(Associated Press) \n \n BOSTON (AP) — A defrocked priest at the center of Boston\'s Roman Catholic clergy sex abuse scandal was released from prison on Friday and settled into an apartment across the street from a children\'s dance studio. \n \n Paul Shanley, who had been convicted of raping a boy in the 1980s, moved to the town of Ware, about 65 miles (105 kilometers) west of Boston, after being released from the Old Colony Correctional Center in Bridgewater, where he completed a 12-year sentence. Shanley, 86, used a cane and was helped by a man as he arrived in Ware, followed by a group of reporters and photographers. \n \n His new home in a multiunit building is across from a recently opened dance studio that teaches children as young as 2. The studio\'s owner, Arielle Lask, said she plans to install ""state-of-the-art"" security systems and to make sure every child leaves the studio accompanied by an adult. \n \n ""It\'s awful that he\'s even on the streets of Ware,"" Lask told The Boston Globe. ""Whether it\'s across the street or down the road, there are children everywhere."" \n \n As a condition of Shanley\'s 10-year probation, he has been ordered to have no contact with children under age 16. \n \n Ware police Chief Shawn Crevier said Shanley has registered as a sex offender and posters will be displayed around town notifying the public that Shanley is living in the area, which is typical procedure for the police department. \n \n ""We\'re going to do what we need to do to make sure the citizens are protected and his rights are also protected,"" Crevier said. \n \n Shanley will be at least the third sex offender living on his street, he said. \n \n Prosecutors sought to hold Shanley beyond his criminal sentence under a law that allows civil commitment of people deemed sexually dangerous. But two psychologists hired by the state found he did not meet the legal criteria to hold him. \n \n A lawyer who represented Shanley in his criminal appeal said he\'s confident Shanley will not harm anyone. But attorney Robert Shaw Jr. said he understands the reaction from those who opposed Shanley\'s release from prison. \n \n ""I\'m sure that law enforcement will ensure that the community feels safe, and I have every expectation that they are going to fulfill their obligation and be certain that Paul Shanley also remains safe,"" Shaw said. \n \n The state\'s sex offender registry designates Shanley as a Level 3 offender, considered the most likely to reoffend. But the two psychologists cited Shanley\'s advanced age and his health issues and concluded his likelihood to reoffend is low. \n \n Attorney Mitchell Garabedian, who represented dozens of men who say they were abused by Shanley, said the evaluations were incomplete because the psychologists didn\'t interview Shanley. Instead, they reviewed police reports, prosecutors\' files and Shanley\'s church personnel file containing numerous sexual abuse complaints against him. \n \n ""Paul Shanley should be in a hospital being treated and not in the outside world where he can easily gain access to innocent children,"" Garabedian said. \n \n Both psychologists found Shanley meets the psychiatric criteria for pedophilic disorder. But they said research suggests recidivism rates for people of his age are extremely low. They also cited Shanley\'s health issues, which were blacked out from the reports, and the fact his last reported offense was in 1990. \n \n Shanley was a street priest who ministered to alienated youths in the 1960s and \'70s. Dozens of men came forward decades later and said Shanley had molested or raped them. He was defrocked by the Vatican in 2004 and was convicted of raping a boy at a Newton parish in 2005. \n \n The archdiocese said this week it will not provide Shanley with financial support or benefits. Republican Gov. Charlie Baker said he will review the standards for civilly committing convicted sex offenders who have served their prison sentences. \n \n Reporting by the Globe\'s Spotlight team helped break open the priest sex abuse scandal in the Archdiocese of Boston in 2002. The reporting uncovered how dozens of priests in the archdiocese had molested and raped children for decades while church higher-ups covered it up and shuffled abusive priests from parish to parish. \n \n A movie about the Globe\'s reporting, called ""Spotlight,"" won the 2016 Academy Award for best picture. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writers Collin Binkley and Bob Salsberg contributed to this report.', 'E-cigarettes should be banned indoors over fears that they can be as toxic to bystanders as normal cigarettes, the World Health Organisation has said. \n \n Despite releasing vapour instead of smoke, the devices still pollute the air with harmful chemicals, health experts warned. \n \n Many smokers use e-cigarettes as a way to quit, as they deliver the nicotine hit but without the carcinogens associated with breathing in smoke. There are no laws currently banning their use inside. \n \n But a report by the WHO questioned the safety of e-cigarettes, officially known as electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS). \n \n ""The fact that ENDS exhaled aerosol contains on average lower levels of toxicants than the emissions from combusted tobacco does not mean that these levels are acceptable to involuntarily exposed bystanders,” said the report. \n \n ""In fact, exhaled aerosol is likely to increase, above background levels, the risk of disease to bystanders, especially in the case of some ENDS that produce toxicant levels in the range of that produced by some cigarettes."" \n \n Some early studies have shown that e-cigarettes can be more effective than over-the-counter products like gum or nicotine patches. \n \n But the report recommends preventing manufacturers from marketing e-cigs as ""smoking cessation aids"" until they provide robust scientific evidence to back the claim. \n \n ""Although anecdotal reports indicate that an undetermined proportion of ENDS users have quit smoking using these products, their efficacy has not been systematically evaluated yet,” the report added. \n \n ""Only a few studies have examined whether the use of ENDS is an effective method for quitting tobacco smoking."" \n \n The WHO also advised banning sales to under-18s and said vending machines should be removed ""in almost all locations.” \n \n The report was welcomed by health officials. \n \n Professor John Ashton of the Faculty of Public Health said: “Most adult smokers start smoking before the age of 18. That\'s why many public health experts are concerned that the advertising of electronic cigarettes could make it seem normal again to think smoking is glamorous, when it is anything but. \n \n “We also don’t know enough yet about the harms and side effects of electronic cigarettes, and it will take years before we can be sure what they are.” \n \n However anti-smoking campaigners said that e-cigarettes were ‘considerably less-harmful’ than tobacco and warned against restricting their sale and use. \n \n Hazel Cheeseman, director of policy and research at Action on Smoking and Health, said there was ""no evidence of any harm to bystanders from use of these devices"" and said regulation needed to be proportionate. \n \n She said: ""Smoking kills 100,000 people in the UK alone. Smokers who switch to using electronic cigarettes in whole or in part are likely to substantially reduce their health risks. \n \n ""Although we cannot be sure that electronic cigarettes are completely safe, as the WHO acknowledges, they are considerably less harmful than smoking tobacco and research suggests that they are already helping smokers to quit.” \n \n The ingredients in e-cigarettes vary but they generally include nicotine and chemicals to vaporise the nicotine such as propylene glycol. \n \n Previous studies have shown that inhaling nicotine, even without tobacco smoke, may contribute to heart disease. \n \n Some e-cigarettes have also been found to give off formaldehyde, a known carcinogen, at higher levels than normal cigarettes. Silicate particles, a cause of lung disease, are also present in some e-cigarette vapour. \n \n A study published last year by the Bavarian Health and Food Safety Authority found that vaping worsened indoor air quality by increasing the concentration of nicotine, particulates and aluminium. \n \n The Department of Health is not considering banning e-cigarettes indoors but said it was planning to prohibit the sale to under 18s. \n \n Electronic cigarettes are currently regulated as consumer products in the UK. But by 2016 they will be regulated by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency. \n \n “More and more people are using e-cigarettes and we want to make sure they are properly regulated so we can be sure of their safety,” said a Department of Health spokesman.']",2,"– A defrocked priest at the heart of Boston's Catholic clergy sex abuse scandal was released from prison Friday and settled into an apartment across the street from a children's dance studio.

1,"[""Female heart attack patients treated by male doctors have a worse chance of survival than those treated by female doctors, a study suggests. \n \n Previous studies based on data from Australia and Sweden have revealed that men and women experience different care if they have a heart attack, while UK research has shown women are more likely to be misdiagnosed. \n \n Now researchers say the gender of the doctor might affect female patients’ chances of survival. \n \n “We find that gender concordance increases a patient’s probability of surviving a [heart attack] and that the effect is driven by increased mortality when male physicians treat female patients,” said Dr Brad Greenwood, associate professor of information and decision sciences at the University of Minnesota. \n \n \n \n Writing in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Greenwood and colleagues describe how they looked at records from Florida of emergency department admissions for heart attacks between 1991 and 2010. \n \n As well as looking at the patients’ age, gender, and whether they had other health problems, the team also looked at whether the patient died during their stay in hospital and whether the emergency room doctor primarily looking after them was a man or a woman. \n \n \n \n The results from more than 580,000 patients reveals that overall, 11.9% of heart attack patients died while in hospital. \n \n Women 50% more likely to be misdiagnosed after heart attack – study Read more \n \n However, the team found that when patients shared the same gender as their doctor, they were more likely to survive, with the probability of death falling by just over 0.6 percentage points once factors including the patients’ age, other health problems, the physician, and hospital-specific differences were taken into account. \n \n Further analysis showed that men and women had similar chances of survival when they saw female doctors. But male doctors were linked to worse outcomes, particularly for women. \n \n Female patients treated by male doctors were about 1.5 percentage points less likely to survive a heart attack than male patients in the care of female doctors. \n \n The team also found women were more likely to survive if the emergency department had a higher proportion of female doctors who had treated heart attacks – a trend particularly strong if the woman was being treated by a male doctor. That, said Greenwood, could be because female doctors might share their experience in tackling heart attacks in women. In addition, the more female patients a male doctor had previously treated for heart attacks, the better the chances of survival a woman had. \n \n Women get worse care after a heart attack than men – must they shout louder? | Ann Robinson Read more \n \n “These results suggest a reason why gender inequality in heart attack mortality persists: most physicians are male, and male physicians appear to have trouble treating female patients,” the authors write. They suggest more female doctors are needed within emergency departments, and say training of doctors needs to be improved to make sure heart disease is not seen only as a male issue. \n \n \n \n Greenwood speculated that there could be several reasons for the trend. “One could be that female patients are more comfortable advocating for themselves with a female physician,” he said. “[Or] it could be because women are more likely to present atypically and female physicians are better at picking up cues than their male colleagues.” \n \n Chris Gale, professor of cardiovascular medicine at the University of Leeds who was not involved in the latest research but has worked on previous studies in the field, welcomed the new research but cautioned that the study was based on US data, meaning it is not clear if the same trend is present in other healthcare systems including the NHS. What’s more, Gale noted that as in the UK, US patients are generally seen by a number of healthcare professionals if they seek medical help, meaning that looking at the gender of just one doctor is a limitation. \n \n Women with heart disease are dismissed, and it's killing them | Nikki Stamp Read more \n \n Gale added that the longstanding idea that a heart attack patient is generally a middle-aged man with risk factors such as smoking, being overweight and having diabetes, high blood pressure or high cholesterol could be putting women at a disadvantage. \n \n “What we do know is that women present with heart attack as well, and you don’t necessarily need to have those risk factors – although it is much more likely if you have a risk factor,” said Gale. “We also know that women with heart attack do have symptoms just like men do, but they can also present atypically as well.”"", '(Reuters Health) - Women who show up in the emergency room with a heart attack are less likely to die if they are treated by a female physician rather than a male, a new study finds. \n \n Researchers scrutinizing data from nearly 582,000 heart attack patients found that women treated by male doctors were 1.52 percent less likely to survive than men treated by female doctors, according to a report in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. \n \n That means if 1,000 women went to the emergency room with a heart attack, 15 more would die if they were treated by a male doctor, study leaded Brad Greenwood of the Carlson School of Management at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities told Reuters Health. \n \n Intriguingly, women treated by a male doctor were more likely to survive if there were many female physicians in the ER. \n \n “The key takeaway is that male physicians appear to have trouble treating female patients,” Greenwood said. “The challenge of (future) research is to figure out how and why this occurs. It’s a tricky question and there’s a lot of speculation that comes into it.” \n \n Male doctors do seem to learn from their mistakes. “We do see improvement as they spend time in practice,” Greenwood said. “But these later benefits come at the expense of earlier patients.” \n \n Greenwood allows that the researchers’ calculation may be an underestimate since it only includes patients who were eventually admitted to the hospital. Women who were misdiagnosed and sent home wouldn’t have been counted in the analysis. \n \n Why would women treated by male physicians be dying at a higher rate than those treated by female doctors even though they were admitted to the hospital? \n \n Greenwood suspects the excess deaths are due to delays in treatment because the male doctors took longer to diagnose the heart attack. \n \n Greenwood and his colleagues reviewed anonymous medical data on 338,642 men and 243,203 women who were seen in emergency rooms in Florida hospitals between 1991 to 2010. Most - 520,078 - were treated by male doctors, while 61,719 were treated by female physicians. \n \n The Florida database included information such as patients’ age, race, gender and medical history, along with hospital quality. Even after accounting for these factors, women were still less likely to survive when treated by a male ER doctor. \n \n While noting that this kind of data is “fraught with potential errors and many unmeasured variables, there’s a growing drumbeat of data suggesting that women physicians have better outcomes,” said Dr. Karol Watson, director of the Women’s Cardiovascular Center at the University of California, Los Angeles. \n \n There are some possible explanations for the new findings, said Watson. \n \n “Everybody knows, but nobody has proven, that women are better listeners,” Watson told Reuters Health. “And women physicians spend more time with their patients. I can’t tell you how many times the critical piece of information comes as the patient is walking toward the door.” \n \n The new study highlights the importance of having “a strong female physician workforce,” said Dr. Jennifer Haythe, co-director of Columbia Women’s Heart Center at the Columbia University Medical Center. \n \n “As a doctor who is very aware of gender bias particularly as it relates to cardiac disease, one can’t help but wonder if improved outcomes stem from the fact that female physicians take women’s symptoms more seriously, thereby expediting the workup and cardiac care of these women and improving mortality,” Haythe told Reuters Health. \n \n Acknowledging that we can’t choose the physician who treats us in the ER, Haythe has some advice for women: “They should certainly feel comfortable asking for their symptoms to be taken seriously. If they are concerned that they may be having a heart attack they should ask the treating physician - man or woman - if they have had an appropriate evaluation to determine this, and if not, why not.” \n \n SOURCE: bit.ly/2M8ElFS Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA, online August 6, 2018.']",2,"– Women suffering from a heart attack seem to have a better chance of survival if they're treated by a female doctor, according to a new study in PNAS. Using data on 582,000 heart attack patients admitted to Florida emergency rooms from 1991 to 2010, researchers found that women treated by male doctors were 1.5% less likely to survive than males treated by female doctors. Reuters frames it this way: If 1,000 women went to the ER with a heart attack, 15 more would die if treated by a man. Survival rates also increased if there were many female physicians in the ER, suggesting that female doctors assist their male colleagues in diagnosis, per the Guardian. So what's going on? ""Since heart disease is often cast as a 'male' condition, male physicians might not pick up on the atypical presentation symptoms women more often show, or at least not to the degree that female physicians do,"" says lead author Brad Greenwood. While more research is needed, ""the key takeaway is that male physicians appear to have trouble treating female patients,"" he adds. That doesn't mean female patients should seek out female doctors, who presided over just 10% of the study cases, per Reuters. While calling for better gender diversity in medicine, the study authors note that careful evaluations of symptoms could prevent critical delays in treatment. (Breastfeeding may help the heart.)"

Boehner said Friday he is opposed to raising tax rates, and Obama didn’t once mention rates. \n \n (PHOTOS: Meet the 12 newly elected senators) \n \n There’s a win for both men in eliminating tax loopholes and deductions: Obama can say the wealthy are paying more, and Boehner can say he didn’t raise tax rates. At the same time, the government gets more revenue. \n \n It would be a reversal, of sorts, for both men. House Republican leadership – most notably Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) – insisted in 2011 that if Congress were to close loopholes, that would have to be offset by tax cuts. Some key Republicans say they have given up on that. Cantor’s spokesman Doug Heye did not respond to an email seeking comment on Cantor’s position on loophole closures. \n \n (PHOTOS: The new D.C.: Who’s up, down or out) \n \n And Obama said he wants tax rates to snap back up to where they were during Bill Clinton’s administration. This latest negotiating maneuver might not allow that. \n \n Capitol Hill aides late Friday said they were seeking a framework like this. \n \n There are a lot of caveats that could blow up something resembling this. Jay Carney, Obama’s chief spokesman, repeatedly said the president would veto any legislation that extends tax cuts for the wealthy – but he demurred when asked if that would hold if Obama got additional revenue. \n \n Senate Democrats are hooked on extending tax cuts for Americans earning less than $250,000 – anything less could seem like capitulation to them. \n \n House Republicans, who haven’t yet returned to D.C. since the election, were trained by their leadership to say on repeat that spending was at the root of the nation’s fiscal problems, not a lack of revenue. \n \n It will all come to roost in the next few weeks. \n \n Obama has invited congressional leaders from both parties to the White House next week, the president said in his first statement since election night, where he’ll begin talks over how to resolve the impasse over taxes and spending cuts. He’ll start with an open mind, he said. \n \n “I’m open to compromise. I’m open to new ideas. I’m committed to solving our fiscal challenges, but I refuse to accept any approach that isn’t balanced,” Obama said in the East Room, joined by Vice President Joe Biden. \n \n Though the president stayed away from making a declaration on tax rates, he clear in arguing that the election’s results have granted him the upper hand in negotiations. \n \n “We found out that the majority of Americans agree with my approach,” he said as he called on congressional Republicans to extend the Bush-era tax cuts only for individuals making less than $200,000 and families making less than $250,000, and to let the upper-income tax rates expire, while negotiating a broader deficit reduction package. \n \n Earlier Friday, Boehner tried to shift responsibility for the looming fiscal cliff to Obama, saying expiring tax rates and trillions of dollars in spending cuts are mostly his to solve. \n \n “This is an opportunity for the president to lead,” Boehner said in the Capitol. “This is his moment to engage the Congress and work toward a solution that can pass both chambers.”""]",2,"– A new UN analysis finds that at least 60,000 people have died in the Syria conflict, a ""much higher"" number than was expected and one that is ""truly shocking,"" says the UN human rights commissioner. The exhaustive, months-long study compiled data from seven sources to come up with a list of 59,648 names as of November. And because fighting has continued, it's safe to say that number is now above 60,000, Reuters reports. (That's slightly higher than the number of Americans killed in the Vietnam War.) The last UN estimate, in May, had the death toll at more than 10,000. This new estimate finds that deaths were at 1,000 per month in the summer of 2011, but had risen to more than 5,000 per month by this past summer. And the violence continued today with what may have been one of the worst attacks so far, al-Jazeera reports: Dozens were killed when a Syrian warplane fired a missile at a gas station near Damascus where people were waiting in line to fill up their cars."
3,"['They say that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. Why is it that the Republicans in Congress seem so determined to prove this maxim? \n \n Let’s start with the Affordable Care Act, a k a Obamacare. The exchanges that are at the heart of Obamacare — making it possible for people who are currently uninsured to buy health care — open for business on Tuesday. Ever since the Republicans took control of the House, they have held vote after vote to roll back the law, even while ignoring important business like, say, fixing the Postal Service. I think it’s been 43 times in all — votes that have been utterly pointless, in that the Senate is still run by Democrats, and the law is President Obama ’s signature achievement, and there’s no way on God’s green earth it will be repealed. \n \n But never mind. As Oct. 1 has neared — the date both Obamacare kicks in and the government needs to be funded — Republicans moved to another tactic, which was every bit as hopeless. They began demanding that Obamacare be reversed — or at least delayed — as part of any deal to keep the government running. (At one point they had a lengthy wish list that was so implausible it was almost laugh-out-loud funny.) \n \n But to the surprise of absolutely no one, when Republicans added the anti-Obamacare language to the “ continuing resolution ” designed to finance the government (for all of six weeks!), the Senate quickly rejected the House bill and insisted instead on a continuing resolution that did nothing but what it was supposed to do: fund the government. Republicans, meanwhile, would not back away from their demand that the “C.R.” had to be linked to a delay in Obamacare. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n “I see almost no hope of avoiding a government shutdown,” Representative Jim Cooper , a conservative Democrat from Nashville , told me Monday afternoon. It’s possible, of course, that House Republicans will pass a continuing resolution in the wee small hours, after this column has gone to bed. But it’s very unlikely. \n \n Photo \n \n And that’s the second way in which Republican strategy seems to have run off the rails. This constant brinkmanship, which Republicans bring on with their unrealistic demands and deadlines, consistently redounds against them. It makes you wonder what they are trying to accomplish.', 'If you can judge people by the quality of their enemies, one quality shared by many opponents of the tea party is their conservatism. Like many ideological factions, tea-party activists display a special intensity in fighting the “near enemy” — other elements on the right that don’t share their tactics. President Obama may be their ultimate foe, but conservative pragmatists are their rivals. And rivals are the more immediate problem. \n \n So the Senate Conservatives Fund runs ads against Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and other solid Senate conservatives for opposing a counterproductive strategy to defund Obamacare. The circle of tea-party purity is drawn so tightly that it excludes Sens. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.), Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) and John Cornyn (R-Tex.) — some of the most reliably conservative members of Congress. \n \n Ideological conflict between Republican factions is, of course, nothing new. The modern conservative movement arose in opposition to Eisenhower Republicanism, which it regarded as ideologically compromised. Ronald Reagan challenged and defeated Rockefeller Republicanism — and seldom has a political defeat been more complete. But Reagan still viewed the Republican Party as a coalition, not as a faction. He campaigned vigorously for Republican moderates such as Sens. Chuck Percy, Robert Packwood and Mark Hatfield (who was the congressional chair for his first inauguration). \n \n During the Obama era, Republican ideological conflicts have intensified. The latest round began with a typical, largely healthy revolt against leaders such as House Speaker John Boehner and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who were viewed as tired and uncreative (though easier to criticize than replace). The young guns — including Reps. Paul Ryan and Eric Cantor — would finally take on Medicare reform and push big questions about the role of government in American life. This involved political risk but had the virtue of intellectual seriousness. \n \n Tea-party populism, however, moved quickly beyond this point. We are no longer seeing a revolt against the Republican leadership, or even against the Republican “establishment”; this revolt is against anyone who accepts the constraints of political reality. Conservatives are excommunicated not for holding the wrong convictions but for rational calculations in service of those convictions. \n \n 1 of 25 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × The Right’s 25 most influential, from Townhall.com View Photos The conservative Web site’s latest listing of the most prominent voices on the right, with a few names you may not know.

Some of this is a reaction to the unique provocation of Obamacare. Tea-party activists assert that the launch of health\xadinsurance subsidies and exchanges will cause immediate and pervasive entitlement addiction — creating a permanent new class of Democratic-voting clients of the state. It seems more likely that Americans will see the flaws of a hastily and poorly designed system and express their displeasure in midterm elections. But the notion that the character of the country is about to suddenly change helps explain the state of emergency in tea-party circles. \n \n This is reinforced by the development of an alternative establishment — including talk-radio personalities, a few vocal congressional leaders and organizations such as FreedomWorks and Heritage Action — that creates a self-reinforcing impression of its power to reshape politics (while lacking much real connection to the views of the broader electorate). \n \n And these ideas do have some resonance among conservative activists who are convinced that Republicans lost recent presidential elections because their candidates lacked combativeness. At least, the argument goes, Ted Cruz has some backbone. It is the political expression of pent-up anger. “If we’re going to fight,” says Michele Bachmann, “we need to fight now.” Few believe any longer that Republicans will be able to defund Obamacare in this session of Congress; it is the fight that counts. This is a word that crops up frequently in tea-party discourse. Not winning. Not strategy. Not consequences. The fight. \n \n Under normal circumstances, this faction — composing less than 20 percent of the House Republican caucus — might exercise a marginal influence. But we have the peculiar situation of a divided Congress and a weak president. The tea-party faction holds the margin of victory in a slim Republican House majority. Boehner has kept some semblance of order by appeasing it — an approach of diminishing utility. And now, in a series of budget showdowns, the interests of tea-party activists have suddenly aligned with those of Obama (who needs a dramatic reshuffling of the political deck). Both sides prefer a powerless, discredited Republican leadership. \n \n The problem for Republicans (as Democrats found in the 1970s and ’80s) is that factions are seldom deterred by defeat. Every loss is taken as proof of insufficient purity.

The country will be much better off if Congress does not abdicate its constitutional role and if the president cannot ignore that role. \n \n When President Barack Obama is willing to negotiate with Russian, Syrian and Iranian leaders but unwilling to negotiate with the U.S. House of Representatives, it is time for the House to stand firm. \n \n When Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid says, according to unnamed sources quoted in Politico, that he will refuse to attend a negotiation at the White House because House Republicans have to cave and surrender to his terms, it is time to stand firm. \n \n When a senior, unnamed Democratic official is quoted Monday morning calling for no negotiations and saying ""it\'s time to punch the bully in the nose,"" it is time to stand firm. \n \n Begala: Bet on Obama in shutdown showdown \n \n When Obama spends a week making three partisan speeches attacking Republicans and then calls House Speaker John Boehner to tell him, ""I will not negotiate,"" it is time to stand firm. \n \n It is a sad commentary on Obama\'s attitude toward the elected majority of the House of Representatives that he could have a more pleasant conversation with the head of the Iranian dictatorship than with the elected leader of the U.S. House. \n \n The left has sold itself on a false history of the 2012 election. According to the left, Obama won the election and therefore we should do whatever he wants. \n \n This ignores that there was also an election for the ""People\'s House"" in 435 congressional districts, and the Republicans won. It also ignores the 63 million Americans who voted against his re-election and his agenda. Winning 52% does not mean he gets 100% of what he wants. \n \n Zelizer: Government shutdown threat is getting very old, very fast \n \n The president has decided to seek to bully and bluff his way to get what he wants. House Republicans must not abdicate their responsibilities now. \n \n Any surrender on the continuing resolution would confirm the contempt with which Obama and Reid already hold Boehner and his Republican colleagues. This fight is about something much bigger than the Republican Party and the future of Obamacare. \n \n It is about whether the president dictates to America\'s elected representatives or negotiates with them when they disagree. It will be very bad for America if a president whose hubris is astounding is reinforced in the belief that he can bully his way into getting everything he wants by making demagogic attack speeches. \n \n The next few weeks might be painful if House Republicans insist on getting to a compromise and refuse to surrender. But the next three years will be frightening if House Republicans cave and the president learns that nothing stands between him and his ability to use overweening power outside the Constitution to advance his ideology. \n \n This is a big moment of decision for America.

(Associated Press) \n \n NEW YORK (AP) — Less than a week after President Donald Trump publicly attacked journalists for using anonymous sources in stories about his administration, it appears the president become one himself on Tuesday — at least briefly. \n \n Three television anchors, shortly after attending from a White House lunch meeting with the president, emerged to report news on the president\'s belief that the time may be right for immigration reform. Fox News Channel\'s Bret Baier, and CNN\'s Wolf Blitzer and Jake Tapper, attributed the news to a ""senior administration official."" ABC\'s George Stephanopoulos, in a tweet, sourced it to a ""WH official."" \n \n After being asked about the apparent contradiction, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said in an email that ""the president\'s comments on that subject are on the record."" \n \n And minutes after that, ABC\'s David Muir, who was also in the meeting, posted a story on the network\'s web site quoting Trump by name saying the president had told news anchors and correspondents at the White House lunch that ""the time is right for an immigration bill, as long as there is compromise on both sides."" \n \n The episode illustrated the administration\'s difficulties in squaring a longtime practice of anonymous sourcing in Washington politics and journalism with the president\'s anger at stories that displeased him. Trump has decried ""fake news"" and called journalists ""enemies of the people."" Friday, in a speech before a conference of conservatives, he said that reporters ""shouldn\'t be allowed to use sources unless they use somebody\'s name. Let their name be put out there."" \n \n It\'s not unusual for presidents to invite journalists for private meetings like Tuesday\'s lunch before a major speech, like Trump\'s before Congress on Tuesday. In the past, they have been considered off the record — meaning nothing said at the meeting could be reported publicly. \n \n Before Trump publicly became the source of the immigration news, a White House official acknowledged to The Associated Press that it came from the meeting with news anchors. The AP was not included in the meeting. \n \n Fox News\' Chris Wallace, who was also in the meeting, reported on Shepard Smith\'s afternoon show that he saw a ""kinder, gentler Donald Trump"" during the lunch. \n \n ""It was in this context that a senior administration official said that the president thinks that the time was right for immigration reform,"" Wallace said. ""That came as kind of a surprise."" \n \n After some more discussion of nuggets from the ""senior administration official,"" Smith couldn\'t take it anymore. \n \n ""So they give us anonymous sources after they rail at us for using anonymous sources?"" he said. ""That is hilarious."" \n \n Replied Wallace: ""Don\'t shoot the messenger, Shep."" \n \n Smith said that Trump ""wants people to think there\'s a major war against people who report facts that he doesn\'t like. But when you\'re in the room with him, it\'s all good. When you\'re on TV, he vilifies you and treats you as if you\'re doing something wrong when you\'re actually doing everything right. That\'s annoying."" \n \n ___ \n \n AP Chief White House Correspondent Julie Pace in Washington contributed to this report.']",5,"– The first government shutdown since the Clinton/Gingrich years has some people bemoaning our divided government. And yes, ""separation of powers is inefficient,"" admits Charles CW Cooke at the National Review; ""it will not only 'allow' gridlock, but it is explicitly designed to encourage it."" And that's not a mistake. ""The Constitution is the product of an abiding insight into politics—an insight that does not change with the wind."" This is how the system is supposed to work. Not everyone agrees: Republicans have driven the government past the point of rationality, complains Joe Nocera at the New York Times. ""A government that functioned would fight over the budget, but would ultimately pass a budget. This government can barely hobble from one CR to the next."" Michael Gerson at the Washington Post notes that the Tea Party's most vociferous opponents are now fellow Republicans, and it's gone beyond traditional GOP ideological disputes. ""We are no longer seeing a revolt against Republican leadership,"" he observes. ""This revolt is against anyone who accepts the constraints of political reality."" The man who orchestrated the last shutdown, on the other hand, thinks Democrats are the ones being unreasonable ""When President Barack Obama is willing to negotiate with Russian, Syrian, and Iranian leaders, but unwilling to negotiate with the US House … it is time for the House to stand firm,"" Newt Gingrich writes in a CNN op-ed. If Republicans cave, he argues, Obama will be able to bully them for years to come. Regardless of who's right, Sean Trende at RealClearPolitics thinks that politically, Republicans will suffer but survive. A shutdown will give Democrats ammunition to blame them for the next economic downturn. But their cause is more popular than Gingrich's was. ""The prophesies of doom for Republicans are heavily overwrought."""

Kelly took to Twitter to clarify two things: She doesn't think she was poisoned the morning of the first GOP debate, and she doesn't think any questions were leaked to Donald Trump in advance, reports USA Today. Kelly doesn't explicitly state either thing in the book, Settle for More, but Times reviewer Jennifer Senior reads between the lines. For instance, on the leak, Kelly wrote in her memoir that Trump was angry the day before the debate because he'd heard that the first question would be a tough one from Kelly, which turned out to be true—it was about his treatment of women. Reads Senior's review: ""She doesn’t speculate where the leak came from. (She reports. You decide.)"" But the review adds that an ""unambiguous takeaway from this book"" is that then-Fox chief Roger Ailes and others ""seemed to be nakedly colluding with the Republican presidential nominee."" Kelly, though, tweeted that her book ""does not suggest Trump had any debate Qs in advance, nor do I believe that he did."" As for the other incident: Kelly wrote in her book that a driver picked her up to take her to the debate and insisted on fetching her coffee, even though she had repeatedly declined; she was violently sick minutes later. ""Ms. Kelly never says outright that someone tried to poison her,"" adds the review. ""But the episode spooked her. ... Foul play? Again: She reports. You decide."" In her tweet, Kelly says that, ""for the record,"" she thinks she caught a stomach bug that was going around, the same one Rand Paul had."

At a coffee shop in Middletown, Patty Todd wiped away tears as she reads a letter written by her 10-year-old grandson, Bradyn.

They carried signs that read “Killers belong in prison,” and “Sociopaths show no remorse.” \n \n The courtroom of Judge Robert Peeler was packed for the judicial release hearing, with dozens of people there on either side. \n \n Smith spoke out, expressing remorse for her actions. \n \n “I’m so very sorry and I hate what I’ve done - I hate the pain that I’ve caused so many people,” Smith said. \n \n Smith was convicted of voluntary manslaughter more than five years ago. She fatally stabbed her boyfriend Takach in the chest while he held their young daughter. \n \n The jury found her not guilty of murder because of the circumstances surrounding his death. \n \n Peeler cited their volatile and violent relationship and had sentenced Smith to the maximum of 10 years at trial, but he granted her request for an early release. \n \n “She regrets her actions and realizes how this has affected so many lives,” said Mike Smith, Shannon’s father. \n \n Takach’s mother read a letter from his son who was just four years old when he saw his father stabbed. \n \n “Life for me would be 10 times better if mom didn’t kill my dad,” said Patty Todd. “I feel my mom should stay in prison because I seen her stab my dad clean through the heart with my sister in his arms and try to hide the knife."" \n \n In granting Smith\'s release, Peeler cited her efforts to improve herself while behind bars. \n \n “Look at what she’s done – I don’t think anybody can dispute she’s been a model inmate, that she’s made an effort to rehabilitate,” Peeler said. \n \n But Smith will remain in prison until she’s served a full seven years, with a scheduled release in December 2016 -- a victory for Smith’s family and a disappointment for the family of Robbie Takach. \n \n “Her staying in prison isn’t going to bring Robbie back.

Inside were 10 of China's famed 8,000 terracotta warrior statues, on loan from China. Xinhua reports on the FBI's allegations: that the 24-year-old took a selfie with the statues, touched the left hand of one and seemed to break something off it, then left. On Jan. 8, museum staffers discovered the statue he was said to have touched—valued at $4.5 million—was missing a thumb. An investigation led to Rohana and his home in Bear, Del.; he allegedly confessed to having broken off the thumb and placed it in his desk drawer. An FBI affidavit states that a friend claims Rohana also Snapchatted a photo of the finger the day after the party, reports the Courier Post. China is incensed, with the head of the organization that loaned the statues to the US asking ""that the US severely punish the perpetrator. We have lodged a serious protest with them."" Two of the organization's members will travel to the US to see the damage first-hand and make the repair with the now-recovered thumb. China will seek monetary damages.

But no one can say how or where the bodies were moved. \n \n Pompano Beach resident Benjamin Miller had family and family friends buried there. Even though he now lives elsewhere, Miller, 83, was born and raised in Deerfield Beach and saw at least three funerals there when he was a child. \n \n ""I saw it with my own eyes, I am a living eyewitness,"" he said.

Where did they put the bodies?"" \n \n The cemetery was once referred to as the ""old colored cemetery"" and some estimates have 300 to 400 bodies buried there. The first plans to build on the site came in 1974, but angry residents quashed the move. According to one city study, the leader of the protest movement said his wife was buried there. In 1974, he exhumed her body and had it reburied elsewhere. \n \n Mayor Jean Robb said she thinks the bodies were moved to the city-owned Pineview Cemetery near Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue but has been unable to confirm that hunch. The city clerk even reviewed old documents stored in a warehouse. \n \n City officials, however, point to two studies, in 1986 and 2005, where experts determined there are no bodies at the site. The studies differ slightly: One said burials were conducted from 1910 to 1942; the other sets earlier dates, from 1897 to 1937. \n \n Both studies could find no proof of skeletons. \n \n The 1986 study, conducted by Florida Atlantic University anthropologists, found no physical evidence despite using a magnetometer to detect objects below the surface such as jewelry or casket handles. They also conducted ""shovel tests."" The study didn\'t prove conclusively there were no bodies, but it said there was little or no evidence they were there. \n \n Another study, in 2005, paid in part by the property owner and carried out under the supervision of city and county historical societies, reached the same conclusion.

11,"['Couple Tells Of Forced Abortion In Chinese City; \'One Child\' Policy Blamed \n \n After running afoul of China\'s One Child policy, a Chinese couple expected to be hit with a fine. But instead, officials demanded that the woman — who was in the eighth month of her pregnancy — have an abortion, according to a new Al Jazeera report. \n \n In telling the couple\'s story, Al Jazeera reporter Melissa Chan gained access to a hospital where a distraught Xiao Ai Ying said doctors had given her womb an injection. As Chan describes it, the two spoke while Xiao awaited a procedure to remove the dead fetus. \n \n The couple\'s story, along with a separate video interview with Xiao\'s husband, is heartrending. And what makes it even more unusual, according to Chan, is that it occurred in the city of Xiamen, which sits on the coast across from Taiwan. Earlier reports of forced abortions in China have mostly been centered in the rural areas of the country\'s western regions. \n \n In fact, the Al Jazeera report has many of the same sad details as a 2007 story from NPR\'s Louisa Lim, who spoke to a couple who had just undergone a similar experience. \n \n In that case, Wei Linrong of Guanxi Province said she was seven months\' pregnant with her second child when family planning officials came to her house and demanded that she report to the hospital for an abortion. \n \n That report also included a reason why forced abortions and crackdowns might be more the work of regional officials — and not the result of a central edict: \n \n Official figures published by the Xinhua news agency shed some light on why a forced abortion campaign might be judged necessary. They show that the Baise government missed its family planning targets last year. The recorded birth rate was 13.61 percent, slightly higher than the goal of 13.5 percent. This is significant because the career prospects of local officials depend upon meeting these goals. \n \n Al Jazeera\'s Chan notes that the central government does not condone forced abortions — and that, in addition to financial rewards for having just one child, parents can be fined as much as $40,000 for having a second baby. \n \n The country\'s official China Daily says that some 13 million abortions are performed in China each year. But that report also warned that the actual number could be far higher, as ""figures are collected only from registered medical institutions.""', ""China's one-child policy leads to an estimated 13 million reported abortions every year, with many of those ordered by the authorities enforcing the system. \n \n Al Jazeera's Melissa Chan gained access to a hospital in the southeastern city of Xiamen, where she found one mother in a terrible condition. \n \n Xiao Ai Ying was forced to have an abortion eight months into her pregnancy because she already has a ten-year-old girl. \n \n Forced abortions sometimes happen in remote areas of China, but this one occurred in one of the country's most modern cities. They are not condoned by the central government. \n \n Mothers who violate China's one-child policy usually pay a fine anywhere from $1 to $40,000, but are then often sterilised to prevent them from having another child. \n \n Although the officials figures of 13 million abortions seem high, physicians and medical researchers quoted by the state-run newspaper China Daily on Thursday said that once unreported and medication-induced abortions are counted, the actual number is substantially higher. \n \n The rate of abortion in China is about 24 abortions for every 1,000 women between the ages of 15 and 44, the World Health Organisation and the Guttmacher Institute said in a joint report. \n \n In 2003, the report put the number of abortions in China at nine million, out of a total of 42 million worldwide. \n \n Al Jazeera approached Chinese authorities in Xiamen for comment on this story, but they declined to speak to us.""]",2,"– China's one-child policy, long a staple of its public policy for urban, ethnic Han Chinese, officially exists on the national level as a series of monetary incentives for those who hold to it and monetary punishments for those who run afoul.

Can you see the lighthouse? \n \n Trump’s Face in Rain on a Window \n \n Dinadesign/Thinkstock \n \n Look at the big drop to the right of the streak on the left side. Go up four drops, and then go to the left another 27 drops. From there, go down six drops and draw a straight line pointing 212 degrees southwest and follow that line for another 21 drops. Combine that drop with the 12 drops surrounding it, and there’s Donald Trump giving Dennis Rodman a gift box of Trump Steaks and old Playboys for surviving the latest challenge on his business-themed television show. \n \n Trump’s Face in a Brick Wall \n \n RR-Photo/Thinkstock \n \n This one’s trickier.

Per WTVR, Clayton Litten was perusing his new bathroom floor from his perch on the porcelain throne when he spotted what he says is a ""one in a trillion"" sighting—a ""perfect"" depiction of the GOP presumptive nominee within the tile's riveting Rorschach, standing with arms folded. ""This cannot be. There's no way,"" Litten tells the station he said when his eyes fell upon this lavatory vision, which he confirmed with workers who were still toiling away on his bathroom remodel. Litten, who's said to be suffering from incurable lung cancer, doesn't leave the house except for doctor visits, and he mainly corresponds with people via email, per the Genorosity.com page set up in his name. He tells WTVR he used that email account to shoot off a pic of the tile to Trump's campaign in the hopes that he might snag a meeting with the candidate when he's in nearby Richmond Friday for a rally. He adds he's a Republican who, tile or no tile, intends to vote for Trump in November (Litten says he hasn't heard back yet). Meanwhile, the station is crowdsourcing opinions about the tile, tweeting an image of Litten's Trump and a poll asking if others see Donald, don't see him, or … see Hillary. (Slate also wants to know if you can spot the Donald in these other six photos.)"

Records also describe an email between Trump campaign officials suggesting they were considering acting on Russian invitations to go to Russia. \n \n In addition, former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and former Trump campaign official Rick Gates surrendered Monday to Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller. \n \n The charges against top officials from Trump\'s campaign signals a dramatic new phase of Mueller\'s wide-ranging investigation into possible collusion between the Russian government and members of Trump\'s team as well as potential obstruction of justice and financial crimes. \n \n Papadopoulos\' guilty plea brings the Mueller probe into actions that occurred during the 2016 campaign. The charges against Manafort and Gates are unrelated to the Trump campaign, though it\'s possible Mueller could add additional charges. \n \n Gates, 45, is a longtime business associate of Manafort, 68. The pair worked together since the mid-2000s, and Gates served as Manafort\'s deputy on the campaign. The two were indicted under seal on Friday, a source with direct knowledge of the matter said. \n \n President Donald Trump distanced himself from Manafort on Monday morning, asking why Clinton wasn\'t being investigated. \n \n ""Sorry, but this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign. But why aren\'t Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focus?????"" He soon added: ""Also, there is NO COLLUSION!"" \n \n Sorry, but this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign.

Mueller signed a 14-page statement regarding Papadopoulos\' offense, which lays out of the facts of the case. \n \n In May, Papadopoulos sent an email to a ""high-ranking campaign official"" with the subject line ""Request from Russia to meet Mr. Trump."" The email said Russian officials were eager to meet with the candidate and had been reaching out. \n \n LIVE Happening now \n \n In a footnote, the FBI statement notes that the email suggesting a Russia visit was forwarded from one campaign official to another. ""We need someone to communicate that DT is not doing these trips. It should be someone low level in the campaign so as not to send any signal,"" the email read. \n \n The FBI statement does not explain to whom the campaign officials were concerned about sending signals. \n \n In the affidavit connected to the case, there is a reference to a July 2016 email Papadopoulos sent to a foreign contact regarding setting up a meeting with what appears to be Manafort (described in the email as his ""national chairman""). Papadopoulos writes the meeting has been ""approved from our side."" \n \n Mueller\'s statement also says that Papadopoulos met in March 2016 with a Russian woman -- introduced to him as a relative of Russian President Vladimir Putin, though she was not -- and he sought to use her connections to arrange a meeting between the campaign and Russian government officials. \n \n The statement also says that Papadopoulos falsely claimed he met with an overseas professor before joining the Trump campaign about ""the Russians possessing \'dirt\' on then-candidate Hillary Clinton in the form of \'thousands of emails.\'"" \n \n The professor only took interest in Papadopoulos because of his status on the campaign, according to the statement. \n \n A former Trump campaign official said Papadopoulos interacted with the campaign ""a significant amount"" during the 2016 election cycle. \n \n ""He was a foreign policy adviser,"" said the official, who described Papadopoulos as an adviser who was in contact with the campaign staff via email and not a familiar face around Trump Tower. The official said Papadopoulos exchanged emails ""constantly"" on foreign policy matters with the Trump team during the campaign. \n \n Another former senior campaign adviser said of Papadopoulos: ""He was a zero. A non-event."" \n \n When asked about Papadopoulos\' role in the campaign, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters his role was ""extremely limited"" and called it a ""volunteer position."" \n \n Sanders said the fact that Papadopoulos did not tell the truth ""has nothing to do with the campaign"" and said he never acted in an official capacity. \n \n ""He reached out and nothing happened beyond that. That shows one, his level of importance in the campaign, and two, shows what little role he had within coordinating anything officially for the campaign."" \n \n JUST WATCHED Indictment against Manafort, Gates unsealed Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Indictment against Manafort, Gates unsealed 01:10 \n \n Manafort, Gates charged with conspiracy against the US \n \n The indictment against Manafort and Gates contains 12 counts: conspiracy against the United States, conspiracy to launder money, unregistered agent of a foreign principal, false and misleading US Foreign Agents Registration Act statements, false statements, and seven counts of failure to file reports of foreign bank and financial accounts. \n \n The two pleaded not guilty before US District Magistrate Judge Deborah Robinson on Monday afternoon. Other than stating their names, neither man spoke. Gates was represented by a public defender. \n \n A federal judge ordered home confinement for Manafort and Gates and set bond at $10 million for Manafort and $5 million for Gates.

19,"['SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - With no sign of Judgment Day arriving on Saturday as forecast by an 89 year-old California evangelical broadcaster, followers were faced with trying to make sense of his failed pronouncement. \n \n Harold Camping, the former civil engineer who heads the \n \n Family Radio Network of Christian stations, had been unwavering in his message that believers would be swept to heaven on May 21. \n \n His Oakland, California-based network broadcasts over 66 U.S. stations and through international affiliates. With the help of supporters it posted at least 2,000 billboards around the United States warning of the Judgment Day. \n \n In New York, retired transportation agency worker Robert Fitzpatrick was inspired by Camping\'s message to spend over $140,000 of his savings on subway posters and outdoor advertisements warning of the May 21 Judgment Day. \n \n As he stood in Times Square in New York surrounded by onlookers, Fitzpatrick, 60, carried a Bible and handed out leaflets as he waited for Judgment Day to begin. \n \n By his own reading of Bible, which was slightly different than Camping\'s, Fitzgerald expected the great worldwide event to begin at 6 p.m. Eastern Time. \n \n When the hour came and went, he said: ""I do not understand why ...,"" as his speech broke off and he looked at his watch. \n \n ""I do not understand why nothing has happened."" \n \n Camping, who previously made a failed prediction Jesus Christ would return to Earth in 1994, had said doomsday would begin at 6 p.m. in the various time zones around the globe. \n \n NEW DAY COMES \n \n That meant it would begin in Asia and Oceania, but with midnight local time having come and gone in those areas, taking them well into May 22, and no indication of an apocalypse, Camping seemed to have gone silent. \n \n During the day, his Family Radio played recorded church music, devotionals and life advice unrelated to Judgment Day. \n \n The headquarters of his network was shuttered on Friday and Saturday, with a sign in the door that read ""This Office is Closed. Sorry we missed you!"" \n \n Camping, whose deep sonorous voice is frequently heard on his radio network expounding the Bible, could not be reached for comment. \n \n The shades were drawn and no one answered the door at his house in Alameda, California. \n \n Sheila Doan, 65, who has lived next door to Camping since 1971, said he is a good neighbor and she was concerned about Camping and his wife because of the attention his pronouncement has received. \n \n ""I\'m concerned for them, that somebody would possibly do something stupid, you just don\'t know in this world what\'s going to happen,"" she said. \n \n Tom Evans, a spokesman for Camping, said earlier this week that at least several tens of thousands of people listen to Family Radio\'s message. \n \n The network is heard in more than 30 languages through international affiliates, according to Family Radio. \n \n In recent weeks, dozens of Camping\'s followers had crossed the United States in recreational vehicles emblazoned with the May 21 warning. Volunteers also handed out pamphlets as far away as the Philippines, telling people God had left clear signs the world was coming to an end. \n \n In Camping\'s description of Judgment Day, the Earth would be wrenched in a great earthquake and many inhabitants would perish in the coming months, until the planet\'s total destruction on October 21. \n \n On Saturday, some atheists in different parts of the country held celebrations and get-togethers to mark the failure of Camping\'s May 21 prediction to come true. \n \n In Oakland, the same city where Camping\'s network is based, over 200 people gathered at an atheist convention where speakers joked about the Judgment Day pronouncement and a vendor sold jewelry with the words ""Good without God."" \n \n Cara Lee Hickey, 32, a Christian turned atheist, said Camping\'s prediction got people talking. \n \n ""I\'ve heard a lot of name-calling, but most of it is from other Christians calling him a false prophet,"" she said. \n \n (Additional reporting by Erik Tavcar, Jonathan Allen and Noel Randewich; Writing by Alex Dobuzinskis; Editing by Jerry Norton)', 'Sue Espinoza was planted before the television, awaiting news of her father\'s now infamous prediction: cataclysmic earthquakes auguring the end of humanity.God\'s wrath was supposed to begin in New Zealand and then race across the globe, leaving millions of bodies wherever the clock struck 6 p.m. But the hours ticked by, and New Zealand survived. Time zone by time zone, the apocalypse failed to materialize.On Saturday morning, Espinoza, 60, received a phone call from her father, Harold Camping, the 89-year-old Oakland preacher who has spent some $100 million — and countless hours on his radio and TV show — announcing May 21 as Judgment Day. ""He just said, \'I\'m a little bewildered that it didn\'t happen, but it\'s still May 21 [in the United States],\'"" Espinoza said, standing in the doorway of her Alameda home. ""It\'s going to be May 21 from now until midnight.""But to others who put stock in Camping\'s prophecy, disillusionment was already profound by late morning. To them, it was clear the world and its woes would make it through the weekend.Keith Bauer, a 38-year-old tractor-trailer driver from Westminster, Md., took last week off from work, packed his wife, young son and a relative in their SUV and crossed the country.If it was his last week on Earth, he wanted to see parts of it he\'d always heard about but missed, such as the Grand Canyon. With maxed-out credit cards and a growing mountain of bills, he said, the rapture would have been a relief.On Saturday morning, Bauer was parked in front of the Oakland headquarters of Camping\'s Family Radio empire, half expecting to see an angry mob of disenchanted believers howling for the preacher\'s head. The office was closed, and the street was mostly deserted save for journalists.Bauer said he was not bitter. ""Worst-case scenario for me, I got to see the country,"" he said. ""If I should be angry at anybody, it should be me.""Tom Evans, who acted as Camping\'s PR aide in recent months, took his family to Ohio to await the rapture. Early next week, he said, he would be returning to California.""You can imagine we\'re pretty disappointed, but the word of God is still true,"" he said. ""We obviously went too far, and that\'s something we need to learn from.""Despite the failure of Camping\'s prediction, however, he said he might continue working for him.""As bad as it appears—and there\'s no getting around it, it is bad, flat-out—I have not found anything close to the faithfulness of Family Radio,"" he said.Others had risked a lot more on Camping\'s prediction, quitting jobs, abandoning relationships, volunteering months of their time to spread the word. Matt Tuter, the longtime producer of Camping\'s radio and television call-in show, said Saturday that he expected there to be ""a lot of angry people"" as reality proved Camping wrong.Tuter said Family Radio\'s AM station in Sacramento had been ""severely vandalized"" Friday night or Saturday morning, with air conditioning units yanked out and $25,000 worth of copper stripped from the equipment. He thinks it must have been an angry listener. He was off Saturday but planned to drive past the headquarters ""and make sure nothing\'s burning.""Camping himself, who has given innumerable interviews in recent months, was staying out of sight Saturday. No one answered the door at his Alameda home, though neighbors said he was there.By late afternoon, a small crowd had gathered in front of Camping\'s Oakland headquarters. There were atheists blowing up balloons in human form, which were released into the sky just after 6 p.m. in a mockery of the rapture. Someone played a CD of ""The End"" by the Doors, amid much laughter.There were also Christians, like James Bynum, a 45-year-old deacon at Calvary Baptist Church in Milpitas, holding signs that declared Harold Camping a false prophet. He said he was there to comfort disillusioned believers.""Harold Camping will never hand out poisoned Kool-Aid,"" Bynum said. ""It\'s not that kind of a cult. But he has set up a system that will destroy some people\'s lives.""', '\'Judgment Day\' came and went on Saturday, and John Ramsey hasn\'t been able to sleep. \n \n The 25-year-old Harrison, N.J. resident had rearranged his life in recent months to devote himself to spreading a fringe California preacher\'s prediction that May 21 would bring worldwide earthquakes and usher in a five-month period of misery before the world\'s destruction. \n \n Like many of those convinced of the Rapture was pending, Ramsey quit his job, donated ""a couple thousand"" to Harold Camping\'s Family Radio network and convinced family members to join him to spread news of the Rapture on Manhattan streets. \n \n His family nervously huddled in their apartment living room Saturday, holding their Bibles open, switching between CNN, Facebook and Google for news of quakes in the Pacific. \n \n They cried. They hugged. They argued. But mostly, they waited. Nothing happened. \n \n On Sunday, a dejected Ramsey said he faces a ""mixed bag."" \n \n He has to find a new job. So does his mother. His 19-year-old brother, who had quit high school the year prior (""It\'s pointless to graduate,"" the brother had said), is thinking of re-enrolling or finding employment. \n \n His wife, Marcia Paladines, had come to accept that she might never meet her unborn baby, whom she and Ramsey had named John Moses. Now, she\'s praying for a healthy birth. The child is due as early as Friday. \n \n ""Life goes on,"" Ramsey said Sunday. ""I get to live. I get to be a dad."" \n \n The May 21 prediction came from the Biblical numerology of Harold Camping, an 89-year-old televangelist who owns the Oakland, Calif.-based Christian Family Radio network. Camping had previously predicted a similar end-times scenario in 1994. \n \n Several Camping followers previously interviewed by The Huffington Post did not return phone calls and emails Sunday. But a few did publicly declare their reactions. \n \n WATCH: \n \n \n \n \n \n ""I guess no man knows the day or the hour,"" said Peter Lombardi, a 44-year-old from Jersey City, N.J. who had had taken an ""indefinite break"" from his job in April to preach about May 21. \n \n He had fitted his Dodge minivan with stickers proclaiming the ""awesome news"" of Judgment Day and paraded with neon green Caravans through Manhattan\'s business districts to hand hundreds of fliers about the date.

I\'m still living today.""

""I don\'t think they were scamming me, but I am definitely waiting to see what they say Monday on the radio show."" \n \n ""It\'s not [Camping\'s] fault,"" said Ramsey, who added he also won\'t ask for his money back.

Camping said he would make a detailed announcement on Monday. \n \n The Family Radio web site has not been updated. A countdown on the site says there are zero days left to \'Judgment Day\' and an image shows the numbers ""2012"" crossed out. \n \n ""Mr. Camping certainly won\'t shy away from this,"" Family Radio spokesman Tom Evans told The Huffington Post on Sunday, adding ""how that will happen will be forthcoming."" \n \n Evans, who had spent \'Judgment Day\' with his wife and kids, said he was happy that he gets more time to be with his family, but added that ""a believer\'s highest hope is to be with the Lord forever."" As for his belief in the second coming, ""nothing has changed other than the ramifications for Family Radio and Mr. Camping\'s credibility in the world."" \n \n After Camping\'s failed Rapture prediction in 1994, Evans stayed with Family Radio, but he declined to say whether he would stay on the job this time. \n \n WATCH: \n \n \n \n \n \n Camping, who told The Huffington Post last week that May 21 was ""no laughing matter,"" had refused to discuss what he would do with donations if the day passed without event. In recent months, followers have given generously to his company, which runs 66 radio stations in the U.S. and is worth at least $120 million. \n \n On Sunday, Evans said Family Radio\'s assets ""far outweigh its liabilities,"" and that it will ""certainly do everything it can to take care of people."" But he said that there has been no decision on giving money back to donors. \n \n In 2009, the last year Family Radio publicly released a tax return, the group reported $18.4 million in income from contributions and $1 million from investments and other income. It spent $36.7 million and employed 348 people paid a total of more than $9 million in wages and benefits. Camping has said he has worked without pay for several years. \n \n Articles have noted that the station\'s lease runs through 2023 and that several employees were planning last week to show up to work on Monday. \n \n Followers like Ramsey and Lombardi said they had few hard feelings toward Camping and still agreed with some of the self-taught preacher\'s views, such as one that says all churches and denominations have been corrupted. \n \n ""I have learned to study the Bible really well. This guy has opened my eyes to a lot of truths,"" said Lombardi. \n \n ""If he makes another prediction, I can\'t tell you what I am going to do,"" said Ramsey. ""But I\'ve really taken an interest in the Bible. I know it\'s the word of God. And I\'ve been reading into more parts today."" \n \n He quoted Mark 13:22: ""For false Christs and false prophets shall rise, and shall [show] signs and wonders, to seduce, if [it were] possible, even the elect.""', 'the end is near Long Island Firefighter’s Wait for the Rapture Goes Unfulfilled \n \n “Wanna order a pizza?"" Jeff asks. ""I don’t know if we’ll have time to eat it, but we might as well get it.” \n \n \n \n It is 4:48 p.m. on May 21, and earthquakes have not yet riven the Earth. “When the sky goes dark and you feel a rumbling, I’m going to ask you and the kids to step outside very quickly,"" Jeff told me when I first arrived at his small ranch house in Hicksville, Long Island. ""God willing, we’ll all be taken up in a whirlwind to Heaven. I know it might sound strange, but that’s my understanding of how it’s going to go.” His 6-year-old son was in the living room, playing a Star Wars game on the Wii. His 4-year-old daughter, wearing a Spider-Man bike helmet from a recent tricycle trip around the backyard, tapped me on the shoulder to show me a crayon drawing of a rainbow. \n \n \n \n Jeff orders a large Sicilian pie for delivery. “And please put a rush on it,” he tells the person taking his order. “We’re — we’re in a rush here.” \n \n Jeff is visibly nervous now, taking deep breaths. “And listen,” he says into the phone, “if you have a radio, put on 94.7. They’re talking about Judgment Day and telling everyone to ask God for mercy. It\'s important.” WFME 94.7 is the New York outlet for Family Radio, the station Jeff was listening to three years ago when he heard Harold Camping prophesying the End of Days. That\'s when Jeff left the Catholic Church and begin studying Biblical numerology. Thousands of Camping\'s followers fervently believe that the Rapture will occur on May 21, 2011; millions more know of the prophecy thanks to Family Radio billboards and newspaper ads. \n \n Jeff, 44, is a muscular firefighter from Flushing with a square jawline. When the pizza arrives, Jeff calls his friend Ron, “One of the only true believers I know who will talk to me about this stuff,"" and they reassure each other by speakerphone, parsing choice psalms and proverbs. \n \n \n \n “So, from the Biblical evidence you’re finding,” Jeff asks Ron, “at what hour do we now think this earthquake is going to happen?” According to Harold Camping, the earthquakes were to start at 6 p.m. at the International Date Line — 2 a.m. Eastern Time — and spread eastward around the world. When Jeff woke up on Saturday and everything was still calm, he decided this was a potentially ominous sign: “This morning the sky was crystal clear, just like 9/11. I was a firefighter then, and I couldn’t believe that on such a beautiful day, such destruction could come.” With the Rapture seemingly running behind schedule, Jeff hypothesized then predicted the earthquakes would come between 3 and 5 p.m. ET, and would wreak destruction over all the world simultaneously. After three, his prediction changed again: “Six now looks more likely, but really it might be any time before midnight.” Ron, over the phone, refuses to predict the hour. “In all this time, I’ve always been blown away by the evidence pointing to the day, but never the exact hour.” \n \n \n \n Rosana, Jeff’s wife, who had been out at a friend\'s birthday party, comes home a little after six. “What, nothing happened?” she asks with no small amount of contempt. \n \n Jeff buries his head in his Bible. He and Ron debate the virtues of King Solomon for another hour, while Rosana loudly opens and closes cabinets. Jeff warms up another slice of pizza and pours Pepsi into a Miller Lite pint glass. Finally, he hangs up the phone. Rosana turns to face him. \n \n “Jeff, starting at midnight tonight, I don’t want to hear any more of this crap, okay?” \n \n “Look,” he says, “I told you I knew the day, but I never claimed to know the hour—“ \n \n “I don’t want to hear it, Jeff. I’m telling you, I can’t take it.” \n \n Rosana gives me a helpless look, and she and I go into another room to chat. “I don’t know what happened to him,” she whispers to me. “He used to be normal. Now all he can talk about is the Bible and this May 21 stuff. He took all his vacation days in a row, so all he’s doing the last four weeks is sitting around reading the Bible and driving me nuts. Thank God he didn’t quit his job like some of them did.” \n \n Meanwhile, Jeff is checking his text messages. “There are a bunch of friends here who are mocking me,” he says. “And that’s all right! I just put on my spiritual shield and endure.” \n \n Ron calls again, and he and Jeff come up with a new interpretation: May 21 will not end, technically, until midnight in Hawaii. “There will be a lot of people mocking me after midnight tonight if nothing does happen,” Jeff says, breathing quickly again, “but what they don’t realize is that May 21 hasn’t been completed everywhere in the world yet. So we really can’t tell anything until six in the morning here. That’s when the truth will really be tested.”', 'CLOSE President Barack Obama says the Senate\'s opposition to a bill that would have expanded background checks for gun buyers marks a ""shameful day"" in Washington. (April 17) AP \n \n President Obama arrives for a news conference in the Rose Garden. He is joined by former representative Gabrielle Giffords and Mark Barden, whose son Daniel was killed in the Newtown, Conn., school shooting. (Photo: Carolyn Kaster, AP) Story Highlights Senate rejects bipartisan amendment to expand background checks on gun purchases \n \n Several red-state Democrats up for re-election in 2014 voted against measure \n \n Vice President Biden says American people are ahead of elected officials on gun legislation \n \n WASHINGTON — An angry President Obama criticized a minority of the Senate on Wednesday for helping defeat a proposal to expand background checks on gun purchases. \n \n ""It came down to politics — the worry that that vocal minority of gun owners would come after them in future elections,"" Obama said in the Rose Garden. ""All in all, this was a pretty shameful day for Washington."" \n \n Obama was introduced by Mark Barden, whose son, Daniel, was among the 20 children and six adults killed Dec. 14 in a gun massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. Besides other Newtown families, Obama was flanked by former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, who was shot in the head during a 2011 assassination attempt. \n \n MORE: How senators voted \n \n Just hours before, the Senate voted 54-46 to defeat an amendment by Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Pat Toomey, R-Pa., to expand background checks to include purchases made at gun shows and on the Internet. Forty-one Republicans were joined by five Democrats — primarily from red states where gun ownership is high — to reject the proposal. \n \n Hello! We’ve got complete midterm election coverage right here. Let’s begin! \n \n The background-checks measure was seen as the core of legislative efforts to reduce gun massacres, such as the one in Newtown and the 2011 rampage near Tucson that killed six people and severely wounded Giffords, a moderate Democrat and gun owner who now champions gun-control efforts. \n \n FIRST TAKE: Obama may regret not leaning in on guns \n \n Sixty votes were necessary to get around a filibuster – a tall order because it meant drawing on Republican support to make up for losing majority-party Democrats. Obama slammed the Senate filibuster rules, and said the concern that gun owners would vote against senators in the next election caused the outcome. \n \n Obama said the background-checks proposal did not include everything he wanted, but it represented ""progress,"" ""moderation"" and ""common sense."" He chided the National Rifle Association (NRA) and its allies for falsely claiming it would create a ""Big Brother""-type gun registry, even though the legislation would specifically outlaw such a thing. \n \n ""Instead of supporting this compromise, the gun lobby and its allies willfully lied about the bill,"" Obama said. ""This pattern of spreading untruths about this legislation served a purpose, because those lies upset an intense minority of gun owners, and that in turn intimidated a lot of senators."" \n \n After the Senate vote, the NRA called the background-checks proposal ""misguided."" \n \n ""This amendment would have criminalized certain private transfers of firearms between honest citizens, requiring life-long friends, neighbors and some family members to get federal government permission to exercise a fundamental right or face prosecution,"" said Chris Cox, the NRA\'s chief lobbyist. ""As we have noted previously, expanding background checks, at gun shows or elsewhere, will not reduce violent crime or keep our kids safe in their schools."" \n \n In an example of the political risk of gun votes, the liberal Progressive Change Campaign Committee launched an ad campaign targeting Democratic Sens. Mark Pryor of Arkansas, Max Baucus of Montana, Mark Begich of Alaska and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota for their ""no"" votes. \n \n Pryor, Baucus and Begich face competitive fights for re-election in 2014. \n \n Four GOP senators — Toomey, Mark Kirk of Illinois, Susan Collins of Maine and John McCain of Arizona — crossed party lines to support the measure. \n \n In a surprise, ailing Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., appeared in the chamber for the first time in weeks to cast an ""yea"" vote. He has been battling muscle weakness and fatigue, and came to the Senate floor in a wheelchair. \n \n CLOSE The U.S. Senate rejected a bill to tighten restrictions on firearms sales by a vote of 54 to 46, well short of the 60 needed. Following the vote, Senator Joe Manchin alongside other Senate Democrats vowed to push on for gun restrictions. (April 17) AP \n \n Earlier in the day, Vice President Biden acknowledged to mayors in an online chat that the Senate vote would be a long shot. But he vowed to keep pressing for gun-control measures, and was echoed by Obama during the Rose Garden event. \n \n ""I can assure you one thing: We\'re going to get this eventually,"" Biden said. ""If we don\'t get it today, we\'ll get it eventually. I think the American people are way ahead of their elected officials."" \n \n The Senate rejected several other amendments to the underlying gun bill, including one to ban assault weapons and limit the size of magazine clips. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., the sponsor of the assault weapons ban, implored her colleagues to ""show some guts"" but the measure was defeated on a 40-60 vote. \n \n A substitute plan by Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, that would tighten the background-check database but not expand the types of sales subject to it was defeated. A measure by Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., and Collins to toughen rules on gun trafficking was also rejected. \n \n More amendments and votes are expected Thursday. \n \n Contributing: Aamer Madhani \n \n Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/15m1NUv']",5,"– So, how do rapture believers feel today, considering the fact that they’re still firmly on earth? A sampling of reactions from the Huffington Post, Reuters, the AP, and the Los Angeles Times: John Ramsey, 25, quit his job, donated thousands of dollars to Camping’s Family Radio, and took to the streets of Manhattan with his family to spread word of the coming end of days. Now, he and his mother must find new jobs and his 19-year-old brother, who quit high school, might re-enroll. The good news is, Ramsey’s wife will get to have her baby. “Life goes on,” he says. “I get to be a dad.” Peter Lombardi, 44, who took an “indefinite break” from his job last year, acknowledges that perhaps “no man knows the day or the hour” the world will end. He spent yesterday peeling Judgment Day stickers off his minivan, but says he’s “not disappointed.” He does want an explanation from Camping, to whom he donated money: “I don’t think they were scamming me, but I am definitely waiting to see what they say … on the radio show.” Robert Fitzpatrick, who spent much of his life savings on advertisements for the rapture, stood in Times Square at 6pm and simply said, “I do not understand why … I do not understand why nothing has happened.” He added, ""I can't tell you what I feel right now. Obviously, I haven't understood it correctly because we're still here."" Keith Bauer, 38, loaded his family into his SUV and drove from Maryland to California to await the end of days. Though he “had some skepticism,” he says he truly wanted to believe, since he figured “heaven would be a lot better than this earth.” Even so, he says he’s not upset with Camping. “Worst-case scenario for me, I got to see the country.

The cause of death was unclear, but Wolfe had been recently hospitalized for an infection.

An acolyte of French novelist Emile Zola and other authors of ""realistic"" fiction, the stylishly attired Wolfe was an American maverick who insisted that the only way to tell a great story was to go out and report it, per the AP. Along with Gay Talese, Truman Capote, and Nora Ephron, he helped demonstrate that journalism could offer the kinds of literary pleasure found in books. Wolfe's hyperbolic, stylized writing work was a gleeful fusillade of exclamation points, italics, and improbable words. An ingenious phrase maker, he helped brand such expressions as ""radical chic"" for rich liberals' fascination with revolutionaries; and the ""Me"" generation, defining the self-absorbed baby boomers of the 1970s. One panel of experts, listing the best journalism of the century, cited Wolfe three times on its list of 100, for The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test, The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flake Streamline Baby, and The Right Stuff. Whether sending up the New York art world or hanging out with acid heads, Wolfe inevitably presented man as a status-seeking animal, concerned above all about the opinion of one's peers.

They might as well say get younger, because that’s how easy it is.’‘I did it the same way everybody has to – don’t eat and exercise more! There is no other way to do it. I have a harder time eating properly than I do exercising. It’s easier for me to add an activity than to deny myself something. And when I do lose the weight, I don’t like that it makes me feel good about myself. It’s not who I am. My problem is they talk to me like an actress, but I hear them like a writer.'‘We treat beauty like an accomplishment, and that is insane. Everyone in LA says, “Oh you look good,” and you listen for them to say you’ve lost weight. It’s never “How are you?” or “You seem happy!”’‘I looked at my mother and said, “Wow. She is gorgeous and I don’t look like her, therefore I’m not pretty. And my father doesn’t visit… I mustn’t be pretty because he likes pretty women.” You think, I’ll go into show business because then I’ll get enough love and they will put make-up on me properly and then my life will work.’‘I’d like to in theory, but it’s very hard for women in show business. I don’t want to make someone Mr Fisher. The most important things in my life now are my mother, my daughter, my friends and my dog, Gary. He travels everywhere with me!

Republicans blasted the president as conducting an unconstitutional military mission, while setting a dangerous precedent that would give the executive branch nearly unchecked power to wage war.""If the president believes that missile strikes and drone operations taking place in Libya are critical, it is his responsibility to explain [that] to the American people and to seek authorization from this Congress. Because the president has failed to do that ... we are here today,"" House Speaker John Boehner said from the floor before the vote.The White House argues that because the United States is acting as a part of NATO, its engagement does not meet the definition of ""hostilities"" that requires congressional authorization under the War Powers Act.The argument has won over few in Congress, even Democratic allies. But opponents of the House bill argued that the solution was to authorize the Libya mission. Cutting off the funding was merely an attempt to score political points while risking damage to the U.S.\' relationship with allies, they argued.""If we want our allies to stand by us in our time of need in Afghanistan we have to stand by them in places like Libya,"" said House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.). ""We\'re either in an alliance or we\'re not.""Earlier, an attempt to authorize the current level of military force in Libya for one year failed. That measure, identical to one with bipartisan support in the Senate, was overwhelmingly rejected by a vote of 123-295. Seventy Democrats joined with Republicans to reject the measure, and eight Republicans voted for the measure.The funding bill failed 180-238. It would have cut all U.S. financial backing for the mission until authorized by Congress. It makes an exception for a short list of specific activities not directly related to a typical definition of ""hostilities,"" including intelligence gathering, search and rescue, aerial refueling and planning.Opponents argued that the bill would essentially end U.S. involvement in the mission.Even if it passed, the bill would have had virtually no chance of becoming law. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has expressed support for the mission in Libya and was not expected to bring it up for a vote.Lisa Mascaro contributed to this report.', 'The August rally in Charlottesville, organized by Unite the Right, which brought together several far-right groups, came amid a string of protests by white supremacist groups of removals of Confederate monuments across the South. Hundreds demonstrated against the city’s decision to remove a statue of Robert E. Lee, the Confederate general. The rally, following a torch-lit march a night earlier, devolved quickly into racial taunts, shoves and brawls. The governor declared a state of emergency, and the police and the National Guard cleared the area. \n \n Mr. Fields was among the crowd of demonstrators “engaged in chants promoting or expressing white supremacist and other racist and anti-Semitic views,” according to the Justice Department. After they were dispersed, prosecutors said, Mr. Fields drove away and encountered a “racially and ethnically diverse crowd of individuals” at the bottom of a hill who were protesting discrimination. \n \n “Fields slowly reversed his vehicle to the top of the hill,” prosecutors wrote in the indictment in trying to underscore his intent, “then rapidly accelerated, ran through a stop sign and across a raised pedestrian mall, and drove directly into the crowd.” Mr. Fields’s car stopped only when it hit another vehicle, and then he fled, court papers said. Ms. Heyer was killed and dozens injured. \n \n In the hours and days afterward, Mr. Trump alternated his responses, condemning the violence but refusing at first to criticize white nationalists or the neo-Nazi slogans on display at the protest. He blamed “hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides” and said the demonstrators included “some very fine people.” \n \n Civil rights advocates rebuked Mr. Trump, his fellow Republicans rushed to condemn the resurgence of white supremacist rallies and others aligned with the White House withdrew their support, including several corporate executives, prompting the president to disband a pair of advisory councils they served on. \n \n But as conservatives and progressives castigated Mr. Trump, David Duke, the former leader of the Ku Klux Klan, sent the president an ominous warning. “I would recommend you take a good look in the mirror & remember it was White Americans who put you in the presidency, not radical leftists,” Mr. Duke wrote on Twitter. \n \n Mr. Sessions was in some ways an unusual voice to emerge from the Trump administration on the violence, first in denouncing it last summer and now in the Justice Department bringing hate crime charges. He has long been skeptical of expanding hate crime laws that create federal jurisdiction over certain assaults and murders.']",2,"– House Republicans wanted to deliver a one-two rebuke to President Obama today over Libya, but they'll have to settle for half that: Good news for Obama: A GOP-led measure to cut off funds for the military operation failed 238-180.

There was no immediate word about whether that package contained a bomb. \n \n FBI agent Michelle Lee said the explosion happened around 1 a.m. at a FedEx facility in Schertz, which is just northeast of San Antonio and about 60 miles (95 kilometers) southwest of Austin. A worker was treated for minor injuries and released, police said. \n \n “It would be silly for us not to admit that we suspect it’s related” to the four Austin bombings that have killed two people and injured four others since March 2, Lee said. She did not have details about the size, weight or description of the package. \n \n The package was on a conveyer belt when it detonated. One worker reported ringing in her ears after the blast. She was treated and released from a hospital. \n \n Schertz Police Chief Michael Hansen said the intended target of the bomb was not the shipping facility or anyone in Schertz. But neither the police chief nor federal agents would say where the package was sent from, where it was being shipped or give any other details about the investigation. \n \n The FedEx blast came less than two days after another bombing wounded two men Sunday night in a quiet Austin neighborhood.

On the night of the bombing, one of the victims was riding a bike in the street and the other was on a sidewalk when they crossed a tripwire that he said knocked “them both off their feet.” \n \n “It was so dark they couldn’t tell, and they tripped,” he said. “They didn’t see it.

And it blew up.” \n \n Grote said his son, who lives about 100 yards (90 meters) from the blast, heard the explosion and raced outside to find both of the young men bleeding profusely. \n \n The presence of a tripwire was a departure from the first three bombings, which involved parcels left on doorsteps that detonated when moved or opened. \n \n The tripwire heightened fears around Austin, a town famous for its cool, hipster attitude. \n \n “It’s creepy,” said Erin Mays, 33. “I’m not a scared person, but this feels very next-door-neighbor kind of stuff.” \n \n Authorities repeated prior warnings about not touching unexpected packages and issued new ones to be wary of any stray object left in public, especially ones with protruding wires. \n \n “We’re very concerned that with tripwires, a child could be walking down a sidewalk and hit something,” Christopher Combs, FBI agent in charge of the bureau’s San Antonio division, said in an interview. \n \n Police originally pointed to possible hate crimes, but the victims have now been black, Hispanic and white and from different parts of the city. \n \n Local and state police and hundreds of federal agents are investigating. The reward for information leading to an arrest has climbed to $115,000. \n \n “We are clearly dealing with what we believe to be a serial bomber at this point,” Austin Police Chief Brian Manley said, citing similarities among the four bombs. He would not elaborate, though, saying he did not want to undermine the investigation. \n \n While the first three bombings all occurred east of Interstate 35, a section of town that tends to be more heavily minority and less affluent, Sunday’s was west of the highway. The differences in location, the lack of a motive and other unknowns make it harder to draw conclusions about any possible pattern. \n \n Thad Holt, 76, said he is now watching his steps as he makes his way through a section of town near the latest attack. “I think everybody can now say, ‘Oh, that’s like my neighborhood,’” he said. \n \n The latest bomb was anchored to a metal yard sign near the head of a hiking trail, Milanowski said. \n \n “It was a thin wire or filament, kind of like fishing line,” he said. “It would have been very difficult for someone to see.” \n \n Authorities have checked more than 500 leads, Milanowski said. Police asked anyone with surveillance cameras at home to come forward with the footage on the chance it captured suspicious vehicles or people.', 'Quilts have fallen victim to the war on bugs. \n \n Or to their makers\' speedy fingers. \n \n The Department of Veterans Affairs and members of Quilts of Valor can\'t agree on the explanation, but the Minneapolis VA is no longer accepting the donated, handcrafted quilts that volunteers have been making for wounded soldiers and other vets who served in Iraq and Afghanistan. \n \n Twin Cities leaders of the charitable group got the word from the Minneapolis VA earlier this month. They were told the decision was part of a nationwide directive for VA facilities because of an outbreak of bedbugs at a VA homeless shelter in another state. The restriction is expected to last at least six months, they were told. \n \n Page Johnson, the southern Minnesota coordinator for Quilts of Valor, said Wednesday that the VA\'s concerns are understandable, though she gave just a hint of offense at the suggestion that her group\'s quilts could be carriers of bedbugs. The fabric is new, the process for making them is clean and there has never been a hint that any of the quilts delivered to the VA were tainted, she said. \n \n ""We\'re dealing with new fabrics, people take this very seriously, everything is kept clean, there is no contact where it would get something like that,"" Johnson said. ""Bedbugs come from humans using the quilts and they are not used, they are new. I can assure you we are not using these things and giving away used items."" \n \n Here\'s where the fog of war extends to quilting. \n \n The VA says the new ban has nothing to do with bedbugs -- the real issue is the generosity and efficiency of the quilting volunteers. The VA has simply run out of room for the stuff. \n \n In an April 6 letter addressed to ""knitters, crocheters, quilters and seamstresses,"" Katharina Ryan, the director of the Voluntary/Community Resource Center of the Minneapolis VA, described the problem. \n \n ""Thanks to your skill, talents and dedication to helping our hospitalized veterans of the Minneapolis VA Medical Center, we have an overabundant supply of lap robes, quilts, blankets, neck pillows, armrest pillows, heart pillows, slippers and laundry bags,"" she wrote. ""We are unable to accept any of these items until further notice."" \n \n While the reason for the embargo may be in question, the productivity of Quilts of Valor isn\'t. The quilts come from quilters sewing the tops together in their basements and spare bedrooms or in sewing clubs or shops like Fabric Town and the Quilting Page. One group gathers the first Friday of every month for a couple of hours at Fabric Town in Apple Valley. \n \n The operation rivals anything in the military. The quilts are put together using donated fabric with backing, batting and binding and a label listing the quilter and her hometown. (Participants are overwhelmingly -- if not exclusively -- women.) The quilts are then brought for ""longarm"" quilting (stitching the layers together with commercial-grade sewing machines) before they are returned to Quilt of Valor local leaders, who sort and distribute them. \n \n In 2009, the Upper Midwest Chapter of the Quilts of Valor distributed 1,399 quilts. In 2010 it was 1,881. Since its genesis in a sewing room in Seaford, Del., in 2004, the group has distributed more than 37,000 quilts nationwide. \n \n \'Good way ... to give back\' \n \n ""It\'s hard work but it\'s been a really good way to do something you love and to give back to people who have given so much,"" said Marcia Stevens, who started a Brainerd Quilts of Valor group in 2005. \n \n VA spokesman Ralph Heussner said he has seen the Minneapolis supply room packed with donated items. While bedbugs are always a concern, the real issue is making a dent in the oversupply. Once supplies dwindle, quilts will be accepted again. \n \n ""We really do appreciate all the work they do,"" he said. \n \n VA qualms or not, there\'s no quit in the quilters. \n \n They are still in the business of giving quilts to Guard and Reserve soldiers with three or more deployments. One recipient, a helicopter pilot, had seven deployments under his belt. County veterans service officers have asked for quilts. Grandmas even call in with requests. Minneapolis police recently distributed quilts to homeless vets on the streets. The Minnesota Veterans Homes, which operate independently of the federal VA system, also continue to accept donations, although quilts and fabrics of all kinds are inspected and may be laundered if there are concerns, said Minnesota Veterans Affairs spokeswoman Anna Long. \n \n ""The fact is we can\'t make enough quilts to cover all the wounded; we can\'t even come close,"" Johnson said. \n \n Mark Brunswick • 612-673-4434']",2,"– Hours after pleas for information about Austin's serial bomber, a package bound for the city exploded at a FedEx facility near San Antonio, injuring one.

""It seemed logical that I would suggest a small set of female minifigures in interesting professions to make our Lego city communities more diverse."" \n \n Lego Ideas is a site where enthusiasts can submit and vote on ideas for sets they want to see available in toy stores. When an project receives 10,000 votes, it then enters a review phase to be evaluated by a board made up of set designers and marketing representatives, according to its website. \n \n After testing the concepts for stability, playability, safety, market fit and more, the board selects one idea to become the next Lego Ideas product.

But many believe that one piece of the puzzle is broadening the dreams and visions of young girls. \n \n In 2013, LEGO introduced a “scientist” mini-figure to its collection, and though she had no particular specialty, it was warmly received. \n \n But LEGO’S 2011 attempt to explicitly appeal to girls was resoundingly panned. LEGO Friends seemed like a Barbie knockoff — replete with lots of pink, short skirts, hanging out at the pool and of course, some good old baking. Its critics called the toy sets condescending and stereotypical, or worse: sexist. \n \n Earlier this year, a 7-year-old girl wrote to the company to complain that “all the girls did was sit at home, go to the beach, and shop, and had no jobs,” while the boys in LEGO toys “went on adventures, worked, saved people, and had jobs.” \n \n 7yo Charlotte writes an adorable and strongly worded letter to LEGO regarding the lack of adventures for girls. pic.twitter.com/JblNKzCwJs — SocImages (@SocImages) January 28, 2014 \n \n \n \n Kooijman’s design is the first step in correcting this problem. \n \n For this heightened awareness of the depiction of women in toys and the media, there are many decades of feminism to thank. \n \n More recently, however, Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, has made changing the depiction of women in stock images a big priority, along with — somewhat controversially — a campaign to reclaim the word “bossy” as a compliment, not a critique. \n \n And startup GoldieBlox captivated the world with its truly ingenious ad recasting the Beastie Boys song “Girls” as a mini-feminist anthem to the backdrop of young girls building and breaking things. (The ad did get the company embroiled in a copyright infringement lawsuit with the band, though.) \n \n “Girls, you think you know what you want,” they sing. “You like to buy us pink toys, and everything else is for boys.” \n \n LEGO’s new “Research Institute” set is on track to be released in August 2014, the company said.']",3,"– Lego has apparently heard the criticism that its plastic universe is mostly a boys' club, and things will change this summer.

41,"['At the height of their powers, our overlords at Marvel have deigned to prove, like an emperor tolerating a court jester, that they do, in fact, have a sense of humor. \n \n This image released by Disney - Marvel shows, from left, Zoe Saldana, the character Rocket Racoon, voiced by Bladley Cooper, Chris Pratt, the character Groot, voiced by Vin Diesel and Dave Bautista in... (Associated Press) \n \n The Marvel universe, of course, isn\'t entirely lacking comedy, as we\'ve seen in ""Iron Man"" and ""The Avengers."" But on the whole, the Marvel kingdom is built on an unshakable foundation of self-seriousness. The comic book studio seems to fear that if the solemnity of its fiction isn\'t diligently guarded, people might start questioning whether all these men in spandex merit quite so much attention. \n \n Yet ""Guardians of the Galaxy,"" a 3-D space opera about a ragtag crew of mercenaries, is Marvel\'s most irreverent film yet, and has a welcome, slightly self-mocking tone that dares to suggest intergalactic battles over orbs might actually be a tad silly. \n \n This is all very much to the good, but the problem with ""Guardians of the Galaxy,"" directed by James Gunn, is the weakness of the comedy it wears so proudly. It takes more than a soundtrack full of \'70s tunes, a talking raccoon and a few gags about ""Footloose"" to be funny. It\'s ""zany"" in quotes. \n \n As if demonstrating its tonal distance from Marvel\'s other planetary bodies, ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" takes place at the far reaches of space, where we find Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) skipping along on an abandoned planet. He removes his mask, presses play on a Walkman and does something normally sacrosanct in Marvel-land: He dances. Blaring is the irresistible 1974 hit ""Come and Get Your Love"" by Redbone, the first of many such old radio hits. \n \n The music, as we learned in the prologue, is from a mixtape given to Quill as a child by his cancer-stricken mother shortly before her death. Distraught, he rushes outside only to — in quite the double-whammy — be beamed up by a spaceship. \n \n Twenty-six years later, Quill is a Han Solo-like scavenger who stumbles across a silver orb also sought by some powerfully evil forces: Ronan the Accuser (Lee Pace, obscured by makeup but still a severe presence) and his boss, Thanos (Josh Brolin). The warm spirit of ""Guardians"" owes much to Pratt, the guileless, formerly doughy ""Parks and Recreation"" star; his casting in inspired. \n \n The resulting scrum for the orb introduces several more seekers: the green-skinned Gamora (Zoe Saldana), the hulking Drax (Dave Bautista) and a CGI odd couple: a bitterly sardonic raccoon named Rocket (Bradley Cooper) and his sidekick, a talking tree called Groot (Vin Diesel) who looks like he sprouted from ""The Lord of the Rings."" All reluctantly unite like a sarcastic ""Dirty Dozen."" \n \n The Guardians, who were first introduced in a 1969 comic, are far from Marvel\'s star players. But their not-primetime-player status is freeing to Gunn, whose 2010 comedy ""Super"" starred Rainn Wilson as a wannabe crime fighter. He wrote the film with Nicole Perlman, clearly aspiring for a rollicking adventure in the mold of ""Indiana Jones"" or ""Star Wars,"" which the movie\'s poster evoked. \n \n But the film is terribly overstuffed and many of the jokes get drowned out by the special effects. Presumably awaiting meatier work sequels to come, fine actors like Glenn Close, John C. Reilly and Benicio Del Toro come and go with just a few lines. (How can a movie seeking humor in outer space not utilize Reilly?) \n \n The pervasive movie references detract from the stab at freshness, and ""Guardians"" depends all too much on the whimsy of \'70s anthems for an original beat. Others, eager for any playfulness from Marvel, will surely be more excited by ""Guardians of the Galaxy."" To them I quote Solo: ""Laugh it up, Fuzzball."" \n \n ""Guardians of the Galaxy,"" a Walt Disney Studios release, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America for ""intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action, and some language.""

Maybe they\'re collateral damage to the film\'s goofy style. \n \n Because the special effects in Guardians look slightly, almost intentionally, chintzy. It\'s as though director James Gunn wanted to make sure we stayed in the farce and didn\'t get sucked in by the sci-fi trappings. \n \n This is entertainment straight out of the professional wrestling handbook: larger than life and emphatically artificial. Unless, of course, you believe the criminal class light years from our planet is exchanging banter cribbed from bad Bill Murray movies. \n \n Speaking of pro wrestling, Dave Bautista, the WWE\'s Batista, has a wonderful turn as the Guardians\' behemoth, Drax the Destroyer. And Zoe Saldana gives one of her best tinted-skin-alien performances yet as Gamora. \n \n Pratt carries the film loosely, as the super-chill Quill, who seems to think he can sweet-talk his way out of the scariest situation. \n \n Michael Rooker and John C. Reilly make the most of their comedic supporting roles. Also impressive as more grimly one-dimensional characters are Lee Pace (Halt and Catch Fire) and Doctor Who\'s Karen Gillan. \n \n Guardians of the Galaxy has a crazy jukebox. Driven by Top-40 acts from the \'70s like Elvin Bishop, Redbone, and the Five Stairsteps, it sounds like one of those cheesy K-Tel albums. \n \n Oldies in space? Hey, it works, along with all the other disparate elements in this frothy action spoof. Guardians of the Galaxy throws everything in the blender, including, yes, Rupert Holmes\' ""Piña Colada Song."" \n \n dhiltbrand@phillynews.com \n \n 215-854-4875 \n \n @daveondemand_tv \n \n Guardians of the Galaxy Directed by James Gunn. With Karen Gillan, Djimon Hounsou, Michael Rooker, Lee Pace, John C. Reilly, Benicio del Toro, Zoe Saldana, Chris Pratt, Dave Bautista, Glenn Close. Distributed by Walt Disney Pictures. Running time: 2 hours, 2 minutes. Parent\'s guide: PG-13 (for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action, and for some language).', 'Maybe you never heard of Guardians of the Galaxy, the Marvel comic franchise that wilts in the shadows while Spider-Man, the X-Men and the Avengers get all the love. Maybe you think a big-ass movie about wanna-be Marvel icons isn\'t worth your time. \n \n Snap out of it. Guardians of the Galaxy does the impossible. Through dazzle and dumb luck, it turns the clichés of comic-book films on their idiot heads and hits you like an exhilarating blast of fun-fun-fun. It\'s insanely, shamelessly silly – just one reason to love it. \n \n Another is the up-for-anything cast. Chris Pratt is blissfully right as Peter Quill, who calls himself the Star Lord, mostly because no one else will. Since age nine, when he was zapped from Earth into space after the death of his mother, Peter has been bounty-hunting around the cosmos in the corrupt employ of blue-skinned Yondu (Michael Rooker). \n \n If you\'re a fan of Pratt as chubby Andy Dwyer on Parks and Recreation or as the voice of Emmet in The Lego Movie or in supporting roles in smart movies such as Moneyball and Zero Dark Thirty, you\'ll want to catch him here. Whether he\'s busting funky dance moves to the 1970s oldies songs on his late mom\'s cassette player (he kills it on ""O-o-h Child"") or showing his chops as a space warrior, Pratt nails every beat in the role – comedy, drama, action and six-pack-baring stud appeal. Want to see Pratt become a full-fledged movie star? This is where it happens. \n \n All praise to director James Gunn, the creative force behind the little-seen but muchadmired Slither and Super, for making his first epic an epic treat. The twisty script Gunn wrote with Nicole Perlman tests Peter\'s mettle with an impossible task: Collect major bucks and, oh yeah, save the galaxy by stealing a mysterious orb back from the evil Ronan (Lee Pace), who wants to use the orb\'s beyond-nuclear power for, well, the usual reasons. \n \n Of course, Peter needs help, which he gets, reluctantly, from four loser misfits, much like himself. Zoe Saldana defines seductive stealth as Gamora, the green-skinned assassin that Peter hits on despite his rep for sleeping with enemy aliens. ""That was one time,"" Peter objects. \n \n WWE wrestling champ Dave Bautista brings ferocity and feeling to Drax the Destroyer, the tattooed hulk who wants to crush Ronan for killing his wife and daughter. \n \n The real scene-stealers are computer-generated. Those who\'ve always dismissed Vin Diesel as a wooden actor will get a kick out of hearing him voice the role of Groot, a walking tree whose one line of dialogue is ""I am Groot."" Diesel gets the last laugh, since he wrings those three words for unexpected humor and heart. \n \n Top dog or, in this case, top rodent is Bradley Cooper as the voice of Rocket, a growling, gun-slinging raccoon given to mouthing off at his fellow guardians. While giving surprising depth to this genetically altered raccoon, Cooper has a ball taking the piss out of friends and foes who mistake Rocket for a candy-ass cartoon. \n \n You\'ll have a ball too. Guardians of the Galaxy is crowded with characters and incidents that sometimes spill over into confusion and chaos. Still, this orphan child of the Marvel universe possesses a wild-card energy and a throwaway charm that its bloated bigger-budget brothers should envy. Even a sequel doesn\'t inspire dread. Should the Guardians take on the Avengers? Hell, yeah!', ""Hollywood saved it�s biggest summer blast for last. \n \n �Guardians of the Galaxy� is the most successful space western since the first �Star Wars� trilogy, an irreverent mix of mismatched characters, heavy-handed baddies and huge battle sequences spiced up with sharp one-liners and a healthy helping of attitude. \n \n There are no pretensions here, no deep thoughts or shallow thoughts trying to look deep. There is a lot of Indiana Jones in the script, with some Avengers and even a hint of �Firefly,� but all this movie wants to do is have big fun. Which is exactly what it does. \n \n Then again, what else can you do when one of your main characters is a walking tree who can only say three words � �I am Groot�? You�d better be having fun. \n \n �Guardians� centers on Peter Quill (aka Star Lord), played by Chris Pratt, the �Parks and Recreation� star who also voiced one of this year�s top films, �The LEGO Movie.� Pratt is buff and handsome enough to pull off the heroic thing, but the film also takes full advantage of his comic chops. \n \n When Quill was a little boy on Earth, a spaceship beamed him aboard just after his mother died. About all he had on him was his Sony Walkman (look it up, kids), which provides the wonderfully incongruous out-of-time soundtrack to the movie. \n \n Twenty years later and Quill is a grown man, a space scavenger of sorts. When he comes upon the magical mumbo-jumbo ball (that�s not its technical name, but all movies like this have the basic equivalent, some item everybody wants), he suddenly find himself the center of a lot of attention. \n \n That attention most immediately comes from two scoundrels, the aforementioned Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel) and his partner Rocket, a machine-gun wielding hyper-intelligent raccoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper). They are soon joined by the green-skinned Gamora (Zoe Saldana), a trained fighting machine sent by the evil Ronan (an excellent Lee Pace) to also capture the magical mumbo-jumbo ball. \n \n Somehow this group all end up in jail together, where they meet the hulking Drax (Dave Bautista), who has sworn to kill Ronan, but opts instead to kill Gamora, until she confesses she was set to betray Ronan. At which point the gang begins melding into the Guardians of the Galaxy. \n \n Directed and co-written (along with Nicole Perlman) by James Gunn (�Slither,� �Super�), �Guardians� can�t rely on the mass nostalgia for its characters that other Marvel Comics franchises have had built in. Baby boomers didn�t grow up with Groot, kids don�t have Rocket pajamas (they doubtlessly will now). But maybe that�s why the franchise seems so fresh � there are few preconceptions or audience expectations about these characters. \n \n But a lot of credit has to go to Gunn, whose somewhat obscure previous films have always struck a precarious balance between dark humor and action. Here the humor isn�t as dark, the action isn�t as gory, and the balance doesn�t feel precarious. \n \n Sure some of the battles become a blur � that�s the way of action extravaganzas these days. And the band of misfits concept goes back decades. \n \n But none of those misfits was a talking tree or an armed raccoon. �Guardians of the Galaxy� has wit, energy and zaniness to spare. It will pop your corn and leave you hungry for more. \n \n 'Guardians of the Galaxy' \n \n GRADE: B+ \n \n Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action, and for some language \n \n Running time: 121 minutes"", 'The most touching thing in Guardians of the Galaxy is its very first opening scene, set in 1988. A young boy, inseparable from his Walkman, watches his mother die of cancer and then runs, in tears, out onto a field, where he’s promptly abducted by a spaceship. The scene positions this entire sci-fi spectacle as a wish-fulfillment fantasy, anchoring its derring-do and frivolity in grief. We read and watch stuff like this to get away, it tells us. So come away with us. Of course, this is just another variation on the old Spielbergian motif of the broken child saved by wonder, but it still works. It’s also an artful dodge, because while this very enjoyable film does return briefly to this scene later on, it mostly avoids anything approaching this level of poignancy for the rest of its running time. \n \n That young boy, 26 years later, has grown up to become Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), who wanders space and calls himself Star-Lord, a “Ravager” whose chief aim appears to be to find, steal, or smuggle cool stuff to sell. After he gets his hands on a mysterious and highly coveted object known as “The Orb,” he’s thrust together with a group of intergalactic misfits: A sociopathic, genetically modified talking raccoon named Rocket, voiced by Bradley Cooper; a giant tree-creature named Groot (who can say only “I am Groot,” but can still somehow get the raccoon to understand him, à la Chewbacca and Han Solo), voiced by Vin Diesel; beautiful, conflicted warrior Gamora, played by Zoe Saldana (claiming her third giant franchise; is she our current record-holder?); and musclebound, humorless, vengeful Drax the Destroyer, played by wrestling star Dave Bautista. \n \n The film jumps between galaxies and planets and interstellar colonies with amazing proficiency. Director James Gunn, who co-wrote the script with Nicole Perlman, has a rare talent, one that George Lucas also had but few filmmakers working in this genre do: He can effortlessly cut between evocative worlds we’ve never seen before without losing sight of the action and the pace of his narrative. With a few deft strokes, he can place us inside an entire mining colony built around the decaying head of an ancient deity floating around the cosmos — the same way that Lucas and his directors could throw us from a swamp planet to Cloud City without having to sit around and give us belabored explanations of what these were. This is a precious gift: an intuitive ability to understand both what we need to know and what we don’t need to know. A story of this scale needs elegant shorthand, the kind of shorthand whose very lack doomed films like John Carter and After Earth. Gunn has it in spades. \n \n A good thing, too, because the plot itself is ridiculously — and, I suspect, purposefully — dense, having to do with something called an ""Infinity Stone,"" which apparently has the power to destroy entire galaxies when wielded by the right being. Or something. Again, it doesn’t really matter. This might be, in terms of sheer destructive capability, the most powerful MacGuffin in the Marvel universe, and yet it feels thoroughly inconsequential. That’s because this is an insistently lighthearted movie. Think about it: Whereas most action films would have a character designated as comic relief, Guardians has a character designated as straight-man relief. Practically everyone else is comic relief of one form or another. \n \n And so, the film eagerly delivers a nonstop onslaught of irreverent one-liners and jokey exchanges and random pop-culture references — endearing gags you want to laugh at even when they’re not particularly funny. Context is everything here. Consider a line like, “He says he’s an A-hole, but — and I’m quoting him here — he’s ‘not 100 percent a dick.’” Or: “I come from a planet of outlaws. Billy the Kid. Bonnie and Clyde. John Stamos.” These wouldn’t be particularly brilliant lines in a standard-issue comedy. (Really? More Stamos jokes?) But wedged inside a superhero spectacle set in outer space, it all feels hilarious, the same way the familiar classic-rock soundtrack, featuring everything from “Moonage Daydream” to “Cherry Bomb,” feels cool. The movie wins you over with its calculated incongruities. It has a charm similar to this year’s earlier The Lego Movie, but that film used its wild, relentless gags to build to a celebration of unbridled creativity and diversity, and even managed to question things like fate, faith, and free will. \n \n But in Guardians of the Galaxy, they’re mostly just jokes. And that frivolity might be both the film’s greatest asset and its chief limitation. Gunn occasionally gives us moments that suggest he wants to do more than just make us chuckle. He has a great eye, not necessarily for pretty pictures, but for images of emotional grandeur — whether it’s of a spaceship beaming in two doomed lovers floating in what appears to be a final embrace, or for the spectacle of thousands of tiny ships conjoining to create a kind of protective cosmic netting. But he almost always undercuts these moments with gags, as if he’s afraid to commit to something bigger, darker, more profound. The film seems forever on the verge of becoming transcendent, but something keeps pulling it back — a certain eager-to-please-ness, maybe even an almost adolescent fear of the grand gesture. \n \n Gunn originally came up through the ranks at Troma (where he wrote Tromeo and Juliet), and a friend I saw Guardians of the Galaxy with, who loved the movie, called it “the most expensive Troma film ever made.” That sounds about right, and it’s not a bad thing. The film seems content to be the class clown of the Marvel Universe, which is all well and good. But like most class clowns, sometimes you wish it would apply itself — because it seems capable of being so much more.', '“Guardians of the Galaxy” brings to mind some of the most unforgettable sci-fi event movies of the last 30 years. Alas, those films are “Howard the Duck” and “Green Lantern.” \n \n Chris Pratt stars as an interstellar frat-boy Indiana Jones, out to steal and sell a precious orb that looks like a wire Christmas ornament from Pier 1 Imports. He teams up with a lady warrior (Zoe Saldana, this time in greenface) who is double-crossing her villainous boss; a wisecracking, Joisey-accented bounty-hunter raccoon (Bradley Cooper, stealing work from Gilbert Gottfried); a large killer plant who says only “I am Groot” (though Vin Diesel is the one they hired to say this); and Drax (Dave Bautista), a block of muscle and tats. \n \n Our hero, scruff-faced earthling Peter (Pratt), speaks in the kind of slang that passes for wit down at Delta Psi — just keep saying “dude,” “chill” or “bro,” it’ll be hilarious. Drax issues dumb-guy chatter that’s meant to bring relief to low-IQ audience members. He doesn’t get metaphors, see? “Nothing goes over my head. My reflexes are too fast.” Hey, Drax, Joey Tribbiani thinks your shtick is old. \n \n As the gang of outlaws whizzes around the universe, villains as fragile as Pringles line up to be obediently killed, amid dialogue that’s a jarring mix of fusty Conan-the-Barbarian-isms (“Spare me your foul gaze, woman”) and bro talk (“They got my d - - k message!”). For background filler there are tunes from Peter’s beloved ’70s pop mixtape. Out: John Williams. In: “The Piña Colada Song.” \n \n The movie isn’t a full-on spoof, like “A Million Ways To Die in Space.” \n \n Instead, we’re actually supposed to get pumped up by the chaotic action, the dazzlingly detailed special effects and the mortal combat with blue-faced villains with bits of circuit board or seaweed stuck to their faces. The comedy is meant to deflate tension that isn’t there in the first place. Writer-director James Gunn keeps pulling the rug out without first bothering to trick anyone into standing on it. \n \n It all goes by as slowly as an IRS audit because there’s no suspense: We learn at the outset that the screenwriters will, when stuck, simply dream up some new problem-solving gadget or superpower and give it, unexplained, to whomever needs it. Floating in space for a few seconds will kill you, unless it doesn’t. \n \n Grasping an all-powerful golf ball of energy will destroy you, except it won’t. A large weapon will suddenly be tossed to the paws of the raccoon, or the walking tree will form a magical bird’s nest of love around the whole crew to protect them from a crash landing. When in doubt, cut to the potty-mouthed raccoon. Ha, ha, he’s saying “Holy s - - t!” or “Attention, idiots!” Straight out of “Howard the Duck.” \n \n The one-liners in “Star Wars,” an obvious inspiration, got laughs while maintaining the illusion that the characters were in danger. \n \n Here, a joke about “Footloose” does the opposite. Told that a legendary hero called Kevin Bacon saved the people who had sticks up their butts, Saldana’s character asks, “Who put the sticks up their butts?” It’s supposed to be Drax’s job to be the sitcom cretin here, but in “Guardians of the Galaxy” there’s so much stupid being delivered that everybody has to chip in.']",6,"– Guardians of the Galaxy—what the AP describes as a ""3-D space opera"" starring Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, and the voices of Vin Diesel and Bradley Cooper—opens today, and reviewers seem happy. As of this writing, 91% of critics on Rotten Tomatoes approve of the Marvel flick, mainly because it does what a summertime movie inspired by a comic series is supposed to: entertain, excite, and elicit a few laughs. Examples: Peter Travers writes at Rolling Stone that, ""through dazzle and dumb luck, it turns the cliches of comic-book films on their idiot heads and hits you like an exhilarating blast of fun-fun-fun."" He adds that it's ""insanely, shamelessly silly"" and that this is the movie where a ripped Pratt transforms into a ""full-fledged movie star."" Summer and cinema metaphors as over the top as the movie abound. Tom Long writes at the Detroit News that the film ""will pop your corn and leave you hungry for more,"" while David Hiltbrand writes at the Philadelphia Inquirer declares that Guardians ""is an open fire hydrant of a summer movie: more fun than should be allowed in hot weather."" Tom Huddleston writes at Time Out London that the movie is like the ""box of chocolates"" from Forrest Gump: ""A vast, family-sized festive crate of chocolates, all wrapped in the shiniest packaging, all exploding with sweetness and surprises."" Bilge Ebiri offers more of a backhanded compliment, writing at Vulture that the ""very fun"" Guardians ""is the class clown of the Marvel Universe,"" wistfully adding that, ""like most class clowns … you wish it would apply itself, because it seems capable of being so much more."" And then—the naysayers. Mick LaSalle at the San Francisco Chronicle writes that the movie ""feels like lots of people pumping air into a tire that has a hole in it,"" while Kyle Smith at the New York Post calls the movie ""space junk"" and makes the wince-inducing comparison of the film to sci-fi fiascos Howard the Duck and Green Lantern."
42,"[""Topics: Opening Shot, Editor's Picks, John Boehner, Barack Obama, Fiscal cliff, Politics News \n \n Last night was hardly the first public humiliation that John Boehner has suffered at the hands of his fellow Republicans, but it’s probably the most stark. And it raises some very basic questions about the House speaker’s political future – like whether he even has one. \n \n That Boehner had devised and pursued Plan B in the first place seemed to speak to his weak grip on the GOP conference. Boehner and President Obama had negotiated their way to within spitting distance of each other, with the president giving significant ground on his revenue demands, agreeing to a reduction in Social Security benefits, and giving up on a payroll tax holiday extension. But when word of the looming deal leaked, House Republicans let their displeasure be known, and the speaker announced that he’d instead hold a vote on a bill to extend the Bush tax rates for all income under $1 million. That was Plan B. \n \n Exactly where Plan B fit into Boehner’s overall strategy was a matter of some debate, but he pressed hard for it and confidently predicted he had the 218 votes needed to pass it. So now we know that not only does Boehner not have sufficient support among Republicans to pass a potential compromise with Obama, he also doesn’t have the support to pass his own plan. \n \n It’s still possible some kind of fiscal cliff deal will be completed before Jan. 1, but it’s hard to see how. Last night’s developments are a clear sign that a significant chunk of Republicans are simply committed to never voting for any kind of tax hike – even one on a tiny chunk of super-wealthy people, even when it comes with some serious concessions from the other party, and even when failing to act means that taxes will go up for everyone. \n \n The most likely scenario now is that Jan. 1 will come and go, the Bush tax cuts will expire for all Americans, and President Obama and Democrats will then introduce a bill to restore the Bush rates for most people – maybe using the $250,000 income threshold that Obama stuck with until this week. Maybe then, when the vote really would be for a tax cut, Republicans will sign off on it. But for now, that’s not where they are."", 'Has there been a House speaker in modern American history with less control over his members than John Boehner? \n \n Sad trombone. (Charles Dharapak / AP) \n \n Over the past three days, Boehner has focused all attention on ""Plan B"": an effort to strengthen his hand in negotiations with President Obama by passing backup legislation that would extend the Bush tax cuts for all income under $1 million. \n \n Tonight, Boehner lost that vote. In a dramatic turn of events on the House floor, he pulled the legislation. In a statement released moments ago, he said, ""The House did not take up the tax measure today because it did not have sufficient support from our members to pass."" Boehner lost. \n \n Plan A, which was a deal with Obama, was put on ice, many believe, because Boehner couldn\'t wrangle the votes to pass anything Obama would sign. Plan B failed because Boehner couldn\'t wrangle the Republican votes to pass something Obama had sworn he wouldn\'t sign. \n \n The failure of Plan B proved something important: Boehner doesn\'t have enough Republican support to pass any bill that increases taxes -- even one meant to block a larger tax increase -- without a significant number of Democrats. The House has now adjourned until after Christmas, but it\'s clear now what Plan C is going to have to be: Boehner is going to need to accept the simple reality that if he\'s to be a successful speaker, he\'s going to need to begin passing legislation with Democratic votes. \n \n There\'s an asterisk there, though: It\'s not entirely clear whether Boehner will be the speaker of the House a month from today. The vote to elect the next speaker is on Jan. 3. To win, you need an absolute majority of the House, not a plurality. Even a hopeless conservative challenge that attracts only a handful of Republican votes could deny Boehner the speakership until a consensus candidate emerged. Tonight\'s vote makes that challenge more likely. \n \n A significant number of Boehner\'s members clearly don\'t trust his strategic instincts, they don\'t feel personally bound to support him, they clearly disagree with his belief that tax rates must rise as part of a deal, and they, along with many other Republicans, must be humiliated after the shenanigans on the House floor this evening. Worse, they know that Boehner knows he\'ll need Democratic support to get a budget deal done. That means ""a cave,"" at least from the perspective of the conservative bloc, is certain. That, too, will make a change of leadership appealing. \n \n If a conservative spoiler runs, he or she could very possibly deny Boehner the 218 votes he needs to become speaker, clearing the way for a consensus candidate like Eric Cantor to unite the party.

This is a speaker who doesn't even have the GOP votes to pass his own plan, let alone a compromise Obama would be willing to sign. If Boehner stays on as speaker, he's going to have to get used to passing things with Democratic votes—but that's a pretty big if. As Ezra Klein at the Washington Post points out, Boehner will need an absolute majority to win the Jan. 3 speaker election, which means that even a no-hope conservative challenger could derail him, clearing the way for, say, a consensus candidate like Eric Cantor to come forward.

""The agreement makes it impossible for the Iranians to make any further progress toward making a nuclear weapon in the next six months—and, if the talks break down after that, and the Iranians decide at that point to start building a nuclear arsenal, it will take them much longer to do so."" Kaplan calls it ""a triumph,"" adding that only a very small percentage of the sanctions on Iran will be freed up in exchange. It's a first step ""rife with historic possibilities.""  On Politico, Aaron David Miller takes a more wary approach. Yes, this deal could end up being a ""historic"" part of US-Iran relations, but ""we should be careful about putting on the party hats and breaking out the champagne—at least for now, anyway."" He lays out five reasons why. Among them: Israel isn't happy with the deal, which could make for ""a diplomatic trainwreck."" But perhaps the most serious problem: In Miller's opinion, the deal doesn't go far enough to put the brakes on Iran's nuclear program (it should have ""limit[ed] centrifuges and [sought] ironclad assurances that Iran can’t reconvert its enriched uranium stockpile into useable material""), meaning we must consider the consequences if a comprehensive accord is not reached within the six-month limit—which it likely won't be. ""We need to be honest with ourselves about what’s achievable."""

Streep used her time onstage while accepting the Cecil B. DeMille Award to talk about when she first saw Trump mock a disabled reporter at a 2015 rally. ""It kind of broke my heart,"" she noted, berating the ""instinct to humiliate"" that he seemed to display. The New York Times first got hold of Trump right after the awards—it was Times reporter Serge Kovaleski whom Trump reportedly made fun of—and although he said he hadn't seen Streep's speech, he noted he ""wasn't surprised"" about coming under fire from ""liberal movie people."" ""People keep saying I intended to mock the reporter's disability, as if Meryl Streep and others could read my mind, and I did no such thing,"" he said, adding he'd simply been ""calling into question a reporter who had gotten nervous because he had changed his story."" He reiterated his stance early Monday with a three-tweet defense. ""Meryl Streep, one of the most over-rated actresses in Hollywood, doesn't know me but attacked last night at the Golden Globes. She is a … Hillary flunky who lost big.

The only reason we are alive is because of you and your family.” \n \n Polziec’s interpreter broke down in tears relaying that message. \n \n “I cannot believe it that this actually came true,” Polziec said through the interpreter. \n \n “I am very happy, after 69 years in Poland, finally meeting my friend. We lived in terrible circumstances. Poland was occupied and they [the Nazis] did what they did. They were killing the Jews.” \n \n Gersten and his loved ones spent two years of his childhood in the home of Polziec’s Catholic family. \n \n Gersten, walking with a cane and wearing a yarmulke, embraced Polziec and gave him a bouquet of flowers. \n \n The Cedarhurst, LI, psychologist, his mom, sister and brother-in-law’s family all owe their lives to Polziec, whose family risked it all in defying Hitler’s killers. \n \n Gersten gestured to his extended family around him, and claimed victory against Hitler’s evil. \n \n “This is why our gratitude is so great, because of them.

All the families could have been killed,” Polziec said. “But my father was a big man, so he was not afraid.” \n \n The senior Polziec made it clear to all kids: Keep your mouths shut about their house “guests.” \n \n “The children were gathered and we were told that we have guests at home,” Polziec said. “You are not to speak of that. You cannot tell anyone.” \n \n Polziec grew up to get married, have two daughters and work at an aircraft factory. \n \n His mom and dad never flinched in their choice to hide the Gersten family. \n \n “These were honest people who just wanted to do the right thing,” Polziec said. “No one consulted us [kids].

(Associated Press) \n \n CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — Pro-government militias wielding wooden sticks and metal bars stormed congress on Wednesday, attacking opposition lawmakers during a special session coinciding with Venezuela\'s independence day. \n \n Four lawmakers were injured and blood was splattered on the neoclassical legislature\'s white walls. One of them, Americo de Grazia, had to be removed in a stretcher while suffering from convulsions. \n \n ""This doesn\'t hurt as much as watching how every day how we lose a little bit more of our country,"" Armando Arias said from inside an ambulance as he was being treated for head wounds that spilled blood across his clothes. \n \n The unprecedented attack, in plain view of national guardsmen assigned to protect the legislature, comes amid three months of often-violent confrontations between security forces and protesters who accuse the government of trying to establish a dictatorship by jailing foes, pushing aside the opposition-controlled legislature and rewriting the constitution to avoid fair elections. \n \n Tensions were already high after Vice President Tareck El Aissami made an unannounced morning visit to the National Assembly, accompanied by top government and military officials, for an event celebrating independence day. The short appearance at the congress by top officials who have repeatedly dismissed the legislators as a band of U.S.-backed conspirators was seen by many as a provocation. \n \n Standing next to a display case holding the founding charter, El Aissami said global powers are once again trying to subjugate Venezuela. \n \n ""We still haven\'t finished definitively breaking the chains of the empire,"" he said, adding that President Nicolas Maduro\'s plans to rewrite the constitution — a move the opposition sees as a power-grab — offers Venezuela the best chance to be truly independent. \n \n After he left, dozens of government supporters set up a picket outside the building, heckling lawmakers with menacing chants and eventually invading the legislature themselves. The siege only lifted after seven nerve-wracking hours when police set up a corridor to allow the hundreds of people trapped inside the legislature, including lawmakers and journalists, to leave. \n \n The brazen attack on one of the symbols of Venezuela\'s already limping democracy drew widespread international rebuke. \n \n ""This violence, perpetrated during the celebration of Venezuela\'s independence, is an assault on the democratic principles cherished by the men and women who struggled for Venezuela\'s independence 206 years ago today,"" U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said. \n \n Despite the violence, lawmakers approved a plan by the opposition to hold a symbolic referendum on July 16 that would give voters the chance to reject Maduro\'s plans to draft a new political charter. \n \n Later Maduro condemned the violence, but complained that the opposition doesn\'t do enough to control ""terrorist attacks"" committed against security forces by anti-government protesters. \n \n ""I will never be an accomplice to acts of violence,"" said Maduro during a speech at a military parade. \n \n The clash followed Tuesday\'s appearance of two short videos by a former police inspector who allegedly stole a helicopter and fired on two government buildings last week. \n \n Oscar Perez, repeating a call for rebellion among the security forces, said that he was in Caracas after abandoning the helicopter along the Caribbean coast and was ready for the ""second phase"" of his campaign to free his homeland from what he called the corrupt rule of Maduro and his ""assassin"" allies. \n \n Perez gave no other details but pledged to join youth who have been protesting on the streets the past three months against Maduro. \n \n ""Stop talking. Get on the streets. Take action. Fight,"" he said in the video, sitting before a Venezuelan flag and with what looks like an assault rifle by his side. He also denounced Maduro\'s plan to rewrite the constitution. \n \n ""If this constitutional assembly goes through, Venezuela will cease to exist because we\'ll have given away the country to the Cubans,"" he said. \n \n Hours later, another video appeared in which he urged Venezuelans to march on a Caracas military base, not the presidential palace, to locate and remove Maduro along with the ruling elite. \n \n The bold though largely harmless June 27 attack shocked Venezuelans who had grown accustomed to almost-daily clashes since April between often-violent youth protesters and security forces that have left more than 90 people dead and hundreds injured. \n \n Perez apparently piloted the stolen police helicopter that sprayed 15 bullets toward the Interior Ministry and dropped at least two grenades over the supreme court building. \n \n While Maduro claimed Perez had stolen the helicopter on a U.S.-backed mission to oust him from power, many in the opposition questioned whether the incident was a staged by the government to distract attention from the president\'s increasingly authoritarian rule. \n \n Adding to the intrigue is Perez\'s colorful past. \n \n In 2015, he produced and starred in a film called ""Suspended Death,"" and several photos show him in fatigues, scuba diving while toting an assault rifle, skydiving and standing in action poses with a German shepherd by his side. In his political debut, he read a manifesto in which he claimed to be part of a group of disgruntled members of Venezuela\'s security forces determined to save the country\'s democracy. \n \n Perez said in the video that the strike produced no casualties because he had taken care to avoid them. Neither of the buildings he attacked suffered damage. The helicopter he stole was found 24 hours later, abandoned in a verdant valley near the Caribbean coastline outside Caracas.', ""CARACAS (Reuters) - Pipe-wielding government supporters burst into Venezuela’s opposition-controlled congress on Wednesday, witnesses said, attacking and besieging lawmakers in the latest flare-up of violence during a political crisis. \n \n The melee, which injured seven opposition politicians, was another worrying flashpoint in a traumatic last three months for the South American OPEC nation, shaken by opposition protests against socialist President Nicolas Maduro. \n \n At least 90 people have died in the unrest, with fighting and barricades frequently blocking cities across Venezuela. \n \n National Assembly president Julio Borges said more than 350 politicians, journalists and guests to the Independence Day session were trapped in the siege that lasted until dusk. \n \n “There are bullets, cars destroyed including mine, blood stains around the (congress) palace,” he told reporters. “The violence in Venezuela has a name and surname: Nicolas Maduro.” \n \n The crowd had gathered just after dawn outside the building in downtown Caracas, chanting in favor of Maduro, witnesses said. In the late morning, several dozen people ran past the gates with pipes, sticks and stones and went on the attack. \n \n Several injured lawmakers stumbled bloodied and dazed around the assembly’s corridors. Some journalists were robbed. \n \n After the morning attack, a crowd of roughly 100 people, many dressed in red and shouting “Long Live The Revolution!”, trapped people inside for hours, witnesses said. \n \n Some in the crowd outside the legislature brandished pistols, threatened to cut water and power supplies, and played an audio of former socialist president Hugo Chavez saying “Tremble, oligarchy!” Fireworks were thrown inside. \n \n Related Coverage Venezuela Assembly siege ending: witnesses \n \n The worst-hurt lawmaker, Americo De Grazia, was hit on the head, fell unconscious, and was eventually taken by stretcher to an ambulance. His family later said he was out of critical condition and being stitched up. \n \n Downtown Caracas is a traditional stronghold neighborhood for the government and there has been a string of clashes there since the opposition thrashed the ruling Socialist Party in December 2015 parliamentary elections. \n \n In a speech during a military parade for Independence Day, Maduro condemned the “strange” violence in the assembly and asked for an investigation. But he also challenged the opposition to speak out about violence from within its ranks. \n \n In daily protests since April, young demonstrators have frequently attacked security forces with stones, homemade mortars and Molotov cocktails, and burned property. They killed one man by dousing him in gasoline and setting him on fire. \n \n “I want peace for Venezuela,” Maduro said. “I don’t accept violence from anyone.” \n \n FOREIGN CONDEMNATION \n \n Numerous foreign nations repudiated Wednesday’s events. \n \n “I condemn the grotesque attack on the Venezuelan assembly,” tweeted UK ambassador John Saville. \n \n “This violence, perpetrated during the celebration of Venezuela’s independence, is an assault on the democratic principles cherished by the men and women who struggled for Venezuela’s independence 206 years ago today,” the U.S. State Department said. \n \n Opposition lawmaker Luis Stefanelli (L) gestures next to fellow opposition lawmaker Leonardo Regnault (C) and a worker of the assembly after both were injured when a group of government supporters burst into Venezuela's opposition-controlled National Assembly, in Caracas, Venezuela July 5, 2017. REUTERS/Andres Martinez Casares \n \n Venezuela’s opposition is demanding general elections to end socialist rule and solutions to the OPEC nation’s brutal economic crisis. The government says its foes are seeking a violent coup with U.S. support. \n \n Earlier, a Venezuelan police officer who staged a helicopter attack on government buildings in Caracas last week appeared in an internet video vowing to continue fighting. \n \n “Once again we are in Caracas, ready and willing to continue our struggle for the liberation of our country,” police pilot Oscar Perez said in the video, wearing a military uniform and wool cap, with a Venezuelan flag and rifle behind him. \n \n Perez had not been seen since he hijacked a helicopter last week and flew through Caracas pulling a “Freedom” banner. He opened fire and dropped grenades on the Interior Ministry and Supreme Court but nobody was injured. \n \n Maduro, 54, the successor to Hugo Chavez, called that attack a terrorist assault to overthrow him and lambasted Western nations for not condemning it. \n \n But many government critics doubt the official version, and some even suggested it may have been staged to divert attention from the country’s economic and political crises. \n \n In the video, Perez said the attack was “perfectly achieved” with no collateral damage “because it was planned, because we are not murderers like you, Mr. Nicolas Maduro.” \n \n Perez said he had staged an emergency landing on the Caribbean coast following the attack, and returned to the capital after hiking through mountains. The Information Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \n \n Perez, who has portrayed himself as a James Bond-cum-Rambo figure on social media, also is an actor who starred in a 2015 movie about the rescue of a kidnapped businessman. \n \n Although he has claimed wider support within the security forces, Perez’s actions so far appear to be a rogue stunt organized by a small group of disaffected policemen. \n \n Slideshow (21 Images) \n \n Venezuela’s opposition says Maduro is seeking to consolidate control through a Constituent Assembly, a superbody that will be elected at the end of July. The opposition has promised to boycott the vote, which it says is rigged in favor of the ruling Socialist Party. \n \n Before the attack on them, opposition lawmakers held a session denouncing the president as a “dictator” and approving a plebiscite that the opposition is organizing for July 16, asking Venezuelans what they think of Maduro’s plans.""]",2,"– Pro-government militias wielding wooden sticks and metal bars stormed the congress building in Caracas on Wednesday, attacking opposition lawmakers during a special session coinciding with Venezuela's independence day.

Last year, Russia\'s Federal Guard Service decided to use more typewriters and paper documents after Edward Snowden\'s leaks of classified NSA documents. \n \n At the time, Nikolai Kovalev, the former head of the Federal Security Service, told Russian newspaper Izvestia, ""Any information can be taken from computers. ... So from the point of view of keeping secrets, the most primitive method is preferred: a human hand with a pen or a typewriter."" \n \n Follow @JolieLeeDC on Twitter \n \n Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1mebyqY', 'German politicians are considering a return to using manual typewriters for sensitive documents in the wake of the US surveillance scandal. \n \n The head of the Bundestag\'s parliamentary inquiry into NSA activity in Germany said in an interview with the Morgenmagazin TV programme that he and his colleagues were seriously thinking of ditching email completely. \n \n Asked ""Are you considering typewriters"" by the interviewer on Monday night, the Christian Democrat politican Patrick Sensburg said: ""As a matter of fact, we have – and not electronic models either"". ""Really?"" the surprised interviewer checked. ""Yes, no joke,"" Sensburg responded. \n \n ""Unlike other inquiry committees, we are investigating an ongoing situation. Intelligence activities are still going on, they are happening,"" said Sensburg. \n \n Last week, Merkel\'s government asked the CIA\'s station officer in Germany to leave the country after an employee of the German intelligence agency BND confessed to passing confidential documents to the US secret service. The ongoing investigation prompted speculation that the CIA may have actively targeted the Bundestag\'s NSA inquiry committee. \n \n Last year, the Russian government reportedly took similar measures after the extent of US electronic surveillance was revealed by the whistleblower Edward Snowden. \n \n The federal guard service, a powerful body tasked with protecting Russia\'s highest-ranking officials, put in an order for 20 Triumph Adler typewriters, which create unique ""handwriting"", that allows the source of any documents created on them to be traced. \n \n But judging by the reaction to Sensburg\'s comments, manual typewriters are unlikely to be widely adopted in German political circles. \n \n ""Before I start using typewriters and burning notes after reading, I\'d rather abolish the secret services,"" tweeted Martina Renner, an opposition member of the parliamentary committee investigating the activities of US and other intelligence agencies in Germany. Sahra Wagenknecht, Die Linke party\'s deputy chair, described the suggestion as grotesque. \n \n Christian Flisek, the SPD\'s representative on the committee, told Spiegel Online: ""This call for mechanical typewriters is making our work sound ridiculous. We live in the 21st century, where many people communicate predominantly by digital means. Effective counter-espionage works digitally too. The idea that we can protect people from surveillance by dragging them back to the typewriter is absurd."" \n \n Yet while Sensburg may regret his comments, there is little question that revelations about digital surveillance have triggered a fundamental rethink about how the German government conducts its communications. \n \n ""Above all, people are trying to stay away from technology whenever they can,"" wrote Die Welt. ""Those concerned talk less on the phone, prefer to meet in person. More coffees are being drunk and lunches eaten together. Even the walk in the park is increasingly enjoying a revival."" \n \n Last November, in the immediate aftermath of the revelations of NSA monitoring of Merkel\'s mobile phone, the German government instructed its MPs to only use encrypted mobile phones for sensitive calls. The use of iPhones for intra-governmental communications is reportedly banned. \n \n Since then, some have even questioned whether the state-of-the-art ""Secusmart"" encryption mobile currently used by the chancellor is safe from bugging attempts. \n \n The Bundestag\'s NSA inquiry committee has found its own way of protecting itself from surveillance: before every meeting, members leave their mobiles in a metal box in an adjacent room, in which any remaining snippets of conversation are drowned out by the music of Edvard Grieg played at full blast.']",2,"– The wave of the future for some German government communications could be a decidedly retro one.

""And not electronic models either."" The interviewer seemed not to expect that revelation, notes the Guardian, asking, ""Really?"" Replied Patrick Sensburg, ""Yes, no joke."" Some of Germany's politicians do see it as a joke, however. Says the SPD's representative on the committee, ""This call for mechanical typewriters is making our work sound ridiculous.

These hormones are located along the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which controls reactions to stress. \n \n The research is reported in the April 6, 2011, issue of The Journal of Neuroscience, the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience. \n \n ""We\'re calling this the Watering Hole Effect,"" says Eric Krause, PhD, a research assistant professor in the basic science division of UC\'s department of psychiatry and behavioral neuroscience and first author of the study. ""When you\'re thirsty, you have to overcome some amount of fear and anxiety to approach a communal water source. And you want to facilitate those interactions—that way everyone can get to the water source."" \n \n Krause and his team dehydrated laboratory rats by giving them sodium chloride, then exposed them to stress. Compared with a control group, the rats that received the sodium chloride secreted fewer stress hormones and also displayed a reduced cardiovascular response to stress. \n \n ""Their blood pressure and heart rate did not go up as much in response to stress as the control group\'s, and they returned to resting levels more quickly,"" says Krause. \n \n ""Also, in a social interaction paradigm with two rats interacting, we found them to be more interactive and less socially anxious."" \n \n Further research, through examination of brain and blood samples from the rats, showed that the same hormones that act on kidneys to compensate for dehydration also act on the brain to regulate responsiveness to stressors and social anxiety. \n \n The elevated sodium level, known as hypernatremia, limited stress responses by suppressing the release of the pro-stress hormone angiotensin II. Conversely, it increased the activity of oxytocin, an anti-stress hormone. \n \n Further research, Krause says, will examine these hormones and neurocircuits to investigate their role in social anxiety disorders and autism, a neurological disorder whose characteristics include social impairment. \n \n ""Oxytocin deficiency has been implicated in autism in previous studies,"" says Krause. ""We\'d like to investigate the possibility that dysregulation in fluid balance during pregnancy could result in autistic disorders."" \n \n Date: April 5, 2011 \n \n Source: University of Cincinnati Academic Health Center', 'A car dealer is taking down an oversized mannequin that had been placed atop a roadside billboard advertisement in rural Iowa after a number of alarmed drivers called the 911 emergency number to report a man who looked like he was going to jump. \n \n ""I hate to take it down, but in the interest of public safety I decided to,"" Brad Deery, owner of 10 car dealerships in Iowa, told Reuters by telephone on Friday. \n \n Deery said the sheriff in Des Moines County asked him to remove the mannequin because drivers were becoming distracted and that some could be tempted to try to climb the sign and take a selfie. \n \n The billboard on U.S. Route 61 advertises Deery\'s West Burlington dealership.

60,"['New research this week found that Tylenol altered the way subjects passed moral judgments. Psychologists used that as a proxy measure for personal distress, a relationship that has been previously demonstrated. \n \n Daniel Randles and colleagues at the University of British Columbia write in the journal Psychological Science, ""The meaning-maintenance model posits that any violation of expectations leads to an affective experience that motivates compensatory affirmation. We explore whether the neural mechanism that responds to meaning threats can be inhibited by acetaminophen."" Totally. \n \n More plainly, ""Physical pain and social rejection share a neural process and subjective component that are experienced as distress."" That neural process has been traced to the same part of the brain. They figure that if you blunt one, you blunt both. As they told LiveScience, ""When people feel overwhelmed with uncertainty in life or distressed by a lack of purpose, what they\'re feeling may actually be painful distress ... We think that Tylenol is blocking existential unease in the same way it prevents pain, because a similar neurological process is responsible for both types of distress."" \n \n In this study, Randles\'s team gave 120 people either two extra-strength Tylenol or a placebo. They then primed them by asking half to write about what happens when we die (meant to invoke or replicate existential anxiety) and the other half to write about a control, non-existential topic (going to the dentist, meant to focus people on concrete things). The rationale was that ""thinking about death is incompatible with everyday thoughts ... and that it leads to the same anxiety ... as frustrated social interactions or perceived incongruities."" \n \n Then all were asked how high they would set bond for a hypothetical person arrested for prostitution. \n \n Randles et al, Psychological Science Randles et al, Psychological Science \n \n Among people who took the placebo pill, those who wrote about existential anxiety set much higher bail ($450) than those who wrote about the dentist ($300). But if they took Tylenol and wrote existentially, that sense of moral judgment seemed to be blunted. They set the same bond regardless of the priming. \n \n Then in a similar, separate experiment, they primed the subjects by having them watch video clips. They either watched The Simpsons or a film by surrealistic neonoir writer/director David Lynch, in which humans with rabbit heads wander an urban apartment muttering non sequiturs. They then passed judgment on people arrested in a hockey riot. Again, the people in the existential mindset imposed harsh sanctions, but the people who\'d watched The Simpsons were lenient. If they\'d taken Tylenol first, though, the David Lynch-induced anxiety was apparently blunted. They recommended the same sanctions as the Simpsons-primed group.', 'Abstract \n \n Acetaminophen has recently been recognized as having impacts that extend into the affective domain. In particular, double blind placebo controlled trials have revealed that acetaminophen reduces the magnitude of reactivity to social rejection, frustration, dissonance and to both negatively and positively valenced attitude objects. Given this diversity of consequences, it has been proposed that the psychological effects of acetaminophen may reflect a widespread blunting of evaluative processing. We tested this hypothesis using event-related potentials (ERPs). Sixty-two participants received acetaminophen or a placebo in a double-blind protocol and completed the Go/NoGo task. Participants’ ERPs were observed following errors on the Go/NoGo task, in particular the error-related negativity (ERN; measured at FCz) and error-related positivity (Pe; measured at Pz and CPz). Results show that acetaminophen inhibits the Pe, but not the ERN, and the magnitude of an individual’s Pe correlates positively with omission errors, partially mediating the effects of acetaminophen on the error rate. These results suggest that recently documented affective blunting caused by acetaminophen may best be described as an inhibition of evaluative processing. They also contribute to the growing work suggesting that the Pe is more strongly associated with conscious awareness of errors relative to the ERN.', 'TORONTO, April 8 (UPI) -- Acetaminophen, commonly sold as Tylenol, is thought to treat everything from fever to headache with few or no side effects, but a recent study suggests the drug could prevent people from spotting errors. \n \n Researchers at the University of Toronto found people are less reactive to uncertain situations when they\'ve taken normally recommended doses of the drug. \n \n Acetaminophen is used by a lot of people without prescription, and the recent study showed people did not perceive any cognitive difference while on the drug, but that doesn\'t mean it isn\'t there. \n \n While recent research has only begun to show how acetaminophen stops pain, some behavioral studies have shown slight cognitive impairments when on the drug. Researches involved with the new study conducted previous research that found slower reactions among participants using acetaminophen. \n \n ""An obvious question is if people aren\'t detecting these errors, are they also making errors more often when taking acetaminophen?"" Dan Randles, a researcher at the University of Toronto, said in a press release. ""This is the first study to address this question, so we need more work and ideally with tasks more closely related to normal daily behavior."" \n \n For the study, published in the journal Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience, researchers recruited 62 people for a double-blind, randomized study with half the participants receiving 1,000 milligrams of acetaminophen, the normal maximum dose, and the rest given a placebo. \n \n The participants were then hooked up to an electroencephalogram and given a target-detection task called Go or No Go, hitting a button when an ""F"" appeared on a screen but not hitting the button if an ""E"" appeared on the screen. \n \n In addition to hitting the button more often when an ""E"" appeared, the group given acetaminophen also missed more ""F"" screens than the placebo group -- suggesting the drug has an effect on the mind beyond simply killing pain. \n \n ""It looks like acetaminophen makes it harder to recognize an error, which may have implications for cognitive control in daily life,"" Randles said.', 'According to the source who spoke to The Times, however, the league has informed current officials that seven men and one woman have been selected as new hires for this season, contingent on them taking physical examinations.', 'People who live in a Stuart neighborhood say their neighbor does yard work and walks around his property naked.

But a new University of Toronto study finds that the painkiller's active ingredient, acetaminophen, may also put a damper on your ability to notice errors, Science Daily reports. ""The core idea of our study is that we don't fully understand how acetaminophen affects the brain,"" researcher Dan Randles says. To get a clearer picture, the team put together two teams of 30 participants each and had them play ""Go or No Go,"" in which they hit a Go button when the letter F flashed on a screen and do nothing when the letter E appeared. The subjects, half of whom had taken 1,000mg of acetaminophen, were hooked up to an EEG to measure brain activity. The group that had taken the equivalent of a normal maximum dose of the painkiller hit the Go button more often when E flashed on the screen, according to UPI. Also, they failed to push the button when the F appeared more often than those on the placebo group. ""It looks like acetaminophen makes it harder to recognize an error,"" Randles says. Next on the agenda for the researchers: to study whether acetaminophen causes people to ""mind wander,"" and to answer the question of whether the drug, in addition to inhibiting the ability to detect errors, also contributes to people making more mistakes. Past research has suggested that acetaminophen may reduce the pain of social rejection, ""sort of like alcohol or Xanax,"" the Atlantic reported in 2013. Another study shows that the drug alters the way people pass moral judgment. (Acetaminophen isn't addictive, but these drugs are.)"

Mitchell, will take part in the next meeting, likely to be in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el Sheik. \n \n Mrs. Clinton, in formally reopening the negotiations at the State Department on Thursday morning, acknowledged, “We’ve been here before, and we know how difficult the road ahead will be.” But she expressed confidence that the core disputes separating the two sides could be resolved within a year. \n \n Analysts said they were encouraged by the goal of a “framework agreement,” which could be a practical vehicle for both sides to resolve vexing “final status” issues: borders, security, the political status of Jerusalem, settlements and the rights of Palestinian refugees. \n \n “They’ve set for themselves an achievable objective in a one-year time frame,” said Martin S. Indyk, a former American ambassador to Israel and Middle East peace negotiator. “A comprehensive agreement would have been unrealistic with that kind of timetable.” \n \n Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Abbas met alone for 90 minutes in Mrs. Clinton’s office and emerged smiling, officials said. After two years without a face-to-face meeting, the two spent some time breaking the ice. \n \n Mr. Abbas brought Mr. Netanyahu up to date on how far he had gotten in his talks with former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert of Israel. Palestinian negotiators are hoping to use the concessions Mr. Olmert made — which have never been publicly acknowledged by Israel — as a basis from which to start these negotiations. But Mr. Netanyahu has so far balked at that. \n \n “The climate, and atmosphere, was positive and serious and down to business,” said Nabil Shaath, foreign relations commissioner of Mr. Abbas’s Fatah Party, who is negotiating for the Palestinians. \n \n “But the cloud is still there,” he added. “The Israelis gave absolutely no hopeful signs that they will continue the moratorium. And in our point of view, that is the litmus test for the Israelis.” \n \n On Wednesday, officials said, President Obama spoke bluntly to Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Abbas at the White House, urging them not to allow the impasse to scotch the talks. But Mr. Netanyahu has not offered any hint of a compromise, and analysts say he is hemmed in by his right-leaning coalition, which could splinter if he simply extended the moratorium. \n \n The more likely outcome, officials said, is a compromise in which Israel would agree to limit settlements, but exempt West Bank areas that are certain to remain part of Israel under a peace deal. It could also offer a limited extension, based on agreeing on the borders of a Palestinian state. \n \n Israeli officials declined to discuss the issue of settlements but said the overall tenor of the talks was “good and constructive.” Citing the killings of four Israeli settlers in the West Bank this week, Mr. Netanyahu said security would have to be a critical theme of the talks. He said that the rise of Iran, and its support of militant groups, had radically altered the landscape for peace talks. \n \n “There is a commitment on our part to address all issues,” said Jonathan Peled, the spokesman for the Israeli Embassy in Washington. “A lot will depend on addressing Israel’s security concerns, and whether the Palestinian leadership is willing to make historic compromises.” \n \n It was a day of self-conscious history-making at the State Department. Just before 10 a.m., the Palestinian delegation entered the ornate Benjamin Franklin Room. Twenty minutes later, the Israelis entered, taking their seats and gazing at the Palestinians across a rose-colored carpet. \n \n “I fervently believe that the two men sitting on either side of me, that you are the leaders who can make this long-cherished dream a reality,” Mrs. Clinton said, gesturing to Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Abbas. \n \n Mrs. Clinton paid tribute to the diplomats in the room, several of whom she noted were veterans of the process. Watching from behind was Dennis B. Ross, a senior White House adviser on the Middle East who helped run the Camp David negotiation for Mrs. Clinton’s husband, President Bill Clinton, in 2000. Also at the table were seasoned negotiators like Mr. Netanyahu’s key adviser on the process, Yitzhak Molcho, and Mr. Abbas’s chief negotiator, Saeb Erekat. \n \n “The people sitting here have worked very hard for many years,” she said. “Now it’s time to get to work.” \n \n But Mrs. Clinton also repeated the oblique criticism of Arab states voiced by Mr. Obama on Wednesday. “We hear often from those voices in the region who insist this is a top priority and yet do very little to support the work that would actually bring about a Palestinian state,” she said. \n \n Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf states have been slow to deliver promised financial aid to the Palestinian Authority, officials close to Mr. Abbas said, and the authority faces an increasingly dire shortfall. \n \n Mrs. Clinton also addressed the people of the Middle East directly. “Your leaders may be sitting at the negotiating table,” she said, “but you are ultimately the ones who will ultimately decide the future.” Mrs. Clinton asked Israelis and Palestinians for their “support and patience” in the process. \n \n On Friday morning, she is to give an unusual joint interview to Israeli and Palestinian television channels, part of what will be an aggressive strategy to sell the peace process at home and abroad.', 'STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: \n \n Prototypes of President Trump\'s proposed border wall are going up near San Diego. Each prototype is a little different. You can see the photos. One is a 30-foot-high slab of concrete and steel, another is a 30-foot-high slab of steel and concrete. Eight variations are all meant to pave the way for a wall that Congress has yet to fund. NPR\'s John Burnett is here for an architecture review. Hi, John. \n \n JOHN BURNETT, BYLINE: Hi, Steve. \n \n INSKEEP: So what\'s it like when you go down to the border and actually get a look at these things? \n \n BURNETT: It\'s quite a scene. The Border Patrol has created this media bullpen at the edge of the construction site. And they\'ve been shuttling in journalists from around the U.S. and around the world from as far away as Japan and Germany to see the great U.S.-Mexico border wall. You put on these fluorescent vests and hardhats and watch cranes lifting huge sections of sand-colored walls into place. They\'re massive, as you said - as tall as a three-story building. \n \n INSKEEP: Well, the president had talked about innovative designs. At one point, he said maybe it should have solar panels, different ways to stop people from crossing the border. Did you see any innovations? \n \n BURNETT: Nothing particularly artistic or high tech about these walls. One has elaborate spikes on top of it in case an illegal crosser has a really tall ladder. \n \n INSKEEP: OK, well, I know you\'ve spent time on both sides of the (laughter) border. Let\'s hear what people down there told you about it. \n \n EDUARDO OLMOS: We\'re actually at the prototype site, San Diego sector, where eight of the prototypes are being built. \n \n BURNETT: That\'s Border Patrol Agent Eduardo Olmos of the San Diego sector. \n \n OLMOS: Once these are built, they\'re going to be evaluated for different characteristics like anti-climbing, anti-breaching, anti-scaling, anti-digging, anti-tunneling. Also, they have to be aesthetically pleasing. \n \n BURNETT: The prototypes have all the appeal of blast walls. Some models are solid reinforced concrete. Others incorporate vertical steel posts. On the U.S. side, no one is allowed anywhere near the wall prototypes because of security precautions. To see what people think about them, I crossed the border at the Otay Mesa port of entry and worked my way over to the Los Torres neighborhood of Tijuana. There\'s a ramshackle recycling business here in Mexico that looks directly onto the soaring concrete slabs. \n \n Jose Avila Rodriguez is pulling wires out of the dashboard of a wrecked truck. \n \n JOSE AVILA RODRIGUEZ: (Speaking Spanish). \n \n BURNETT: ""From the size of the wall they\'re building, they don\'t even want the wind to blow from there to over here,"" he says ruefully. His granddaughter Melanie plays with puppies in the dusty street. Her grandmother Juana fills a bag with plastic bottles and considers Trump\'s border wall. \n \n JUANA: (Speaking Spanish). \n \n BURNETT: ""I don\'t think the new wall will deter people,"" she says. ""How many years have they been crossing to the other side?"" Border Patrol officials in San Diego say they need some kind of new obstacle. Illegal crossers have cut 1,700 holes in the existing steel mesh fencing in the past three years. Just in the past three weeks, a half-dozen Mexican men have been nabbed in the construction zone while the prototypes were going up. Roy Villareal is the chief patrol agent here. \n \n ROY VILLAREAL: What we want is something that is better, that is, again, impenetrable, unscalable and not capable of being dug under very quickly. \n \n BURNETT: Six construction companies that won a nationwide competition to design and build the prototypes have until the end of this month to finish the eight mockups. I asked Villareal after his agency selects its favorite designs, does he believe these giant barriers will actually go up along the 2,000-mile frontier? He doesn\'t want to be pinned down. \n \n VILLAREAL: These prototypes are going to influence the next evolution of our border infrastructure. So it very well may not be what you witness this morning. \n \n BURNETT: Border Patrol officials are not waiting for a new wall design. The chief in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas told me he\'s planning to build 60 new miles of barriers, if Congress funds it, but he\'ll use what\'s there now - rust-colored steel columns that rise no higher than 18 feet. The administration has asked Congress for $1.6 billion for the first segments of the president\'s border wall. \n \n But it faces a number of obstacles. It\'s opposed by congressional Democrats as well as most of California\'s and San Diego\'s leadership. And lawmakers in Washington are being hit with billions in unforeseen spending for hurricane damages from Texas to Puerto Rico. Doris Meissner, a former immigration commissioner and now a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute, thinks prospects for funding the wall look dim. \n \n DORIS MEISSNER: The real issue with building a wall is what the Congress does, not what the contractors do. And the price tag on this is enormous. \n \n BURNETT: The Border Patrol expected the prototypes to spark big protests. But since construction began, there have been no demonstrations. \n \n CHRISTIAN RAMIREZ: We knew that this was political theater and that we weren\'t going to respond. This is much ado about nothing. \n \n BURNETT: That\'s Christian Ramirez, director of the Southern Border Communities Coalition in San Diego, which has organized local rallies against Trump\'s immigration policies but not this time. \n \n INSKEEP: So what are they doing instead, John Burnett? \n \n BURNETT: Well, Ramirez thinks the real fight is in Washington. And that\'s where Congress will decide what to do about funding the border wall and what to do about the nearly 800,000 dreamers, the immigrants who were brought into this country illegally as children. \n \n INSKEEP: OK. I guess we should mention that while activists have been relatively quiet, they think it\'s much ado about nothing, President Trump seems kind of excited. \n \n BURNETT: Exactly. On Tuesday, the president tweeted a picture of those massive barriers with the message border wall prototypes underway. \n \n INSKEEP: OK. That\'s NPR\'s John Burnett in Texas. John, thanks as always. \n \n BURNETT: You bet, Steve. \n \n Copyright © 2017 NPR. All rights reserved.

She therefore cannot officially hold the First Lady title, but her dedication to pursuing her own career after her partner takes control on May 15 as the first French Socialist Prime Minister in nearly two decades suggests that she’s not the kind to mind. \n \n (MORE: After Winning the French Presidency, What Will François Hollande Do Next) \n \n A twice-divorced mother of three, Trierweiler reportedly began her relationship with Hollande in 2005, despite claims that Hollande and former Socialist presidential candidate Ségolène Royal, who had been together for 30 years, were still a couple during the 2007 French election campaign. Hollande and his new partner only went public in 2010. \n \n Ever hungry to dissect female public figures, media commentators have already begun branding Trierweiler as “chic” and “classic” and remarking upon her sartorial choices. Even Reuters has fallen for her appearance, fawning over her “look reminiscent of late Hollywood actress Katharine Hepburn.” In fact, rather than focusing on her own image, it is claimed that Trierweiler played a key role in transforming her erstwhile bland boyfriend into a serious contender for the French presidential position, supposedly helping him lose 10 kg and instructing him to wear glasses with thinner frames. \n \n (MORE: Who Is François Hollande?

Hollande’s campaign staff members apparently were careful never to disturb him if the words mon amour flashed up on his phone, knowing that it meant Trierweiler was calling and that he would be listening attentively. \n \n It seems that despite conveying a public persona almost diametrically opposed to the glamorous, camera-friendly Bruni, the engagingly independent Trierweiler will capture just as much attention from the press and public.

REUTERS/Stefan Wermuth \n \n The scheme is part of a larger initiative by the privately owned U.S. food company to encourage healthier eating at a time when large food multinationals, or Big Food, are coming under increasing pressure from public health advocates and regulators struggling to fight a growing obesity epidemic. \n \n The plan, however, does not extend to Mars’ chocolate or sweets businesses, whose brands include M&M;’s, Snickers and Starburst. \n \n Products that are particularly high in salt, sugar or fat, including Dolmio lasagne meal kits and lasagne sauces, will come with a label advising “occasional” consumption, meaning once a week. Products with lower levels of salt, sugar or fat will be considered “everyday” products. \n \n The company said most of its products in the UK would fall into the latter category. However, only 70 percent of its tomato sauces sold in jars already meet that standard. \n \n It did not give details for other countries but plans to introduce the labeling in all markets where those products are sold. \n \n Nearly all packaged food makers are reformulating products as they try to keep up with changing tastes of increasingly health-conscious consumers. \n \n Mars Food, which also produces Uncle Ben’s rice, said it plans to post on its website within the next few months a list of “occasional” products, and “everyday” products, including ones to be reformulated over the next five years to reduce sodium, sugar or fat. \n \n It has also set targets to reduce sodium across its global product range by an average of 20 percent by 2021, and cut the amount of added sugar in a limited number of sauces and light meals by 2018. \n \n It also plans to boost the use of whole grains and vegetables. \n \n Some countries including Britain, France and Mexico have announced levies on sugar-sweetened drinks, while others are considering them.', 'The bottom line: Americans are pulling together, every day, to help one another; there are medical advances that will help millions, and not even D.C. is that bad all the time.

At least 40 US groups have collected more than $200 million in tax-exempt donations to use specifically for Israeli settlements.

66,"['A state judge on Monday ordered paint companies to pay 10 California cities and counties $1.1 billion to remove lead from millions of older homes. \n \n Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge James Kleinberg found that Conagra Grocery Products Co., NL Industries Inc. and the Sherwin-Williams Co. marketed paint they knew was harmful to children. Atlantic Richfield Co. and DuPont Co. were found not liable. \n \n The industry has faced similar lawsuits across the country but has won most of them. \n \n Kleinberg\'s verdict came after a five-week trial without a jury. The companies have 15 days to object to the tentative ruling, which the judge can alter. \n \n ""There is a clear and present danger that needs to be addressed,"" Kleinberg wrote in his 110-page decision. ""The defendants sold lead paint with actual and constructive knowledge that it was harmful."" \n \n Lead-based paints were barred from the U.S. market in 1978, but millions of homes painted before then still pose a health risk. \n \n The industry argued that it never deliberately sold a harmful product and that the old paint is no longer a significant public health risk. The companies argued that children diagnosed with lead poisoning could have gotten sick from sources other than paint. \n \n ""The existence of other sources of lead exposure has no bearing on whether lead paint constitutes a public nuisance,"" Kleinberg wrote in today\'s opinion. ""It does not change the fact that lead paint is the primary source of lead poisoning for children in the jurisdictions who live in pre-1978 housing."" \n \n Bonnie Campbell, a spokeswoman for the companies, said the paint manufacturers will urge the judge to overturn his decision. Failing that, she said the companies will seek a mistrial. If the judge upholds his verdict, Campbell said the companies will appeal. \n \n Campbell said the verdict unfairly penalizes companies for marketing lead-based paint in good faith before the health risks were known. She said the current owners of pre-1978 painted homes should be responsible for removing the lead. \n \n ""The decision rewards scofflaw landlords who are responsible for the risk to children from poorly maintained lead paint, and it conflicts with and threatens to upend California\'s lead poisoning prevention programs, which work,"" Campbell said. ""This decision is more likely to hurt children than help them, and it will likely disrupt the sale, rental, and market value of all homes and apartments built before 1978."" \n \n ConAgra Foods also issued a separate statement in response to the verdict. \n \n ""We vehemently disagree with the decision and will appeal. We are absolutely not an appropriate defendant,"" said spokeswoman Lane Friedman. ""ConAgra Foods was never even in the paint business. As a food maker who employs thousands of people in California, we believe this case is an unfortunate example of extreme overreach."" \n \n Exposure to lead is linked to learning disabilities and other health problems, especially in children. Some 60,000 children under the age of 6 suffered from lead poisoning between 2007 and 2010 alone in the jurisdictions who filed the lawsuit, the judge noted. \n \n Data from the 2010 census show that close to 5 million homes at issue in the lawsuit were built before lead paint was banned in 1978. Homes built before then are presumed to have been painted with lead paint. \n \n The case has taken 13 years to reach trial because of objections from the industry, but appeals courts have allowed it to proceed. It alleges the manufacturers knew of lead-paint dangers starting in the 1890s but still sold it to consumers without health warnings. \n \n The 10 cities and counties awarded damages Monday are the counties of Santa Clara, Alameda, Los Angeles, Monterey, San Mateo, Solano and Ventura, and the cities of Oakland, San Diego and San Francisco.', ""A Northern California judge Monday ordered three companies to pay $1.1 billion to remove lead-based paint from inside California homes, concluding a 13-year legal case. \n \n Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge James P. Kleinberg ruled that ConAgra, NL Industries and Sherwin-Williams created a “public nuisance” by selling lead-based paint for decades before it was banned in 1978, finding them liable for exposing children to a known poison. \n \n The opinion set aside $605 million, or 55% of the judgment, to pay for lead removal in Los Angeles County. The money will go into a fund administered by the state’s Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Branch and will pay for inspections and lead abatement on the inside walls of tens of thousands of homes. \n \n “The court is convinced there are thousands of California children in the Jurisdictions whose lives can be improved, if not saved through a lead abatement plan,” the judge’s ruling said. \n \n Local governments sued major paint manufacturers in 2000, alleging they promoted the use of lead-based paint even though its dangers had been known for many decades. Ten California cities and counties joined the case seeking to hold country’s largest paint companies accountable. The case went to trial in July. \n \n The companies, however, argued that they never deliberately sold a hazardous product and relied on experts that did not determine the levels of lead in their paints were a public health problem until they were taken off the market in the 1970s. \n \n Lead is a powerful poison that is particularly harmful to the development of young children, even at low levels. The government’s case stressed that lead paint is widely considered to be the main cause of lead poisoning for children who live in older housing. \n \n Nearly 5 million homes in the cities and counties that sued were built before the 1978 ban and could require abatement. Many are in low-income neighborhoods. \n \n “The people who are affected are largely poor and minority children who live in old homes that haven’t been repaired,” said Joseph Cotchett, an attorney who represented the cities and counties who backed the lawsuit. \n \n The ruling did not hold responsible two of the companies that were sued: Atlantic Richfield and DuPont. \n \n ALSO: \n \n 817 guns collected at L.A.'s latest buyback event, officials say \n \n Big Sur wildfire grows to 500 acres; fire chief's home destroyed \n \n \n \n Twitter: @tonybarboza \n \n tony.barboza@latimes.com""]",2,"– A long-running California lawsuit has concluded with three paint companies being ordered to pay $1.1 billion to remove lead paint in 10 cities and counties. The judge ruled that the companies had created a ""public nuisance"" by selling the toxic paint for decades before it was banned in 1978, the Los Angeles Times reports. Some 5 million homes in the cities and counties that sued, mainly in low-income neighborhoods, may still contain enough lead paint to pose a health risk. Childhood exposure to lead has been linked to learning disabilities, other health problems, and even adult criminality. But the paint companies say they sold the lead paint in good faith before the ban and have vowed to fight the ruling, the AP reports. ""The decision rewards scofflaw landlords who are responsible for the risk to children from poorly maintained lead paint, and it conflicts with and threatens to upend California's lead poisoning prevention programs, which work,"" a spokeswoman for the companies says. ""This decision is more likely to hurt children than help them, and it will likely disrupt the sale, rental, and market value of all homes and apartments built before 1978."""
67,"['More than forty years after the first initiatives were taken to ban the use of PCBs, the chemical pollutants remain a deadly threat to animals at the top of the food chain. A new study, just published in the journal Science, shows that the current concentrations of PCBs can lead to the disappearance of half of the world\'s populations of killer whales from the most heavily contaminated areas within a period of just 30-50 years. \n \n Killer whales (Orcinus orca) form the last link in a long food chain and are among the mammals with the highest level of PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) in their tissue. Researchers have measured values as high as 1300 milligrams per kilo in the fatty tissue (blubber) of killer whales. For comparison, a large number of studies show that animals with PCB levels as low as 50 milligrams per kilo of tissue may show signs of infertility and severe impacts on the immune system. \n \n Together with colleagues from a wide range of international universities and research institutions, researchers from Aarhus University have documented that the number of killer whales is rapidly declining in 10 out of the 19 killer whale populations investigated and that the species may disappear entirely from several areas within a few decades. \n \n Killer whales are particularly threatened in heavily contaminated areas like the waters near Brazil, the Strait of Gibraltar and around the UK. Around the British Isles, the researchers estimate that the remaining population counts less than 10 killer whales. Also along the east coast of Greenland, killer whales are effected due to the high consumption of sea mammals like seals. \n \n PCBs accumulate in the food chain \n \n The killer whale is one of the most widespread mammals on Earth and is found in all of the world\'s oceans from pole to pole. But today, only the populations living in the least polluted areas possess a large number of individuals. \n \n Overfishing and man-made noise may also affect the health of the animals, but PCBs particularly can have a dramatic effect on the reproduction and immune system of the killer whales. \n \n Killer whales whose diet includes, among other items, seals and large fish such as tuna and sharks critical accumulate PCBs and other pollutants stored at successive levels of the food chain. It is these populations of killer whales that have the highest PCB concentrations and it is these populations that are at the highest risk of population collapse. Killer whales that primarily feed on small-sized fish such as herring and mackerel have a significantly lower content of PCBs and are thus at lower risk of effects. \n \n PCBs have been used around the world since the 1930s. More than one million tonnes of PCBs were produced and used in, among other things, electrical components and plastics. Together with DDT and other organic pesticides -- PCBs have spread around the global oceans. \n \n Through the 1970s and 1980s, PCBs were banned in several countries and in 2004, through the Stockholm Convention, more than 90 countries have committed themselves to phase out and dispose of the large stocks of PCBs. \n \n PCBs are only slowly decomposed in the environment. Moreover, PCBs are passed down from the mother orca to its offspring through the mother\'s fat-rich milk. This means that the hazardous substances remain in the bodies of the animals, instead of being released into the environment where they eventually deposit or degrade. \n \n Global investigation of killer whales \n \n ""We know that PCBs deform the reproductive organs of animals such as polar bears. It was therefore only natural to examine the impact of PCBs on the scarce populations of killer whales around the world,"" says Professor Rune Dietz from the Department of Bioscience and Arctic Research Centre, Aarhus University, who initiated the killer whale studies and is co-author of the article. \n \n The research group, which includes participants from the United States, Canada, England, Greenland, Iceland and Denmark, reviewed all the existing literature and compared all data with their own most recent results. This provided information about PCB levels in more than 350 individual killer whales around the globe -- the largest number of killer whales ever studied. \n \n Applying models, the researchers then predicted the effects of PCBs on the number of offspring as well as on the immune system and mortality of the killer whale over a period of 100 years. \n \n More than 50% of the populations under threat \n \n ""The findings are surprising. We see that over half of the studied killer whales populations around the globe are severely affected by PCBs"" says postdoc Jean-Pierre Desforges from Aarhus University, who led the investigations. \n \n The effects result in fewer and fewer animals over time in these populations. The situation is worst in the oceans around Brazil, the Strait of Gibraltar, the northeast Pacific and around the UK. Here, the models show that the populations have virtually been halved during the half century where PCBs have been present. \n \n ""In these areas, we rarely observe newborn killer whales,"" says Ailsa Hall, who together with Bernie McConnell developed the models used by Sea Mammal Research Unit in Scotland. \n \n ""As the effects have been recognized for more than 50 years, it is frightening to see that the models predict a high risk of population collapse in these areas within a period of 30-40 years,"" says Jean-Pierre Desforges. \n \n A female killer whale may live for 60-70 years, and although the world took its first steps to phase out PCBs more than 40 years ago, killer whales still have high levels of PCBs in their bodies. \n \n ""This suggests that the efforts have not been effective enough to avoid the accumulation of PCBs in high trophic level species that live as long as the killer whale does. There is therefore an urgent need for further initiatives than those under the Stockholm Convention,"" concludes Paul D. Jepson, Institute of Zoology, Zoological Society of London, England, who is another killer whale expert and co-author of the article. \n \n In the oceans around the Faroe Islands, Iceland, Norway, Alaska and the Antarctic, the prospects are not so gloomy. Here, killer whale populations grow and the models predict that they will continue to do so throughout the next century.', 'At least half of the world’s killer whale populations are doomed to extinction due to toxic and persistent pollution of the oceans, according to a major new study. \n \n Although the poisonous chemicals, PCBs, have been banned for decades, they are still leaking into the seas. They become concentrated up the food chain; as a result, killer whales, the top predators, are the most contaminated animals on the planet. Worse, their fat-rich milk passes on very high doses to their newborn calves. \n \n PCB concentrations found in killer whales can be 100 times safe levels and severely damage reproductive organs, cause cancer and damage the immune system. The new research analysed the prospects for killer whale populations over the next century and found those offshore from industrialised nations could vanish as soon as 30-50 years. \n \n Among those most at risk are the UK’s last pod, where a recent death revealed one of the highest PCB levels ever recorded. Others off Gibraltar, Japan and Brazil and in the north-east Pacific are also in great danger. Killer whales are one of the most widespread mammals on earth but have already been lost in the North Sea, around Spain and many other places. \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest Killer whales hunting seals off the coast of northern Norway. Photograph: Audun Rikardsen/Science \n \n “It is like a killer whale apocalypse,” said Paul Jepson at the Zoological Society of London, part of the international research team behind the new study. “Even in a pristine condition they are very slow to reproduce.” Healthy killer whales take 20 years to reach peak sexual maturity and 18 months to gestate a calf. \n \n PCBs were used around the world since the 1930s in electrical components, plastics and paints but their toxicity has been known for 50 years. They were banned by nations in the 1970s and 1980s but 80% of the 1m tonnes produced have yet to be destroyed and are still leaking into the seas from landfills and other sources. \n \n The international Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants came into force in 2004 to tackle the issue, but Jepson said the clean-up is way behind schedule. “I think the Stockholm Convention is failing,” he said. “The only area where I am optimistic is the US. They alone produced 50% of all PCBs, but they have been getting PCB levels down consistently for decades. All we have done in Europe is ban them and then hope they go away.” \n \n The researchers said PCBs are just one pollutant found in killer whales, with “a long list of additional known and as yet unmeasured contaminants present”. Further problems for killer whales include the loss of key prey species such as tuna and sharks to overfishing and also growing underwater noise pollution. \n \n The new research, published in the journal Science, examined PCB contamination in 351 killer whales, the largest analysis yet. The scientists then took existing data on how PCBs affect calf survival and immune systems in whales and used this to model how populations will fare in the future. “Populations of Japan, Brazil, Northeast Pacific, Strait of Gibraltar, and the United Kingdom are all tending toward complete collapse,” they concluded. \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest Underwater close-up of a killer whale off the coast of northern Norway. Photograph: Audun Rikardsen/Science \n \n Lucy Babey, deputy director at conservation group Orca, said: “Our abysmal failures to control chemical pollution ending up in our oceans has caused a killer whale catastrophe on an epic scale. It is essential that requirements to dispose safely of PCBs under the Stockholm Convention are made legally binding at the next meeting in May 2019 to help stop this scandal.” Scientists have previously found “extraordinary” levels of toxic pollution even in the 10km-deep Mariana trench in the Pacific Ocean. \n \n Mariana trench live feed: engrossing viewing from deepest place on Earth Read more \n \n “This new study is a global red alert on the state of our oceans,” said Jennifer Lonsdale, chair of the Wildlife and Countryside Link’s whales group. “If the UK government wants its [proposed] Environment Act to be world-leading, it must set ambitious targets on PCB disposal and protect against further chemical pollution of our waters.” \n \n The research shows that killer whale populations in the high north, off Norway, Iceland, Canada and the Faroes, are far less contaminated due to their distance from major PCB sources. ”The only thing that gives me hope about killer whales in the longer term is, yes, we are going to lose populations all over the industrialised areas, but there are populations that are doing reasonably well in the Arctic,” said Jepson. \n \n If a global clean-up, which would take decades, can be achieved, these populations could eventually repopulate empty regions, he said, noting that killer whales are very intelligent, have strong family bonds and hunt in packs. “It is an incredibly adaptive species – they have been able to [live] from the Arctic to the Antarctic and everywhere in between.” \n \n He praised the billion-dollar “superfund” clean-ups in the US, such as in the Hudson River and Puget Sound, where the polluter has paid most of the costs: “The US is going way beyond the Stockholm Convention because they know how toxic PCBs are.”', 'Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Pollution threatens future of killer whales \n \n Killer whales are in deep trouble because of persistent chemical pollution in the environment, researchers say. \n \n A new study suggests the long-term viability of more than half of the different orca groups around the globe is now in question. \n \n Some populations, such as those around the UK, the Strait of Gibraltar, off Brazil, Japan and California, are almost certainly doomed. \n \n The assessment is in Science magazine. \n \n The issue is polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs. \n \n These chemical compounds were once manufactured in vast quantities, and used in everything from plastics and paints to electrical equipment and sealants. But they are highly toxic and although banned decades ago have amassed in the environment, leaching into the ocean. \n \n Killer whales, or orcas, are top predators so they absorb all the PCB pollution taken in by the different prey in their food chain - from fish, right up to seals and sharks. \n \n The PCBs stunt the ovaries of female orcas, limiting their ability to produce calves. The chemicals also suppress the immune system. \n \n What is the outlook for orcas? \n \n The new study models the future of the killer whales\' reproductive success and survivability against the chemical challenge. \n \n For those populations living in clean waters, it is positive. Orcas in places like the Antarctic and the Arctic should increase their numbers. \n \n But for those living in the most polluted seas, the next 30-50 years will be grim. \n \n The killer whales that live on the west coast of Scotland, for example, are now down to just eight individuals and they have not produced a calf in more than 20 years. \n \n Paul Jepson, from the Zoological Society of London, says this group will ""disappear in my lifetime"". \n \n ""Over 50% of the populations that we\'ve got data for will actually collapse in our model,"" he told the BBC\'s Science In Action programme. \n \n ""PCBs are such highly toxic chemicals, and they persist in the environment.

This puts very precise pressure on a population. \n \n In addition, PCBs are soluble in fat - and killer whales are extremely fat-rich animals. A mother\'s milk will be loaded with PCBs which she will pass on to her offspring during lactation. \n \n Image copyright Audun Rikardsen \n \n How do we tackle the PCB legacy? \n \n Most PCBs have yet to be destroyed or safely stored away. \n \n Some countries have done better than others. In the US, where federal ""superfunds"" have been used to clean up the most heavily contaminated sites, PCB levels entering the ocean have come down. \n \n But there needs to be much more urgency in places such as Europe. \n \n ""Improper disposal of PCB-containing equipment in landfills may lead to leakage and leaching of PCBs into nearby streams, river, estuaries, and ocean,"" said lead author on the new report, Jean-Pierre Desforges from Aarhus University, Denmark. \n \n ""We know that PCBs were used in paints and sealants in old buildings and for outer coating on ships, so if contaminated building materials are improperly disposed of they could also reach the environment, and demolition of buildings may cause PCBs to enter the air."" \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Paul Jepson: ""The killer whale is the most PCB-contaminated species on Earth"" \n \n Can we help the orcas themselves? \n \n There is very little that can be done to recover the PCBs once they have reached the ocean. And the robustness of the chemicals means they will hang around in the environment for a very long time. \n \n But there are parallel problems we could conceivably fix, said co-author Ailsa Hall from the Sea Mammal Research Unit at St Andrews University, UK. \n \n ""We should recognise that this is just one of many stresses on the animals,"" she told BBC News. \n \n ""There are things such as noise, changes in habitat, changes in the availability of prey - that we do have influence over.

Claudia Marcelloni/CERN \n \n For now, physicists are only willing to call them \'excess events\', but fresh data from two experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) are hinting at something unusual — and it could be the most sought-after particle in all of physics. \n \n Both ATLAS and the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiments are seeing an unusual surplus of events in a rough mass range of 130–150 gigaelectronvolts (energy and mass are used interchangeably in particle physics). The data are far from conclusive, but physicists believe this could be the first indication of the Higgs particle, believed to be responsible for the masses of other particles. The results were presented this afternoon at the Europhysics Conference on High Energy Physics in Grenoble, France. \n \n Physicists familiar with the experiments urge caution. The new data are a long way from a discovery, says Matthew Strassler, a theoretical physicist at Rutgers University in New Jersey. ""I would call it tantalizing."" \n \n The hunt for Higgs \n \n Since its prediction in 1964, the Higgs has been the most wanted particle in all of physics. The particle is part of the mechanism that endows all other particles with mass. The standard model of particle physics, which has been verified to astonishing accuracy, also requires a Higgs (or something like it) to unify the weak nuclear force, which regulates nuclear decays, and the electromagnetic force, which governs electricity, magnetism and light. \n \n To track down the Higgs, high-energy physicists have built the LHC — a 27-kilometre ring housed at CERN, the European particle-physics laboratory near Geneva, that accelerates protons to near the speed of light and then smashes them together. The collisions can briefly create heavier particles. Those heavier particles then decay into a cascade of lighter particles that are picked up by building-sized detectors. \n \n The two largest detectors, ATLAS and CMS, are now reporting excess numbers of lighter particles in the range of 130–150 GeV. That is smack in the middle of the range in which some physicists believe the Higgs particle might exist. \n \n The statistics are far from conclusive, and the signal could yet disappear. ""We really need to be very prudent; we really need to be systematic,"" says Guido Tonelli, the spokesperson for the CMS experiment. In the coming months, Tonelli says that CMS will focus its efforts on probing the unusual bump. \n \n ""I think that we have to be extremely careful,"" agrees Fabiola Gianotti, spokesperson for the ATLAS detector. Gianotti says that these low-energy excesses, and a few others seen at higher energies, could yet disappear when more data are collected. \n \n Much of the increase seems to be in the decay of particles called W bosons. W bosons help to moderate the weak nuclear force, and theory predicts that the Higgs can sometimes decay into a pair of Ws. Both experiments have seen an unusually large number of W pairs. But they do not have enough events to confirm the excess as a signal. What\'s more, the way W particles themselves decay means that they cannot give a precise value of the Higgs\' mass. \n \n ADVERTISEMENT \n \n Even if the excess is a real signal, it could be down to a theoretical miscalculation, says Strassler. Predicting the precise quantities in which W bosons decay can be tricky, and the standard model may simply need an adjustment to explain the excess. \n \n The picture will change rapidly in the coming months. At present, the LHC is ""going gangbusters"", says Vivek Sharma, a researcher at the University of California, San Diego, who is heading the Higgs search at the CMS. ATLAS and the CMS will combine their results at next month\'s Lepton Photon meeting in Mumbai. Additional data this autumn and winter should either confirm the excess as a real signal or show once and for all that a Higgs, at reasonably low masses, doesn\'t exist. \n \n ""I\'m excited,"" Tonelli says. ""We have been working in this field for 20 years and now in a matter of months we\'ll know the answer.""']",4,"– It's less killer whale and more killed whales, at least according to a new study that found at least half the world's orcas could be taken down by ocean pollution in just a few decades. The culprit: highly toxic polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs. ""Despite a near-global ban of PCBs more than 30 years ago, the world's killer whales illustrate the troubling persistence of this chemical class,"" reads the study in Science. Most PCBs, which were used in everything from plastics to paint, have not been destroyed or securely stored, reports the BBC, and those that already leached into the ocean are unrecoverable and stubbornly persist in the whales, who metabolize them incredibly slowly, reports the New York Times. PCB concentration rises as you climb the food chain. Killer whales are at the top, leaving them with levels than can be 100 times what's considered safe and making them ""the most contaminated animals on the planet,"" as the Guardian puts it. Newborn calves are heavily dosed with PCBs via milk, and even birthing newborns may be compromised: Science Daily reports researchers evaluated the PCB levels of more than 350 orcas and detected PCB levels of 1300 milligrams per kilo in some whales' blubber; other studies have shown animals with levels of just 50 milligrams can exhibit infertility and immune system issues. The most contaminated, and therefore threatened, populations are those near Brazil, the UK, and the Strait of Gibraltar. ""In these areas, we rarely observe newborn killer whales,"" says a study co-author. The outlook is better for pods near Iceland, Norway, Alaska, and the Antarctic.

(Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP) \n \n President Trump “speaks for himself” on his values, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Sunday. \n \n The U.S. commitment to tolerance and equality is unchanged, Tillerson said, in the wake of controversy over Trump's response to racially tinged violence. \n \n “We express America's values from the State Department — our commitment to freedom, our commitment to equal treatment of people the world over,” Tillerson said on “Fox News Sunday,” adding: “And that message has never changed.” \n \n A United Nations committee last week criticized Trump for what it deemed his failure to fully condemn hatred and bigotry in the wake of deadly violence at a white supremacist march in Charlottesville earlier this month. \n \n “I don't believe anyone doubts the American people's values,” or the U.S. government's willingness to defend them, Tillerson said. \n \n Asked whether Trump's reaction, which included a statement that there was blame on “many sides” for the violence in Charlottesville, reflects American values, Tillerson answered evenly. \n \n “The president speaks for himself,” he said. \n \n [Trump confronts unprecedented criticism on Charlottesville from adviser Cohn] \n \n When host Chris Wallace asked whether Tillerson was “separating himself” from Trump's remarks, Tillerson answered, “I've made my own comment as to our values.” \n \n Tillerson's remarks followed pointed criticism of Trump's reaction from economic adviser Gary Cohn last week. \n \n On North Korea, Tillerson said the missile tests don't necessarily mean that Kim Jong Un's regime is thumbing its nose at the offer of negotiations with the United States. \n \n “Clearly, they are still messaging us, as well, that they are not prepared to completely back away from their positions,” Tillerson said. “We continue to want the Kim regime to understand there is a different path that he can choose.” \n \n The launch of three short-range missiles Friday followed statements from Trump and Tillerson last week that took note of what Tillerson called recent “restraint” on the part of Pyongyang. \n \n Until Friday, North Korea had not launched any missiles since the unanimous approval of new United Nations Security Council sanctions three weeks ago. That caused Trump to say that North Korea was finally “starting to respect us.” \n \n “I don’t know that we're wrong,” Tillerson said. “It's going to take some time to tell.”""]",2,"– Could Rex Tillerson be the next bold-faced name banished from President Trump's inner circle? Calls for the secretary of state's head are growing louder in the White House, Axios reports, citing sources who say Trump has grown ""increasingly frustrated"" by Tillerson. The nation's top diplomat didn't do his cause any benefit on Sunday by drawing a line between ""America's values"" and the president's. Speaking on Fox News Sunday about the deadly violence in Charlottesville, Tillerson said, per the Washington Post, ""I don't believe anyone doubts the American people's values,"" or the US government's commitment to defending them. When host Chris Wallace asked whether Tillerson was ""separating"" himself from Trump's comments, which included blaming ""many sides"" for the fighting, Tillerson responded, ""The president speaks for himself."" It's not the first time ""Rexit"" rumors have roiled the capital, but sources tell Axios the president has grown ""more and more fed up"" with a secretary he thinks is too ""establishment in his thinking."" After a meeting on Afghanistan recently, Trump reportedly griped, ""Rex just doesn't get it."" Other knocks on Tillerson: contradicting Trump on Qatar, pushing to re-certify the Iran nuclear deal Trump wants to ax, and failing to fill key State Department jobs. As for the knock, a Tillerson rep blames a ""busted"" system. ""The secretary sends over recommendations and they sit on the dock."" A State Department rep said in July that Tillerson has no plans to leave, but serves ""at the pleasure of the president."""

71,"['Dinosaurs are resurrected, on cinema screens at least with the release of Jurassic World, sixty-five million years after they were literally inventing the phrase, ‘gone the way of the dinosaurs’. The mass extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous period wiped out up to 81 per cent of all species on Earth. \n \n Today, the World Wide Fund for Nature estimates that between 200 and 2,000 species become extinct every year as our planet’s resources are used up – but there is a solution to this unfolding environmental catastrophe. Instead of losing thousands of species, we could save them all with the deliberate and orchestrated extermination of one particular species… us. \n \n Sacrificing the human race for the benefit of all other life is a view promoted by a growing number of people, including 67-year-old substitute teacher Les U Knight, from Portland, Oregon, who is de facto leader of the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement. VHEMT, pronounced ‘vehement’, like their beliefs, advocate an extreme form of birth control to fix the ever-growing problem of overpopulation. But Knight does not want you to die, he just (like George Bailey halfway through It’s a Wonderful Life) wishes you had never been born at all. \n \n “We are encouraging people to think before they breed,” he says. “Once you get a more logical approach to the idea of procreation, you realise it’s not in your best interests or in the best interests of society or the world. \n \n “My main motivation for wanting our species to go extinct is preservation of Earth’s biosphere. Diversity is a strength of the biosphere and the fewer species there are the weaker it becomes. We’re pulling strands from the web of life and at the same time putting more pressure on it due to our increased population and consumption. \n \n “People are not doing too well,” Knight continues. “Two billion people don’t have potable water, almost a billion are experiencing food insecurity – we used to call it hunger – it’s not a pretty world for half the people on the planet and it won’t be easy to improve their lot as long as all the progress is gobbled up by our increase in numbers.” \n \n Around 367,000 babies are born daily – meaning there are more new humans every day than the entire population of great apes left in the world. At the current birth rate, there will be 27 billion of us by the year 2100. That is the extreme end of population predictions and a more rational estimate is 10.1 billion people by the end of the century, which some think could be an unsustainable amount. \n \n What about reducing global population to a sustainable level, perhaps with everyone adopting China’s one child policy? \n \n “One is twice as good as two as far as procreation goes but our population momentum would take a while to start decreasing,” Knight says. “In terms of energy consumption, when a North American couple stops at two it’s about the same as an average Indian couple stopping at 30 or a Bangladeshi couple stopping at 97. At least China has done a lot to control their increase. There would be 400 million more of them today if they hadn’t instituted their policy.” \n \n Knight argues that a lower population would result in house prices stabilising, lower rents and wages increasing with fewer people to fill vacancies. He also suggests that it would be good to join the voluntary movement to ensure it does not become a compulsory one. \n \n “The end of humanity would be good for humanity,” he says. “That seems contradictory but as we phase ourselves out, the lives of those of us who exist will greatly improve. And those of us who don’t exist won’t know the difference.” \n \n Knight put his money where his unmentionables are at the age of 25 when he underwent a vasectomy. “I’ve never regretted it for a moment,” he says. “I only wish I’d done it earlier. It’s dangerous having those wigglers. \n \n “Don’t like voluntary extinction? It’s so much nicer than involuntary extinction,” he warns. “There are enough nuclear weapons to end the world tomorrow – we’ve been involuntarily trying to extinct ourselves for a very long time, and it will not be a pleasant experience for all of the people and all the other species to die in an ecological collapse.” \n \n And let’s not forget, our extinction is not optional. We are all going to go the way of the dinosaurs sooner or later. \n \n “It’s what we leave behind that will make the difference,” Knight says. \n \n However, even if the human race does disappear from the face of the Earth, in 65 million years, whatever the dominant species is will undoubtedly clone us to populate their amusement parks. In their films, at least. \n \n \n \n Read more at vhemt.org \n \n \n \n @stevenmackenzie', 'I’ve had to put up with the Fake News from the first day I announced that I would be running for President.

Knight came to that conclusion long ago, and unlike you, he's doing something about it. He's the founder of the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement, which aims to rid Earth of humans. Sounds like a depressing goal, right? Well, VHEMT (say it as ""vehement"") is actually pretty upbeat about the whole thing. To clarify, the organization's website notes it doesn't advocate for suicide, it's not a suicide cult, and yes, it likes babies. But it also states that the annihilation of humans would give Earth a chance to recover. This idea isn't exactly new: The Awl points to an overpopulation-minded essay published in 1798. But as the Awl puts it, VHEMT is ""the only serious organization committed to peacefully annihilating all of humanity."" As its unofficial motto goes, ""May we live long and die out."" Knight—who had a vasectomy at 25, per Big Issue—started the group in 1991 and gained supporters with the zine These Exit Times, which included essays and comics, and, once, a Valentine's Day contest to win a free vasectomy. Those who are fully on board are known as ""volunteers,"" though all they had to do to ""join"" was ""make the choice to refrain from further reproduction."" Writing for the Awl, Joe Veix sees a problem: ""If we are to assume that humans are so selfish/destructive that the earth is better off without us, it also holds that we're too selfish/destructive to ever actually allow ourselves to die off."" Knight offers this counterpoint: ""We're spreading memes, not genes, so the more people who learn of VHEMT, whether they agree or not, it's a success,"" he says. ""I'd like to think there are more than a few people who don't exist thanks to our encouragement."" The Awl has more."

You’re taught you have to be a man; you have to be masculine.

74,"['NEW YORK – Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman today announced the conviction and sentencing of Abdul Jamil Khokhar and BMY Foods, Inc., which together owned and operated nine Papa John’s franchises throughout the Bronx. Khokhar pled guilty to failure to pay wages under the New York Labor Law, a misdemeanor, and BMY Foods pled guilty to falsifying business records in the first degree, an E felony. Khokhar was sentenced to spend 60 days in jail and to pay $230,000 in restitution to underpaid workers at his Papa John’s franchises. \n \n “Wage theft is a crime and a Papa John’s franchisee is now going to jail for cheating his employees and trying to cover it up,” said Attorney General Schneiderman. “My office will do everything in its power to protect the rights of New York’s workers and make sure that all employers – including fast food restaurants – follow the law.” \n \n “The Attorney General’s successful criminal prosecution of this employer, together with the Department of Labor’s civil consent judgment against the enterprise, show that employers will not get away with covering up violations of state and federal wage laws,” said Mark H. Watson, Jr., Regional Administrator for the Wage and Hour Division at the U.S. Department of Labor. “We will continue to work together to prevent such law-breaking and obtain proper compensation for workers.” \n \n Both New York and federal law require employers to pay workers at least the minimum wage for all hours worked and overtime at one-and-one-half times their regular rate of pay for hours worked in excess of forty in any given workweek. New York’s current minimum wage is $8.75 per hour, and the federal minimum wage is currently $7.25 per hour; employers in New York must pay the higher rate. In addition, employers must report all wages paid to employees on tax returns on a quarterly basis and must make contributions to the State Unemployment Insurance Fund based upon the reported wages. \n \n Khokhar and BMY Foods, Inc. failed to pay overtime to their workers. Instead, they paid workers the same, “straight time” regular rate of pay for all hours worked, including hours in excess of forty and they created fictitious names for employees to use in their computerized timekeeping system to hide this practice. In a further attempt to conceal this scheme, the defendants filed fraudulent tax returns with the State of New York that omitted the cash payments made under fictitious names. Khokhar created the dual name scheme after becoming aware that he was under investigation by the U.S. Department of Labor for wage violations. \n \n The U.S. Department of Labor secured a civil settlement in July 2015 requiring Khokhar to pay $230,000 in liquidated damages and $50,000 in civil monetary penalties, in addition to the $230,000 in restitution for unpaid wages paid to the Attorney General’s Office upon the Order of the Court at sentencing. Pursuant to the consent judgment filed by the U.S. Department of Labor, Khokhar’s Papa John’s franchises also will be required to designate and create procedures for an internal compliance officer and will be subject to independent auditing of the franchises’ practices. \n \n The investigation was handled for the Attorney General’s Office by Investigators Edward Ortiz, Elsa Rojas, Sixto Santiago, and Michael Yun, Investigator Luis Martinez of the Special Operations Unit, Senior Investigators Lawrence Riccio and Salvatore Ventola, Supervising Investigator Luis Carter, Deputy Chief Investigator John McManus, and Chief Dominick Zarrella. \n \n The case was prosecuted by Assistant Attorney General Benjamin Holt, Section Chief Richard Balletta of the Labor Bureau, and Deputy Bureau Chief Stephanie Swenton of the Criminal Enforcement and Financial Crimes Bureau and the Auto Insurance Fraud Unit.

Bob Casey says her planned meeting with a fringe men\'s group is a ""slap in the face"" to sexual assault survivors. \n \n Alex Wong / Getty Images Education Secretary Betsy DeVos at a May hearing on Capitol Hill. \n \n A top Democratic senator accused Education Secretary Betsy DeVos on Wednesday of ""outright neglecting"" her department\'s civil rights duties, while another blasted DeVos for planning to meet with a fringe group that says false rape reports are part of a “war” being waged on men. Two letters, one obtained exclusively by BuzzFeed News, were sent to DeVos on the eve of Thursday’s meetings between the Education Department and organizations representing victims of sexual violence, and those accused of it. Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, the third-ranking Democrat in the Senate, criticized DeVos in her letter for steps the Department of Education has taken under the Trump administration, such as narrowing the scope of campus sexual assault investigations. Murray said she feared DeVos was moving toward changing the department’s approach to the gender equity law Title IX “in a way that will undermine the rights of sexual assault survivors."" In her letter, Murray also took aim at comments made by Candice Jackson, the acting head of the department\'s Office for Civil Rights, which investigates how schools comply with Title IX. Jackson told the New York Times that 90% of campus rape accusations ""fall into the category of \'we were both drunk,\' \'we broke up, and six months later I found myself under a Title IX investigation because she just decided that our last sleeping together was not quite right.\'"" ""I am deeply disturbed by this message coming from the person you have selected to lead OCR,"" Murray wrote. ""At the least, this suggests a fundamental misunderstanding of campus sexual assault and suggests that OCR is not prepared to take accounts from survivors seriously."" Jackson, a rape survivor herself, later apologized in a statement Wednesday for her remarks to the Times: ""What I said was flippant, and I am sorry. All sexual harassment and sexual assault must be taken seriously — which has always been my position and will always be the position of this department."" On Thursday, DeVos will hold a series of meetings with various groups on how schools handle sexual violence, broken up into three 90 minute sessions. One will feature groups representing rape victims, another will include groups that work with students accused of assault, and a third will involve educational groups, attorneys, and lobbyists. Earlier Wednesday, Sen. Bob Casey, a Democrat from Pennsylvania, called DeVos\'s inclusion of a men\'s rights group, the National Coalition for Men Carolinas, in her meetings ""a slap in the face to the victims of campus sexual assault."" \n \n ""It is disturbing that the Department of Education would place these radical groups on the same level as those working tirelessly to confront the crisis of sexual assault on our campuses."" \n \n The coalition is a branch of the National Coalition for Men, which has referred to rape survivor advocates as ""anti-male,"" and last week it called Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, a New York Democrat, a ""misandrist"" on Twitter. ""We are dedicated to bringing attention to the very real and damaging war on men that is being waged in classrooms, in the media, in our courts, on college campuses, in the workplace, even in places of worship,” the group says on its website. The Education Department said that the men\'s rights group will participate in a meeting for ""Students who have been falsely accused and disciplined under Title IX,"" and is bringing two students and two parents. The group has also posted photos of women it believes made false rape accusations, and suggested half of all sexual assault reports are lies. ""It is disturbing that the Department of Education would place these radical groups on the same level as those working tirelessly to confront the crisis of sexual assault on our campuses,"" Casey wrote in his letter. Murray also focused on an internal memo from Jackson telling OCR offices to narrow their Title IX investigations to focus on individual cases and shift away from class action reviews geared toward uncovering systemic issues. Jackson said the goal was to finish investigations more quickly and clear a backlog of cases, some of which have languished for years. Murray said this change, combined with plans to decrease OCR staff, shows DeVos ""is outright neglecting ED’s civil rights responsibilities."" \n \n Alex Wong / Getty Images Sen.

(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta) (Associated Press) \n \n WASHINGTON (AP) — Secretary of State Rex Tillerson declared the Iran nuclear deal a failure on Wednesday but left open the possibility the Trump administration will uphold it nonetheless. \n \n The top American diplomat sought to reinforce the notion that the U.S. is aggressively countering Iran\'s destabilizing behavior throughout the Middle East, even though President Donald Trump so far has not pulled out of the deal. Tillerson spoke a day after certifying to Congress that Iran is complying with its obligations under the 2015 deal, a requirement for Tehran to continue receiving relief from nuclear sanctions. \n \n ""The JCPOA fails to achieve the objective of a non-nuclear Iran,"" Tillerson said, using an acronym for the 2015 nuclear deal. ""It only delays their goal of becoming a nuclear state."" \n \n He said the deal, brokered by former President Barack Obama\'s administration along with other world powers, represented the ""same failed approach"" the U.S. has taken to North Korea. Like with the North, Tillerson said, the Trump administration was unwilling to be patient with Iran, ticking through a list of countries where he said Iran was supporting terrorism and violence. \n \n Tillerson\'s hastily arranged statement before cameras at the State Department reflected the competing forces pulling at the Trump administration as it develops its policy toward Iran. On the one hand, Trump wants to show he\'s being tougher than Obama toward Iran, but on the other hand, he\'s not yet ready to rip up the deal. \n \n Trump as a candidate vowed to discard or renegotiate the pact, and shortly after taking office his administration put Tehran ""on notice"" that its troublesome behavior would no longer be tolerated. But neither Iran nor the other world powers that negotiated the agreement have any interest in re-opening the deal, and U.S. companies stand to lose billions if the deal is scuttled. \n \n Proponents of the deal have long acknowledged it doesn\'t address concerns about Iran\'s non-nuclear behavior, such as its ballistic missile program or support for Houthi rebels in Yemen. Obama and others argued it was narrowly tailored to take the most dangerous prospect — a nuclear-armed Iran — off the table. \n \n The deal\'s critics, though, say it fails to achieve even that goal because key restrictions on Iran\'s nuclear development sunset after a decade or more. With some of those critics now in office, Tillerson\'s comments Wednesday marked the first time that position has been echoed by the U.S. government. \n \n Still, since taking office, Trump has stopped promising he\'ll gut the deal. Tillerson said that decision will be made as part of a governmentwide review of Iran policy currently under way. \n \n ""The Trump administration has no intention of passing the buck to a future administration on Iran,"" Tillerson said. \n \n In an ominous warning, Tillerson linked Iran\'s behavior to that of North Korea and said that with both countries, the U.S. would no longer engage in ""strategic patience."" The U.S. has been exploring ways to address the threat of North Korea\'s nuclear program, which is significantly farther along than Iran\'s. \n \n ""An unchecked Iran has the potential to travel the same path as North Korea — and to take the world along with it,"" Tillerson said. \n \n ___ \n \n AP Diplomatic Writer Matthew Lee contributed to this report. Reach Josh Lederman on Twitter at http://twitter.com/joshledermanAP', 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Wednesday accused Iran of ‘alarming ongoing provocations’ to destabilize countries in the Middle East as the Trump administration launched a review of its policy toward Tehran. \n \n Tillerson told reporters the review, which he announced on Tuesday, would not only look at Tehran’s compliance with a 2015 nuclear deal but also its behavior in the region which he said undermined U.S. interests in Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Lebanon. \n \n His tough words matched those of U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who said in a visit to Saudi Arabia on Wednesday that Iran’s destabilizing influence would have to be overcome to end the conflict in Yemen. \n \n President Donald Trump ordered the review to evaluate whether suspension of sanctions related to the nuclear deal was “vital to the national security interests of the United States,” Tillerson said \n \n Though there was no sign the Trump administration intended to walk away from the deal, Tillerson twice cautioned that if left unchecked Tehran could become a threat like North Korea, which is also under pressure over its nuclear ambitions. \n \n In a letter to U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan released late on Tuesday, Tillerson declared that Iran was meeting its commitments under the 2015 nuclear deal but there were concerns about Tehran’s role as a state sponsor of terrorism. \n \n “A comprehensive Iran policy requires we address all of the threats posed by Iran and it is clear there are many,” Tillerson told reporters at the State Department. \n \n Tillerson said the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers failed “to achieve the objective of a non-nuclear Iran and only delays their goal of becoming a nuclear state.” \n \n Related Coverage U.S., Iran trade barbs over landmark 2015 nuclear deal \n \n “FAILED APPROACH” \n \n Iran has yet to comment on the Trump administration’s review, but Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei warned in November that Tehran would retaliate if the United States breached the nuclear agreement. \n \n Tillerson said one of the mistakes in the way the agreement was put together was that it ignored all the other serious threats Iran posed outside of its nuclear program. \n \n “That is why we have to look at Iran in a very comprehensive way in terms of the threat it poses in all areas of the region and the world,” he added. \n \n “This deal represents the same failed approach of the past that brought us to the current imminent threat we face from North Korea,” Tillerson said of the nuclear deal. \n \n The nuclear agreement, negotiated during Barack Obama’s presidency, placed limitations on Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for lifting economic sanctions against Iran. \n \n Tillerson’s notice to Congress was part of a 90-day process in which the president has to certify that Iran is complying with the nuclear accord. It is the first update under the Trump administration. \n \n The next test of Trump’s attitude toward the nuclear deal will be in May when he must decide whether to extend sanctions waivers for Iran first signed by President Barack Obama. \n \n U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson attends a news conference with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov following their talks in Moscow, Russia, April 12, 2017.

Tillerson called Iran ""the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism"" and accused it of ""intensifying multiple conflicts and undermining US interests in countries such as Syria, Yemen, Iraq, and Lebanon,"" the BBC reports. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis also talked tough on Iran Wednesday, saying Tehran's influence would need to be overcome before the conflict in Yemen would end. Tillerson did, however, acknowledge that Iran is complying with the 2015 nuclear deal. It's not clear whether President Trump still plans to make good on his promise to scrap or renegotiate the deal, a move that could cost US companies billions, the AP reports. Tillerson did say that the deal ""fails to achieve the objective of a non-nuclear Iran,"" and only ""delays their goal of becoming a nuclear state.""

77,"['Emma Sulkowicz says she was raped in her own dorm bed by a classmate on the first day of her sophomore year of college. Since then, a substantial amount of her time at Columbia University has been spent trying to convince college administrators, police, and even friends that what happened to her really happened, that it was rape, and that her rapist deserves to be punished for what he did. \n \n (Update: Read The Cut’s interview with Sulkowicz here.) \n \n Related Stories Columbia Student Speaks on Mattress Performance \n \n Sulkowicz is one of 23 students who are part of a federal Title IX complaint filed against Columbia in April for mishandling sexual-assault cases. Though she and two other students reported that the same student had assaulted them, all of their claims were swept under the rug, and the male student was not expelled from campus. \n \n “Every day, I am afraid to leave my room,” Sulkowicz wrote in Time in May. “Even seeing people who look remotely like my rapist scares me. Last semester I was working in the dark room in the photography department. Though my rapist wasn’t in my class, he asked permission from his teacher to come and work in the dark room during my class time. I started crying and hyperventilating. As long as he’s on campus with me, he can continue to harass me.” \n \n Now a senior majoring in visual arts, Sulkowicz has devised a senior thesis rooted in performance art that will allow her to protest the fact that her rapist continues to study on campus. She has committed to carrying around a twin-size dorm mattress everywhere she goes on campus, to classes and appointments, “for as long as I attend the same school as my rapist.” \n \n “I was raped in my own dorm bed, and since then that space has become fraught for me,” she says in a video about the piece, called Mattress Performance or Carry That Weight, published by the Columbia Spectator. “And I feel like I’ve carried the weight of what happened there with me everywhere since then.” \n \n In an interview with The Cut, Sulkowicz talks about how her performance has been going so far.', 'One-hundred-fifty years after the Hunley made the South proud, the Confederate submarine remains a graceful and formidable machine, its rusted shell continuing to tell tales worthy of the greatest Southern yarn-spinners. \n \n Desperation, military stakes, engineering knowhow, and sheer bravery all played a role in the historic moment on Feb. 17, 1864, when eight Confederate navy men cranked the Hunley up to a Union ship called the Housatonic and jammed an explosive into her side in an effort to break the chokehold Union blockade of the critical Southern port of Charleston, S.C. \n \n Hunley’s explosive stab was the first time a military submarine ever sank an enemy ship, and it had an immediate and tragic coda: The Hunley and her eight crew also retired to the bottom of Charleston Harbor, from where it was excavated and returned to harbor in 2000 after being found in 1995. \n \n The return of the Hunley to land was marked with the pride of cannon fire and cheering crowds, and her treasure was immediate and fulfilling – including the discovery of a bullet-bent coin embossed with the phrase “My life preserver,” as well as buttons, bones and other belongings from the eight-man crew. \n \n But it’s taken the ensuing fifteen years for researchers to get close to solving the mystery of why the Hunley sank after dispatching her torpedo with a long spar mounted on its prow. \n \n The Hunley was built in Mobile, Alabama, and hauled by train to Charleston. In test runs, it had already killed several crews by the time it struck the Housatonic, but had each time been raised out of the water to try again. Crew members, lit by lantern-light, sat in a tight row – assuredly praying and sweating – as they hand-cranked a propeller while diving as deep as 50 feet. \n \n From discovered drawings most experts thought the Hunley was a rude and rudimentary machine, so researchers were shocked at its graceful lines and the ingenuity of its engineering. \n \n “A real surprise was that the submarine was far more technically advanced than anybody had ever thought,” the novelist Clive Cussler, who helped find the ship, told the Monitor in 2001. \n \n Scientists say they’re still not 100 percent sure why the Hunley sank, but last year researchers announced a new theory. While the torpedo sat at the tip of a 200-foot spar, evidence shows that the Hunley may have been as few as 20 feet from the Housatonic’s hull when the blast went off. Judging by damage to the spar, researchers suggest the explosion may have knocked the crew unconscious and the boat to the bottom. \n \n Get the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox.

Put to rest in 2004, the eight crew members were the last Confederates to be buried from the war. \n \n On Monday night, military reenactors will gather at the Hunley’s launching spot, to commemorate the achievement of the pioneering sub and her brave crew.']",2,"– Columbia senior Emma Sulkowicz says school authorities have ignored her allegations that a fellow student raped her in her dorm room on the first day of sophomore year. It's going to be tough to ignore this, however: The visual arts major plans to carry a mattress with her everywhere she goes on campus ""for as long as I attend the same school as my rapist,"" reports New York. Sulkowicz has turned her ordeal into a senior thesis she's calling Mattress Performance: Carry That Weight. “I could have taken my pillow, but I want people to see how it weighs down a person to be ignored by the school administration and harassed by police,"" she explains to Jessica Valenti of the Guardian. Two other female students have accused the same male student of rape, and Columbia authorities declared him to be ""not responsible"" in all three cases. Sulkowicz is one of about two dozen students who have lodged a federal complaint against Columbia over its handling of sexual abuse allegations. She wrote of her experience previously in Time and now speaks to the Columbia Spectator about her project. One of its rules: She's not allowed to ask for help carrying the mattress, but she can accept it if others offer. (Earlier this year, a graffiti vigilante began naming alleged rapists at Columbia.)"

Those were far more respectable than Monday’s 1.3 and 4.9 million viewers. So, what happened? \n \n Well, for starters, two years have passed. In case you’ve been asleep this whole time, somehow Trump has gone from reality competition host to the frigging PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. That means those who regularly tuned in for the “You’re Fired” guy maybe weren’t as interested as the “Get to the chopper!” dude. \n \n Plus, Trump’s still an executive producer on the show, which could have also turned off some viewers less enthused about Trump since his full-time shift into politics. \n \n Also Read: Ratings: Arnold Schwarzenegger's 'Celebrity Apprentice' Debut Crushed by 'The Bachelor' \n \n It’s also worth pointing out that the 2015 version actually premiered on a Sunday evening, when there was a greater potential audience and less competition. The next night’s regular Monday time slot premiere dipped to a 2.0 and had 6.5 million viewers overall. \n \n So what was the big competition last night? Well, Fox aired a modestly rated “MasterChef Celebrity Showdown” special, which could have fragmented the reality audience a bit. Meanwhile, ABC’s 2017 season premiere of “The Bachelor” was broadcast’s biggest demo bully last night, pulling in a 2.1 and 6.6 million viewers. \n \n Another challenge came from ESPN’s coverage of the Rose Bowl, which turned out to be an instant classic.

Seabed Constructor is now over 15 hours without updating her AIS position. I will post as soon as anything changes — Kevin Rupp (@LabratSR) February 1, 2018 \n \n Whatever strategy you have now @Ocean__Infinity, - wrong one. Request your vessel #SeabedConstructor turn on its AIS & allow ppl like @richard_e_cole @LabratSR @Airlandseaman report fairly & accurately. Otherwise you create a vacuum quickly filled by idiots/speculation. #MH370 — Air Investigation (@AirInvestigate) February 2, 2018 \n \n Interested if someone like @Airlandseaman or @richard_e_cole with inside connections can help fill us in soon. These types of blackouts are just opportunities for conspiracies to abound. My assumption for now: something wrong with AIS transponder. — HawkeyeErik (@eriksnewton) February 1, 2018 \n \n “I think that the AIS transmission from Constructor has been disabled. The question is whether this is finger-trouble by someone adjusting the AIS system settings ahead of departing for Fremantle, or deliberate action.” Mr Cole posted in a subreddit dedicated to Seabed Constructor position updates. \n \n Comparisons have also been made with the missing plane itself, which vanished from radar after its aircraft communications, addressing and reporting system (Acars) system was switched off less than an hour after taking off from Kuala Lumpur on March 8 2014. \n \n The irony was not lost among MH370 watchers online, with one Reddit user commenting: “Rogue captain?” and another responding “If it starts pinging in the Malacca Strait that would be something.” \n \n As predicted some observers used the blackout as an opportunity to back more outlandish theories about Ocean Infinity’s “back up plan” should they fail to find the missing Boeing 777. \n \n Some speculated the Constructor took a secret detour to check out the wreckage of what is believed to be the S.V Inca, a Peruvian-built transport ship that vanished en route to Sydney more than 100 years ago. \n \n In January 2016, MH370 search vessel Havila Harmony stumbled across the shipwreck almost four kilometres below the surface inside the 7th Arc, initially mistaking it for the plane’s fuselage. \n \n S.V Inca was last seen on March 10, 1911 when it set sail from Callao, Peru bound for Sydney. There has been speculation about what cargo the vessel may have been carrying and inevitable chatter about sunken treasure. \n \n Last night Seabed Constructor turned its AIS back on and is currently making its way to Perth in Western Australia, where she is scheduled to dock at Fremantle on February 8. \n \n Ocean Infinity is expected to given another update on the progress of the search late this week but it’s anyone’s guess if it will explain why it disabled its tracking system for such a long period of time. \n \n #MH370 My morning update. Seabed Constructor is back on AIS and on her way to Fremantle. She is due in on the 8th and is scheduled for AusMarine Complex 4.

This section had previously been identified by Australian scientists as the most likely endpoint for MH370’s flight. \n \n “As I write this, the scan of the innermost section of the Primary Search Area has been completed, but the assessment has not yet been released. However, the fact that Seabed Constructor has moved on to another area suggests that probably nothing was found there, either. A big caveat: we don’t really know how long it takes the search team to assess the data collected during each pass. \n \n “A failure to find any wreckage in the Primary Search Area would come as a disappointment to David Griffin and his team at Australia’s CSIRO, who declared in a June, 2017 report that after analysing satellite imagery and drift patterns “we think it is possible to identify a most-likely location of the aircraft, with unprecedented precision and certainty.” The report specified three target points, all located within the Primary Search Area.” \n \n Seabed Constructor is expected to dock in Fremantle to refuel and top up supplies before returning to the search area.', ""Seabed Constructor, which has been looking for missing plane, turned off its monitoring system \n \n The ship searching for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 disappeared from tracking screens for three days after it turned off its own satellite monitoring system with no explanation. \n \n At the beginning of January, the US-based company Ocean Infinity was hired by the Malaysian government to search for the missing plane, which disappeared in March 2014. \n \n Its ship, Seabed Constructor, began the search on 22 January, but on Thursday, after only 10 days, it turned off its Automatic Identification System (AIS) with no explanation. \n \n \n \n Three days later, it reappeared outside the search area and on its way to a scheduled refuelling stop at the Australian port of Fremantle. Neither the Malaysian government nor Ocean Infinity has explained the outage, or where the ship travelled in those three days. \n \n Map Seabed Constructor turned off its AIS on 1 February and reactivated it on 4 February. The three days in between are unaccounted for. \n \n Family members of those on board the missing flight have called on the Malaysian government and Ocean Infinity to explain the blackout, amid mounting speculation over the ship’s movements. \n \n KS Narendran, who had a relative on MH370, called for greater transparency over the ship’s temporary disappearance. \n \n “I found the development quite odd, and worrying,” he said. “If this silence and becoming invisible was intentional, to ward off suspicion, a satisfactory explanation is due. If it was for other reasons, then in the interests of transparency, we ought to be told what caused it. \n \n MH370's location an 'almost inconceivable' mystery – final report Read more \n \n “There are no journalists and no family members on board the search ship. I wish there were some ... We watch on in good faith. I hope ongoing official disclosure is of such a high order that there is little room for speculation, controversy or a whiff of conspiracy.” \n \n During the three-day data blackout conspiracy theories spread online, including one that Seabed Constructor had taken a detour to recover sunken treasure from the nearby wreck of the SV Inca, a Peruvian ship that sunk in 1911 while en route to Sydney. \n \n Kevin Rupp, a precision machinist who has been publicly tracking Seabed Constructor, said that was highly unlikely. \n \n \n \n “I have nothing polite to say about those who are spreading rumours that Seabed Constructor was really on a treasure hunt,” he said. \n \n He said all speculation was simply guesswork, and the tracker may have been turned off to prevent unnecessary distress to the victim’s families. “If the ship detected possible contacts [with MH370] its most likely action would be to move to the spot of the detections and lower an ROV – a tethered remote-controlled small vehicle,” he said. \n \n “To do this, Seabed Constructor would have to sit still in one place for a long period of time and this would be very noticeable to those of us watching through our AIS tracking apps ... I believe they may have turned the AIS transmitter to low power mode to prevent us from speculating that they had found something and causing undue distress for the next of kin.” \n \n In the single update released by Malaysian officials so far, it was confirmed MH370 had not been found in the first week of the search, between 22 and 30 January. \n \n During that time, Seabed Constructor had searched a “high priority” area that Australian researchers had pinpointed as the plane’s likely resting place. Between 2014 and 2017, Australian authorities had conducted a three-year search across 120,000sq km that failed to find the plane. Afterwards, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) identified the priority area as the next place to look. \n \n Scientist Richard Cole said on Twitter he believed the ship had spent the three days in an area it had previously searched, in the south-east corner of the search area. \n \n \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest Map of the new MH370 search area, with the first week’s search in orange.

A reward of between US$20m and $70m is available depending on the area searched. \n \n \n \n Flight MH370 disappeared in March 2014, vanishing from radio contact 40 minutes into a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. Military radar and satellite data suggested the plane suddenly turned around and flew south towards the Indian Ocean, crashing and claiming the lives of all 239 crew and passengers on board. \n \n It was carrying 152 Chinese nationals and 50 from Malaysia, as well as passengers from Australia, Canada, France, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Iran, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Russia, Taiwan, Ukraine and the US."", 'The Costs Of The Pulse Nightclub Shooting \n \n Enlarge this image toggle caption John Raoux/AP John Raoux/AP \n \n Mario Perez lives in Miami, but he was in Orlando for a housewarming party Saturday, June 11. After the party, the 34-year-old went to the Pulse nightclub for Latin night. \n \n At 2 a.m., he heard gunshots. Loud. He knew it was real. \n \n ""And the minute he started shooting, I got hit from the side, I got grazed by a bullet,"" Perez says. ""My first instinct was to fall to the floor, that\'s what you\'re taught to do."" \n \n He heard gunshot after gunshot after gunshot — too many to count. But then there was a brief break in the firing, and Perez ran out the back of the club. He hid inside the kitchen of a nearby 7-Eleven until police and paramedics showed up. He was taken to Orlando Regional Medical Center, and was at the emergency room from 3 a.m. until 8 a.m. \n \n The gunshot wound on his side is purple and swollen, and he has nerve damage from the bullet fragment. He cut his elbow from glass on the floor of the nightclub and needed six stitches. Perez doesn\'t know how much bills coming from specialists, X-rays and tests might cost him. But his bill from Orlando Regional Medical Center\'s emergency department is $20,000. \n \n ""$20,000,"" Perez said. ""That\'s the quote, that\'s what they told me."" \n \n Perez has no health insurance. He\'s working for a temp agency right now and doesn\'t have the money to be seen by a doctor for follow-up care in Miami. \n \n So just how much will the Pulse nightclub shooting cost all of the victims? It\'s a difficult, if not impossible question to answer right now. At last check, 56 people had been brought to the hospital, including three patients who spent two weeks in the intensive care unit, and one patient who is still in the hospital in critical condition. \n \n Embry Howell, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, a think tank in Washington, D.C., studied the average cost of a gunshot victim in 2010. Using that benchmark, she estimates the hospital costs from the Pulse shooting will be about $1 million. \n \n ""And I would imagine that would be an underestimate,"" Howell said. \n \n Howell said many of the victims may be in the same boat as Mario Perez: uninsured. \n \n ""They\'re young, primarily Latino and living in Florida,"" she says, a state that has not expanded Medicaid to its population. \n \n ""My guess would be you have a high rate of uninsured,"" she concludes. \n \n Ted Miller, a researcher with the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, has been studying the cost of firearm injuries for more than two decades. He used the 2011 shooting of former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords and 18 others in Arizona to make what he calls a conservative estimate: $4 to $7 million in medical costs and mental health costs for victims and survivors of people who died. \n \n That\'s lifetime medical costs for the survivors, the costs of surgery and rehab — but it doesn\'t count long-term costs for those who are severely injured. \n \n ""They said some time ago that there were six people in ICU who would have longtime, serious consequences,"" Miller said. ""And my guess is most of those folks will have traumatic brain injuries that will have continuing lifetime care."" \n \n Miller also makes a broader estimate beyond just the medical costs. That includes the cost of the police response, the cost to employers — and the dollar value of those 49 lost lives. \n \n ""I estimate that the total cost of the Orlando shooting is around $385 to $390 million,"" Miller says. ""To put that in context, on that same day, the cost of other gunshot wounds in the U.S. was probably about $600 million. So about 1 1/2 times the cost of the Orlando incident. That tells you that there are a lot of people killed and injured by firearms every day in this country,"" he says. And, he explains, ""Suicide deaths account for the largest share of gun violence costs."" \n \n Miller\'s $385 million estimate doesn\'t include the cost of mental health counseling for people who were in the club but not physically shot — and friends and family of those there. And then there\'s the cost of fear: people being afraid to go out to a dance club, or maybe skipping a visit to the theme parks. \n \n Orlando Regional received 44 of the shooting victims. A hospital spokeswoman says some patients have insurance coverage, some don\'t. The hospital is going to look for payment sources from the community or the state, such as victim funds that are raising money across the country. But she says the hospital expects unreimbursed costs of more than $5 million. \n \n Pulse shooting victim Mario Perez is calculating his personal costs. He\'s worried he\'s going to lose his job. He\'s anxious knowing millions of dollars have been raised to help victims, but his bills are arriving now. He started his own GoFundMe campaign, but it\'s only raised about $600. \n \n ""As long as it gets covered, I\'m going to be fine,"" Perez said. ""If they don\'t cover it, I\'m stuck in a hole. I don\'t know what I\'m going to be able to do if they don\'t assist me."" \n \n This story is part of a reporting partnership with NPR, Health News Florida and Kaiser Health News.']",3,"– Just when you thought the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 couldn't get any more mystifying, it has. While searching for the Boeing 777 that vanished with 239 people on board after departing Kuala Lumpur in March 2014, a ship itself disappeared more than 1,200 miles off Western Australia, reports the Guardian. Ten days into a 90-day search commissioned by Malaysia—which will pay up to $70 million if the ship is found—the Seabed Constructor from US-based company Ocean Infinity apparently turned off its satellite monitoring system Thursday, leaving it untrackable in the Indian Ocean. It reappeared three days later en route to a scheduled refueling stop in Fremantle, Australia, but neither Ocean Infinity or the Malaysian government have offered an explanation for the disappearance, which has sparked wild conspiracy theories. Some speculated that the crew was actually pulling treasure from a Peruvian shipwreck nearby, per News.com.au. With Malaysian officials saying only that Flight 370 wasn't found during the first week of the search that began Jan. 22, others say the Seabed Constructor might've found an area of interest and turned off its Automatic Identification System to protect passengers' relatives from undue distress at seeing the ship focused on a particular spot. The wide-ranging speculation is perhaps no surprise given this search was ""shrouded in mystery"" from the outset of the deal signed in January after months of negotiations, reports New York. An interesting tidbit the magazine uncovered: ""A so-called anchor-handling vessel designed to support offshore oil drilling"" was seen heading for a rendezvous with the Seabed Constructor days before the search began."

As it turns out, they might have been, had a higher power not intervened. At the time, there were reports that a plan to unseat Boehner was called off at the last minute, allowing him to narrowly survive the January 3 vote. It was never clear what prompted this change of heart, but according to a Washington Post report on the discord within the House GOP, “The cabal quickly fell apart when several Republicans, after a night of prayer, said God told them to spare the speaker.” \n \n The defectors didn’t have a particular person selected to replace Boehner, but they planned to prevent him from reaching a majority on the first ballot, forcing a second vote. They hoped that at that point someone else (such as Eric Cantor or Paul Ryan) would emerge, and if not, it would still send Boehner a message. \n \n Rep. Steve Southerland of Florida said that on the night before the vote, he turned to the Bible for guidance, and came upon the story of Saul, the king of Israel, and David, his future successor. David has two opportunities to kill Saul, but decides to spare the king. Southerland slept for three hours, and when he woke up he was convinced that he should vote for Boehner. According to the Post, “Others, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said they, too, prayed before siding with Boehner.” \n \n Six months later, there’s still a rift between House leaders and more recent Tea Party–affiliated additions.

""Copies need to totally disappear."" \n \n Sweet called the book ""child pornography"" when asked to explain why the library had banned it. \n \n ""We do not like to remove books,"" Sweet wrote in an email. ""It was felt, however, that the book was not appropriate."" \n \n ""Revolutionary Voices"" was named among the best adult books for high school students by the School Library Journal in 2001, and was in the school\'s library to help young people struggling with issues of sexuality. \n \n Though Marinelli has not read much of the book, according to the Inquirer, she did cite a specific illustration of Boy Scouts watching two men have sex, calling it ""the worst."" \n \n She says she isn\'t a ""homophobe,"" just a ""normal mother and grandmother"" defending her conservative values. \n \n ""We did it for the children,"" she told the Inquirer. \n \n According to its official website, Beck\'s 9.12 Project is aimed at Americans ""looking for direction in taking back control of our country."" \n \n Marinelli identifies herself as Burlington County member of the group and once posted on a 9.12 Project website that she is ""disgusted w/ what this Administration is doing and what is happening to our country."" \n \n In the fall, TPM reports, she took part in a protest against ""indoctrination"" at a local elememtary school, railing against a video of students singing Obama\'s praises.', 'A public library in Burlington County, New Jersey has ordered all of the copies of ""Revolutionary Voices: A Multicultural Queer Youth Anthology"" removed from circulation, after a member of Glenn Beck\'s 9/12 Project complained about the book\'s content. \n \n The library cited ""child pornography"" as its reason for removing the book. \n \n The Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network (GLSEN) describes ""Revolutionary Voices,"" edited by Amy Sonnie, as ""the first creative resource by and for queer and questioning youth of every color, class, religion, gender and ability.""

The reasoning was that the book constituted ""child pornography."" \n \n In an email to the library\'s circulation coordinator, Sweet asked: ""How can we grab the books so that they never, ever get back into ccirculation [sic].

84,"[""The Hendersons have poured their life savings into hover technology and are hoping to create new industries based on this science. \n \n Dustin Rubio, 39, an electrician who grew up skateboarding and saw “Back to the Future Part II” when he was a teenager, is not thinking quite that big. \n \n This year, Mr. Rubio turned “a leaf blower, some plywood, some plastic and duct tape” into a small hovercraft that his daughters used to glide down the driveway at his home in Napa, Calif. “I was like I’m just gonna make something funny and see if it works,” he said. \n \n Unfortunately, his invention is not really a hoverboard. Bob Gale, who wrote the “Back to the Future” trilogy, said that, in his imagination anyway, the hoverboard floats on a magnetic field similar to magnetic levitation trains. \n \n This has been extremely difficult, mostly because of something called Earnshaw’s theorem, which states, more or less, that repelling magnets are tough to balance. One way is to use a track that would hold the magnetic skateboard in place, but what self-respecting skateboarder wants to be constrained to a track? \n \n Superconductors can also levitate things. In 2011, a research group directed by Alain Sacuto, a physics professor at the Université Paris Diderot, used smoking-cold superconductors to levitate a liquid-nitrogen-filled skateboard that he and others rode across a five-meter magnetic rail. \n \n In March, the website Funny or Die released a video that seemed to show the skateboarder Tony Hawk on a real hoverboard. Mr. Hawk later apologized for misleading fans. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n “As early as this morning I had three emails from people: Is this real? Can I buy it?” Rachel Goldenberg, who produced the video, said on Monday. \n \n If you had to time-travel back to 1989 and place a couple of bets on who might invent the hoverboard, Rich DeVaul would have been a good wager. Mr. DeVaul is a senior engineer at Google X, the company’s research division. He is also a longboard skater and a snowboarder. \n \n Slide Show \n \n Last year, Mr. DeVaul and a Google mathematician, Dan Piponi, tried to crack the hoverboard. They got as far as a fingernail-size piece of carbon that could hover above a lattice of small magnets. \n \n They remain confident they could have built a board, but are less confident they could have found a use for it. Mr. DeVaul imagined several applications, like a futuristic assembly line where robotic machine tools could levitate from job to job. \n \n “I was racking my brain because I so wanted to build this damn thing,” he said. \n \n But, he added, “We weren’t sure exactly what big problem we were solving except for this global lack of hoverboard skate parks.” \n \n Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Mr. Henderson, though, doesn’t even skate and his “Hendo Hoverboard” is basically a publicity stunt. \n \n Mr. Henderson became enamored of hover technology in 1989. His inspiration was not “Back to the Future,” but the Loma Prieta earthquake. His idea was that if you could make buildings float, you could build cities to better withstand earthquakes. \n \n Over the next 25 years he graduated from West Point, served in the Army, worked in finance and construction and went to architecture school. He spent most of the last decade designing apartment and condo buildings. Two years ago, he started his company, Arx Pax. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n The business plan is to develop magnetic technologies and license patents to builders, engineering firms, the Green Goblin and anyone else who might need to hover something. \n \n Mr. Henderson may be a dreamer, but he is enough of a realist to understand that people are likely to be more interested in hovering skateboards than they are in his ideas for new kinds of building foundations. \n \n “That’s why we picked the hoverboard: to capture that attention,” he said. “If one in 10 people realize there is another use for this stuff, that would be a great success.” \n \n The Hendo Hoverboard is not yet for sale. On Tuesday, he and his wife will start a campaign to raise $250,000 on Kickstarter, the crowdfunding site. \n \n They won’t be alone. Kickstarter already lists several campaigns for hovering contraptions, including HoverSkater, a hovercraft-like board, and the NeoLev, a miniature hoverboard. \n \n The original hoverboard was also a product of architecture. Mr. Gale, the screenwriter, said that when he and Robert Zemeckis wrote “Back to the Future Part II,” they envisioned a future in which people had abandoned suburban malls for more pedestrian-friendly downtowns. \n \n To showcase the town square, they recreated a skateboard chase from the first film, which takes place in 1955, only this time with a flying skateboard. \n \n Rumors of a real hoverboard began after Mr. Zemeckis told an interviewer that the technology was real but that “parents’ groups” had prevented toy makers from producing the skateboards, prompting an avalanche of letters from boys like Dave Mertes. In November 1989, he wrote Universal Studios asking if he could buy a hoverboard. \n \n Mr. Mertes, now a 36-year-old clothing designer in Seattle, said he was crushed when it turned out that Mr. Zemeckis was joking. “I would have never written to George Lucas asking for a light saber,” he said. “But I was like, oh, the director just said it was real. How can I get one?”"", 'Greg and Jill Henderson are behind a hoverboard that uses a magnetic field to generate lift, and they have turned to crowdfunding to put the finishing touches on their California-based Hendo Hoverboard. They said that ""perfecting it will take a little more time and resources,"" and their target date is October 2015. Their plan is to procure parts from a number of overseas suppliers, with the final assembly in Los Gatos, California. \n \n Engadget described it as ""a self-powered, levitating platform with enough power to lift a fully grown adult."" The technology behind the hoverboard lies in its four disc-shaped hover engines. These create a special magnetic field that pushes against itself, generating the lift that levitates the board off the ground. There is work ahead. The surface needs to be a non-ferromagnetic conductor. ""Right now we use commonly available metals in a simple sheets, but we are working on new compounds and new configurations to maximize our technology and minimize costs,"" the team said on the campaign page. \n \n The campaign\'s hoverboard is a means for the company to draw attention to a larger development, the device\'s technology, and the developer kit option could open up opportunities to leverage this technology in important ways. ""We are putting hover technology in YOUR hands,"" they said. The New York Times said the Hendersons would like to see new industries based on this science. Greg Henderson, CEO of the company, Arx Pax, said the underlying technology is totally scalable. ""The Hendo hoverboard is just the first step,"" he said. ""It\'s a proof of concept for demonstrating a technology that everyone can understand."" Campaign supporters who go for the option of a developer kit will find inside the box the hover engine, to use to build their own projects. ""You no longer have to be a scientist in a lab in order to build the future,"" he remarked. ""The wheel may finally have some competition."" \n \n This video is not supported by your browser at this time. \n \n Their hoverboard is a ""vehicle,"" in a sense, for the core technology which the Hendersons call Magnetic Field Architecture (MFA). As the campaign page explained, ""The Hendo Hoverboard is a first-step product,"" with a vision toward broader MFA implementations. ""It enables a new generation of lift and motion technology that will change the way we view transportation. Additional applications for MFA technology are virtually limitless - from business, to industry, to healthcare, and beyond."" The team would like to see an ecosystem of technologies using MFA. ""Hovering modes of transportation are now possible and practical. Lifting a wide range of loads - whether it\'s a person riding a hoverboard (what we were all expecting) or a building riding out an earthquake (what we never imagined could be possible) - is all within reach."" Another vision is to see a place for using the hoverboard. They said that as their current technology requires special types of surfaces, ""we need a hoverpark to go with our boards, and we have been busy designing a park befitting the awesomeness of our technology."" Arx Pax developed the hover technology used in the Hendo Hoverboard and Whitebox Developer Kit. \n \n For a pledge of $10,000, they said, one can own one of the world\'s first ten Hendo production hoverboards. \n \n Explore further: Quantum levitating (locking) video goes viral \n \n More information: www.kickstarter.com/projects/142464853/hendo-hoverboards-worlds-first-real-hoverboard', 'I initially approached the floating pallet with caution, expecting it to dip and bob under my weight like a piece of driftwood. It didn\'t. The levitating board wiggled slightly under my 200-pound frame, but maintained its altitude (a mere inch or so) without visible strain. Arx Pax tells me that the current prototype can easily support 300 pounds and future versions will be able to hold up to 500 pounds without issue. Either way, you\'ll need to hover over a very specific kind of surface to get it to hold anything: The Hendo uses the same kind of electromagnetic field technology that floats MagLev trains -- meaning it will only levitate over non-ferrous metals like copper or aluminum. \n \n Riding the contraption was a lot fun, but also quite the challenge: The Hendo hoverboard doesn\'t ride at all like McFly\'s flying skateboard. In fact, without a propulsion system, it tends to drift aimlessly. Arx Pax founder and Hendo inventor Greg Henderson says it\'s something the company is working on. ""We can impart a bias,"" he tells me, pointing out pressure-sensitive pads on the hoverboard\'s deck that manipulate the engines. ""We can turn on or off different axes of movement."" Sure enough, leaning on one side of the board convinces it to rotate and drift in the desired direction. Without feeling the friction of the ground, however, I had trouble knowing how much pressure to exert -- Henderson\'s staff had to jump in and save me from spinning out of control. Clearly, this might take some practice. \n \n As fun as its current form is, Henderson didn\'t necessarily set out to reinvent transportation. The Hendo engine\'s original inspiration came from architecture. ""It came from the idea of hovering a building out of harm\'s way,"" he says. ""If you can levitate a train that weighs 50,000 kilograms, why not a house?"" After some prodding, he clarifies the idea as a sort of emergency lifting system that could theoretically raise a building off of its foundation during an earthquake, essentially rendering the natural disaster\'s tremors harmless. The idea sounds as fictional as, well, a hoverboard -- but he already built one of those. Henderson says that floating a building is a long-term goal. Right now, the technology is in its early stages, and he\'s just trying to get it in the hands of engineers with big ideas. \n \n That\'s where the Hendo ""white box"" comes in. Backers who contribute to the company\'s Kickstarter at the $299 level will receive a complete, working Hendo hover engine and enough hover surface to play around with. It\'s a developer kit, Henderson says, and he wants makers to use it to build their own hover projects. If they have an idea they want to take to market, Arx Pax will work with them to make it a reality. ""The most important piece of it all for me is the idea of taking away the limitations of how we think about problems in general. Not just thinking outside the box, but off the page,"" he says, explaining how Hover technology could be used to solve old problems in new ways. ""When you do that -- when you approach problems that were seemingly impossible in different ways -- you\'ll never cease to be amazed by the solutions you can come up with."" \n \n While long-term goals go far beyond that of the not-so-humble hoverboard, there are plenty of Kickstarter goals focused on scratching that itch exclusively. For instance, 250 backers at the $100 level will be eligible for a five-minute ride on one of the company\'s prototype boards, and $1,000 buys a privately coached hour-long ride. Not content with merely renting hover-time? Okay, okay: The first 10 backers to contribute $10,000 will get a hoverboard to keep.

A company called Arx Pax has developed a skateboard-style device that rides on air instead of wheels, and it's raising money to ""perfect"" the project on Kickstarter, Phys.org reports. Arx Pax has already surpassed its $250,000 goal. How it works: Four engines on the board create a magnetic field which ""literally pushes against itself,"" the company says on Kickstarter. That pushes the board upward. Says co-inventor Greg Henderson of his Hendo Hoverboard: ""The wheel may finally have some competition."" Pretty cool, but it's not quite a Marty McFly experience yet, Engadget notes: It only gets about an inch off the ground, and it only works over certain types of metal, including copper and aluminum. It's also very loud, according to the Verge (via Gizmodo). Still, it can hold a 300-pound person, Arx Pax says, though the New York Times adds that the board itself weighs 100 pounds. The paper notes that the Hendo Hoverboard ""is basically a publicity stunt."" What Henderson is really interested in is the broader application of the technology; a building using it, for instance, might be able to ""ride out an earthquake,"" he says.

88,"['Activists say the Damascus killings reflect a new government strategy to deter support for the opposition Free Syrian Army by punishing and intimidating civilians living in areas under rebel control. Videos posted online and accounts from residents point to summary executions occurring on a scale unprecedented since the start of the 17-month-old uprising against the rule of President Bashar al-Assad. \n \n According to the Center for the Documentation of Violations in Syria, which lists victims of violence who have been identified, 730 civilians have been killed in Damascus this month and 529 in Aleppo, a disparity that has increased over the past week as the bodies have piled up in the Syrian capital. \n \n Some of the deaths in the Damascus area have also been caused by shelling and helicopter bombardments, as the government pounds areas known to support the rebels. But most of the dead are civilians who have disappeared in the wake of offensives or have been seized at checkpoints and whose bodies have been discovered in groups of as few as a handful or as many as a several dozen, activists say. \n \n In the most recent discoveries, 11 corpses were found Thursday in an apartment in Kfar Souseh, a day after 24 people were shot execution-style there, according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Five were found in the Tadamon neighborhood. On Wednesday, several dozen bodies were discovered in the Qaboun suburb, tangled together along a roadside, covered in blood and with the throats slit, according to a graphic video posted on YouTube. \n \n Grisly deaths on daily basis \n \n The details of the killings are impossible to confirm, and activists and human rights groups say they are finding it difficult to verify the circumstances of the grisly deaths being recorded daily on videos posted online.

Government forces met with little resistance there, Reuters reports; rebels had already cleared out of the town. Damascus isn't getting as much press as Aleppo, but it's become an epicenter of violence in Syria, the Washington Post reports. Rebels typically flee in the face of Syrian troop advances, but their departure is followed by the slaughter of civilians in their wake. By one group's count, 730 civilians have been killed in the capital this month, compared to 529 in Aleppo. Dozens of mutilated, bloodied bodies have been found recently in the streets of formerly rebel-held Damascus neighborhoods. The regime is punishing rebel supporters, one activist said, ""and the punishment is applied equally to those who are active in the revolution and also those who are just living there."" The victims are mostly men, including the elderly, and many show signs of torture. ""Frankly, there are few witnesses,"" a Human Rights Watch official says.

Robel Phillipos (R), the teenager accused of lying to FBI agents in the Boston Marathon bombing investigation, appears in court in Boston, Massachusetts in this May 6, 2013 court sketch. Phillipos was ordered freed on $100,000 bail on Monday pending a later trial date. \n \n BOSTON (Reuters) - The teenager accused of lying to FBI agents in the Boston Marathon bombing case was freed on $100,000 bail on Monday pending a later trial date, and investigators said bomb fragments suggest they were less sophisticated than homemade ones used by insurgents. \n \n While out on bail, Robel Phillipos will be under the custody of his mother and must wear a GPS bracelet, U.S. Magistrate Judge Marianne Bowler ordered in federal court in Boston. The $100,000 bail for the 19-year-old was secured by real estate put up by a third party, the judge said. \n \n Phillipos, of Cambridge, Massachusetts, is accused of making false statements to FBI agents investigating the April 15th attack that killed three people and injured 264 near the marathon\'s finish line. He was not charged with direct involvement in the attack. \n \n Phillipos\' mother was ""very emotional,"" after the ruling, the teenager\'s attorney, Derege Demissie, said. About 60 people, including friends, family and a large contingent from the Boston Ethiopian community, appeared in the courthouse on Monday showing their support. \n \n Defense lawyers argued he was not a flight risk, has no prior criminal history and can refute FBI allegations that he interfered with their investigation, court records show. In affidavits of support filed with the court, Phillipos is described as a social worker\'s caring son who read to kindergarten students. \n \n Last week, U.S. authorities charged Phillipos and two 19-year-old students from Kazakhstan with interfering with their investigation as a manhunt for suspects Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was under way. \n \n After the hearing, Phillipos walked through the courthouse wearing street clothes and a black baseball cap and was surrounded by the contingent of family and friends. \n \n Federal investigators, meanwhile, are focusing on two main points in their continuing investigation. \n \n They are examining forensic evidence, most notably computers seized from the suspects and possibly their associates, a U.S. national security official said. They are also focused on a trickle of evidence that is coming in from Russian authorities, the official said. \n \n All the analyses of the bomb fragments and related evidence suggests that the bombs were very unsophisticated, far less so than homemade bombs used by insurgents in places like Iraq. \n \n Investigators believe it is quite likely that the bomb designs at least partly came from the article ""How to build a bomb in the kitchen of your mom,"" published a couple of years ago by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula\'s ""Inspire"" magazine and then republished earlier this year in a glossy brochure entitled the ""Lone Mujahid Pocketbook."" \n \n FINDING BURIAL SITE \n \n The family of Tamerlan Tsarnaev, killed in a police gun battle, struggled on Monday to find a burial site for him. \n \n Relatives have said they want to have him buried locally, but several cemeteries in Massachusetts said they would not accept the remains. Under Islamic law, the body cannot be cremated, a procedure used in some cases of notorious criminals such as Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh. \n \n Phillipos and the two Kazakhstan teens are described as college friends of the surviving suspect, 19-year-old Dzhokhar. Authorities charged the Kazakhs, Azamat Tazhayakov and Dias Kadyrbayev, with conspiring to obstruct justice by disposing of a backpack containing fireworks they found in Tsarnaev\'s dorm room. \n \n Lawyers for Phillipos point out that he has not been charged with removing or tampering with evidence, but with lying to authorities about the conduct of his friends. \n \n Their cover-up, as alleged by investigators, happened after the FBI released surveillance photos of Dzhokhar and Tamerlan. Dzhokhar was found bleeding while hiding in a covered boat in a back yard in Watertown, a Boston suburb. \n \n Phillipos was born in Boston and raised in Cambridge as part of a loving Ethiopian extended family, according to affidavits filed in federal court. \n \n Richard Feigenberg, who taught math to Phillipos in the seventh and eighth grades, described his former student as a caring member of the school community. \n \n ""When I asked for someone to take out the trash or read to a kindergarten student, it was most often Robel who volunteered,"" Feigenberg said in an affidavit. ""He always had a wonderful smile that warmed the whole classroom."" \n \n Relatives of Phillipos described him as a kind, polite and respectful young man, according to affidavits. \n \n ""When I heard the news of Robel\'s arrest, I was extremely shocked and heartbroken,"" said Kifle Alemu, an uncle. ""I was unable to wrap my mind around what was going on, especially knowing Robel as a gentle young man who has never been in any trouble."" \n \n (Additional reporting by Mark Hosenball in Washington; Editing by Doina Chiacu and Philip Barbara)', 'Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

The $3.99 trillion plan for the budget year that begins Oct. 1 is founded on higher taxes both for the wealthy and corporations; some money will come from closing loopholes, USA Today reports. The budget aims ""to bring middle-class economics into the 21st century,"" the White House says. Among its key points: That $3.99 trillion in spending meets with projected revenues of $3.53 trillion, for a deficit of $474 billion, or 2.5% of GDP. The AP reports the plan doesn't zero out the deficit over the next decade, but the administration maintains that various actions on health care, immigration, and taxes would trim the deficits by about $1.8 trillion over that period, leaving the red ink at manageable levels. Indeed, the goal is a ""sustainable"" deficit below 3% of GDP, Politico reports. Companies like General Electric and Microsoft would face a one-time 14% tax on what's thought to be $2.1 trillion in profits ""piled up abroad,"" Reuters reports; firms would owe 19% on foreign profits in the future. Sequestration spending ceilings would end, USA Today reports, and domestic and military spending would climb by 7%, with infrastructure and education seeing benefits. Some $3 billion would go to science and math education. The bill would also cover two years' tuition for some community college students at a cost of $60 billion over 10 years. Also put forward: an up-to-$3,000 child care tax credit. The plan also puts forward $14 billion for upping cybersecurity, proposes paid-leave programs, and calls for $1 billion put toward a ""fully democratic"" Central America.

94,"['Trump may have found a way to tie Facebook’s hands as it investigates Russian interference into the election. \n \n Without citing any evidence or even a reason, Donald Trump today declared that “Facebook was always anti-Trump”. That’s despite Trump’s campaign heavily relying on targeted Facebook ads during the election to rally citizens sympathetic to his brand of nationalism. \n \n This morning Trump tweeted, “Facebook was always anti-Trump.

Virtually no President has accomplished what we have accomplished in the first 9 months-and economy roaring”. \n \n Facebook was always anti-Trump.The Networks were always anti-Trump hence,Fake News, @nytimes(apologized) & @WaPo were anti-Trump. Collusion? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2017 \n \n Despite the claim, Facebook’s share price is still up 1.35% today, showing investors don’t believe the tweet foreshadows Trump meddling with Facebook’s business. \n \n [Update: Mark Zuckerberg has responded to Trump’s tweet, writing “Trump says Facebook is against him. Liberals say we helped Trump. Both sides are upset about ideas and content they don’t like. That’s what running a platform for all ideas looks like.” Zuckerberg went on to describe how Facebook’s impact on the election was more about giving everyone including the candidates a voice than malicious interference or bias.] \n \n From one angle, though, Trump might be right. Facebook is led by liberals who support immigrants and refugees, the LGBT community, and equal rights for women and muslims — all of which Trump has railed against. \n \n “I hear fearful voices calling for building walls and slowing immigration” CEO Mark Zuckerberg said at Facebook’s April 2016 F8 developer conference. He advocated that the country “Instead of building walls, build bridges. And instead of dividing people, we can help bring people together.” Zuckerberg has also directly spoken out against Trump’s moves against Dreamers who immigrated to the US as children, and his push for a transgender troop ban. \n \n I attended then-President Barack Obama’s townhall at Facebook HQ in 2011, and it was clear that the employee section enthusiastically whooped it up for Democrat policies and grumbled when Obama and Zuckerberg discussed the Republican agenda. \n \n Yet on the other side, Facebook has purposefully tried to avoid seeming biased against conservatives. Anonymous reports to Gizmodo claimed that Facebook’s Trending news team purposefully suppressed conseverative news outlets. \n \n While Facebook’s internal investigation supposedly found no evidence of this, it made stiff changes to how Trends were surfaced, and moved to a mostly algorithm-driven system to reduce the potential human bias. It also met with conservative news outlets to promise them a balanced platform. \n \n Some believe this scandal is what led Facebook to be soft in its initial response to fake news during the election, as this content was more commonly pushed by right wing new media sources. Gizmodo reported that Facebook shelved an anti-fake news update to its News Feed during the election for fear of provoking Republican backlash against the platform. That could both endanger Facebook’s ad-driven business model, but also could have pushed conservatives off the social network, worsening the polarization of the country. \n \n In the end, Facebook was blamed for allowing fake news to proliferate in ways that might have assisted Trump’s election victory. \n \n And so, here we may find a rationale for Trump’s criticism of Facebook today. If he can embolden critics who say Facebook leans left, the company may be less aggressive in tackling fake news and its on-going investigation into Russian interference in the election. It could also deter Facebook from potentially penalizing or blocking Trump’s Facebook account for distributing hate or threats more , as many have called on Twitter to do. \n \n Facebook today outlined 11 tactics it used to thwart interference in the Germany federal election. But it could encounter resistance from Trump’s followers for trying to implement these in the U.S. \n \n As long as Facebook must actively combat the perception that it’s anti-Trump, it may have to act more pro-Trump, or at least neutral in the face of his incendiary actions.', 'Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg: ""Trump says Facebook is against him.

And as a man obsessed by data and metrics, he\'s probably looking at the problem of Russian-backed fake news ads and seeing it as a minuscule part of all the election goings-on on his network of 2 billion people. \n \n But it\'s not the scale that\'s the issue here - but his immature refusal to face up to the public\'s concerns. It was less cover up, more can\'t-be-bothered. \n \n Mark Zuckerberg has surely by now realised that he must answer his users\' concerns, even when he doesn\'t share them.

In spite of being filmed, photographed, and seen by eyewitnesses during their attacks, most of them still remain at large. We will identify them and bring them to justice ourselves. \n \n Neither state nor federal law enforcement have been able to independently identify a single one of DeAndre Harris’ attackers. These men were caught on several audio visual recordings, from various angles, in high definition, bludgeoning DeAndre with blunt objects as he curled into a ball and attempted to shield himself from their repeated blows. The men taunted and pursued him when he was finally able to escape and then regrouped and marched together right passed a local police station. Afterward the uploaded video to the internet bragging about the assault. “They were beating that nigger on the ground! It was glorious!!! I got the whole thing [on camera]!” Images of the men prior to the attack, during the attack, immediately after the attack, have been shared with Charlottesville PD and the FBI. The men wore symbols indicating the hate groups they are affiliated with. The men were photographed and recorded throughout the week interacting with known associates. iPhone 8 and Google have facial recognition software, so we'd imagine law enforcement has similar, hypothetically more advanced, identification programs. The same notwithstanding, police have failed to identify any of the several assailants not first gift-wrapped and delivered to them with their full name, address and place of birth by social justice advocate and writer Shaun King. At least four men remain at large. \n \n \n \n At this point it is clear, it’s on us. We cannot wait around for law enforcement to identify or capture white supremacist who criminally attack black people or others who speak out against injustice. We cannot rely on police to get justice for DeAndre and others who have been attacked. We will do it ourselves. \n \n \n \n We are hoping to crowd-source #JusticeForDeAndre by raising funds for three areas \n \n (1) A cash reward for anyone with information leading to the identification and arrest of DeAndre’s attackers \n \n (2) Hiring private investigators to do the job of law enforcement \n \n (3) create a general fund for anyone who is able to provide identifying information on Neo-Nazi’s guilty of criminal acts against citizens. \n \n We are committing to pursuing justice for DeAndre and other victims of racism no matter what value law enforcement gives this pursuit.

Photographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg \n \n Mark Zuckerberg has decided he’s a $1-a-year man. \n \n Zuckerberg, who is Facebook Inc. (FB:US)’s chief executive officer and also the 22nd richest person in the world as ranked by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, was paid $1 in salary for 2013, according to a regulatory filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday. That’s down from a base salary of $503,205 in 2012, the year that Facebook went public. \n \n Zuckerberg is following the well worn path of other Silicon Valley technology moguls who also chose to take on the symbolic annual salary of $1 after they were already wealthy. Apple Inc.’s late co-founder Steve Jobs helped popularize the practice, which is today also espoused by Google Inc. co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, among others.

He saw his net worth balloon last year as Facebook’s stock more than doubled (FB:US) in value. The 29-year-old has ramped up his public service and philanthropy, including starting a group called Internet.org to connect the world to the Web. \n \n Private Planes \n \n Zuckerberg’s total compensation last year was $653,165, down from $1.99 million in 2012. The amount, besides the $1 salary, was for the passenger fees, fuel, crew and catering costs for his use of private planes for personal reasons, as part of his security program, according to the filing. \n \n The CEO also made $3.3 billion last year after exercising stock options to purchase 60 million shares, according to the filing. Zuckerberg offered 41.35 million of those shares in a secondary offering by Facebook in December. At the time, the company said Zuckerberg would use the majority of the proceeds to pay for the taxes incurred in connection with the transaction. He also gifted 18 million shares to charity. \n \n Other Facebook leaders also saw their compensation fall from 2012 levels. Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg received $16.2 million in total compensation in 2013, compared with $26.2 million a year earlier. She became a billionaire in January as Facebook’s shares soared, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. \n \n Chief Financial Officer David Ebersman made $10.5 million in compensation last year, compared with the $17.5 million in 2012.

The Daily Progress reports an arrest warrant has been issued for 20-year-old DeAndre Harris for his alleged attack on an unnamed victim who says it happened shortly before Harris' own beating in a parking garage on Aug. 12. Per WVIR, a Charlottesville Police Department release notes that the victim went to the local magistrate's office to detail the attack allegedly carried out by Harris and to request a warrant. After a detective ""verified"" those facts, a warrant against Harris for unlawful wounding, a felony, was issued. Harris was not yet in custody as of the PD's statement. S. Lee Merritt, one of Harris' attorneys, tells the Washington Post the warrant is ""clearly retaliatory"" and also ""highly unusual"" in that it was issued by a magistrate, not the cops. ""We find it highly offensive and upsetting, but what's more jarring is that he's been charged with the same crime as the men who attacked him,"" Merritt adds. NBC News notes that Merritt started a fundraiser in September for Harris, which has brought in close to $45,000 to help identify and bring to justice his attackers. Two men have already been arrested in that case: Alex Michael Ramos, 33, of Georgia, and Ohio's Daniel Patrick Borden, 18, both charged with malicious wounding. Meanwhile, Zach Roberts, a journalist who took photos of Harris' beating, tweeted that neither Charlottesville cops nor the FBI have had any interest in interviewing him on what he saw that day as a witness, per the Root."

97,"['LONDON -- The European Union has frozen the assets of former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich, two of his sons and more than a dozen advisors who it says are responsible for stealing state funds. \n \n Announcement of the blacklist Thursday came as leaders of the EU’s 28 member countries gathered for an emergency summit in Brussels to try to forge a tough common response to Russia’s incursion into Crimea. \n \n Most of the 18 individuals affected by the asset freeze are members of Yanukovich’s inner circle who were involved in the bloody crackdown on anti-government protesters in Kiev. The blacklist includes the former head of the security service, prosecutor general, justice minister and officials with the department of internal affairs. \n \n The names of ex-Prime Minister Mykola Azarov and his son also appear on the list, as do Yanukovich’s sons Oleksandr, a businessman, and Viktor, a member of parliament. \n \n The EU had signaled its intention Wednesday to impose the sanction but waited until the freeze took effect Thursday to identify the individuals for fear that they might try to move funds out of Europe preemptively. All 18 targets are suspected of “the embezzlement of Ukrainian state funds and their illegal transfer outside Ukraine,” the EU said. \n \n Whether European leaders meeting in Brussels will now slap any sanctions on Russia or individual Russians, following the example of the Obama administration, remains to be seen. \n \n Britain and former Soviet bloc nations such as Poland are eager to come up with some sort of penalty against Moscow. But Germany, which has strong trade ties with Russia, has been cautious. \n \n “We’ve got to demonstrate here in the European Union that we will help the Ukrainian people in their hour of need,” British Prime Minister David Cameron told reporters upon arriving in Brussels. “We need to send a very clear message to the Russian government that what has happened is unacceptable and should have consequences.” \n \n In a show of solidarity with the interim government in Kiev, acting Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk has also been invited to attend the emergency summit. \n \n “This is not just a Ukrainian-Russian crisis. This is the crisis in Europe,” Yatsenyuk said. “We stick to the political option, and it depends on Russia, whether Russia is ready to fix this conflict, whether Russia is ready to have the real debate over the ways how to stabilize the situation.” \n \n The EU has said it is ready to provide Kiev with up to $15 billion in grants and loans to help shore up its parlous finances and stave off a crippling government default. \n \n henry.chu@latimes.com \n \n Twitter: @HenryHChu', 'WASHINGTON (AP) — The Obama administration slapped new visa restrictions Thursday against pro-Russian opponents to the new Ukraine government in Kiev, and cleared the way for upcoming financial sanctions, as the West began punishing Moscow for refusing to withdraw its troops from Ukraine\'s Crimea region. \n \n The new restrictions targeted an unspecified and unidentified number of people and entities that the Obama administration accused of threatening Ukraine\'s sovereignty and territorial borders. They were announced in Washington as Secretary of State John Kerry headed into a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Rome on the sidelines of a diplomatic forum about Libya. \n \n The anticipated financial sanctions will penalize ""those who are most directly involved in destabilizing Ukraine, including the military intervention in Crimea, and does not preclude further steps should the situation deteriorate,"" the White House said in a statement. \n \n ""At the same time, as the president has said, we seek to work with all parties to achieve a diplomatic solution that de-escalates the situation and restores Ukraine\'s sovereignty,"" the statement said. ""We call on Russia to take the opportunity before it to resolve this crisis through direct and immediate dialogue with the Government of Ukraine."" \n \n A senior administration official said the new restrictions are aimed at Russians and Ukrainians in the strategic Crimea region. Crimea is a peninsula that hosts a major Russian navy base and is historically and culturally a stronghold of Russia. \n \n Local government officials in Crimea are now seeking to separate from Ukraine, and on Thursday set a March 16 date for a referendum vote on whether the region should become part of Russia. \n \n Ukraine\'s unrest peaked in February, after months of pro-Western protests seeking the overthrow of the President Viktor Yanukovych in anger over economic woes and corruption. Yanukovych, who is pro-Russian, fled for protection just outside of Moscow, and Russian President Vladimir Putin sent troops into Crimea in a show of force against the upstart government in Kiev. \n \n ___ \n \n Jakes reported from Rome.', ""Rocco Morabito, one of Italy’s most-wanted mafia bosses, slipped up by enrolling daughter at local school under real name \n \n 'Cocaine king of Milan' arrested in Uruguay after 23 years on the run \n \n After 23 years on the run, one of Italy’s most wanted mobsters – the so-called “cocaine king of Milan” – has been arrested at a hotel in Uruguay. \n \n Uruguayan and Italian authorities said Rocco Morabito, 50, a fugitive boss of Italy’s most powerful organised crime group, the Calabrian ‘Ndrangheta, had been living with false papers in the southern coastal resort of Punta del Esta for more than a decade. \n \n Uruguayan police said Morabito, the target of an international arrest warrant since 1995, was detained after a six-month investigation that was triggered after he enrolled his daughter at a local school under his own name. \n \n Morabito, who obtained Uruguayan papers after presenting a false Brazilian passport in the name of Francisco Capeletto, was arrested on Monday at a luxury hotel in Montevideo, Uruguay’s capital, along with his wife, reportedly an Angolan national. \n \n Mafia bosses caught in Italian police raid on mountain hideout Read more \n \n A search of his properties uncovered 13 mobile phones, 12 bank cards, two cars, 150 passport-sized photos of him in various guises plus a Portuguese passport, a quantity of jewels, about $50,000 (£38,500) in cash and a 9mm pistol, the Uruguayan interior ministry said. \n \n \n \n In a statement, Marco Minniti, Italy’s interior minister, congratulated Italian and Uruguayan police for a joint operation that resulted in the apprehension of “the No 1 fugitive” from the ‘Ndrangheta. \n \n Sentenced to 30 years in prison in Italy, Morabito had been sought by police since 1994 after attempting to import almost a tonne of cocaine, worth 13bn lire (£6m), into Italy from Brazil, according to the Corriere della Sera newspaper. \n \n Also suspected of transporting the drug to Milan from elsewhere in the country, he was wanted on charges of belonging to a criminal organisation devoted to international drug trafficking, the Italian interior ministry said. \n \n Thought to have arrived in Uruguay in 2002, Morabito has has been leading “a normal life” since 1994 and has not engaged in any criminal activities since, his lawyer told Italian media. \n \n Pending a formal Italian extradition request, he will be held in Uruguay for at least the next three months for false papers and identity theft, the Uruguayan interior ministry said. \n \n Federico Cafiero de Raho, chief prosecutor for the Calabria region, said Morabito had played “a major role” in cocaine trafficking between South America and Milan, a distribution point for the drug to be sold elsewhere. \n \n He described Morabito as “a key figure” in the ‘Ndrangheta mob, which controls a large part of the world’s cocaine trade. \n \n Italian prosecutors have suggested the organisation tries to ensure the size and quality of its cocaine deals live up to dealer expectations by placing top gang bosses in Latin American so they can be closer to the drug’s producers. \n \n The arrest ticks off one of the Italian interior ministry’s top five list of most wanted organised crime bosses, which also includes the Sicilian mafia boss Matteo Messina Denaro. \n \n Last year Italian anti-mafia police caught two other fugitive ’Ndrangheta bosses after discovering them “living like animals” in a mountain hideout stocked with an arsenal of weapons. \n \n Giuseppe Ferraro, 47, and Giuseppe Crea, 37, both high-ranking members of the organisation, had been on Italy’s list of most dangerous fugitives. Ferraro, convicted of a string of brutal murders, had been on the run for 18 years. Crea, wanted for mafia association and extortion, disappeared 10 years ago.""]",3,"– Ukraine's prime minister yesterday said Crimea would remain part of Ukraine, but Crimea itself isn't exactly on board.

The Crimean parliament voted 78-0 (with eight abstentions) ""to enter into the Russian Federation with the rights of a subject of the Russian Federation,"" reports Reuters, which cites diplomats as saying today's developments could not have occurred without the OK of Vladimir Putin. A Kremlin rep says only that Putin had been made aware of the Crimean vote, and Crimean parliament sources say lawmakers are waiting for Moscow to respond, per the BBC. Ukraine's interim government says the referendum is illegal, and has launched a criminal investigation into Crimea's prime minister. Meanwhile: The EU is holding an emergency session on Ukraine in Brussels today and has made moves to ""punish"" Viktor Yanukovich, reports the New York Times: All assets of Yanukovich, two of his sons, and 15 members of his inner circle held on European soil have been frozen.

The regime\'s track record of torture, sexual violence, air strikes, artillery strikes, barrel bomb, and improvised unguided bombs or air-dropped IEDs, as well as the denial of food, water and medical care, have all been well documented, Jones said. \n \n The Syrian regime has also systematically targeted eastern Aleppo\'s hospitals and made a practice of abducting civilians, Jones said. He said that between 2011 and 2015, the regime has abducted between 65,000 and 117,000 people. \n \n JUST WATCHED Tillerson: US-Russia relations at a low point Replay More Videos ...

It is just one of many detention facilities where prisoners are being held, Jones said. \n \n The ""continued brutality of the Assad regime"" including its use of chemical weapons, represents a continued threat to regional stability and to the United States, Jones said. Given these abuses, ""Russia must now with greater urgency exercise its influence,"" Jones said. \n \n Jones said that despite the talks last week between Tillerson and Lavrov, he ""would not say they have mapped a way forward on how to address Syrian atrocities or how to move forward on the Geneva process,"" which is meant to help establish a political settlement to the conflict. \n \n He said the US has not shown Moscow the photos of the crematorium, but that they have ""an ongoing conversation with the Russians"" about their failure to condemn Syrian atrocities and the climate of tolerance that creates.', 'The U.S. is accusing Bashar al-Assad\'s regime in Syria of killing thousands of people from 2011 to 2015 and using a crematorium to dispose of their bodies.

Add Syria as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Syria news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest \n \n The Trump administration says the regime has killed as many as 50 people a day at the Saydnaya prison complex in that period, and beginning in 2013, it turned a building on the compound into a crematorium. \n \n ""Although the regime\'s atrocities are well documented, we believe that the building of a crematorium is an effort to cover up the extent of mass murders taking place in Saydnaya prison,"" said Stuart Jones, the acting assistant secretary for Near Eastern affairs. ""We are appalled by the atrocities that have been carried out by the Syrian regime, and these atrocities have been carried out seemingly with the unconditional support of Russia and Iran."" \n \n Jones called on Russia in particular to hold the Assad regime accountable. \n \n ""Russia must now with great urgency exercise its influence over the Syrian regime to guarantee that horrific violations stop now,"" he added. \n \n To support the claim today, Jones cited reports from international monitoring groups, the press and U.S. intelligence — including new satellite photos the State Department distributed to the press. The photos allegedly show construction over the course of several years at Saydnaya that would be consistent with a crematorium, with features like ventilation equipment, a discharge stack and a firewall. \n \n DigitalGlobe via US State Department \n \n The U.S. has not presented this evidence to the Russian government yet, according to Jones, but he added that last week\'s talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Washington gave the administration hope that Russia will comply. \n \n ""Foreign Minister Lavrov and the Russian government have indicated to us that they are interested in finding a solution on Syria,"" Jones said. ""We hope that we will now be able to work with the Russians in a constructive way to put pressure on the regime to end these atrocities."" \n \n After more than six years of civil war and continued Russian support for Assad, however, it is hard to see that happening. Jones noted how Russia has supported Assad even after other horrific crimes, including chemical attacks, extrajudicial killings, forced starvation and indiscriminate airstrikes. \n \n ""Russia has either aided in or passively looked away as the regime has conducted an airstrike against a U.N. convoy, destroyed east Aleppo and used chemical weapons, including sarin against civilians in Idlib province on April 4,"" he said. \n \n The accusations of mass killings at Saydnaya are not new. The notorious prison, 17 miles north of Damascus, was the subject of an Amnesty International report in February, alleging that the regime executed 13,000 prisoners in mass hangings and carried out systematic torture there in the last couple of years. Still, Amnesty International could not confirm the existence of a crematorium. \n \n US State Department \n \n ""We haven\'t independently verified the photos, and it\'s not a detail that was included in our report or analysis,"" a spokesperson told ABC News. ""But the statement is certainly a chilling reminder of the horrors highlighted in our report and the urgent need to allow access for independent monitors into Saydnaya and all other prisons in Syria."" \n \n After Lavrov\'s trip to Washington last week, the administration is hoping to seize the moment to push Russia to help solve the Syrian crisis. \n \n ""This was an opportune time to remind people about the atrocities that are being carried out inside of Syria all the time, of which this is one discrete, additive piece of evidence,"" said Jones. \n \n Neither the Assad regime nor the Russian government has responded to the charge so far, but State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert told reporters that the administration believes the U.S. and Russia share a goal in Syria for a ""unified and stable nation,"" achieved through diplomatic and political means.', 'NEW YORK (AP) — Pope Francis made a rousing show of gratitude for American nuns on Thursday while thanking clergy for persevering through the priest sex abuse scandal, seemingly intent on moving the U.S. church beyond recent crises. \n \n A New York City police officer searches nuns outside St. Patrick\'s Cathedral prior to the arrival of Pope Francis in New York, Thursday Sept. 24, 2015.

Francis is expected... (Associated Press) \n \n The pope called religious sisters ""women of strength"" and ""fighters"" who had a ""spirit of courage"" as they served at the forefront of the church. \n \n Six months ago, Francis abruptly ended a contentious Vatican overhaul of the leading umbrella group for U.S. nuns that had started under his predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI. The Vatican accused the Leadership Conference of Women Religious of straying far from church teaching, which the nuns denied, and overemphasizing social justice over abortion. The sisters received a wave of popular support, including parish vigils, protests outside the Vatican embassy in Washington and a congressional resolution commending the sisters for their service to the country. \n \n ""To you, religious women, sisters and mothers of this people, I wish to say thank you, a big thank you and to tell you that I love you very much,"" Francis, an Argentine, said in his native Spanish, to applause from worshippers in an evening prayer service at St. Patrick\'s Cathedral. \n \n In the same talk, Francis told the assembled members of religious orders and diocesan priests that he understood they had ""suffered greatly"" because of the clergy sex crisis and from the ""shame of some of your brothers who harmed and scandalized the church through the most vulnerable of its members."" \n \n ""I accompany you at this time of pain and difficulty, and I thank God for your faithful service to his people,"" Francis said. \n \n The molestation crisis, which first drew public attention in the mid-1980s, erupted in 2002 in the Archdiocese of Boston, then consumed the entire church, compelling bishops to remove hundreds of priests from parish work, pay multimillion-dollar settlements with victims and undergo law enforcement and grand jury investigations in many states. At the height of the scandal, many priests said they stopped wearing their collars so much in public or refrained from hugging or touching any child they didn\'t know well for fear of evoking the misdeeds of others. \n \n It was the pope\'s second reference to the scandal on this trip, his first to the United States. On Wednesday, he commended the U.S. bishops for their ""generous commitment"" to helping victims. The comments have angered advocates for victims, who say American bishops took decisive action only when lawsuits and government investigations revealed documents that showed the scope of the problem. \n \n The Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, denied that the pope was giving short-shrift to victims in his remarks, saying he had acknowledged them by referring to children as ""the most vulnerable"" members of the church. But he also noted that the pope has three more days of public events in the U.S., suggesting further comments more directed at survivors are coming. \n \n Francis has made healing divisions a central theme his U.S. trip, while encouraging bishops and clergy. \n \n He had made a point of expressing his gratitude to U.S. sisters before he arrived. In an ABC News town hall via satellite Aug. 31, with him in Rome and American Catholics in different cities, he asked a nun who works with immigrants in Texas to step forward so he could thank her and, through her, all nuns in the United States. \n \n And in Washington on Wednesday, he paid a surprise visit to the Little Sisters of the Poor, a religious order that runs homes for poor senior citizens. The Little Sisters are suing President Barack Obama over the Affordable Care Act requirement that employers provide insurance that covers birth control. The administration has provided an opt-out for religious objectors that would require insurers to cover contraception instead, but attorneys for the religious order say the accommodation doesn\'t go far enough. \n \n After the cathedral service Thursday, Sister Mary Alice Kizita Otoo, who is from the Handmaids of the Divine Redeemer of Accra, Ghana, but works in New York, said that when the pope spoke, ""I felt something going through my whole body and being."" \n \n Sister Gertrude Lily, of Franciscan Handmaids of the Most Pure Heart of Mary in Harlem, said, ""The pope has recognized the grace of God working in the American nuns."" \n \n On Friday, the pope will speak at the United Nations before heading to Philadelphia, where he will celebrate a weekend Mass on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writer Deepti Hajela contributed to this report.']",3,"– A Syrian military prison that Amnesty International last year called a ""human slaughterhouse"" is reported to be executing upward of 50 prisoners daily, and now a US State Department official says President Bashar al-Assad's regime has built and is using a secret crematorium to dispose of the bodies, Reuters and the Washington Post report. Stuart Jones, the acting assistant secretary for Near Eastern Affairs, puts the number of Syrians who have been rounded up, detained, and ""exterminated"" at the Sednaya prison outside of Damascus in the thousands, and the killings appear to have ""unconditional support"" from both Russia and Iran. Jones, who offered overhead photos of the reported crematorium, said evidence was culled from ""intelligence assessments,"" as well as human rights and other sources. Based on the Amnesty International report, the prisoners are apparently yanked from their cells in the middle of the night, ostensibly to be placed in different cells, then summarily hanged or otherwise killed en masse, per CNN. Jones indicated that while Russia and Iran may not have known specifically about the crematorium, they've certainly been aware of other atrocities said to be taking place, ABC News notes. Jones also had a pessimistic take on a deal last week, negotiated with Russia's help, to set up ""de-escalation zones"" inside the war-torn country to cut down on the violence. ""In light of the failures of the past ceasefire agreements, we have reason to be skeptical,"" Jones said, per Reuters. (The Syrian Kurds are about to get more help from the US.)"

However, he never got a chance to celebrate his popularity with American readers -- he died in 2004, the year before the first of his books was published in the U.S. \n \n Now Norstedts Förlag, Larsson\'s Swedish publisher, has decided that his tattooed heroine, Lisbeth Salander, should return. \n \n Swedish author David Lagercrantz will write a fourth book in the series, the publisher announced. Larsson\'s original plan was to have the series, known as the Millennium series, run for 10 novels. \n \n The announcement comes after a long debate over Larsson\'s estate. He and his partner, Eva Gabrielsson, were together for more than 30 years. When he died of a heart attack in 2004, he had no official will -- and under Swedish law, his entire estate went to his brother and father. Gabrielsson was entitled to nothing. \n \n Legal battles over the estate included who would keep Larsson\'s laptop and who would manage his literary legacy, including possible future books. At one point, Gabrielsson and the Larsson family each claimed they had the materials to move forward with a fourth novel. \n \n The Bookseller, the British trade magazine that had reported on the upcoming Lisbeth Salander novel, doesn\'t make clear whether the estate issues have been resolved. \n \n The next ""Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" book does not yet have a title.

Most tumors that grow from these cells are noncancerous; however, in cases where these types of tumors are cancerous, they are very dangerous, as they are often not diagnosed until the disease is advanced, the NOCC says. \n \n The woman had gone to her gynecologist after she experienced a rapid weight gain — about 10 lbs.

Truth, Lies, Diana, opening in London's West End on Jan. 9 after a run in New York, features the Hewitt character telling a journalist, ""Diana and I started our relationship more than a year before Harry was born. Now, that doesn't prove that I am his father. It's just the inconvenient truth."" According to the Telegraph, playwright Jon Conway says Hewitt really did admit his relationship with Di started 18 months prior to Harry's birth and allowed the play to use this information, during two years of interviews with Conway. Hewitt has also confirmed he was interviewed and said he thinks the play is ""accurate,"" but he says he's never read the script. In the past, however, he's staunchly denied fathering Harry and said he didn't even meet Diana until Harry was a toddler. One more royal rumor, plus one fact: A new book called Backstairs Billy, about a servant to the queen mother, claims she adored him ""mostly because he made her gin and tonics just the way she liked them, nine-tenths gin and one-tenth tonic."" (The book also claims that during the last two decades of her life, ""she was dotty to the point of lunacy."") Hilariously, the queen mother's niece and former lady-in-waiting's rebuttal to the ""disgusting"" rumors, as offered to the Express, includes this line: The queen mother ""never drank a gin and tonic, not ever. ...

102,"['Senate Republicans pressed Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan Wednesday on her lack of judicial experience and her support for a policy that once banned military recruiters from some college campuses in her first appearance on Capitol Hill since her nomination earlier this week. \n \n Following in the tradition of past Supreme Court nominees, Kagan visited the offices of key senators for private meetings lasting about 30 minutes each. Kagan, the U.S. solicitor general, said almost nothing publicly, ignoring questions shouted at her by reporters as she walked through the halls of Congress with four White House officials in tow. \n \n Most of the five members she has met with so far -- three Democrats and two Republicans -- have said little in detail about their sessions. But Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, which will hold Kagan\'s nomination hearings, said he aired GOP concerns about her lack of judicial experience. \n \n ""She indicated she felt she had the experience to do the job, and she didn\'t hesitate in that answer,"" Sessions said after his session with Kagan. If confirmed to replace Justice John Paul Stevens, Kagan would be the only current member of the court who did not previously serve as an appeals court judge. \n \n Sessions also said he remained concerned about Kagan\'s criticism of the U.S. military\'s recruitment efforts at Harvard Law School when she was dean. Kagan signed a legal brief, along with numerous other law schools and professors, defending the right of universities to bar recruiters because of the military\'s ""don\'t ask, don\'t tell"" policy. \n \n ""That you think you could disagree with a legal policy of the military and that would allow you to in any way inhibit their ability to come to your campus I think indicates some of the dangers of being in the rarefied atmosphere of the academy,"" Sessions said after the meeting. \n \n Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) said he was worried Kagan might be a ""rubber stamp"" for the policies of the Obama administration. \n \n Democrats, as expected, praised Kagan. After meeting with her, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (Nev.) described Kagan as ""the right choice to replace Justice Stevens."" He pledged to make her path to the nation\'s highest court ""as smooth as possible."" \n \n Kagan\'s arrival on Wednesday created a familiar spectacle on Capitol Hill. As occurred after the nominations of John G. Roberts Jr. and Sonia Sotomayor, at the start of each meeting, dozens of reporters and photographers entered the suite of the senator hosting the session. \n \n While photographers snapped pictures of Kagan sitting beside the senator, reporters shouted questions. Kagan smiled and bobbed her head occasionally, but never said a word except ""thank you"" to the senator she was meeting with. \n \n It\'s not yet clear if Kagan is offering a ""repetition of platitudes,"" the phrase the nominee herself used in a 1995 article to describe how Supreme Court nominees speak to the senators during the confirmation process. Back then, she called for the Senate to explore ""the essential rightness -- the legitimacy and the desirability -- of exploring a Supreme Court nominee\'s set of constitutional views and commitments."" \n \n Nominees generally don\'t answer such pointed questions, arguing that their answers could prejudice them if they heard a potential case.', 'Please enable Javascript to watch this video \n \n CAPE GIRARDEAU, MO - Students on the campus of Southeast Missouri State are expressing support for University President Dr. Carlos Vargas after he issued an apology for drinking beer from a beer bong during a recent tailgating event at a football game in Carbondale, IL.

Amri's family members, speaking from his hometown of Oueslatia in central Tunisia, were shaken to learn he's the prime suspect in Monday's truck attack, which killed 12. Amri, who turned 24 on Thursday, left Tunisia years ago for Europe but had been in regular contact with his brothers via Facebook and phone. ""I ask him to turn himself into the police,"" brother Abdelkader Amri tells the AP. ""If it is proved that he is involved, we dissociate ourselves from it."" He says his brother may have been radicalized in prison in Italy, where he went after leaving Tunisia in the wake of the Arab Spring uprisings. In other developments: German media reported several locations were searched overnight, including a house in Dortmund and a refugee home in Emmerich on the Dutch border. Federal prosecutors, who are leading the investigation, declined to comment. The manhunt also prompted police in Denmark to search a Sweden-bound ferry in the port of Grenaa after receiving tips that someone resembling Amri had been spotted. But police said they found nothing indicating his presence. German officials had deemed Amri, who arrived in the country last year, a potential threat long before the attack. They had been trying to deport him after his asylum application was rejected, and politicians are now bickering over what conclusions should be drawn. The Berlin market that was attacked has reopened. Concrete blocks have been put in place at the roadside to heighten security. Organizers decided to reopen the market next to the central Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church on Thursday, though without party music or bright lighting. Berliners and visitors have laid candles and flowers at the site in tribute. Israel Foreign Ministry rep Emmanuel Nahshon said Thursday that citizen Dalia Elyakim was among those killed in the attack. Elyakim was visiting Berlin with her husband Rami and had been missing since the attack. Her husband was seriously wounded but is now stable. The couple, in their 60s, loved to travel, friends say. Donald Trump, when asked Wednesday if the attack in Berlin would cause him to evaluate the proposed ban or a possible registry of Muslims in the United States, said ""You know my plans. All along, I've been proven to be right, 100% correct,"" the AP reports. "" A transition rep said later that Trump's plans ""might upset those with their heads stuck in the politically correct sand."""

The credits include time the Grammy winner has spent in rehab and jail, as well as credits for good behavior while behind bars. \n \n His admission came in a felony assault case filed after Brown attacked pop singer Rihanna hours before the 2009 Grammy Awards. The pair was dating at the time. \n \n Brown has been in custody since mid-March, when he was arrested after being dismissed from a court-ordered rehab sentence. \n \n Brown faces a misdemeanor assault charge in Washington after a man accused the singer of hitting him outside a hotel in the nation\'s capital. \n \n Brown responded ""Yes sir,"" repeatedly to questions posed by Brandlin during Friday\'s hearing, including a question about whether he was acknowledging he committed a crime in Washington. It is unclear whether that will have any impact on Brown\'s pending case. \n \n Brandlin said Brown will have to complete the remainder of his 1,000 hours of community labor once he is released from jail. \n \n The judge said he took into account that Brown was relatively young when he attacked Rihanna, and that he had a previously undiagnosed mental illness before the case began. \n \n Brown, 25, will remain on probation until Jan. 23, Brandlin ordered. \n \n ___ \n \n Anthony McCartney can be reached at http://twitter.com/mccartneyAP', ""Chris Brown Ordered to 131 More Days in Jail \n \n Chris Brown's Jail Sentence Extended -- Ordered to 131 More Days Behind Bars \n \n Breaking News \n \n has just been sentenced to spend another 4-plus months in jail ... for violating his probation in the Rihanna case ... but the reality is, he could be released by week's end.Brown was in court Friday afternoon ... where he admitted he violated his probation by getting into a fight with a dude in Washington D.C.That's all the judge needed to hear.

105,"['Crude oil prices–and the shares of U.S. oil and gas companies–surged over 8% Wednesday as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) agreed to cut its output by some 1.2 million barrels a day to end a global glut. \n \n If fully implemented, the deal will effectively end the price war started by Saudi Arabia two years ago in its efforts to wrest market share back from U.S., a ploy that has wrecked the budgets of many OPEC members including Saudi itself. \n \n Crucially, the deal is dependent on persuading major non-OPEC producers such as Russia to cut output too, by a total of 600,000 barrels a day. Moscow, having previously said it would only freeze production at current (record high) levels, has now committed to cut by 300,000 barrels a day, OPEC President and Qatari Energy Minister Mohammed Saleh al-Sada told a press conference in Vienna after the meeting. \n \n Al-Sada said that Saudi Arabia would take the biggest hit, cutting by 486,000 barrels a day to just over 10 million. Reuters reported that Iran, Saudi’s biggest rival in the cartel, had agreed to freeze its output close to current levels, which would represent a major diplomatic coup for the Islamic Republic in the face of heavy Saudi pressure to share the pain. \n \n “We believe it is very much achievable,” al-Sada said. \n \n But the actual cut isn’t as big as OPEC would like to present it. The cartel has simply stopped counting the 750,000 barrels a day produced by Indonesia, on the grounds that it is no longer an oil exporter. And there is no way of knowing how Russia will measure its contribution yet. In the past it has merely chosen to defer planned output increases. \n \n The exact production quotas are still to be published. \n \n Shares in the biggest U.S. shale producers exploded on the deal, as the threat of a longer price war receded. EOG Resources (eog), Apache Corp (spa), and Chesapeake Energy (chi) all rose by over 8% on the news. Conventional heavyweights ExxonMobil (xom), Chevron (cvx), and Conocophillips (cop) also gained strongly, lifting the S&P 500 to a new record high. At midday, the benchmark futures contract for U.S. crude was up 8.5% to $49.08, which was a five-week high. \n \n “I don’t think this means that we’re going back to a world of $100 oil or even $75 oil, but it does mean that we’re not going back to a world of $28 any time soon,” Andy Brogan, global oil and gas transaction leader at EY, told Fortune. \n \n As a result, shale companies can be more confident about drilling, and banks can be more confident about lending to them, Brogan said. The key variable, he noted, will be how quickly, and how cost-effectively, the industry can do that–given that the carnage in the oil services sector since 2014 has “hollowed out” the supply chain. \n \n If the cut sticks, then the International Energy Agency reckons that the world market could “move from surplus to deficit very quickly in 2017,” leading prices to rise sharply once the existing stock overhang is depleted. \n \n The question is, though, will it stick? Or will a reviving shale industry simply enjoy a free ride on OPEC’s discipline? \n \n “If you get to the next OPEC meeting and all that has happened is that shale has replaced the entire cut, then there is a risk that they’ll think again,” EY’s Brogan said.', ""VIENNA (Reuters) - OPEC has agreed its first oil output cuts since 2008 after Saudi Arabia accepted “a big hit” on its production and dropped its demand on arch-rival Iran to slash output, pushing up crude prices by around 10 percent. \n \n Fast-growing producer Iraq also agreed to curtail its booming output, while non-OPEC Russia will join output cuts for the first time in 15 years to help the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries prop up oil prices. \n \n “OPEC has proved to the skeptics that it is not dead. The move will speed up market rebalancing and erosion of the global oil glut,” said OPEC watcher Amrita Sen from consultancy Energy Aspects. \n \n The cut did not come without a casualty, however. Indonesia, the producer group’s only East Asian member, said it would suspend its membership after rejoining only this year as it was not willing to comply with the output cuts sought. \n \n Following news of the deal, the price for Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, surged to settle up nearly 9 percent. They eased slightly in early Asian trading on concerns that other producers, especially U.S. shale drillers, could fill any gap. \n \n The agreement came despite huge political hurdles. Iran and Russia are effectively fighting two proxy wars against Saudi Arabia, in Yemen and Syria, and many skeptics had said the countries would struggle to find a compromise. \n \n Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said ahead of the meeting that the kingdom was prepared to accept “a big hit” on production to get a deal done. \n \n “I think it is a good day for the oil markets, it is a good day for the industry and ... it should be a good day for the global economy. I think it will be a boost to global economic growth,” he told reporters after the decision. \n \n SOME CAUTION ON CUTS \n \n Some observers were more cautious. \n \n “This is an agreement to cap production levels, not export levels,” British bank Barclays said in a note. “The outcome is consistent with ... what OPEC production levels were expected to be in 2017, irrespective of the deal reached.” \n \n Despite Wednesday’s price surge, oil prices are still only at levels last seen in September and October, when plans for a cut were first announced, and are at less than half their levels of mid-2014, when the glut started. \n \n OPEC produces a third of global oil, or around 33.6 million barrels per day, and under the Wednesday deal it would reduce output by around 1.2 million bpd from January 2017. \n \n That would take its output to January 2016 levels, when prices fell to over 10 year lows. \n \n Saudi Arabia will take the lion’s share of cuts by reducing output by almost 0.5 million bpd to 10.06 million bpd. Its Gulf OPEC allies - the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Qatar - would cut by a total 0.3 million bpd. \n \n Iraq, which had insisted on higher output quotas to fund its fight against Islamic State militants, unexpectedly agreed to reduce production - by 0.2 million bpd. \n \n Iran was allowed to boost production slightly from its October level - a victory for Tehran, which has long argued it needs to regain market share lost under Western sanctions. \n \n OPEC President Qatar's Energy Minister Mohammed bin Saleh al-Sada and OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo address a news conference after a meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in Vienna, Austria, November 30, 2016. REUTERS/Heinz-Peter Bader \n \n WILL OPEC COMPLY? \n \n Falih had long insisted OPEC would limit output only if non-OPEC producers contributed. \n \n OPEC president Qatar said non-OPEC producers had agreed to reduce output by a further 0.6 million bpd, of which Russia would contribute some 0.3 million. \n \n Russia had previously resisted participating and instead pushed production to new records in recent months. \n \n “Russia will gradually cut output in the first half of 2017 by up to 300,000 barrels per day, on a tight schedule as technical capabilities allow,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said from Moscow. \n \n Novak, who spoke an hour after OPEC announced its deal, did not say from which output levels Russia would cut. \n \n Non-OPEC Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan have said they might also cut. \n \n “With the deal agreed to in principle and country level quotas established, focus will now shift to implementation,” Goldman Sachs said in a note to clients. \n \n OPEC will hold talks with non-OPEC producers on Dec. 9. The organization will also have its next meeting on May 25 to monitor the deal and could extend it for six months, Qatar said. \n \n INDONESIA SUSPENDS MEMBERSHIP \n \n Indonesia, the cartel’s only Asian member, said it would suspend its membership as it wasn’t willing to cut its production as agreed by OPEC. \n \n Slideshow (12 Images) \n \n “The meeting... requested for Indonesia to cut around 5 percent of its production or around 37,000 barrels per day... As a net oil importing country, a cut to production capacity would not benefit Indonesia,” the country’s Energy and Mineral Resources Ministry said in a statement. \n \n Indonesia has a patchy OPEC membership history. After first joining in 1962, it left in 2009 as dwindling production meant that Southeast Asia’s most populous country had become a net importer of crude oil, which is against OPEC’s statute for full membership. \n \n Despite this, it re-joined OPEC in early 2016. Indonesia’s suspension will not affect OPEC’s overall reduction as its share of cuts will be redistributed among other members."", ""Oil prices rose to some of their highest prices of the year Thursday, building on gains made after OPEC struck a long-sought agreement to reduce production by 1.2 million barrels a day. \n \n U.S. crude futures briefly topped their one-year-high of $51.60, hit in October, before settling at $51.06 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, up $1.62, or 3.28%, from Wednesday’s close. Brent, the global benchmark, gained $2.10, or 4.05%, to $53.94 a barrel—the highest settlement value since August 2015. \n \n The agreement struck by representatives of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries marked the group’s first concerted effort to slash output since 2008. \n \n Market participants were skeptical in the days leading up to the meeting that major producers would be able to put aside their differences, and the deal caught some by surprise. U.S. crude futures rose more than 9.3% Wednesday. \n \n And questions remain about whether countries will stick to the agreement. But optimism is growing that the cut, representing about 1% of global production, will help to reduce a supply glut that has depressed prices for more than two years. \n \n “Market forces have brought supply and demand back close to balance already. The cuts are more intended to accelerate the rebalancing process and in particular the drawdown of the large inventory overhang,” said Gordon Gray, global head of oil and gas equity research at HSBC . \n \n The group is expected to reassess the effectiveness of the deal in six months. \n \n Related Video Rising oil prices in the wake of OPEC's production cut could further weigh on demand among Asia's emerging energy importers, where weakening currencies have already led to higher prices. Photo: CCTV \n \n Analysts say the biggest question remains enforcement, as OPEC has no authority to make its members comply. OPEC members have a history of producing beyond their allotted quotas. Adam Longson, commodities analyst at Morgan Stanley , said that OPEC exceeded its quota by an average of 883,000 barrels a day from 2000-2008. \n \n “Do I think there’s a possibility these guys will not honor their quotas? Yes. They’ve proven in the past numerous times that they can get out of the market what they want,” said Gene McGillian, research manager for Tradition Energy. \n \n Still, analysts were hopeful that the agreement could move oil supply and demand closer together more quickly than would happen if OPEC members keep pumping at current high levels, even if the actual cuts turn out to be smaller than what was announced. \n \n “While we acknowledge that OPEC’s record of delivering on production cuts has historically been poor, on a net basis we expect this to tighten crude markets,” said Scott Darling, the head of Asia-Pacific oil and gas research at J.P. Morgan . \n \n An OPEC news conference on Wednesday. Photo: Bloomberg News \n \n And some said markets have been buoyed by the signal that OPEC is returning to its policy of taking collective action to keep prices from cratering—a reversal from two years ago when the group essentially lifted all output quotas, allowing more supply to come to an already flooded market. \n \n “Although this may seem like a drop in the bucket of rebalancing the global supply/demand equation, the coordination seems to be enough for the markets to hang their hat on for now,” analysts at TAC Energy wrote in a research note Thursday. \n \n Higher prices, however, are likely to cause more U.S. shale producers to increase production. \n \n The latest production data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration showed U.S. production increased by 9,000 barrels a day to 8.7 million barrels for the week ended Nov. 25. \n \n “There is a real risk that higher prices could reactivate more dormant shale oil,” said ANZ Research, which expects international oil prices to hit strong resistance at around $60 a barrel in early 2017. \n \n Another wild card is the cooperation of non-OPEC producers, which are expected to decrease production by 600,000 barrels a day. Russia said it would cut production by 300,000 barrels a day, though it isn’t clear how much of that will come from already expected declines. \n \n “In fact, we’re not even fully confident that Russia will freeze production, particularly if the market tempts them with higher prices,” said Tim Evans, a Citi Futures analyst. \n \n Gasoline futures rose 6.45 cents, or 4.35%, to settle at $1.547 a gallon. Diesel futures rose 7.16 cents, or 4.54%, to $1.6479 a gallon. \n \n Write to Sarah McFarlane at sarah.mcfarlane@wsj.com, Alison Sider at alison.sider@wsj.com and Jenny W. Hsu at jenny.hsu@wsj.com"", 'It is not often that the interests of an industry cartel and the global environment are aligned, but the Opec agreement to limit oil production may prove to be just one. The agreement, for the first cut in eight years, had an immediate impact on the oil market. The benchmark Brent crude rose by about 8 per cent to more than $50 a barrel. Since the dollar has been strengthening this year – it touched a 14-year high earlier this month – the underlying rise in the price of oil has been even greater. \n \n The decision is welcome in a number of ways. For a start, it shows that two historic enemies in the Middle East, Saudi Arabia and Iran, are able to settle their differences for the oil industry’s greater good. And it shows that Iraq can be swept into a wider agreement. All this bodes well for stability in a notoriously unstable region. \n \n In addition, higher prices will feed through into other energy prices, and into the global supply chain. Petroleum is an important chemical feedstock. Under normal circumstances more expensive energy and higher inflation would be unwelcome. But in the present world of falling prices in many countries and zero or near-zero interest rates, a little inflation would be helpful. It would reinforce the return to more normal financial conditions associated with a fiscal stimulus in the US and elsewhere. \n \n But perhaps the most solid reason for welcoming higher oil prices would be the support it will give to the renewable energy industries. The more expensive oil and gas are, the greater the financial pressure to shift to non-carbon alternatives. At the moment most alternative sources of energy require subsidies to make them competitive. The price of alternatives – solar power in particular – is falling fast and the world is already close to the point where in some regions no subsidies will be required. The declining cost of electricity storage further increases the attraction of non-carbon energy. The higher the oil and gas prices, the closer that tipping point. \n \n The rise in the oil price, if sustained, will have two other substantial effects: it will help shore up public finances in Russia; and it will support uplift in oil production in the US. \n \n Russia depends on energy and raw material exports, which together account for some 80 per cent of its foreign currency earnings. It is also a vital source of tax revenue. It has been calculated that to balance its budget, Russia needs an oil price of around $100 a barrel. That may be too high, and in any case it will have been reduced the fall of the rouble. Nevertheless the plain truth is that more expensive oil will bring financial relief to Russia, though quite how it responds in political terms is unclear. \n \n As for the US, its shale oil industry has been the main force disrupting the global oil balance – without it, the collapse of the oil price two years ago would hardly have happened. Now there will be some recovery of production and that will limit the climb. But that, surely, is not a bad outcome for the world as a whole: more expensive oil, but not so expensive as to disrupt the world economy.

OPEC’s decision on Wednesday, Nov. 30,... (Associated Press) \n \n DALLAS (AP) — OPEC\'s decision to cut production gave an immediate boost to oil prices, but the impact on consumers and the U.S. economy is likely to be more modest and gradual. \n \n The cartel agreed Wednesday to cut output by 1.2 million barrels a day, reversing a strategy that produced lower oil prices and pain for U.S. drillers but saved money for consumers. \n \n Even if OPEC members carry through on their promises, global oil production would only fall by about 1 percent. There is still more supply than demand — the reason oil prices collapsed beginning in mid-2014. \n \n The price of oil shot up 9 percent to near $50 a barrel. If the price keeps rising, some of the slack from OPEC cuts will be picked up by producers in the United States — good news for drillers and oilfield workers in Texas and North Dakota. President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to increase drilling in the U.S., the world\'s third-largest producer after Saudi Arabia and Russia, which would help ensure there is plenty of oil. \n \n In short, analysts say, consumers and businesses are not likely to see the return of $100-a-barrel oil — and the high energy costs that came with it — anytime soon. \n \n Still, there could be some short-term shocks even before OPEC\'s cuts take effect in January. \n \n ""The average Joe filling up his tank may notice in the next week or two that gas prices move higher by 5 to 15 cents a gallon just on the psyche of the deal,"" said Patrick DeHaan, an analyst for GasBuddy, a site used to comparison-shop for gasoline. \n \n The U.S. Energy Department predicts that heating oil costs will rise about one-third this winter, but that prediction was issued more than a month ago and was based heavily on forecasts of much colder temperatures in the Northeast. If the weather forecast proves wrong, prices could sink because heating-oil inventories are running above their 5-year average and grew again last week. \n \n A small increase in gasoline or even a bigger jump in heating oil, which is used in only 5 percent of American homes, won\'t affect shoppers if the economy does well, in the view of Michael Niemira, chief economist at The Retail Economist LLC, which does a weekly retail-sales report with Goldman Sachs. \n \n ""The consumer isn\'t really focused on gasoline since prices remain low. A better economy, a better labor market — those matter much more,"" Niemira said. But if gasoline spikes to $4, ""that could be bad. "" \n \n Crude has traded between $40 and $50 a barrel the last several months. The national average for gasoline on Wednesday stood at $2.15 a gallon, according to the AAA auto club. \n \n Before the OPEC meeting, the U.S. Energy Department predicted that crude would rise to $50 or $51 a barrel next year. \n \n Sal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets, said modestly higher oil prices will actually help the U.S. economy by spurring investment in the energy industry without draining consumers\' purchasing power. He expects an average price of about $53 a barrel next year as a result of the OPEC production cuts. \n \n ""The losers are Europe and Japan — oil-importing regions of the world,"" Guatieri said. \n \n U.S. producers are likely to be winners. Drilling fell off after oil prices started to slide in mid-2014. The number of active U.S. drilling rigs bottomed out at 404 in May and has been rising since, to just below 600 last week. That\'s still down 20 percent from a year ago, however. \n \n The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas recently surveyed producers and found that most believe crude must be $55 or higher before drilling picks up significantly, said Michael Plante, an economist for the bank. \n \n The Energy Department predicts that U.S. production will fall from 9.4 million barrels a day in 2015 to 8.8 million this year and 8.7 million next year — the forecast assumed oil at $50 a barrel next year. \n \n Research firm IHS Inc. estimates that if crude rises to $55, U.S. production will instead grow by about 500,000 barrels a day — offsetting nearly half of OPEC\'s stated cut. \n \n Much of that production is expected to come from the Permian Basin in Texas, where prices for acquiring oilfield acreage have skyrocketed in recent months. There are now almost as many drilling rigs running in the Permian as in the rest of the country combined, including offshore. \n \n ""A few months ago rigs were being stacked on the side of roads,"" said Avi Mirman, CEO of Lilis Energy Inc., a small producer that operates in the Permian and the Rockies. ""Today it\'s almost impossible to get a hot rig"" with a crew. \n \n Mirman is facing higher costs for materials used for hydraulic-fracturing or fracking, a technique to boost well production.

They have agreed on their first joint output cut since 2001, a move that sent the price of crude oil up around 10% on Wednesday. The Russians and Saudis announced a deal earlier this year, but skeptics found it hard to believe fellow OPEC members Iran and Iraq would come on board. They did, though they'll be giving up less than other cartel members. In total, OPEC says it will cut its output by 1.2 million barrels a day, while the Russians say they'll cut theirs by 300,000. A roundup of coverage: The AP reports that even with the cuts, there's likely to be more supply than demand, meaning that the return of $100-a-barrel oil is not on the horizon, though US consumers may see small rises soon. ""The average Joe filling up his tank may notice in the next week or two that gas prices move higher by 5 to 15 cents a gallon just on the psyche of the deal,"" says GasBuddy analyst Patrick DeHaan. The Wall Street Journal reports that the deal will cut world oil production by around 1% if all parties stick to the agreement—and that is a big if. Enforcement of the agreement is expected to be a big problem, and analysts say the Russians in particular might not cut or even freeze production, especially not if prices keep going up. Analyst Chris Weafer tells CNBC that the announcement of the deal was ""very weak in detail,"" and it appears that Russia will be able to simply reduce its stated 2017 production targets and pass it off as a cut. Shares in US shale oil producers soared after the deal was announced, reports Fortune, which notes that the agreement ""will effectively end the price war started by Saudi Arabia two years ago in its efforts to wrest market share back from US."" Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said before a deal was reached that the country was willing to take a ""big hit"" on production. ""I think it is a good day for the oil markets, it is a good day for the industry,"" he told reporters Wednesday, per Reuters. ""It should be a good day for the global economy. I think it will be a boost to global economic growth."" An editorial in the Independent says the deal ""may have done the world a good turn"" by bringing historic enemies Saudi Arabia and Iran together, and by giving the renewable energy industry a boost. The Financial Times reports that the future now looks brighter for US shale producers, who could end up being the biggest winners from the deal. Other winners include brokers who benefited from ""frenzied"" trading in oil futures after the agreement was announced."

The bizarre claim? That the company used a raccoon from the zoo in an ""erotic"" ad and traumatized it. Officials at the Animals Aren't Toys zoo say Tomas the raccoon returned from the shoot distressed and, tellingly, a little obsessed with women's breasts, reports the BBC.

The zoo says it never would have given the OK for the raccoon to be used in a racy ad, and it worries about the raccoon population at large: ""Now everyone who sees this video ... will directly associate raccoons with erotica,” declares the lawsuit. ""Absurd,"" responds the head of marketing for Art-Msk. The ad for blankets and pillows was made for national TV in Russia and thus doesn't come close to ""erotica,"" says Valery Bogatov. In fact, he says the raccoon actually stole the model's bra on set and destroyed it during the August shoot, reports Euro News. ""When the zoo told us they would sue us, we told them we’d file our own suit for the cost of the bra,” he tells the Telegraph. ""I said it as a joke, because I thought they were joking, too.""

107,"['A menacing 2-inch-long carnivorous flatworm with a more voracious appetite for snails than the French is invading Europe, and scientists fear it could force escargot to go the way of the dodo, reports Phys.org. \n \n ""This species is extraordinarily invasive,"" said Jean-Lou Justine of the National Museum of Natural History. ""I really hope it can be stopped at the earliest stages. All snails in Europe could be wiped out. It may seem ironic, but it\'s worth pointing out the effect that this will have on French cooking."" \n \n The invasive species, Platydemus manokwari, is a large New Guinean flatworm measuring about 2 inches long and 5 millimeters wide. It has a backside colored like black olives, a pale belly and two beady dark eyes upon its elongated head. It is capable of rapidly climbing trees in pursuit of snails, its favorite prey. When snails are scarce, it also hunts earthworms, which could also spell trouble for agriculture in Europe. \n \n It was first spotted in Europe after workers at a botanical gardens in Caen, Normandy, spotted an unusual flat-as-a-pancake worm lurking in their greenhouse. After scientists identified it as P. manokwari, scientists immediately raised alarm. \n \n ""Platydemus manokwari represents a new and significant threat to biodiversity in France and Europe, which hosts hundreds of species of snails, some of which are endangered and protected,"" said PeerJ, a publisher of peer-reviewed studies. ""It is therefore important to consider the implementation of eradication and control of this flatworm."" \n \n The worm\'s native habitat is high in the mountains of New Guinea, where the 10,000-foot altitudes keep temperatures moderate. Tests have confirmed the worm can survive temperatures down to as low as 50 degrees Fahrenheit, which means it ought to be able to survive just fine in snail-friendly European climates. It has already invaded more than 15 countries and territories in the Pacific, gobbling up snails at an alarming rate. Even before being found in Europe, the worm was considered one of the 100 most dangerous invasive species in the world. \n \n Officials are scrambling to organize new monitoring measures to prevent the worm from being imported through plants and agricultural products. They are cautiously optimistic that the invasion can be contained before the worms can become established on the continent. If the worms do manage to gain a foothold, however, they could radically transform ecosystems and menus in Europe forever. \n \n Related on MNN:', 'French snails, take cover. A team of local scientists have confirmed what could be the escargot industry’s worst fears. Platydemus manokwari, a snail-eating flatworm, has arrived in France. \n \n This is what it looks like: \n \n The flatworm that was found in Caen, France. (Pierre Gros) \n \n This is what it does to snails: \n \n This is the flatworm preying on a snail. (Pierre Garos) \n \n While the threat to France has yet to be assessed, there’s good reason to be believe it could be devastating. The highly efficient predatory worm, also known as the New Guinea flatworm, is listed among the world’s 100 most invasive species. And for good reason: It’s a leading cause of snail population decay and even flat-out extinction in the 15+ countries and habitats it has traversed. Take Hawaii, for instance, where the presence of the worm has driven an estimated 90% of the US state’s 750 species of land snails extinct, according to the Invasive Species Specialist Group. \n \n “This species is extraordinarily invasive,” Jean-Lou Justine, a professor at the National Museum of Natural History, told Agence France-Presse. “All snails in Europe could be wiped out. It may seem ironic, but it’s worth pointing out the effect that this will have on French cooking.” The French consume some 30,000 tonnes (33,000 tons) of snails each year. With fewer and fewer of those being produced locally, an onslaught on the country’s snail population could do away with “true French” escargot altogether. \n \n The New Guinea flatworm’s appearance in France also heralds an alarming spread into the West. Until now, it had only been found in the Indo-Pacific region. Here’s the map the group of scientists shared: \n \n Where the New Guinea flatworm has been found. \n \n It’s yet unclear how the flatworm made its way to Europe—strict agricultural import restrictions have been in place for years to curb its spread. But if it’s in France, it may be roaming elsewhere in Europe, too. Which is a scary thought, considering that there are currently no known chemical or biological methods for controlling the pests. The only consensus way to kill it, thus far, has been temperatures below 10°C (50°F).

It was a very warm welcome, an open session and there were a questions on a whole range of topics,” he said. \n \n “There was one gentleman there who clearly had a few drinks too many.” \n \n “I think he was assisted in making an early return home. Which is probably where he should have gone earlier in the evening, as I’m sure he’s worked out by this morning.”', 'The school says a man was taken to a nearby hospital for treatment. \n \n Even as police search for his killer, friends and family of slain Savannah State student Chris Starks are remembering the 22-year old as a natural born leader who led by example. \n \n “He was a fun-loving kid,” said his uncle, Collier Starks. “And he was raised right.” \n \n Police said someone shot and killed Chris Starks at the Savannah State Student Union. Collier Starks believes the shooting was part of a robbery, and his nephew was hit by a ricocheting bullet. \n \n ""Although we would\'ve loved for this to be a different way, we would\'ve loved for the bullet to have gone straight through and not ricocheting and piercing his heart, which is what we heard,"" said Collier Starks. ""But the reality of the matter is, it was his time, and God is too wise to make mistakes."" \n \n The violence at Savannah State is adding up. In 2013, a man was shot and killed on campus. Last year, there was a shooting at student housing. \n \n One student says the latest shooting took the life of one of his closest friends. \n \n “I just spoke to him a couple days ago. He was asking about the little flag football tournament they have here at Savannah State,” said Dorion McMickens. \n \n Chris Starks played football for Miller Grove High School in DeKalb County until his graduation in 2012. His former high school football coach said Chris Starks was a team leader. \n \n ""But he was a leader in different ways, because he had great grades, but he didn\'t brag about having great grades,"" said Coach Damien Wimes. ""He was talented, but he didn\'t brag about his talent. He was just raised well."" \n \n \n \n Chris Starks signed a scholarship with Appalachian State and played football there until he blew out his knee. He transferred to Savannah State last year hoping to play there once his injury healed. His uncle said he also pursued a career in music and fashion design. \n \n \n \n Starks\' grandfather and several uncles are church pastors, and Collier Starks said Chris was all about church and football. \n \n \n \n ""He had a relationship with God,"" said Collier Starks. ""Not by his resume, but he knew God from a relationship."" \n \n Students who knew Starks say his death will always be on their minds, and the tragedy has brought them closer together. \n \n “I just want to make sure people understand that this isn’t the culture of Savannah State,” said student Gregory Brown. \n \n The university has deployed grief counselors, and friends of Chris Starks are putting together a memorial. \n \n The family has not announced any funeral plans. \n \n A ""gofundme"" account has be set up through assistance from the local high school Starks\' attended.

113,"['Last October, the Justice Department unveiled the first-ever indictment against Chinese manufacturers of opioids, accusing two groups with operating illicit labs that sold fentanyl and other drugs to U.S. dealers. The rings were vast — one involved at least 100 distributors — and authorities were able to trace at least four deaths to fentanyl and related chemicals sold by one of the groups, court records show.', 'Major dark web drug suppliers have started to voluntarily ban the synthetic opioid fentanyl because it is too dangerous, the National Crime Agency has said. \n \n They are “delisting” the high-strength painkiller, effectively classifying it alongside mass-casualty firearms and explosives as commodities that are considered too high-risk to trade. Fentanyl can be up to 100 times stronger than heroin and can easily cause accidental overdoses, particularly when mixed with heroin. \n \n Vince O’Brien, one of the NCA’s leads on drugs, told the Observer that dark web marketplace operators appeared to have made a commercial decision, because selling a drug that could lead to fatalities was more likely to prompt attention from police. \n \n It is the first known instance of these types of operators moving to effectively ban a drug. \n \n O’Brien said: “If they’ve got people selling very high-risk commodities then it’s going to increase the risk to them. There are marketplaces that will not accept listings for weapons and explosives – those are the ones that will not accept listings for fentanyl. Clearly, law enforcement would prioritise the supply of weapons, explosives and fentanyl over, for example, class C drugs – and that might well be why they do this. \n \n “There are also drug users on the dark web who say on forums that they don’t think it’s right that people are selling fentanyl because it is dangerous and kills a lot of people.” \n \n Fentanyl arrived in the UK around 18 months ago and so far is said to have caused around 160 deaths, with fatalities caused by the opioid rising by nearly 30% last year, according to the Office for National Statistics. \n \n One type of fentanyl, carfentanyl, is thousands of times stronger than heroin and O’Brien confirmed that police had made a number of small seizures of the substance in the UK. In the US, fentanyl has taken a significantly more profound hold on the drugs sector and has replaced heroin in many major US drug markets, precipitating a more deadly phase of the nation’s opioid epidemic. The number of overdose deaths associated with fentanyl and similar drugs has grown to more than 29,000 a year, from 3,000 five years ago. Deaths were up by more than 45% in 2017. \n \n O’Brien said that the NCA is working with US law enforcement agencies to prevent the UK from having a similar fentanyl epidemic, though the number of people dependent on opioids in the UK compared to America means it has a much smaller market. \n \n “We are working closely with international partners in terms of how the threat developed there. It’s an emerging new drug, a threat we’re taken very seriously because of what happened in the US,” said O’Brien. The NCA has had a series of successes against UK fentanyl dealers, who typically source the drug from China and then sell it on the dark web. The first fentanyl case to be sentenced in the UK involved Kyle Enos, 25, from Newport who was jailed for eight years in February. Enos had procured the narcotic from China, selling it worldwide and to customers in 30 UK police areas. \n \n Colin Williams, senior NCA investigating officer on the case, said: “We realised within a number of hours we had to deal with this very quickly.” \n \n Even so, as they tracked down the 160 or so clients who had bought fentanyl from Enos to warn them that the drug was deadly, they learned that four of his customers were already dead. “We can’t say whether they took the drug but they were certainly on his [customer] list,” said Williams. \n \n Enos, himself a fentanyl and heroin user, was aware of the risks and had informed each customer that the substance was liable to kill. \n \n O’Brien added: “Every time we take down a dark web vendor we follow up with customers, and when we have done that, a number are turning up dead – there’s a real cautionary tale there.” \n \n Some of the biggest dark web fentanyl suppliers were closed down last year with the most famous – Alphabay – often described as the largest underground market ever seen - shut following a global police investigation.', 'The shooter was once a Catholic altar boy — with a surname that could have been Jewish. \n \n His father is white, neighbors say. His mother is Latina. And his family is eager to point out that some of his relatives are black. \n \n There may be no box to check for George Zimmerman, no tidy way to categorize, define and sort the 28-year-old man whose pull of a trigger on a darkened Florida street is forcing America to once again confront its fraught relationship with race and identity. The victim, we know, was named Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager in a hoodie. The rest becomes a matter for interpretation. \n \n The drama in Florida takes on a kind of modern complexity. Its nuances show America for what it is steadily becoming, a realm in which identity is understood as something that cannot be summed up in a single word. \n \n The images of Zimmerman — not just his face, but the words used to describe him — can confound and confuse. Why are they calling him white, wondered Paul Ebert, the Prince William County commonwealth’s attorney who knew Zimmerman’s mother, Gladys, from her days as an interpreter at the county courthouse. Zimmerman’s mother, Ebert knew, was Peruvian, and he thought of her as Hispanic. \n \n Looking at Zimmerman’s photograph made Darren Soto, a Florida state legislator, think he might be Latino. But he just as easily might have been Italian or French, he thought. “It’s all over the place in Florida,” said Soto, who represents a statehouse district in Orlando, a 20-minute drive from the gated subdivision in Sanford where Martin died. “You have people with Anglo first and last names who speak perfect Spanish and are from Puerto Rico. And you’ve got a third- or fourth-generation Joey Gonzalez from Tampa who can’t speak a word of Spanish.” \n \n The focus in Florida, where thousands gathered Thursday night in Sanford for an emotional rally, has primarily been on complaints that Martin may have been targeted because of his race. The uproar led Thursday to the temporary resignation of Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee, who has been accused by demonstrators of bungling the case and criticized for not arresting Zimmerman. \n \n In Manassas, where Zimmerman lived in the 1980s and 1990s with his parents and two siblings, neighbors tended to define the family based on their spiritual profile. “Very Catholic . . . very religious,” their neighbor Jim Rudzenski recalled Thursday. The children attended All Saints Catholic School on Stonewall Road through the eighth grade before going to Osbourn High School. George became an altar server and evening receptionist at All Saints Catholic Church. The Zimmermans “were known and respected in the community for their dedication and service,” said Robert Cilinski, pastor of All Saints Catholic Church. \n \n The father, Robert Zimmerman Sr., is a retired military man. He could be strict. And the children’s grandmother, who lived with the family, also kept a watchful eye, said Kay Hall, who lived across the street from the Zimmermans in a neighborhood just west of Sudley Road for about 20 years. George and his siblings “didn’t play with the neighborhood kids,” Rudzen\xadski said. “They had to stay home and play.” It was always “Yes, ma’am,” “No, ma’am,” Hall said. \n \n Zimmerman’s life was not without difficulties. In 2001 — when he was 17 or 18 — he was the victim of a minor criminal assault, said Manassas police Sgt. Eddie Rivera. The city’s computer records do not provide details of the crime. \n \n In school, Zimmerman hinted at ambitions in the business world. He joined a Future Business Leaders of America club. And in his senior yearbook, he wrote: “I’m going to Florida to work with my godfather who just bought a $1 million business.” \n \n In Florida, Zimmerman shifted his plans, enrolling in Seminole State College with hopes of becoming a law enforcement officer. He became the self-appointed protector of the streets around his home, although his neighborhood watch organization was not officially registered. He called the police department at least 46 times since 2004 to report everything from open garages to suspicious people. In 2005, according to police records obtained by the Orlando Sentinel and other news organizations, Zimmerman was twice accused of either criminal misconduct or violence. He had a concealed-weapon permit and had a black Kel-Tec semiautomatic handgun and a holster the night Martin died. \n \n Zimmerman’s father has sought to emphasize his family’s diversity in hopes of saving his son from condemnation as a racist. While images of protests from across the country skitter past on television screens, the elder Zimmerman has tried to do what others have been doing, in various ways, for days: define his son. George is “a Spanish-speaking minority,” the father wrote in a letter delivered to the Orlando Sentinel. “He would be the last to discriminate for any reason whatsoever.” George, the father insisted, was more like the boy he killed than people thought. George was a minority — the other — too. \n \n But the argument that the father is making feels hollow and self-serving to Michaela Angela Davis, an African American writer and activist who lives in New York. In her eyes, George Zimmerman’s Hispanic roots don’t give him cover. \n \n “You being a minority doesn’t make you immune to racist beliefs,” she said in an interview Thursday. Davis sees a pervasive cultural imprint, reinforced by media and entertainment imagery: the black man as a symbol of “violence, fear and deviant behavior.” A young man could be susceptible to the influence of that image whether his “mother is from Peru or Norway.” \n \n Hispanics and black Americans have a shared history of discrimination in the United States. But they also have a shared history of tension — in neighborhoods, schools, even prisons. In Latin America, including Peru, Afro Latinos have frequently complained of a lack of political representation, economic disenfranchisement and the virtual absence of their image in popular culture, such as soap operas, an issue they attribute to racial exclusion. \n \n Zimmerman’s legal fate could rest on examinations of possible motives that will be pieced together from clues, including snatches of audiotape, and from inquiries into whether he muttered a racial slur before the shooting. \n \n Zimmerman’s family background doesn’t invite a racial motive, but it doesn’t discount one either, said Luis Martinez-Fernandez, a professor of Latin American and Caribbean history at the University of Central Florida. Hispanics are an ethnic group, but within that group there are different \xadraces. There are black Dominicans and Cubans, for instance. \n \n “Who is Hispanic and who’s not is not as clear as other ethnic groups,” said Martinez-Fernandez. “There’s no such thing as a Hispanic race. It has to do with origin, culture and race. Some people argue that language should be a part. All this complicates identity.” \n \n Hispanics make up the nation’s largest ethnic group at more than 13 percent of the population, while African Americans are the largest racial group, with more than 12 percent of the population. In the 2010 Census, more than half of people who identified as Hispanic said they were white, and only 3 percent said they were black. \n \n “There’s a sense that one group has been harmed historically more than the other,” Martinez-Fernandez said. “There’s been a history of the dominant group in power pitting one group against the other. I think we have not fought together. There have been few instances of that.” \n \n But there have been some signs in Florida that Hispanics and African Americans are forging a bond, said Soto, the state legislator. During ongoing redistricting debates in Florida, the two groups have “stuck together very solidly,” he said. \n \n If not for a quirk of fate, Martin and Zimmerman might never have encountered each other, sparing the nation a painful episode. Several years ago, Zimmerman returned to his old neighborhood and showed up unannounced at the house across the street. He came back two more times to see George Hall, a retired Presbyterian minister. Zimmerman told him that he had plans. He wanted to move back to Virginia. He wanted to be a police officer, but he needed a letter of recommendation that Zimmerman could give to prospective employers. \n \n “I told them he was a great guy,” Hall recalled. “We never did hear what happened with that.” \n \n Staff writers Brady Dennis, Sari Horwitz, Josh White and Jeremy Borden contributed to this report.']",3,"– Fentanyl suppliers on the so-called ""dark web"" are delisting the drug because it's just too dangerous—and tends to attract police attention, the Guardian reports.

The opioid's rising popularity has caused roughly 160 deaths in the UK and many more in America, where nearly 29,000 people died in 2017 from synthetic-opioid-linked overdoses. Police say labs in China are producing fentanyl, which is often processed by Mexican cartels and sold domestically as pills or mixed into heroin and other substances. Some users procure it directly online, where sellers may be getting nervous.

IT was so hot, the temperature of the cup began to burn her hands, according to the lawsuit. \n \n As Salas-Salano was screaming in pain, she claims her dog Alexander jumped onto her lap, causing the hot tea to spill onto him. \n \n According to the lawsuit, Alexander was taken to an emergency veterinarian hospital but “ultimately succumbed to the injuries caused by the tea, dying a short time later.” \n \n Salas-Solano was taken to Rose Medical Center for severe burns and underwent surgery the next day at the Swedish Medical Center Burn and Reconstructive Unit. \n \n The lawsuit states she was diagnosed with “Two percent total body surface area second-degree burn injury to the abdomen and bilateral thighs.” \n \n She would later need skin grafts. \n \n The lawsuit claims Starbucks had received previous complaints for failing to provide hot cup sleeves and securing cup lids when serving customers with hot coffee or tea. \n \n The complaint states Starbucks had a written policy to “double-cup” hot tea. \n \n The lawsuit seeks claims that exceed $100,000. \n \n “We have video evidence that clearly contradicts the claims made by the plaintiff and believe they are without merit,” Starbucks said in a statement. “We look forward to presenting our case in court. \n \n “While we are sympathetic to Ms. Salas-Solano and the injuries she sustained, we don’t have any reason to believe our partner (employee) was at fault.” \n \n Starbucks’ legal team would not provide a copy of the video, but it did allow it to be reviewed. \n \n It shows Salas-Solano on her cellphone with her dog in her in her lap as she buys the tea. \n \n The video also shows the hot tea did have a hot sleeve and it appears the lid was secure, though the video is not conclusive. \n \n In the video, it’s hard to tell if Salas-Solano grabs the cup by the hot sleeve or by the lid when she accidentally spilled it. \n \n It’s hard to determine if she spilled the tea because of the cup’s hot temperature or because she was distracted by her cellphone use or if perhaps her dog bumped into the cup while he stood in her lap. \n \n The lawsuit might sound familiar to a famous 1994 case involving McDonald’s and hot coffee. \n \n In that case, a New Mexico jury awarded $2.86 million to Stella Liebeck, a 79-year-old woman who suffered third-degree burns across her pelvic region when she accidentally spilled hot coffee in her lap. \n \n Ultimately, the judge reduced the final verdict to $640,000. \n \n McDonald’s appealed and the two sides settled for a confidential amount before the appeal was decided.']",2,"– A woman is suing a Denver Starbucks over a spilled cup of hot tea she claims caused second-degree burns that disfigured her and killed her dog, the Denver Post reports. A federal lawsuit filed by Deanna Salas-Solano, 58, contends an employee at the drive-thru window didn't secure the lid to the ""unreasonably hot"" 20-ounce tea she ordered in September 2015. The complaint says the cup was so hot it began to burn her hands; tea then spilled onto her lap, melting her clothes and scalding her stomach, legs, and lap. Her dog, Alexander, was splashed and burned. He was taken to the vet and died shortly after. With 2% of her body surface severely burned, Salas-Solano underwent surgery the following day and needed to get skin grafts. The legal action seeking more than $75,000 for injuries, emotional distress, and lost wages notes Salas-Solano hadn't ordered an ""extra hot"" tea. The barista didn't slip a cardboard sleeve on the hot cup and, contrary to Starbucks policy, didn't use a second cup, the suit says. A wall timer marks how fast employees fill orders, per the filing. Starbucks denies the charges, saying a video contradicts the woman's claims. Their legal teams wouldn't provide a copy of it, but KDVR watched it and says it's ""not conclusive"" what happened. The footage shows Salas-Solano on her cellphone, with her dog on her lap, but the station says it's unclear if she spilled the tea because the cup was hot, she got distracted, or due to a jostle by the dog. Starbucks says in a statement: ""We don't have any reason to believe our partner (employee) was at fault."" (McDonald's has been sued more than once over hot coffee.)"

117,"['PLUS: It\'s Time to Kill Off the Word \'MILF\' >> \n \n Published in the August 2014 issue \n \n Let\'s face it: There used to be something tragic about even the most beautiful forty-two-year-old woman. With half her life still ahead of her, she was deemed to be at the end of something\x97namely, everything society valued in her, other than her success as a mother. If she remained sexual, she was either predatory or desperate; if she remained beautiful, what gave her beauty force was the fact of its fading. And if she remained alone... well, then God help her. \n \n Mrs. Robinson was forty-two. And so if you want to see how our conception of forty-two-year-old women has changed over the last five decades, simply imagine The Graduate remade today, with Cameron Diaz in the part made famous by Anne Bancroft. Or Sofia Vergara. Or Leslie Mann. Or Amy Poehler. Or any of the forty-two-year-old women now gracing our culture. The result might be misguided, in the way of so many remakes. But it would either outdo the original, in terms of heat, or upend it entirely, with sex as a form of subversion or subversion as a form of sex. In the right hands, it would be funny; but even in the wrong hands it couldn\'t get away with what Mike Nichols and Dustin Hoffman got away with: a movie that turned on the hero\'s disgust with himself for having an affair with a forty-two-year-old woman. It is hard to feel sorry for a young man who goes to bed with the woman everybody else in the theater wants to go to bed with. \n \n There are many reasons for the apotheosis of forty-two-year-old women, and some of them have little to do with forty-two-year-old women themselves. In a society in which the median age keeps advancing, we have no choice but to keep redefining youth. Life lasts longer; so does beauty, fertility, and sex. And yet forty-two-year-old women are not enjoying some kind of scientific triumph but rather one of political and personal will. A few generations ago, a woman turning forty-two was expected to voluntarily accept the shackles of biology and convention; now it seems there is no one in our society quite so determined to be free. Conservatives still attack feminism with the absurd notion that it makes its adherents less attractive to men; in truth, it is feminism that has made forty-two-year-old women so desirable. \n \n Carla Gugino. Christina Applegate. Jennifer Garner. Maya Rudolph. It is no accident that every woman mentioned here has comic as well as carnal appeal, and entices with the promise of lust with laughs. No generation of American women has entered its forties as frank about sex, and so no generation of American women has been as attuned to\x97or forgiving of\x97the absurd theater of men trying to get into their pants. They have had so much going their way for such a long time that their superiority to their male counterparts has become part of the grain of American life, especially in movies and on television; indeed, it may be said that the best thing that forty-two-year-old American men have going for them is forty-two-year-old American women. \n \n Of course, they have to work for their advantage; they have armored themselves with yoga and Pilates even as they joke about the spectacle. Still, what has made them figures of fantasy is not that they have redefined the ideals of female strength but rather their own vulnerabilities. Go to a party: There is simply no one as unclothed as a forty-two-year-old woman in a summer dress. For all her toughness, and humor, and smarts, you know exactly what she looks like, without the advantage of knowing who she is. ""You\'re trying to seduce me, aren\'t you?"" Benjamin Braddock asked Mrs. Robinson a long time ago. The question, back then, was all that mattered. Now we wait for the answer. \n \n Photo credits: (Jennifer Garner) Amanda Friedman/Trunk Archive; (Carla Gugino) Kayt Jones; (Leslie Mann) Jeffrey Mayer/WireImage', 'When I woke up this morning to see that a friend of mine had sent me Tom Junod’s essay, “In Praise of 42 Year Old Women,” I felt a lot of things. First of all, I felt happy. I mean, I had been following Junod’s career for many years, and so I’ve watched him begin so many articles with the word “You.” And this piece began with “Let’s face it,” which was obviously progress. So yeah, I felt good, the kind of good you feel when you see a kid who always walks in Little League get a hit, or when your dog is choking on a piece of rawhide and then just suddenly stops. Except with a dog you were thinking you might have to reach down its throat at some point, and I have never gotten to the point where I thought about reaching down Junod’s throat to extract something other than the pronoun “you.” And now, I don’t have to! \n \n The next thing I felt was relief: Tom Junod still wanted to have sex with me, and more importantly, laugh over hamburgers afterward, as he admired me in a stunning shift. Because according to Junod, I’m still hot — not like 42-year-old women used to be, back when they were super gross, like Anne Bancroft in The Graduate. And according to Junod what makes me hot isn’t just being hot, it’s that, unlike other women who just haven’t had all this time, I also finally figured out how to be sort of interesting. \n \n Because — to borrow a phrase — let’s face it. Young women may still be perfect physical specimens. They can put on a bustier and high heels and arrange their legs, as 42-year-old Sofia Vergara has here, in a pose that’s not quite open and not quite closed, but they just don’t have, according to Junod, my “toughness, humor, and smarts.” He doesn’t come out and say that they don’t, but he definitely doesn’t say here, “Oh, the reason 42-year-old women are hot is because of what they look like.” No, it’s because we have a certain gravitas combined with what remains of our beauty. Young women don’t have that gravitas. So we sort of have the best of femininity. \n \n I guess this is supposed to make me feel good. I guess it’s supposed to make me feel good that at a party in a summer dress, I am “the most unclothed woman in the room.” \n \n Or, well, I want that to make me feel good, but first I have to figure out what “most unclothed” means. According to Junod, I’m “the most unclothed” because “you know exactly what she looks like, without knowing exactly who she is.” (We couldn’t escape that second person singular for long!) I’m trying to figure out this idea of not knowing who I am? As opposed to the younger women at the party? Is it easy to know who they are, because at this point, they’re just body parts? Is 42 years how long it takes for the female brain to develop, and then, there’s, like, this sweet spot where a woman has brains and a body? And you (the universal male you, of course, otherwise known as Tom Junod’s BFF) want to just crawl up in that “lust with laughs” sweet spot and have a blast? \n \n OK, Tom. To borrow another phrase, “Are you trying to seduce me?” I am actually 44, so I hope my collagen-intelligence ratio is still in your ballpark. Oh, I just looked you up on Wikipedia and I see that you’re 55. Oh, yeah! That is such a hot age. It’s like, you’re still alive, but only for about 30 more years. \n \n Art by Jia Tolentino. \n \n Sarah Miller is the author Inside the Mind of Gideon Rayburn and The Other Girl. She lives in Nevada City, CA. Follow her on Twitter @sarahlovescali.', 'Apparently, I still have a few more years of ""hotness,"" according to Esquire writer, Tom Junod. Because, you know, I was worried. Really really worried. \n \n Junod says: \n \n There used to be something tragic about even the most beautiful forty-two-year-old woman. \n \n Yes, because any purpose our life had (other than motherhood) was over. But have no fear, 41-year-olds, you\'re still free to strut your stuff without judgment because you have one year left. Now, obviously I\'m not serious, I\'m sarcastic. There\'s a part of me that cannot even believe that we are having a conversation legitimizing the sex appeal of a particular age group. It\'s absurd. But we are, because when attractive celebrities that certain men want to have sex with reach a particular age, we need a piece like this one to justify desiring sex with said age group. \n \n And in essence, that\'s really what this article is about. It\'s about a man not wanting to be troubled by liking someone more mature in age than your average Playmate. This isn\'t about women. This is about male insecurity. Tom, it\'s okay to like women your own age. It\'s okay to like them older, too. It happens. (But truth be told, in this case, Tom is saying that he would like to screw women who are a decade or so younger than him. Tom is in his 50s.) Gee, a man being interested in a younger woman -- wow -- that sounds like a novel idea. \n \n Junod offers lots of reasons why the 42-year-old female is suddenly desirous. One that I am particularly drawn to is: \n \n No generation of American women has entered its forties as frank about sex... \n \n Oh, Tom. Women have always been talking about sex. This is nothing new; you just haven\'t been listening. In recent history alone, the women who fought for contraception and abortion in the 1960s and early 1970s have long since passed the age 42. Were they not talking about sex? \n \n Maybe it\'s time to start paying attention. \n \n It\'s amusing to me that the majority of 42-year-old celebrities Junod talks about are comediennes with timing, wit, and sass. He says: \n \n It is no accident that every woman mentioned here has comic as well as carnal appeal, and entices with the promise of lust with laughs. \n \n I\'m going to put it differently. The reason we love these women isn\'t because they are still hot. It\'s because they are smart. And sexiness, while some may think depends on Pilates and yoga and voluptuous curves, is really about what\'s going on in the mind.']",3,"– Tom Junod of Esquire thinks modern-day 42-year-old women are the bomb, through some combination of sexiness, frankness about sexiness, gravitas, self-confidence, yoga, Pilates, feminism, and summer dresses. ""A few generations ago, a woman turning 42 was expected to voluntarily accept the shackles of biology and convention,"" he writes. ""Now it seems there is no one in our society quite so determined to be free."" He ticks off names such as Cameron Diaz, Sofia Vergara, Jennifer Garner, and Amy Poehler to make his point. And he similarly asks us to imagine a remake of the 1967 movie The Graduate, when a young Dustin Hoffman is disgusted with himself for having an affair with the 42-year-old Mrs. Robinson. The movie wouldn't be quite the same today, he writes. ""It is hard to feel sorry for a young man who goes to bed with the woman everybody else in the theater wants to go to bed with."" In short, 42 ain't what it used to be. The essay, however, is getting just as much buzz for the reaction, often in the form of ridicule, from female writers.

I thank them for being responsive to the needs of New Yorkers,” the governor said. \n \n Time Warner Cable and MSG execs met this week for the first time since December amid a growing clamor for the games to return to the cable company as the team went on a winning streak, thanks in part to Lin’s play. \n \n MSG ratings have surged as Lin has turned the Knicks into must-see TV. Average ratings are up 87 percent in the Lin Era, all 11 days of it. \n \n The rating for Tuesday’s game against the Raptors was 4.66 and drew 344,272 households, the highest-rated MSG game since Carmelo Anthony’s debut last year. Time Warner’s Facebook page has been all but hijacked by complaining customers. \n \n The two were fighting over what are called carriage fees, the amount a cable company pays to a network. \n \n Today Quinn said, “I want to thank the MSG Network and Time Warner Cable for coming to a deal that will put the Knicks and the Rangers back on TV. Now, a million more New Yorkers will be able to go Linsane in the privacy of their own living room. I’m looking forward to watching the return of Carmelo Anthony for the Knicks and Henrik Lundqvist in goal for the Rangers.”', 'MSG Network, Time Warner Cable blackout ends Deal was pushed by Governor Cuomo, sources say \n \n Is there anything Jeremy Lin can\'t do? \n \n City Council Speaker Christine Quinn confirmed in a triumphant press statement reports that Time Warner Cable and MSG Network had ended their nearly two-month long standoff as political and populist pressure intensified over the past few days thanks in large part to Linsanity. \n \n ""I want to thank the MSG-Network and Time Warner Cable for coming to a deal that will put the Knicks and the Rangers back on TV.

It was not immediately clear when the network would return to the air. \n \n Sources said that Governor Andrew Cuomo got involved by phone in the deal over the past few days, which helped give the deal a final push through. \n \n “I applaud both Mr. Dolan and Mr. Britt and their companies,” Cuomo said in a statement. “I thank them for being responsive to the needs of New Yorkers.” \n \n Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has also been involved over the past few weeks. After weeks of silence towards each other, the two sides said they began talking again this week. \n \n THE LINSANE DEAL: POLS REACT TO TIME WARNER, MSG NETWORK DEAL \n \n The agreement came after Knicks and Rangers fans had to look elsewhere to watch their favorite teams for 48 days. \n \n ""I\'m not surprised if politicians got involved that it got done,” one industry executive said. “I\'m more surprised that it went so many weeks without any conversations.

Much of it happens online, a realm that’s difficult-to-police, but when it happens out in the open, right in our faces, it seems reasonable that it should be dealt with – harshly. \n \n It appears that’s not going to happen with ESPN reporter and Northwestern University graduate Britt McHenry, whose recent act of meanness was captured on video and broadcast for all the world to see. \n \n In case you missed it, McHenry’s car was towed away in Arlington, Va. At the towing company’s office, McHenry mercilessly harangued an employee while a security camera picked up the whole exchange, which included lines like: “That’s why I have a degree and you don’t”; “Do you feel good about your job? So I can be a college dropout and do the same thing? Why? Because I have a brain? And you don’t?”; “‘Cause I’m on television and you’re in a (expletive) trailer, honey”; and “Lose some weight, baby girl.” \n \n Charming. McHenry was classist, elitist and foul-mouthed while still managing to slip in some fat shaming. Rather than just being annoyed about having her car towed or being angry at the towing company itself, she resorted to an all-out attack on the character and appearance of the employee. \n \n ESPN must be so proud. \n \n Actually, it must be at least a little bit, because the network’s response was to suspend McHenry for one lousy week. I’m sure the towing company employee who was dressed down will remember McHenry’s insulting rant a lot longer than one week. \n \n But apparently ESPN feels that’s sufficient punishment. That along with McHenry’s mea culpa, which she put out on social media: “In an intense and stressful moment, I allowed my emotions to get the best of me and said some insulting and regrettable things. As frustrated as I was, I should always choose to be respectful and take the high road. I am so sorry for my actions and will learn from this mistake. \n \n Sorry, McHenry. Sorry, ESPN. That’s not good enough. \n \n Nobody can watch that video and buy that McHenry is sorry about a thing, aside from being caught. (The employee informs McHenry in the video that she’s being recorded.) \n \n She should have been fired immediately. \n \n We all get mad. We all say dumb things. But most of us don’t say cruel things repeatedly and with such apparent ease. McHenry’s comments revealed a smug sense of superiority and the kind of detached meanness that has become so prevalent online and so corrosive to society. \n \n ESPN had a chance to make a statement that such behavior from a person who’s in the public eye is wholly unacceptable. The network had a chance to show that when you’re mean, there are consequences – serious, career-altering consequences. \n \n Instead, it just delivered a slap on the wrist. And allowed McHenry to deliver a carefully scripted apology that will in no way deter another person from behaving the same way. \n \n Mean-spirited tirades, whether delivered in person by a television personality or sent online by an anonymous nobody, hurt people. And hurting people should never be OK. \n \n McHenry should be fired, and ESPN should say nothing more than these five words: That behavior won’t be tolerated. \n \n rhuppke@tribpub.com']",4,"– New Yorkers with cable can finally watch Jeremy Lin on a regular basis: MSG and Time Warner reached a deal today to end a 48-day impasse, reports the New York Times.

However, [the state] does not explain how offering this test at the surgical center garbles or distorts Ohio\'s message. The STD testing is not related to the abortion services, nor is it a precursor to a discussion about abortion services.

While the girls are clearly just playing around, Edward—who became king a few years after the 1933 video and then abdicated to marry Wallis Simpson—had close ties to Germany and was often accused of having Nazi sympathies, the Independent reports. He met with Adolf Hitler in 1937 and discussed becoming the figurehead for a Hitler-friendly international peace movement, the BBC reports. Historians believe Hitler might have put Edward back on the throne if he had successfully invaded Britain. The Sun has been condemned for leaking the footage, but it should be saluted for reminding the world that Edward ""was a charming, libidinous idiot,"" writes Peter Preston at the Guardian.

Bobby Mann, understood to be Mrs Mann\'s husband, said other communities had withered after solar farms were installed. \n \n ""You\'re killing your town,"" he said.

The council defeated the motion for the rezoning of an area on US Highway 258 for an additional solar farm after a public comment period, where members of the town could give their opinions. \n \n A retired science teacher, Jane Mann, said she was concerned about the rising risk of cancer deaths in the area (despite reports showing that cancer rates in North Carolina have fallen over the 2008 to 2012 period) saying that no one could tell her that solar panels were not causing the cancer. \n \n She was also concerned that photosynthesis would slow due to the solar panels, stopping the plants from growing in the solar farm fields. ""I want to know what\'s going to happen. I want information. Enough is enough.

While contruction has started on one of the three farms that have already been approved for the area, it\'s unlikely this forth one will get the go-ahead. \n \n Unfortunately, this dislike of solar is not new. The New York Times reported in 2011 that when Oradell, New Jersey began putting up solar panels on power poles, many residents were unhappy. ""I hate them,"" Eric Olsen told The New York Times. ""It\'s just an eyesore."" \n \n Other residents were also reported as calling the panels ""ugly"" or ""hideous"", and said they were worried about their property value declining because of it. \n \n However, these panels pushed New Jersey closer to their renewable energy target, which is one of the highest in the US. As of earlier this year, New Jersey also approved a bill that requires the state to get at least 80 percent of all its energy from renewable sources by 2050. \n \n And not all New Jersey residents have been against these changes, with some seeing the panels as a badge of pride representing their switch to clean energy. \n \n Hopefully, with increased exposure and better education, we can outline the positives of having solar panels installed in both big cities and country towns.

He spoke on condition of anonymity in keeping with police regulations. \n \n The police department later issued a statement saying it had decided to further investigate the matter given the circumstances of the incident and the possible ""ambivalence"" of the initials. \n \n The fine of between 100 and 600 euros ($112-672) was proposed under the 2015 Public Security Law nicknamed the ""gag law,"" which has been criticized by opposition parties, United Nations experts and journalists\' and rights groups, who say it curtails free assembly and expression. Opposition parties say they will ditch the law if they get into government. \n \n The woman told several Spanish news outlets that police stopped her Sunday in Madrid. She said she explained to them that the bag made no mention of police. \n \n The online newspaper Eldiario.es and others showed photographs of the bag and the police complaint reportedly posted on the woman\'s Twitter account. \n \n It was not immediately possible to obtain comment from the woman. \n \n The A.C.A.B. slogan has long been used to insult police on T-shirts and graffiti, while the cat wording is seen by some as a way of concealing it. \n \n The ""gag law"" allows the expulsion of migrants illegally entering Spain\'s two North African enclaves, sets stiff fines for protests outside Parliament or strategic installations and allows authorities to fine journalists and media organizations who distribute unauthorized images of police.

126,"['If you are involuntarily committed to a mental health institute in Georgia, your name will be added to a list of people who are not allowed to buy firearms. For five years. \n \n Five years from when a record of your commitment has been added to the database, your information will be removed and you should have no problem clearing background checks needed to buy a gun anywhere in the United States. \n \n The Atlanta Journal-Constitution explains: \n \n This year, the state uploaded more than 2,000 new records of mentally ill Georgians to the database —people committed for inpatient treatment; found incompetent to handle their own affairs; or found guilty of a crime but mentally ill. But the state also took down almost 500 other records in 2015, making it possible for scores of mentally ill people to acquire guns legally anywhere in the country. \n \n According to the AJC, Georgia law requires that the records of those who have been involuntarily committed be cleared from the National Instant Background Check System after five years. \n \n Dr. Steven Hoge, who heads the American Psychiatric Association’s Council on Psychiatry and the Law, told the AJC that he thinks the five-year limitation makes sense. He explained that treatment generally takes just a few weeks or months, and that “the public has massively overestimated the dangerousness of the mentally disordered.” \n \n Chairwoman of the Senate Health and Human Services Committee Renee Unterman, a Republican senator, agrees that it’s more harmful for the individuals in question to be branded as mentally ill for life. “It’s a tenuous position for someone to have had a mental illness,” she said, adding, “your mental health when you’re 25 years old is different from when you’re 55 years old. Why should you carry the baggage and stigma of mental illness?” \n \n AJC’s report comes at the close of a year where Americans saw, by some estimates, hundreds of mass shootings. By now, we know that there will be two responses to these tragic events: Liberals will call for better gun control, and conservatives for better mental health services. The conflict in Georgia—between keeping guns away from people with a history of mental illness, and the dangerous implications of keeping records of those who’ve been involuntarily committed—illustrates how the second option is so complicated. \n \n Strict gun laws, on the other hand, work.', 'Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Footage showed the bus on its side on the edge of the road \n \n At least 13 people have been killed after a bus carrying foreign students crashed on a Spanish motorway between the cities of Barcelona and Valencia. \n \n Most of the 57 people on board the bus were students on the Erasmus programme who were returning to Barcelona after a trip to a fireworks festival. \n \n The accident occurred near Freginals, 150km (93 miles) south of Barcelona. \n \n All of those who died were female, officials say. \n \n Their nationalities have not been made public while the process of identification continues. \n \n Those on board the bus included students from the UK, Hungary, Germany, Sweden, Norway, Switzerland, the Czech Republic, New Zealand, Italy, Peru, Bulgaria, Poland, Ireland, the Palestinian territories, Japan and Ukraine, local Spanish officials said. \n \n Image copyright AP Image caption The bus overturned after hitting a car travelling in the opposite direction \n \n Image copyright AFP Image caption The driver of the coach survived the crash \n \n Of the 43 people injured, 28 were taken to hospital. \n \n Jordi Jane, Catalonia\'s regional interior minister, said the driver of the coach had ""hit the railing on the right and swerved to the left so violently that the bus veered onto the other side of the highway"". \n \n The bus then hit a vehicle coming in the opposite direction, injuring two people inside. \n \n The location is a known accident blackspot. \n \n ""There were students on board, many of them foreign students studying in Catalonia and in Barcelona, who had travelled to Valencia for the Fallas and were returning,"" Mr Jane added. \n \n British student Tallulah Lyons was taken to hospital in Tarragona with fractured vertebrae. \n \n ""I just remember waking up and people were on the floor,"" the 19-year-old from Swindon in Wiltshire told the BBC. \n \n ""I was trying to crawl out with friends - and that\'s when we realised some people were trapped.

Her lawsuit alleged the copyright assignment to him was ""a gross example of self-dealing"" and was intended to ""secure to himself an irrevocable interest in the income stream"" from sales of her book. \n \n The federal lawsuit sought forfeiture of all commissions Pinkus and his companies received after the copyright assignment in 2007; damages; and that Pinkus and his companies assign whatever copyright rights they own to Lee.

(When the new novel was announced earlier today, apparently, “a series of screams” could be heard in the offices of Penguin Random House, Lee\'s U.K. publisher.) To Kill a Mockingbird is beloved in ways few of its fellow curricular staples are. More than half a century after its original publication, it continues to sell more than a million copies a year; it\'s been translated into more than 40 languages. Not only has it proven itself, repeatedly, to be on the right side of history; it also captures, in a way few books are able to, that particular feeling, smallness straining against bigness, that comes with being a kid. For many American children—myself, and possibly you, very much included—Mockingbird offered an early, easy exposure to justice and the lack of it. It eased us, through the charming person of Scout, into a truth we were alternately warned about and protected from: that life can be, without at all meaning to be, cruelly unfair. \n \n * * * \n \n Mockingbird’s author is now 88 years old. She spent much of her adult life in New York City, living with the kind of strategic privacy that tends to get one labelled as “reclusive.” Recently forced to sell her Upper East Side apartment, she now lives in an assisted-living facility back in Monroeville—a 2007 stroke, a friend says, having left her “95 percent blind, profoundly deaf,” and bound to a wheelchair. ""Her short-term memory,"" he says, ""is completely shot, and poor in general."" \n \n Perhaps he is overstating Lee\'s condition. Perhaps not. But it’s worth considering, either way, something that is both inconvenient and also indicative of the expectations we place on the small cadre of people we have elevated to the status of Author: that Harper Lee, née and known to those close to her as Nelle, spent the majority of her life not wanting Go Set a Watchman to be published. Or, at least, she has spent the majority of her life telling the media that she didn\'t want Go Set a Watchman to be published. (She has had many opportunities to do so: In 2006, The New York Times wrote a piece about her specifying “the three most frequently asked questions” associated with her name: “Is she dead? Is she gay? What ever happened to Book No. 2?”) \n \n Here’s an exchange from a press conference Lee gave in 1962 to promote the film version of her novel: \n \n ""Will success spoil Harper Lee?"" a reporter asked. \n \n ""She\'s too old,"" Harper Lee replied. \n \n ""How do you feel about your second novel?"" another asked. \n \n ""I\'m scared,” Harper Lee replied. \n \n At one point, Lee\'s sister (and companion and caretaker and sometime legal adviser), known publicly as Miss Alice, claimed that a burglar had stolen the manuscript of Mockingbird’s spectral sequel. But Lee had many other explanations for why the anticipated novel failed to materialize. To a cousin: “When you\'re at the top, there\'s only one way to go.” To a bookseller: ""I said what I had to say."" To a friend: “I wouldn\'t go through the pressure and publicity I went through with To Kill A Mockingbird for any amount of money.”', 'No, none of your business and none of your business: those are the best answers at which ""Mockingbird"" arrives. But it fares better at filling in the basic details of Ms. Lee\'s life, from the reason Nelle Harper Lee didn\'t use her first name in print (she didn\'t want ""Nelle"" pronounced as ""Nellie"") to the genesis of her novel and its characters. Even though he never gets close to the flinty Ms. Lee, Mr. Shields constructs a worthwhile portrait of the artist. \n \n Monroeville, Ala., where Ms. Lee and Mr. Capote grew up as neighbors and playmates, is credibly evoked, even if one of Mr. Shields\'s best sources is Ms. Lee\'s father\'s caddy. The book gives a sense of the tomboy Ms. Lee, a k a Miss Frippy Britches, growing up watchfully in a town full of people who would later populate her fiction. And since her father, A. C. Lee, was a lawyer, newspaper editor and politician, Mr. Shields is able to trace the way some of his more hidebound opinions (""Get off the \'social justice\' and get back on the Gospel,"" he once said) gave way to the crusading morality that would make Atticus Finch, his fictional alter ego, a character for the ages. \n \n Photo \n \n ""Mockingbird"" dwells on Ms. Lee\'s college years, no doubt because Mr. Shields tracked down so many classmates. All attest to her reluctance to behave like a demure Southern belle. ""In the purely feminine aquifer of sorority life, she floated like a drop of motor oil,"" Mr. Shields writes. The book then observes her first literary efforts (""May I thit here?"" she wrote, caricaturing her friend Truman) and follows her to New York, where the anecdotal manuscript originally called ""Atticus"" came together over a long period. \n \n During that period she also accompanied Capote to Kansas and provided immeasurable help in the researching of his nonfiction breakthrough, ""In Cold Blood."" When her notes described the misshapen face of the killer Richard Hickock as looking ""as if someone cut it down the middle, then put it back together not quite in place,"" Capote recycled with a minimum of embellishment: ""It was as though his head had been halved like an apple, then put together a fraction off center."" \n \n Yet Capote\'s condescension remained intact. (""I got Harper interested in writing because she typed my manuscript on my typewriter,"" he told The Washington Post. ""It was a nice gesture for her, and highly convenient for me."") \n \n Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you\'re not a robot by clicking the box.

From the agent who countered Ms. Lee\'s desire to have Spencer Tracy play Atticus by instead recommending Robert Wagner, to the notes by Gregory Peck (who won an Oscar), insisting that his character dominate the story, the book captures a sharp sense of what Hollywood does to writers. It also casts some light on why Ms. Lee didn\'t want to endure this ever again. \n \n Her own words are clearer than anyone else\'s, as in this exchange from a 1962 news conference: ""Will success spoil Harper Lee?"" \n \n ""She\'s too old."" \n \n ""How do you feel about your second novel?"" \n \n ""I\'m scared."" \n \n And Mr. Shields piles up evidence that her fear was real. After a decade had gone by, and no second book emerged (at one point Ms. Lee\'s sister claimed that a burglar had stolen the long-awaited manuscript), Ms. Lee seems to have faced up to reality and stopped pushing herself. \n \n ""When you\'re at the top, there\'s only one way to go,"" she once said to a cousin.

Bauman ordered McAtasney, also 19, of Neptune City held without bail pending trial. \n \n Doyle said McAtasney admitted to a person identified only by the initials A.C. that he choked Stern and watched her die for a half-hour. \n \n \n \n ""He even so much as demonstrated how he lifted her up off the ground, then left her on the floor and watched her die for 30 minutes,\'\' Doyle said.

But others aren't so sure everything's on the up-and-up, citing the author's notoriously publicity-shy nature, the recent death of her fiercely protective sister, and the somewhat shady characters that have swirled around her for years, perhaps preying on her age and reported ill health. After all, Lee won a Pulitzer Prize in 1961 for her debut effort, and in a 1962 press conference, when asked how she felt about a possible second novel, she replied, ""I'm scared,"" as per the New York Times. (Lee herself noted in the publisher's statement released yesterday that she'd written the new novel before Mockingbird.) As Megan Garber writes for the Atlantic in pondering Lee's legacy: ""Why end the silence? And why do it now?"" The skepticism partly comes from the fact that Lee has been linked in the past (and perhaps the present) with those who may not have been looking after her best interests. She sued Samuel Pinkus, her ex-agent, for reportedly ""duping"" her out of the copyright to Mockingbird (they settled in 2013); she disputed she had anything to do with a memoir published about her in 2014; and she ""has a history of signing whatever's put in front of her,"" sometimes at the urging of Tonja Carter, her tight-lipped attorney, Gawker has noted. But it's the loss of Alice Lee—her older sister and most ardent protector—that may have upped the vulnerability level of Lee, said by multiple sources to be mostly blind and deaf after a 2007 stroke. ""Just feels very potentially exploitative, especially given how TKAM itself was exploited and how badly Lee was cheated,"" a tweet cited on Jezebel reads."

This anticipation was spawned by the #OscarsSoWhite controversy, a protest not only against the fact that nominations in the award show's major categories don't adequately represent people of color or those in the LGBT community, but also that the film industry overall is lacking in its opportunities for minorities. And Rock addressed the issue as soon as the opening scenes from this year's nominated films came to a close. ""Man, I counted at least 15 black people in that montage!"" he exclaimed, per the Washington Post. He explained that he didn't boycott the show as some black luminaries were doing because the ""last thing I need is to lose another job to Kevin Hart"" and that ""Jada [Pinkett Smith] boycotting the Oscars is like me boycotting Rihanna's panties. I wasn't invited!"" He also wondered aloud why there hadn't been as big of a protest during the previous 87 award shows. His conclusion? Black people have had bigger things to worry about. ""We were too busy being raped and lynched to care about who won best cinematographer,"" he said. ""When your grandmother's swinging from the tree, it's really hard to care about best documentary foreign short."" But he turned serious as he summed up the issue in Hollywood: ""We want opportunity. We want black actors to get the same opportunities. That's it."""

""And the intelligence committee is already looking at Russian involvement in our election. As Sen. (Roy) Blunt has already indicated, it is highly likely they will want to take look at this episode as well. They have the broad jurisdiction to do it."" \n \n The Senate\'s second-ranking Republican and other GOP senators have called for an investigation into the episode, building on a string of investigations underway on Russian interference in the US elections. Sen. John Cornyn told reporters Tuesday that the Senate standing committees with oversight of intelligence needs to investigate. \n \n Asked by CNN if he wanted the Senate\'s committees to investigate Flynn, Cornyn replied: ""Yes."" \n \n But Cornyn, the Senate majority whip, was not ready to say Flynn should testify before Congress. \n \n ""I think it\'s symbolic of somebody with a distinguished military career making a bad mistake,"" Cornyn said of Flynn. \n \n Flynn resigned from his position as national security adviser Monday following reports that the Justice Department warned the Trump administration last month that he misled administration officials about the nature of his conversations with the Russian ambassador and whether they addressed the issue of sanctions. \n \n The conversations occurred before he was an official government employee, causing some to fear that he was potentially vulnerable to blackmail by the Russians for covering up details of the exchanges. It is illegal for unauthorized private citizens to negotiate with foreign governments on behalf of the US. \n \n Vice President Mike Pence -- who was pushed into the center of the story after he defended Flynn on TV one month ago -- did not respond to shouted questions as he left the Capitol Tuesday. Pence has yet to say how he feels about Flynn\'s actions. \n \n Pence met with Senate Republicans Tuesday at the Capitol for their weekly lunch and discussed Flynn\'s resignation, although senators in attendance said he did not discuss his personal feelings. \n \n Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican who used to serve with Pence in the House of Representatives, said that Pence thanked Flynn for his service and explained that ""when discrepancies arose, they realized they had to do something."" \n \n ""And obviously the president made the call,"" Cassidy added.

To the question of executive privilege as to the president should discuss you know what he knows."" \n \n Sen. Roy Blunt, a member of the Senate intelligence committee, told KTRS radio he wanted to speak with Flynn. \n \n Blunt told KTRS radio that an investigation ""needs"" to happen. \n \n ""I think everybody needs that investigation to happen,"" he said. ""And the Senate intelligence committee, again that I serve on, has been given the principle responsibility to look into this, and I think that we should look into it exhaustively so that at the end of this process, nobody wonders whether there was a stone left unturned, and shouldn\'t reach conclusions before you have the information that you need to have to make those conclusions."" \n \n Blunt said lawmakers need to talk to Flynn ""very soon."" \n \n ""I would think that we should talk to Gen.

In his resignation letter, Flynn addressed the issue. \n \n ""Unfortunately, because of the fast pace of events, I inadvertently briefed the Vice President Elect and others with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the Russian Ambassador. I have sincerely apologized to the President and the Vice President, and they have accepted my apology,"" Flynn wrote in the letter. \n \n On TODAY, Conway was asked repeatedly why, despite reports that the Justice Department told the White House last month that Flynn had misled them and even put himself at risk for blackmail, he continued to retain the president\'s full trust. \n \n “That’s one characterization,"" Conway said. ""But the fact is that General Flynn continued in that position and was in the presidential daily briefings, was part of the leader calls as recently as (Monday) … and as time wore on, obviously the situation had become unsustainable.” \n \n Conway added that the president accepted Flynn\'s resignation and ""wishes him well, and we\'re moving on,"" noting three ""very strong candidates"" the administration is considering to replace him.', 'WASHINGTON — President Trump was informed more than two weeks ago that his national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, had not told the truth about his interactions with Russia’s ambassador, and the president eventually asked for Mr. Flynn’s resignation after concluding he could not be trusted, a White House official said on Tuesday. \n \n Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said the president’s team had been “reviewing and evaluating this issue with respect to General Flynn on a daily basis for a few weeks trying to ascertain the truth.” While Mr. Trump and his advisers ultimately concluded that there was no violation of law, the president decided Mr. Flynn could no longer serve in his position. \n \n “The evolving and eroding level of trust as a result of this situation and a series of other questionable instances is what led the president to ask for General Flynn’s resignation,” Mr. Spicer said at his daily briefing. He did not elaborate on the “other questionable instances.” \n \n As leaders of both parties indicated that Congress would investigate, Mr. Spicer’s comments were the first public confirmation by the White House that Mr. Trump was aware of the allegations against Mr. Flynn before they were reported last week. They also contradicted the previous description of the national security adviser’s abrupt departure on Monday night, attributing the decision to Mr. Trump rather than Mr. Flynn.', 'On Monday evening, President Trump lost his national security adviser, Michael Flynn, who resigned amid a swarm of questions about whether he misled top White House officials and the FBI over a December phone call with the Russian ambassador to the US. But in the process, Trump may have also suffered another major loss: his best and easiest shot at warming ties with Russia, by lifting sanctions on the country. \n \n The Trump administration has been struck by a hurricane of controversy stemming from Flynn’s resignation, including questions over whether Flynn potentially illegally discussed lifting sanctions on Russia during his communications with the Russian diplomat, and a continuing FBI probe into those communications, which could lead to criminal prosecutions. Additionally, the Army is looking into whether Flynn received money from the Russian government for a trip to Moscow in 2015, which could be a violation of the emoluments clause of the Constitution. \n \n There are also questions over how much Trump or top White House officials actually knew about Flynn’s call — including whether Trump may have authorized it in the first place. \n \n The unprecedented scrutiny of ties between the Trump administration and Moscow is in and of itself politically damaging for the White House. But it also might rob Trump of his ability to lift sanctions on Russia, one of his most widely anticipated maneuvers designed to reset Washington’s relationship with the Kremlin. \n \n Foreign policy observers had long anticipated that Trump would lift sanctions on Russia as his opening gambit to signal his commitment to improving US-Russian ties. After Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, said earlier in February that sanctions against Russia for its annexation of part of Ukraine in 2014 were expected to remain in place, the most obvious set of sanctions to lift became the ones Obama slapped on Moscow’s intelligence establishment in December for using cyberattacks to interfere with the US presidential election. \n \n Since those sanctions were imposed by executive order, Trump could overturn them on his own — without having to drag legislation through a Congress that up until very recently held deeply bipartisan animosity toward Putin. While that set of sanctions was largely symbolic, lifting them would instantly thaw some of the tensions between Washington and Moscow and open up a conversation on potential cooperation in pursuing shared interests. \n \n Prior to Flynn’s resignation, that move would have been controversial but doable. Now it’s looking like it would blow up in Trump’s face. \n \n Flynn’s ouster is raising the political costs of lifting sanctions. The press and advocates are going to pursue investigation of Trump’s ties to Russia with even more vigor. Democratic lawmakers are already ramping up their calls for independent congressional investigations (which top Republicans are refusing to consider for now). And the intelligence community is poring over Trump administration records for evidence of wrongdoing. \n \n That’s not enough to say Trump won’t lift sanctions anyway — but he and his advisers likely know that it would be foolish not to delay lifting them until wide concern over Russia’s meddling in Washington fades. That could be a while. \n \n Is all of this actually going to prevent Trump from lifting sanctions? \n \n At first glance, it might be hard to see why Trump would feel hamstrung by the Russia controversies engulfing his administration. Trump thrives off catering to his base through polarizing policies that cause enormous uproar from critics, like his ban restricting travel from seven Muslim-majority countries. \n \n But there are a few other factors to consider here. One is that being nice to Russia isn’t something the GOP base actually wants; it’s just something they’ve grown more receptive to because Trump has talked about it so frequently that their negative views of the Kremlin have become less intense. So while the share of Republicans who consider Russia a major threat has decreased in the past year or so, more than 40 percent of them still consider Russia a major threat, according to Pew data from January. It’s safe to say there aren’t huge rewards to be reaped from warming ties with Russia. \n \n On the other hand, lifting sanctions is something that would likely cause a huge outcry among those left of center — and from some members of the GOP, like Sens. Lindsey Graham, John McCain, and Marco Rubio, who have repeatedly expressed discomfort with Trump’s affection for Vladimir Putin. It could very well breathe even more energy into the emerging anti-Trump protest movement, and it could intensify the intelligence community’s scrutiny of Trump’s administration. \n \n Finally, there is the possibility that Trump will at some point actually grow concerned about the increased prominence of narratives suggesting that he doesn’t control his own policy and that he’s at the beck and call of a foreign leader. After reports earlier in February that his chief strategist, Steve Bannon, was the true mastermind at the White House — and some jokes from Saturday Night Live driving home the point — Trump took to Twitter to promise the public, “I call my own shots.” \n \n Trump doesn’t have a great deal to gain from lifting sanctions on Russia, but he does stand to lose quite a bit from it at this moment. His much-anticipated olive branch to Moscow is likely to be delayed as a result of it.', 'PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — At least 20 people on a music group\'s packed Carnival float in the Haitian capital were killed Tuesday when they were electrocuted by a power line, officials said. \n \n The accident occurred as thousands of people filled the streets of downtown Port-au-Prince for the raucous annual celebration. People at the scene said someone on the float used a pole or stick to move a power line so the float could pass under it. \n \n At least 20 people were killed and 46 were injured, according to Nadia Lochard, a coordinator for the Department of Civil Protection. \n \n The float was sponsored by the Haitian hip-hop group Barikad Crew.

Here are some of the latest updates on the ongoing Michael Flynn situation: On Tuesday morning, Kellyanne Conway told Today that Flynn decided to resign because he ""knew he had become a lightning rod."" But during a press briefing a few hours later, White House spokesperson Sean Spicer said Trump asked Flynn to resign due to an ""eroding level of trust,"" the New York Times reports. Spicer also insisted that Flynn hadn't broken the law. Regardless, even Republican senators—including Senate majority whip John Cornyn—are now calling for an investigation into Flynn and his talks with the Russian ambassador, though Cornyn wouldn't go so far as to say Flynn should testify, according to CNN. Meanwhile, Trump insists leaks, not Flynn's resignation, are the ""real story."" ""Why are there so many illegal leaks coming out?"" Politico quotes the president as saying. The Washington Post has a list of 10 questions about Flynn's actions and resignation that still haven't been answered, including if Flynn will face prosecution or if Spicer or the vice president will apologize to America for lying, deliberately or otherwise. Finally, Vox reports that before the Flynn situation, lifting Russian sanctions would be ""controversial but doable"" for Trump. But to do so now ""would blow up in Trump's face."""
132,"['(CNN) A top adviser to Donald Trump resigned Monday after sending a mocking tweet about just-fired campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, a campaign source tells CNN. \n \n Michael Caputo, a Trump adviser and head of the communications for Trump\'s caucus operations team, tweeted ""Ding Dong the witch is dead"" following the news that Lewandowski had been fired. \n \n ""I regret sending out a tweet today alluding to the firing of Corey Lewandowski. In hindsight, that was too exuberant a reaction to this personnel move. I know this is a distraction from the kind of campaign you want to run, so I\'m resigning my position as director of communications for caucus operations at the 2016 Republican National Convention. Let\'s make this immediate,"" Caputo wrote in a letter to campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, according to a copy obtained by CNN. \n \n Caputo also said he deeply respects Trump as well as Manafort and Gates. \n \n ""I wish you success in the months ahead. I continue to believe Donald Trump must be elected President in November. With you at the helm, I know he can. Call if I can help,"" he said. \n \n Caputo later told CNN that ""falling on the sword is what you do if you mess up."" \n \n ""Unforced errors have no place on a general election campaign for the White House,"" he said. \n \n Cleveland \n \n Caputo had been quietly helping to build Trump\'s convention\'s caucus operations team ahead of Cleveland, and was serving as communications director for caucus operations. \n \n The campaign was scheduled to release its caucus operations team on Tuesday, according to a convention source. \n \n The team, part of campaign chairman Paul Manafort\'s convention operation, will serve as a liaison between Trump\'s campaign and the national convention staff and has been meeting with RNC staff on the ground in Cleveland for the last two and a half weeks -- marking a big step toward creating a more traditional political machine for a campaign built on nonconformity. \n \n Veterans \n \n Trump\'s team is heavily comprised of military veterans, including its director of caucus operations, Ryan Price, who served as an Army Ranger. Price is a longtime GOP campaign operative, and former director of operation for the 2012 Republican National Convention in Tampa. \n \n Price will be assisted by David Urban, a West Point grad and Army Gulf War veteran who had worked as chief of staff for former Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen Specter. Urban will serve as deputy director. Caputo was to serve as director of communications for caucus operations at the 2016 Republican convention. \n \n John Ullyot, a Marine veteran and former adviser to former Sens. John Warner and Specter, who was to serve as deputy director of communications for media relations, will now serve as head of communications due to Caputo\'s departure. \n \n According to one convention source, the 14-person team will not be involved in any of the campaign\'s day-to-day communications operations. That will still fall to Trump\'s spokeswoman -- and only campaign communications team staffer -- Hope Hicks. \n \n Frustrations \n \n Caputo\'s departure comes amid frustrations over the campaign\'s lack of hiring so far of a traditional communications team to handle the high volume of media requests that comes with being a nominee for president, according to two sources in and around the campaign. \n \n Trump\'s convention team is currently in the process of trying to refine Trump\'s message -- building out its surrogate team ahead of Cleveland under John Wagner, the deputy director of communications for surrogate media. One convention source said they have already added 100 new surrogates, a number that will increase to 250 by the time of the convention. \n \n Wagner has a long list of credentials as retired U.S. Army public affairs officer where he served as an analyst for CENTCOM, an operations officer for NORTHCOM and a media official in Baghdad during Operation Iraqi Freedom. \n \n \'Murder boards\' \n \n Wagner, in conjunction with a new rapid-response team, has been prepping daily to respond to attacks -- sitting through ""murder boards,"" committees set up to drill individuals before hitting the media circuit, according to a convention source. \n \n Amber Smith, former spokeswoman for Concerned Veterans of America, has been brought on as press secretary of the rapid response team. Smith is a former Kiowa pilot who served in Iraq and Afghanistan. \n \n Former Trump surrogate and ""Apprentice"" contestant, Erin Elmore, had been tapped as deputy press secretary, but on Monday, a statement by the Republican National Convention said: ""Erin Elmore, who was recently named as a valued deputy press secretary for caucus operations, has left the team and remains active as one of the campaign\'s surrogate media spokespeople."" \n \n Elmore said Monday she could be a ""more effective advocate for Donald Trump\'s election as as surrogate on TV rather than working behind the scenes in Cleveland. \n \n Maricelly Velez, will serve the critical role of deputy press secretary for Hispanic media. \n \n Velez will be responsible for Hispanic outreach during the convention, a position that several sources in and around the campaign say is vital for building unity given various remarks made by Trump during the campaign, including calling Mexican immigrants ""rapists"" and saying the Mexican-American judge in his Trump University case was incapable of doing his job due to his heritage.

133,"['In the 61 years after it was first summited, Mount Everest has called tens of thousands of climbers to its icy trails. They focus on death-defying physical and mental achievements, but they face a more mundane summons on the mountain: nature’s call. \n \n Every climbing season, up to 26,500 pounds of human excrement befoul Everest, most of it bagged and carried by native Sherpas to earthen pits near Gorak Shep, a frozen lake bed and village at 16,942 feet. But space is running short, and fecal coliform bacteria threaten the nearby Khumbu Glacier watershed. \n \n Nate Janega ’06 is hoping to help solve the disposal problem. As senior engineer with the Seattle-based Mount Everest Biogas Project, Janega is designing a biogas digester that could convert the waste to methane gas. The digesters are common around the world — including in the United States, where cow manure is turned into energy — but the machinery never has been attempted in such a frigid climate. \n \n “It’s pretty much a frozen desert,” says Janega, whose designs call for insulation and solar panels, which will provide the digester’s heat. “It’s difficult because the digester’s temperature has to be kept between 20 and 30 degrees Celsius, which is much higher than the usual ambient temperature.” \n \n Project members hope to finalize the design this year to they can start building the underground digester next spring. The contraption is the size of a small to medium backyard storage shed. Processed waste could yield up to 667 liters of biogas a day, which would generate 50–80% of the heating value of a 20-pound propane tank, the size typically used for gas barbecue grills. \n \n The effort builds on efforts to minimize people’s impact on the mountain. Officials in Nepal, whose economy is reliant on the climbing industry, have required each climber in recent years to pack out 18 pounds of garbage – everything from oxygen bottles to broken tent parts. They now fear human waste has reached a critical mass on Everest. \n \n “Every climbing season sees more human waste dropped there, and there’s this overwhelming sense that as climbing becomes more accessible, the problem could grow,” Janega says. \n \n The path to the Himalayas wasn’t always so clear to Janega. As a kid, he loved building creations with Legos, but an idealistic streak didn’t initially draw him to engineering. \n \n “By high school, I had clearly seen the destructive influence of humans on the rest of nature,” Janega says. “I knew that I wanted my life and work to change that habit, but I didn’t know how.” \n \n It was at Grinnell that he enrolled in a First-Year Tutorial and studied the role of biogas in China. There, biogas is credited with slowing the rate of deforestation by providing families an alternative heating source. Janega decided to major in biochemistry. \n \n “The classes I took (at Grinnell) changed the way I analyze and absorb information. It’s a culture of expanding the mind that is still important to me today.” He went on to earn a civil environmental engineering graduate degree at the University of Washington in Seattle. For the biogas project, he’s one of six volunteer engineers. Last spring, Janega traveled to Nepal in part to survey possible sites for the digester. \n \n This is an urgent matter. Water sampling on the mountain has shown E. coli levels are high enough to be health-threatening. \n \n Janega made a quick impression on Garry Porter, a retired Boeing engineer who is the biogas project’s program manager. \n \n “Nate is an incredibly bright and enthusiastic young man with a broad worldview,” Porter says. “He has a can-do attitude that sometimes gets beaten out of old engineers like myself. He’s the pointy edge of the sword right now.”', ""Each year, the Eco Everest Expedition picks up the oxygen tanks and food containers discarded by decades of mountaineers \n \n \n \n Apa Sherpa has climbed the world's tallest mountain a record 20 times. The expedition for his 21st began last week, with the simplest of all environmental goals: to pick up the trash. \n \n In an endeavor where the burden of extra weight can mean the difference between life and death, between surviving with your limbs intact or missing, it's not surprising that until recently the custom was to leave debris such as used oxygen tanks and food containers on the mountain, where they would likely be covered by snow soon enough anyway. But the trash has accumulated over time and, sadly, global warming has meant less snow and more exposure for what was discarded. \n \n According to an article written by expedition organizer Ang Tshering Sherpa and posted on Explorers Web, this is the fourth consecutive year that the Eco Everest Expedition has been conducted: \n \n \n \n The Eco Everest Expedition was organized successfully for three consecutive years (2008, 2009 and 2010) to create international awareness about the impact of Climate Change in the Himalayas and the lives of the mountain communities. That is why the expedition uses highly successful alternative energy solutions like the parabolic solar cookers, solar energies for lighting and the SteriPENs for water purification and also encourages other expedition teams to use them . . . \n \n \n \n Since 2008 until today Eco Everest Expedition has brought down more than 12,000 kilos of previous expedition garbage and more than 300 kilos of human waste produced by Eco Everest Expedition from Mt. Everest for proper disposal. Also four dead bodies [have been] recovered and brought down from the mountain for a dignified burial and funeral. \n \n Apa and his team—which includes porters and guides from other expeditions—are planning on making several trips up and down the widely used Southeast Ridge route, reports Nick Vega on the website The BQB. That is the most heavily trafficked route to the summit. The climbers (not all of whom will attempt the summit) include 40 Sherpas and 22 others from the U.S., India, Brazil, Japan, Spain, Mexico, and Switzerland."", 'FILE - In this Oct. 27, 2011 file photo, the last light of the day sets on Mount Everest as it rises behind Mount Nuptse as seen from Tengboche, in the Himalaya\'s Khumbu region, Nepal.

Human waste left... (Associated Press) \n \n KATHMANDU, Nepal (AP) — Human waste left by climbers on Mount Everest has become a problem that is causing pollution and threatening to spread disease on the world\'s highest peak, the chief of Nepal\'s mountaineering association said Tuesday. \n \n The more than 700 climbers and guides who spend nearly two months on Everest\'s slopes each climbing season leave large amounts of feces and urine, and the issue has not been addressed, Ang Tshering told reporters. He said Nepal\'s government needs to get the climbers to dispose of the waste properly so the mountain remains pristine. \n \n Hundreds of foreign climbers attempt to scale Everest during Nepal\'s mountaineering season, which began this week and runs through May. Last year\'s season was canceled after 16 local guides were killed in an avalanche in April. \n \n Climbers spend weeks acclimatizing around the four camps set up between the base camp at 5,300 meters (17,380 feet) and the 8,850-meter-high (29,035-foot-high) summit. The camps have tents and some essential equipment and supplies, but do not have toilets. \n \n ""Climbers usually dig holes in the snow for their toilet use and leave the human waste there,"" Tshering said, adding that the waste has been ""piling up"" for years around the four camps. \n \n At the base camp, where there are more porters, cooks and support staff during the climbing season, there are toilet tents with drums to store the waste. Once filled, the drums are carried to a lower area, where the waste is properly disposed. \n \n Dawa Steven Sherpa, who has been leading Everest cleanup expeditions since 2008, said some climbers carry disposable travel toilet bags to use in the higher camps. \n \n ""It is a health hazard and the issue needs to be addressed,"" he said. \n \n Nepal\'s government has not come up with a plan yet to tackle the issue of human waste. But starting this season, officials stationed at the base camp will strictly monitor garbage on the mountain, said Puspa Raj Katuwal, the head of the government\'s Mountaineering Department. \n \n The government imposed new rules last year requiring each climber to bring down to the base camp 8 kilograms (18 pounds) of trash — the amount it estimates a climber discards along the route. \n \n Climbing teams must leave a $4,000 deposit that they lose if they don\'t comply with the regulations, Katuwal said. \n \n More than 4,000 climbers have scaled Mount Everest since 1953, when it was first conquered by New Zealand climber Edmund Hillary and his Sherpa guide, Tenzing Norgay. Hundreds of others have died in the attempt, while many have succeeded only with help from oxygen tanks, equipment porters and Sherpa guides.']",3,"– The majesty of Mount Everest is being ruined by hundreds of climbers and guides who turn it into the world's highest toilet every climbing season, officials in Nepal warn. The chief of the country's mountaineering association says that at camps between base camp and the summit, climbers ""usually dig holes in the snow for their toilet use and leave the human waste there,"" the AP reports. He says the accumulated waste is not only causing pollution, it has the potential to spread disease and turn the mountain into a health hazard. According to one estimate, climbers leave 26,500 pounds of excrement on Everest every year, Gawker notes. Last year, before an avalanche killed 16 guides and brought climbing season to an early end, Nepal ordered each climber to bring at least 18 pounds of trash down from the mountain—not including ""empty oxygen bottles and human dung."" But some have been bringing back more than that: A few years ago, the Atlantic profiled the Eco Everest Expedition, in which dozens of volunteers go up the mountain every year to haul down some of the thousands of pounds of accumulated trash—and the bodies of some climbers who didn't make it back."

Police believe it's a case of premeditated murder and say the Toronto native, 41, likely knew his killer as there were no signs of forced entry. They've released a photo of what CBS News reports to be a silver or light green Toyota Prius, though police say it's not necessarily the suspect's vehicle and they won't say exactly where it was spotted. The New York Daily News reports Markel had two young sons, aged 3 and 5, with ex-wife Wendi Adelson, a fellow professor at Florida State with whom Markel was reportedly involved in a legal dispute over custody issues and finances.

A subsequent pathologist report found that Glushkov died by a ""compression to the neck,"" London\'s Metropolitan Police said on Friday. \n \n Glushkov was best known for being a close associate of the Russian oligarch and prominent Putin critic Boris Berezovsky, who was found dead on the bathroom floor of his ex-wife\'s house in Ascot, southeast England, in 2013. \n \n Shortly after Berezovsky\'s death, Glushkov told The Guardian that he was also a target of the Russian government. \n \n He alleged that both Berezovsky and Alexander Litvinenko, a former Russian spy who was fatally poisoned in 2006, had been on a Kremlin hit list. \n \n Glushkov said at the time: ""I don\'t see anyone left on it apart from me."" \n \n On Wednesday, Glushkov\'s friend Alex Goldfarb also claimed that Russian intelligence agencies had held a grudge against Glushkov since the 1990s. \n \n A police forensic officer outside Glushkov\'s house in New Malden, southwest London, on Wednesday.

Leadership matters,” said Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said at a Lakeland rally, according to audio provided by American Bridge. “And that is why this election is so cotton-pickin' important to the state of Florida. I hope you all don’t mess it up.” \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n Perdue is a former governor of Georgia. \n \n “You would have to ask Governor Perdue about any of his remarks,” Stephen Lawson, a spokesman for DeSantis’ campaign, said by email. “We were happy to have him in Polk County campaigning with us.“ \n \n The phrase “cotton-pickin‘” bedeviled another Trump Republican earlier this year when the president’s former deputy campaign manager, David Bossie, apologized in June for telling a black guest on Fox News, “You’re out of your cotton-pickin' mind.” \n \n Before Bossie could apologize, program host Ed Henry called the phrase “deeply offensive and wholly inappropriate.” \n \n From the start of the general election, race has played a dominating factor in Florida’s nationally-watched governor‘s race. The day after the Aug. 28 primary election, on a different Fox show, DeSantis called Gillum “articulate” and said voters shouldn’t “monkey this up” by electing him. Like Bossie, DeSantis was rebuked on air by a Fox News personality, but the former three-term congressman, who is white, refused to apologize because he said he did nothing wrong and his comment was not about race. \n \n During an Oct. 21 debate, Gillum directly addressed the “monkey this up” remark in a racial context after the moderator asked DeSantis about the comments. \n \n “He has only continued in the course of his campaign to draw all the attention he can to the color of my skin,” Gillum said. “The truth is, I’ve been black all of my life. So far as I know, I will die black.” \n \n DeSantis has fiercely pushed back against any accusations he is racist, offering up his time as a Navy JAG officer as evidence. \n \n “When I was down-range in Iraq, we worked as a team regardless of race,” DeSantis said during the second and final gubernatorial debate on Oct. 24. \n \n The moderator at that debate asked DeSantis about the fact he has spoken at conferences organized by conservative David Horowitz, who has in the past sparked controversy for statements like “the country’s only serious race war is against whites.” \n \n “How the hell am I supposed to know every single statement someone makes?” DeSantis said. “I’m not going to bow down to the altar of political correctness, I’m not going to let the media smear me.” \n \n Gillum’s response drew loud reaction from the audience, and later went viral. \n \n “I’m not calling Mr. DeSantis a racist,” Gillum said. “I’m saying the racists believe he’s a racist.” \n \n Marc Caputo contributed to this report."", 'On the day she buried her 15-year-old daughter, Sandra Wesselman made a silent promise: to never let the search for her killer be forgotten. \n \n ""I didn’t know that was going to be a lifetime process,” Wesselman said in 2011, two-and-a-half decades after Kristina Wesselman was found raped and stabbed in a field near their suburban Chicago home. \n \n The mother can now put her vow to rest. \n \n On Sunday, authorities announced that they\'d caught the suspected killer: a 62-year-old man who lived 150 miles south of the crime scene. \n \n The big break came on Sept. 10, when investigators ""obtained new information"" on the case, DuPage County Sheriff John Zaruba said in a statement.

He said that the protest had run for two hours from the start of Petraeus\'s class, at 2.30pm, and ended quietly after a total of 100 people had attended. \n \n The demonstration in the video took place after Petraeus\'s session had finished at 6.30pm, Moreno said. He said the people in the footage ""were just students taking their own initiative"". \n \n Students will protest against Petraeus\'s presence again on Monday, Moreno said. He said a coalition of groups would form ""your traditional picket"", which would be peaceful, and would take place outside the building where Petraeus is due to teach. \n \n ""There are other students that are willing to go the extra step and wait for him after class and just make his time here in New York a living hell basically,"" Moreno added. \n \n Petraeus, who served as commanding general in Iraq and oversaw all coalition forces in the country, is teaching a course titled ""Are We On the Threshold of the North American Decade?"" \n \n The weekly class is billed as an interdisciplinary seminar where students ""examine in depth and then synthesize the history and trends in diverse public policy topics with a view towards recommendations for America\'s leadership role in the emerging global economy"". \n \n Petraeus was appointed director of the CIA in 2011 but resigned in November 2012 after revelations of an extra-marital affair. \n \n ""The purpose of the protest is to let the administration know that war criminals cannot be hired, especially on a campus that historically has been a working class institution,"" Moreno said.

In fact, more than 4,000 brewers are battling for less than a dozen popular hop varieties ""like a bunch of wolves going after a carcass,"" Wicked Weed Brewing co-owner Luke Dickinson tells the Wall Street Journal. The result is a shortage of the weed even as its production continues to rise; farmland devoted to the crop has jumped 65% in the past five years alone, but the number of brewers has grown faster, doubling from 2,000 to 4,000 in that same period. Competition is so fierce, and hops so slow to mature (it takes the vines two to three years), that some brewers are forced to turn away thousands of barrels of beer orders. Ironically, the resulting slowdown in craft beer production growth this year has farmers worrying about a coming glut of hops, not to mention a concern about how reliable all the new breweries will be two, three, four years down the road. This has farmers cautious even as demand outpaces supply. Further complicating matters is that craft brewers are looking for aroma hops to add flavor, not alpha hops that give Budweiser and Miller Lite their bitterness, resulting in a wide variety of new and niche hops, many of which have small orders.

139,"['Irvine, Calif., Jan. 23, 2015 – UC Irvine and Australian chemists have figured out how to unboil egg whites – an innovation that could dramatically reduce costs for cancer treatments, food production and other segments of the $160 billion global biotechnology industry, according to findings published today in the journal ChemBioChem. \n \n “Yes, we have invented a way to unboil a hen egg,” said Gregory Weiss, UCI professor of chemistry and molecular biology & biochemistry. “In our paper, we describe a device for pulling apart tangled proteins and allowing them to refold. We start with egg whites boiled for 20 minutes at 90 degrees Celsius and return a key protein in the egg to working order.” \n \n Like many researchers, he has struggled to efficiently produce or recycle valuable molecular proteins that have a wide range of applications but which frequently “misfold” into structurally incorrect shapes when they are formed, rendering them useless. \n \n “It’s not so much that we’re interested in processing the eggs; that’s just demonstrating how powerful this process is,” Weiss said. “The real problem is there are lots of cases of gummy proteins that you spend way too much time scraping off your test tubes, and you want some means of recovering that material.” \n \n But older methods are expensive and time-consuming: The equivalent of dialysis at the molecular level must be done for about four days. “The new process takes minutes,” Weiss noted. “It speeds things up by a factor of thousands.” \n \n To re-create a clear protein known as lysozyme once an egg has been boiled, he and his colleagues add a urea substance that chews away at the whites, liquefying the solid material. That’s half the process; at the molecular level, protein bits are still balled up into unusable masses. The scientists then employ a vortex fluid device, a high-powered machine designed by Professor Colin Raston’s laboratory at South Australia’s Flinders University. Shear stress within thin, microfluidic films is applied to those tiny pieces, forcing them back into untangled, proper form. \n \n “This method … could transform industrial and research production of proteins,” the researchers write in ChemBioChem. \n \n For example, pharmaceutical companies currently create cancer antibodies in expensive hamster ovary cells that do not often misfold proteins. The ability to quickly and cheaply re-form common proteins from yeast or E. coli bacteria could potentially streamline protein manufacturing and make cancer treatments more affordable.

Earlier this year, researchers at the National Autonomous University of Mexico published a formal breakdown of the absolutely ridiculous physics behind his breathtaking 9.58-second world record sprint –– a feat some hold to be one of the greatest athletic performances ever recorded. Now, the Jamaican runner is poised to break another set of records with the publication of his new autobiography, in which he reminisces about women, bolting, and the time he ate 1,000 Chicken McNuggets in 10 days. \n \n The fast food feat reportedly took place during the 2008 Bejing Olympics, where the then 22-year-old athlete would eventually shatter the competition by breaking his own world record. When Bolt discovered that he was weirded out by Chinese food, he decided to keep it simple and base his Olympic diet on America’s favorite food: the Chicken McNugget. As with most things in Bolt’s life, the situation soon took a turn for the extreme. \n \n “At first I ate a box of 20 for lunch, then another for dinner. The next day I had two boxes for breakfast, one for lunch and then another couple in the evening. I even grabbed some fries and an apple pie to go with it,” he writes in his biography, Faster Than Lightning. “Man, I should have gotten a gold medal for all that chowing down.” \n \n Both Usain Bolt and Michael Phelps have stunned the world with their extreme diets. Calgary Reviews, CC BY 2.0 \n \n According to The New York Post, the 200-lbs athlete estimates that over the 10 days he spent in the Chinese capital, he averaged 100 nuggets per day –– 1,000 pieces in total. That means that Bolt scarfed about 59,000 calories, 3,000 grams of protein, and 4,000 grams of fat during the tournament. Each day, he consumed 2220 mg of sodium, or about five times the daily recommended intake. \n \n Why Eating 1,000 Chicken McNuggets Is Not A Good Idea \n \n Bolt’s chicken McNugget stunt recalls the Olympic diet of Michael Phelps, whose 12,000-calorie-a-day meal plan made headlines a few years ago. Like Bolt, Phelps has no truck with lettuce-wrapped tofu dogs or steamed greens, and relies primarily on one-pound bowls of pasta and entire pizzas to get him through the day. A typical Phelps breakfast, for example, consists of three fried-egg sandwiches loaded with cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, fried onions and mayonnaise; two cups of coffee; one five-egg omelet; one bowl of grits; three slices of French toast topped with powdered sugar; and three chocolate-chip pancakes for good measure. \n \n Why, then, are so many people freaking out about exceeding their daily calorie intake? If two Olympic athletes can subsist entirely on foods that 99 percent of all diets ban, why can’t everyone else do it? Why do we even have diets? According to Mark Klion, a sport medicine physician and orthopedic surgeon at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York, extreme eating ultimately comes down to basic math. Once you take into account Phelps’ equally extreme training regimen, you will find that the vertiginous calorie-count is rapidly offset by the pull-ups, deadlifts, squats, and 1,600 Olympic pool lengths he records every week. \n \n “I think for him, because of his caloric demands, he can probably eat whatever he wants to,” Klion said, speaking to The Wall Street Journal. “If you’ve got to eat that much, it better be enjoyable, or you won’t be able to keep up.”']",2,"– Harry Reid's hope of passing health care legislation before Christmas took a giant step forward tonight.

Mother Jones ranked it as one of America’s “worst prisons.” Sitting on an island that was once used to raise pigs for slaughter and as a landfill, the correctional facility has a long history of gang violence and widespread corruption among its guards. \n \n It was here that 41-year-old Aitabdel Salem, a native of Algeria, spent five months for no good reason. His bail was set at a mere $2 — the price of a slice of New York pizza — but allegedly no one actually told him. Salem, thinking his bail was set at $25,000, languished on Rikers Island from November 2014 to April 2015 although he could have walked out at any time. \n \n Salem was arrested Nov. 21, 2014, accused of attacking the New York police officer who was arresting him in the theft of a coat from a Zara location in the Flatiron District, the New York Daily News reported. His bail was set at $25,000, more than Salem could afford. \n \n [Kalief Browder’s suicide and the high cost of violence and delay at Rikers] \n \n Prosecutors weren’t able to get an indictment for the alleged police assault, though, and Salem’s release from that charge was ordered just a week later on Nov. 28. \n \n He still faced charges for two minor offenses from allegedly tampering with a subway card machine in 2014, according to Mashable, so he was required to post bail before leaving jail. Since the charges were so small, a judge dropped his bail to a dollar for each charge, totaling $2. \n \n According to Salem, though, no one told him. Salem’s new attorneys, Glenn Hardy and Theodore Goldbergh, are placing the blame on his previous attorney. \n \n Salem “was shocked and dismayed and frustrated that his case was unconscionably mishandled and there was no communication by his attorney telling him his bail was $2 which he could have made at any moment,” Glenn Hardy said at a recent court hearing, according to WPIX. \n \n The previous attorney has not responded. \n \n [Prosecutors charge Rikers Island officers in beating death of inmate] \n \n Salem was released in April 2015, five months after being arrested, but was arrested again for failing to appear at an arraignment for the original assault charge a few weeks later, on May 13, according to the Daily News. His lawyers claim the letter informing Salem of his court date was lost in the mail and had been stamped “return to sender” by the post office. \n \n “You can’t do what you don’t know and if you’re a defendant in a criminal case you certainly have a right to rely upon the system [to know] what your next court date is,” Goldbergh said. \n \n According to court records, his bail is now set at $30,000, the Centre Daily Times reported. \n \n Last June, 22-year-old Kalief Browder committed suicide after being held in Rikers for three years, from 2010 to 2013, without a trial on charges related to stealing a backpack, Agence France-Presse reported.', 'These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

A growing advocacy movement is gearing up to pressure New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio to spend considerable capital to shut down the scandal-scarred jail complex, which they argue is too broken to reform. \n \n Unable to pay $25,000 to bail himself out, a Queens resident languished in New York City’s notoriously overcrowded and abusive Rikers Island jail for approximately five months. According to court documents, he should’ve only paid $2 for bail and been released after one week. \n \n Aitabdel Salem, an immigrant from Algeria, was detained in November 2014 for fighting a cop who arrested him for theft at a clothing store. He was locked away at Rikers because he was unable to pay the $25,000 bail amount. After his first week behind bars, however, prosecutors on the case were unable to indict him and he no longer owed thousands of dollars. To be released, Salem only had to chalk up two, $1 bail payments for unrelated mischief and tampering charges. \n \n His lawyer, Stephen Pokart, never told him. And when Salem was eventually released in May 2015, he also missed his arraignment because of a court date mix-up. He was subsequently charged with bail jumping, jailed, and slapped with $30,000 for the officer assault. \n \n “(Salem) was shocked and dismayed and frustrated that his case was unconscionably mishandled and there was no communication by his attorney telling him his bail was $2 which he could have made at any moment,” Glenn Hardy, one of Salem’s new attorneys, said at a recent court hearing. \n \n In reality, Pokart’s failure is representative of New York City’s broken bail system. \n \n Last year, Mayor Bill de Blasio’s office announced that some nonviolent offenders wouldn’t be jailed for being poor and unable to make bail. The decision was made about one month after Kalief Browder, who was jailed as a teenager because he couldn’t pay a $3,000 bail amount, committed suicide. Browder didn’t commit a crime, but spent more than three years at Rikers, and half of that time in solitary confinement. When he was released, he suffered from depression and paranoia. He ultimately took his own life. \n \n New York City’s bail system forces poor people to pay an average of $2,000 to avoid jail time. According to the New York Lawyers’ Association, 44 percent of defendants are unable to pay $500, let alone thousands. Prior to de Blasio announcement, 45,500 people were held on bail, annually. Roughly 90 percent of the people behind bars are black or Latino. \n \n Instead of funneling defendants to city jails, including Rikers, the judges can now offer low-level offenders the opportunity to attend drug and behavioral therapy instead. Judges can also require text message reminders and daily check-ins, in lieu of setting bail.""]",3,"– Aitabdel Salem needed to hand over only $2 to bail himself out of Rikers Island, a fact he found out after a five-month stay. The 41-year-old Queens man was initially jailed on $25,000 bail for allegedly attacking an officer who arrested him on suspicion of theft at a retail store on Nov. 21, 2014, reports the New York Daily News. A week later, prosecutors couldn't get an indictment, and Salem was ordered released. First, though, he needed to pay $1 bail for each of two other charges of tampering and mischief—and he would have, had he been informed of the change. The Algerian native says his lawyer at the time, a legal aid defender, never told him that a $2 bill would be enough to set him free—the equivalent of a slice of pizza in New York City, notes the Washington Post. Salem ""was shocked and dismayed and frustrated that his case was unconscionably mishandled,"" his new lawyers told a hearing. He was finally released in the spring of 2015, but he missed the police assault arraignment in May of that year—and Salem blames that on another communication foul-up by his original attorney involving an errant address. Still, the mix-up led to charges of bail jumping, and Salem was sent back to jail with bail set at $30,000. He remains locked up. Salem's case ""is representative of New York City's broken bail system,"" writes a blogger at ThinkProgress.

Chris Christie faces one of his first major tests since his backyard political scandal erupted: reassuring top Republican donors that he has taken steps to address allegations of political payback in his home state and that he remains a viable presidential contender for the party\'s establishment. \n \n In this Jan. 16, 2014, photo, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie addresses a gathering of home owners in Manahawkin, N.J., who were affected by last year\'s Superstorm Sandy. Christie faces a big test this... (Associated Press) \n \n Christie, who leads the Republican Governors Association, will travel to Florida this weekend for a series of fundraisers to help Republican Gov. Rick Scott. It will be his first out-of-state trip since the scandal involving lane closures at the George Washington Bridge escalated. \n \n The itinerary listing some of Florida\'s most exclusive addresses will give Christie an opportunity to convince longtime financial supporters and wealthy newcomers that the scandal has not hurt his stature as a potential 2016 presidential contender. Many Republicans have come to Christie\'s defense and credited him with taking responsibility, although some GOP leaders say his future will depend on whether his account of what happened is accurate. \n \n ""I have heard from a few donors and their general feeling is that Governor Christie is being truthful, has fully accepted responsibility and has acted decisively in firing those responsible for this awful act,"" said Fred Malek, the governors association\'s finance chairman. ""Their enthusiasm and support for Christie is only heightened by his display of leadership under duress."" \n \n Christie plans to raise money for Scott at an Orlando luncheon whose host committee includes John D. Rood, a Jacksonville real estate developer; Orlando attorney Pat Christiansen; and businessman Bill Heavener, a co-chairman of Mitt Romney\'s Florida fundraising team in 2012. \n \n A second event is planned at the Palm Beach home of Pepe Fanjul Jr., executive vice president of Florida Crystals, a prominent U.S. sugar producer. It\'s being followed by a fundraiser at the Fort Lauderdale home of Bill Rubin, the president of a lobbying firm and a longtime friend of Scott\'s. \n \n On Sunday, Christie will attend two fundraisers in Palm Beach and meet with top financial supporters at a gathering organized by Ken Langone, the billionaire co-founder of Home Depot, who urged the governor to consider a late entry into the 2012 presidential race. The event, which was first reported by The Washington Post, will allow some of Christie\'s longtime supporters to huddle following the governor\'s sweeping re-election in November. \n \n As Christie spends time along Florida\'s coast, the U.S. attorney\'s office in New Jersey and the state Legislature are looking into a scheme that shut down lanes to the major bridge connecting New York and New Jersey for four days in September, creating massive traffic jams. The plan apparently was hatched by Christie\'s aides as a political vendetta, possibly because the city of Fort Lee\'s Democratic mayor wouldn\'t endorse the Republican governor\'s re-election. \n \n The governor apologized and fired a top aide but told reporters he had ""no knowledge or involvement"" in the incident. He has not been implicated in the case, yet the scandal could dog him in the weeks ahead and cause consternation for his financial backers. \n \n Scott, one of the nation\'s most vulnerable Republican governors, also will receive help on Friday night at a Naples, Fla., fundraiser headlined by Indiana Gov. Mike Pence. Scott is expected to face a formidable challenge this year from former GOP Gov. Charlie Crist, who is running as a Democrat. \n \n As the New Jersey incident gained national attention earlier this month, Scott\'s campaign contemplated canceling the fundraisers but ultimately decided to go ahead. \n \n During the private meetings, how Christie addresses the imbroglio could be critical for financial rainmakers who are beginning to take stock of a potentially large Republican field. Two prominent Florida Republicans — former Gov. Jeb Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio — are viewed as potential candidates. \n \n ""Is Governor Christie someone I would consider? Absolutely. Yes. But I would consider other people,"" said Ned Siegel, a Boca Raton, Fla., developer and prominent Republican donor who is helping Scott\'s campaign. \n \n The 2016 presidential campaign will begin in earnest following November\'s midterm elections. Insiders suggest that any prospective candidate will need to raise $50 million to $100 million by the end of the 2016 primaries. Separately, aspiring presidential candidates will need wealthy donors willing to fund super PACs that will advocate for the candidate outside the confines of a presidential campaign. \n \n Democrats have tried to use the bridge scandal to tarnish Christie, who cruised to re-election against an underfunded Democratic opponent. \n \n ___ \n \n Thomas reported from Washington.

(AP) — Cutting nearly $1 trillion from Medicaid will give states the freedom to tailor the program to suit their needs, Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price said Sunday, as he defended a narrowly passed House bill that aims to undo parts of the health care law enacted by the previous administration. \n \n The bill\'s passage buoyed President Donald Trump, but the measure appeared headed for an overhaul in the Senate. Mick Mulvaney, Trump\'s budget director, said the House bill is unlikely to be the version that ultimately clears the Senate and ends up in front of the president. \n \n Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, a moderate Republican whose vote will be critical in getting a bill to Trump\'s desk, voiced concerns about potential higher costs for older people and those with pre-existing conditions. She said the House bill was difficult to assess overall because it passed without an updated analysis by the Congressional Budget Office on how the measure would affect health care costs and coverage. The CBO concluded after reviewing an earlier version of the House bill that an estimated 24 million consumers would lose coverage over 10 years. \n \n Collins said she expected the Senate would come up with a ""whole new fresh approach"" to replacing the Affordable Care Act, enacted under President Barack Obama. \n \n ""The House bill is not going to come before us,"" she said. ""The Senate is starting from scratch. We\'re going to draft our bill, and I\'m convinced we will take the time to do it right."" \n \n CBO\'s analysis highlighted an $880 billion cut to Medicaid, the federal-state health care program for the poor and disabled, which Price sought to cast as a way to give states more leeway to experiment with the program. The Obama-era law expanded Medicaid with extra payments to 31 states to cover more people. The House bill halts the expansion, in addition to cutting federal spending on the program. \n \n But Prince insisted Sunday, ""There are no cuts to the Medicaid program,"" adding that resources were being apportioned ""in a way that allows states greater flexibility."" \n \n Price said the changes will make sure that people who rely on Medicaid get the care and coverage that they need. \n \n The House bill, passed 217-213, would end the health care law\'s fines on people who don\'t buy policies and erase its taxes on health industry businesses and higher-earning people. It would dilute consumer-friendly insurance coverage requirements, like prohibiting higher premiums for customers with pre-existing medical conditions. The measure would also water down the subsidies that help consumers afford health insurance. \n \n Major medical and other organizations, including the American Medical Association, oppose the bill. \n \n Trump celebrated its passage with House Republicans in the White House Rose Garden on Thursday, an unusual move following passage of a bill by one House of Congress. \n \n On Sunday, he urged Republican senators to not fail the American people. \n \n ""Republican Senators will not let the American people down!"" Trump tweeted. ""ObamaCare premiums and deductibles are way up — it was a lie and it is dead!"" \n \n House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said he expected the Senate will improve the House bill, which represents the culmination of seven years of promises by Republicans to repeal and replace what\'s become known as ""Obamacare."" Ryan said the House vote was one part of a ""multistage process."" \n \n ""We think we need to do even more support for people who are older,"" he acknowledged. ""The Senate will complete the job."" \n \n Price commented on CNN\'s ""State of the Union.""

154,"['Angela Weiss/Getty Images Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) was the first senator to publicly call on her colleague, Al Franken, to resign after numerous allegations of sexual misconduct. \n \n No one in Congress is more associated with the Me Too movement than Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.). Long before Harvey Weinstein and Matt Lauer became infamous creeps, Gillibrand was focusing her attention on sexual assault and harassment in the military, on college campuses and in the workplace. \n \n But the two-term senator cemented her prominence in the movement last year when she called out members of her own party. In November, she said that Bill Clinton should have resigned the presidency over his affair with Monica Lewinsky. And then the following month, she became the first Democratic senator to publicly call on then-Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) to go after multiple women accused him of engaging in sexual misconduct. \n \n Franken announced his resignation the following day. \n \n Speaking out has consequences. Women who come forward about the abuse they’ve faced are often barred from further job opportunities. And even someone in power like Gillibrand who tries to be an advocate for victims can find themselves facing a negative response from a previously friendly community. \n \n Eight women accused Franken of groping them. Yet he remains beloved by many Democrats, who say he was one of the party’s strongest champions on progressive issues. His questioning in Senate hearings landed both Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos in hot water, and if he were still around, he’d no doubt play a big role in taking on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. \n \n His defenders say he was pushed out too early for transgressions that, while unfortunate, didn’t rise to the level of what some members of the GOP have done and didn’t make him a threat who needed to leave immediately. \n \n Gillibrand wasn’t the only senator to publicly call on Franken to step down, but she was the first (but only by minutes) in a wave of female senators ― who were eventually joined by many of their male colleagues on the same day, Dec. 6 ― to do so. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), however, reportedly told Franken in private that he needed to go beforehand. \n \n But Gillibrand has received the brunt of the blame for what happened, with many of her detractors saying the reason she came out against Franken was that she’s an “opportunist” who was positioning herself for a presidential run in 2020. Some Democratic Party donors have been reconsidering whether they would support her in a primary. \n \n Most prominently, Gillibrand has attracted the ire of billionaire George Soros, who has long funded Democratic candidates and causes. Soros recently said he wasn’t sure whom he was supporting for 2020, but that it absolutely wouldn’t be Gillibrand. He accused her of going after Franken, “whom I admire,” to “improve her chances” for president. \n \n “If standing up for women who have been wronged makes George Soros mad, that’s on him,” Gillibrand said in a statement to HuffPost. “But I won’t hesitate to always do what I think is right. For nearly a year, we have seen countless acts of courage as women and men have spoken hard truths about sexual assault and sexual harassment and demanded accountability.” \n \n “I stand with them in this new watershed moment of important change in our society on what we deem as acceptable,” she added. “It is clear that we must put our morals and the valuing of women ahead of party loyalty. When someone does something wrong, you have to speak up and be counted, whether it’s President Trump, or a Democratic colleague.” \n \n ‘I Think It Was A Big Mistake’ \n \n HuffPost spoke to dozens of elite donors who contributed significant amounts of money to Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. Gillibrand, at one time, was part of the tight, loyal Clinton world. The Clintons were early supporters of hers and Hillary wrote the foreword to Gillibrand’s book. \n \n Many of these donors said that either they were unhappy with Gillibrand or knew plenty of people who were. The 2020 race is still years away, but as donors start to shop around, her comments on Clinton and Franken could be a factor. \n \n “I viewed it as self-serving, as opportunistic ― unforgivable in my view,” said Rosalind Fink, a New York donor. “Since then, I have not purposely attended any fundraiser where she was there. And there is absolutely no way I will support her.” \n \n Fink said she condemned Franken’s behavior, but she believed the Senate should have investigated the allegations thoroughly before forcing him out. \n \n “I think it was a big mistake,” said Irene Finel Honigman, another Clinton donor from New York, adding, “I was not that impressed with her to begin with. I think she certainly had potential, but as for many people, this kind of sealed the deal.” \n \n Another donor, who like many others asked to remain anonymous in order to speak candidly, called Gillibrand a “ruthless opportunist.” \n \n “That’s the knock on her, and that’s what this proved,” he said. “She saw an opportunity to be out front, and regardless of the ramifications, she took it.” \n \n Susie Tompkins Buell, a major Democratic Party donor who has championed female politicians, also said she was reconsidering her support for senators who called for Franken to resign. \n \n On social media, it’s easy to find anti-Gillibrand posts. No matter the issue, Gillibrand has detractors who circle back to what she did to Franken. \n \n Hope Kirsten Gillibrand is happy with her handiwork. https://t.co/vg6Dmpko9B — Bruce Bartlett (@BruceBartlett) July 31, 2018 \n \n Because of Al Franken, I will never in a million years vote for Kristen Gillibrand. — Burke Omalley (@burke_omalley) June 17, 2018 \n \n So maybe all the women Senators who were so fucking threatened by Al Franken in the Senate need to God Damn find out where the thousand girls are ... like now \n \n Looking at you Gillibrand \n \n https://t.co/PZyveKjept — NTXProgressive (@NTXProgressive) June 17, 2018 \n \n There’s also a theory, readily found on social media, that Franken was the target of a right-wing hit job centered around Leeann Tweeden, the first woman to accuse Franken of groping her without her consent, who appears to be conservative-leaning. But besides Tweeden, there were seven other women who said Franken harassed them, and four of them were on the record. Several of the incidents also occurred while he was either in office or running for office. \n \n Part of the reason Franken faced so much pressure to resign was that there was a heated campaign to win the U.S. Senate race in Alabama underway. Franken’s problems were a distraction at a time the party was hammering Republican Roy Moore, who was facing allegations of pursuing teenage girls while he was an adult. The senator resigning without a fight was no doubt, in part, an acknowledgment to the politics of the moment. \n \n Jill Farber Bramson, a Democratic donor and activist in Michigan, said she knew a number of women ― who tended to be older ― who were deeply disappointed when Gillibrand spoke out against Franken. \n \n “They had always really liked Kirsten Gillibrand very much,” she said. “They really respected her. ... They were just devastated that she pushed, they felt, all too hard and all too soon to have him resign.” \n \n ‘Why Are We Making This About Her?’ \n \n Gillibrand still has plenty of supporters ― including some former Clinton donors ― and many of them are standing by her even more fiercely since she faced the Franken attacks. They are deeply worried about the damage her principled stand may have done to her political future. \n \n “Why are we blaming Sen. Gillibrand for what Sen. Franken did?” asked Risa Levine, a New York donor who is friends with the senator. “Why are we making this about her? It’s not about her.” \n \n “She’s not the one who put her hand on all those women’s asses and boobs. She didn’t do that,” added another donor. “Why does she have to sacrifice her career, her brand, her authenticity, for the sake of Franken?” \n \n Gillibrand, after all, isn’t a newcomer on the issue of sexual misconduct. In addition to her work on women in the military and on college campuses, she has an organization devoted to promoting women running for office and introduced the Me Too Congress Act in the Senate, legislation devoted to combating sexual harassment in Congress. \n \n In fact, if she hadn’t spoken out, she likely would have lost credibility with her core group of supporters for deciding to suddenly be silent when it came to one of her colleagues. It seemed like no matter what she did, she couldn’t win. \n \n “She’s either a shrew with no power who’s just trying to make a name for herself, or she’s so all-powerful that her saying one thing made a man who has made decisions for himself for 60 years crumble like a cheap suit,” said a Democratic activist, summing up the way Gillibrand has been characterized. \n \n There’s a good chance Gillibrand would have been attacked if she had remained silent on Franken. In Minnesota, a GOP-aligned group sent out a mailer attacking state Rep. Melissa Hortman, the Democratic minority leader in the House, for signing a November statement expressing support for the senator after four women had come forward. Hortman, too, has been outspoken in her support for women’s rights. \n \n HuffPost A mailer by the GOP-aligned group Minnesota Jobs Coalition went after a Minnesota lawmaker for supporting Al Franken. \n \n Gillibrand isn’t the only woman to face a backlash for the Franken resignation. In November, Lindsey Port, then a Democratic candidate for the state legislature, accused state Sen. Dan Schoen (D) of sexual harassment. Schoen resigned, and Port initially received an outpouring of support. \n \n But after Franken announced he was leaving the Senate, the tide turned. Port lost financial support for her campaign and her nonprofit, with some people alleging that she “softened the ground” for Franken’s resignation by speaking out about the sexual harassment she faced at the hands of a totally different man. Others even wondered if she was secretly a conservative operative. \n \n Many Democrats say they see the split on Gillibrand and Franken as generational, with younger voters ― both men and women ― more likely to support Gillibrand, or at least be sympathetic to what she did. \n \n In June, Gillibrand spoke at the Washington, D.C., chapter of The Wing, an all-female social club that attracts a younger crowd, and she addressed the reason she spoke out on Franken. An attendee said the audience was supportive of her answer and applauded her. \n \n Gillibrand has also had other discussions in the wake of the matter, including calling some other prominent Democratic women in the San Francisco area who are friends with Tompkins Buell. According to someone with knowledge of the situation, the senator reached out to them to explain why she believed Franken needed to go, and she’s been willing to talk about her views with people who are skeptical and have questions. \n \n “Times change, and this is time changing for the better. This is about sexual harassment and sexual assault. Are we for that?” said a Democratic donor. “People just have to get over it. They should expect people to speak up and take a position on it.” \n \n “Did she do it because she wanted to position herself for president? Gee, I’m shocked. People do that all the time. Why is this issue a no-go? Is Bernie [Sanders] taking advantage of single-payer and putting people in an uncomfortable position by being so aggressive about that? We say it’s not the same, but it is the same. It’s getting a different frame because it’s squeezing the old-boy network.”', ""Nearly a year after Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand led the charge in calling for former Sen. Al Franken's resignation, the anger is fresh on the minds of major donors. | Mark Wilson/Getty Images 2020 Election Franken scandal haunts Gillibrand’s 2020 chances ‘Let me tell you how strongly I felt about it — I didn’t even vote for her in the recent election. I left it blank,’ said one top donor. \n \n Just a month after Al Franken formally resigned from the Senate amid sexual misconduct allegations, the former senator met with an intimate group of Bay Area supporters at the home of major Democratic Party financiers Mary and Steve Swig. \n \n As Franken and his wife, Franni Bryson, made the rounds, thanking supporters in the philanthropists’ San Francisco home at the February 2018 event, the conversation broke off into another subject: Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand. The New York Democrat had, in their opinion, pulled the rug out from under Franken, a Minnesota Democrat beloved by the group, forcing him out without any real vetting of the allegations facing him. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n “It was said not in front of Al to impress him; it was said privately in a corner. A group of us were standing there talking about it. He was one of our best weapons against this administration, his presence on these committees. [Gillibrand] did the damage that Republicans could not do themselves,” one of the attendees told POLITICO. “There were other people at this event who were saying the same thing. They said, ‘Absolutely, I will never do anything for her.’” \n \n Today, nearly a year after Gillibrand led the charge in calling for Franken’s resignation, the anger is fresh on the minds of major donors across the country. \n \n More than a dozen prominent West Coast, New York and national donors and bundlers — many of them women — said they would never again donate to or fundraise for Gillibrand or would do so only if she ended up as the Democratic presidential nominee. \n \n COUNTDOWN TO 2020 The race for 2020 starts now.

But the still-burning resentment among the donor class now confronts Gillibrand as she explores a presidential bid, cutting her off from influential and deep-pocketed contributors and their networks at a time when an expansive 2020 field will compete for their dollars. \n \n Among those donors is Susie Tompkins Buell, a prominent Democratic fundraiser and co-founder of Esprit and the North Face clothing brands, who said the matter remains fresh in her mind and among those in her circles. The episode, she said, “stained [Gillibrand’s] reputation as a fair player.” \n \n “I do hear people refer to Kirsten Gillibrand as ‘opportunistic’ and shrewd at the expense of others to advance herself, and it seems to have been demonstrated in her rapid treatment of her colleague Al Franken,” she said. “I heard her referred to as ‘She would eat her own,’ and she seems to have demonstrated that. I know [Gillibrand] thought she was doing the right thing, but I think she will be remembered by this rush to judgment. I have heard [that] some of her women colleagues regret joining her.” \n \n The anger is at least in part a testament to donors’ fondness for Franken, a comedian who rose to fame as a “Saturday Night Live” cast member and remains in the eyes of his supporters one the Senate’s greatest champions for women — even after his resignation. Several of those who talked to POLITICO also spoke of an inner-party struggle to keep Franken from resigning, fearing he was swept up in a panic at the time. A Change.org petition opposing Franken’s resignation had 75,000 signatures. Some blamed the media for rushing to publish allegations without a full vetting. \n \n “I could stay on the phone all afternoon talking about this,” said a Manhattan-based member of the ‘Majority Trust’ of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, an elite group of top donors, who has donated to Gillibrand in the past. “Let me tell you how strongly I felt about it — I didn’t even vote for her in the recent election. I left it blank.” \n \n Another major Manhattan-based donor said the episode raised suspicions that it was a craven political move by Gillibrand. \n \n “I thought she was duplicitous,” the donor said. “Once the whole thing happened with Al Franken, it was confirmed 1 billion percent that she’s not to be trusted. I think that she hurt the Democratic Party. I think that she hurt the Senate. I think that what she did for women in politics was dreadful.” \n \n The Franken accusations came in the weeks after a parade of powerful men were toppled by the #MeToo movement; among them Harvey Weinstein, Matt Lauer, Louis C.K. and Garrison Keillor. The wounds over Franken’s ouster were reopened, some Democrats say, during confirmation hearings for Brett Kavanaugh, who faced sexual misconduct allegations but still was seated on the Supreme Court. \n \n One major national Democratic fundraiser told POLITICO the level of residual anger runs the gamut, but it’s still very much present. \n \n “I know Kirsten well, and I know Al well. ... It’s tragic what happened to Al, and a lot of my donors feel anywhere from strongly to adamantly about anger at Kirsten for what she did. Others see that it was a way to kind of grab the high ground with no ambiguity,” the fundraiser said. “Personally, I lean towards I think Kirsten overdid it. It’s such a shame that Al couldn’t just go through the process and be reprimanded, or censured. At the moment it happened, it was understandable.” \n \n Gillibrand has stood her ground, never publicly backing down from the criticism, even when it came from the Democratic Party’s most prolific donor, George Soros. In June, he told The Washington Post he blamed Gillibrand for cornering Franken into resigning, accusing her of doing so “in order to improve her chances” in 2020. \n \n In August, Gillibrand responded specifically to Soros, telling HuffPost in a statement : “If standing up for women who have been wronged makes George Soros mad, that’s on him.” \n \n Gillibrand’s campaign recently pushed back against the criticism, asserting that the senator did the right thing by speaking up. \n \n “Leadership means standing up for your values when it's hard. Kirsten has never been afraid to stand up for what she believes in and never will be. You can disagree with her views, but holding her accountable for someone else's behavior towards women is wrong, and her values aren't for sale,” Gillibrand spokesperson Glen Caplin said in a statement to POLITICO. “One year later, after the special election in Alabama, the Kavanaugh hearings and the historic number of women who took back the House in the midterms, there is just no case to be made the Democratic Party would have been better off with a different outcome. We have to put our morals and the valuing of women ahead of party loyalty.” \n \n On Monday, Gillibrand herself sounded off on Twitter. “Silencing women for the powerful, or for your friends, or for convenience, is neither acceptable, nor just,” she wrote above a link to this POLITICO story. \n \n NARAL Pro-Choice America President Ilyse Hogue said “history will laud” Gillibrand for her actions. \n \n On its face, the revolt against Gillibrand seems counterintuitive. At a key moment in the “#MeToo” movement, Gillibrand stood up to a revered colleague in her own party. She led the call for Franken’s resignation after he was accused of groping or trying to forcibly kiss more than half a dozen women. A chorus of senators quickly followed her. It raised Gillibrand’s national profile, almost immediately branding her as a fierce female leader who told the establishment that when it comes to sexual harassment, “enough is enough.” \n \n It’s unclear whether or to what extent a donor backlash could debilitate Gillibrand’s possible 2020 campaign. In the era of small-donor, digital fundraising, major donors arguably don’t hold as much sway — but that’s typically true only for candidates who catch fire, like Sen. Bernie Sanders or Rep. Beto O’Rourke. \n \n From 2013 through this year, Gillibrand’s campaign committee raised nearly $18 million for her 2018 reelection bid. Almost 60 percent of that amount came from high-dollar donors, but Gillibrand also raised nearly $6.5 million, or about 30 percent of her total, from small-dollar donors who gave less than $200. \n \n Ana Maria Archila, co-executive director for the Center for Popular Democracy, called Gillibrand’s response “important and courageous.” \n \n “It probably made her more enemies than friends,” said Archila, who famously confronted Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) in a congressional elevator this summer during the Kavanaugh hearings. \n \n If Gillibrand is unpopular with a certain subset of the Democratic donor class, it didn’t hurt her in her most recent reelection bid in New York in November, when she won roughly two-thirds of the vote against her Republican opponent and garnered 3.73 million votes — the most for any candidate in New York in this election cycle. \n \n She earned almost 400,000 more votes than Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who is sometimes mentioned as a possible 2020 Democratic contender himself. In 2012, when she was running for her first full Senate term, she garnered 350,000 more votes than President Barack Obama, who led the Democratic ticket, received in New York. \n \n Franken, who declined to comment for this story, posted on Facebook over the Thanksgiving holiday thanking supporters for well wishes over the past year — and offered a reflection. \n \n “I’ve also spent a lot of time over this past year thinking about the broader conversation we’ve been having about the experience of women in this country. I know that, for so many people, this issue raises a lot of powerful and painful feelings,” Franken wrote. “This conversation can also be incredibly complicated. I don’t think it’s my place to weigh in on all the debates — but I will continue to listen and learn.” \n \n Carla Marinucci contributed to this report.""]",2,"– If Kirsten Gillibrand decides to run for president, Politico reports that she shouldn't expect help from several big Democratic donors during the primaries. The reason? Her role in forcing Al Franken to resign last year. The website talks to more than a dozen big donors and bundlers on both coasts who say they will not donate to the New York senator or help her raise money. If Gillibrand ends up as the nominee, that would change, but she won't be getting any help before then. The gist of the sentiment is that Gillibrand led a rush to judgment on Franken before the sexual harassment allegations against him were properly vetted. “I do hear people refer to Kirsten Gillibrand as ‘opportunistic’ and shrewd at the expense of others to advance herself and it seems to have been demonstrated in her rapid treatment of her colleague Al Franken,” donor Susie Tompkins Buell tells Politico. ""I know [Gillibrand] thought she was doing the right thing, but I think she will be remembered by this,"" she adds. Gillibrand, for her part, has staunchly defended her role. When George Soros voiced a similar complaint against her in August, she responded, “If standing up for women who have been wronged makes George Soros mad, that’s on him.” A post at Jezebel suggests it's unfair for the likes of Tompkins Buell to punish Gillibrand, whose call for Franken to step down was quickly joined by other female lawmakers. ""That Democratic donors are now withholding their money from Gillibrand is a reminder that there are costs for speaking up—and powerful people ready to enforce them,"" writes Clio Chang. (Gillibrand seems to be extending her reach nationally.)"

More than 300 police vehicles participated in a procession in Stauffer\'s honor. \n \n ""Almost the entire city of Tupelo lined the streets for the procession,"" iReporter Lee Anne Grace said Saturday. ""I lost count after 205 police cars, 16 motorcycles."" \n \n Grace, a music teacher at an elementary school, said she realized she knew Stauffer only after seeing his picture in a news story.

164,"['Good Friday is about to get better for publicans in the Republic of Ireland. Why? Because they can finally toast the Easter holiday with a pint. \n \n For almost a century, selling alcohol had been banned on Good Friday - a legacy of Ireland\'s Christian traditions. \n \n But in January 2018 the Irish parliament passed new legislation which means this year will be different. \n \n So what\'s the story for 2018? And who stands to gain from the change? \n \n What\'s different this year? \n \n Pubs in the Republic will welcome Easter revellers from 10:30 until closing time at 00:30. \n \n Off-licences may see some changes too, with fewer booze-desiring customers stocking up a day in advance. \n \n Good Friday is traditionally a popular time for house parties in the Republic, as friends and loved ones gather at home instead of the local boozer. But with the pub doors suddenly open, some may decide they\'d rather skip the washing-up. \n \n It\'s good news for tourists seeking a tipple too. On Good Fridays past, hapless foreigners unaware of the drinks ban could be found wandering the streets of Dublin in a futile search for a pint. The most dedicated were even spotted boarding trains or ferries to exploit an infamous loophole - the on-board bar. \n \n Why did the law change? \n \n Easter is a busy tourist period, and the extra day\'s trade is set to boost the Irish economy. \n \n According to publicans\' group the Vintners Federation of Ireland (VFI) - whose interest is clear - it could generate as much as 40m euros (£35m; $49m) in sales - plus 7m for the exchequer through VAT and excise duty. \n \n ""The Good Friday ban is from a different era,"" the group\'s chief executive, Padraig Cribben, said. ""Like all other businesses who were never subject to a ban, publicans now have a choice to open."" \n \n ...but is everyone toasting the change? \n \n The Roman Catholic Church held considerable influence in the Republic historically, and some would still prefer an alcohol-free Friday on religious grounds. \n \n Back in January, critics said the altered legislation also undermined the government\'s goal of reducing the harm caused by alcohol. \n \n Independent TD (Irish member of parliament) Maureen O\'Sullivan spoke frankly, asking: ""Are we saying that the only tourists we want are those who can\'t last 24 hours without buying a drink in a public house?"" \n \n ""I actually think we could do with a few Good Fridays throughout the year,"" she added. \n \n Perhaps mindful that not everyone approves of them opening, some hostelries have decided to give their Good Friday takings to charity. \n \n And in rural Newmarket, a little town in Cork, the six local publicans put their heads together - and agreed to keep their doors bolted. \n \n John Scanlon of Scanlon\'s Bar explained: ""We have only two days off each year, Christmas Day and Good Friday, and we want to hold on to that. It is a day publicans want to spend with their families."" \n \n What about north of the border? \n \n In Northern Ireland pubs can open on Good Friday but may only serve alcohol between 17:00 and 23:00. \n \n The hospitality sector has called for the North to have the same options as the Republic. \n \n Colin Neill, chief executive of Hospitality Ulster, believes serving restrictions will cost the North\'s pubs and restaurants £20m in trade over the Easter weekend. \n \n What\'s your drinking nationality? \n \n How does your drinking measure up to the average in countries around the world?

Nearby, the chatter of workers from the Victorian fruit and vegetable markets mixed with the sound of church bells wafts through the air as a key turns in the lock of Slattery’s pub and owner Brian Conlon pushes open the door. \n \n He sticks his head briefly outside and exchanges a few words with doorman Cristian Ichim before retreating to the cosy confines of his Capel Street pub. So far, the only customers on schedule for this historic 7am Good Friday opening are journalistic hacks, eagerly awaiting the Thursday night rollovers to begin streaming in. \n \n Pierce Bunch, Haley Wells, Bethany Ferraro, Lauren Thalheimer, Alexandra Kononenko, Faison Bunch, on a spring break from Maryland , Origan and New York, arrive at Slatterys Pub on Capel Street direct from the Airport to become some of the first customers to enjoy a pint on Good Friday.

Shane McShea is already digging into his breakfast and taking a sip of his first ever (legally poured) Good Friday pint when approached for a chat. He’s a regular to the pub and often stops by for a bite on his way to work. \n \n Asked if it feels special to be drinking in a pub on such a momentous day, he shrugs his shoulders. “It’s different but I never really thought about it before. It’s a good thing to see pubs open and I don’t think it’s going to cause any major issues towards alcoholism. Eventually I can see it just becoming like any Friday. I guess it’s a positive thing.” \n \n Outside on the street, Ichim stamps his feet to keep warm. After 11 years working the early morning security shift outside Slattery’s he’s fully accustomed to the early morning clientele. \n \n Darragh Gavin and Paul Reid from Heineken with Darragh Ridgeway. utilities manager of Slatterys Pub on Capel Street, making the first delivery to the pub on a Good Friday since 1922.

Not many drunks or messers.” \n \n Pushed on this point, he admits he’s already turned away a few people who he felt were too drunk to enter. They have other options, he says pointing up the street towards another establishment where he says roll-overs can continue drinking. \n \n Slattery’s lit-up windows and open doors have already been met with disapproval by passers by this Good Friday morning, he adds. “They were older people saying it’s a disgrace and that it shouldn’t be happening.

He’s arrived into town early to pick up fittings for a job later this morning. His plan is two pints, pick up the fittings and then off to work. \n \n Foy says the decision to allow pubs to open on Good Friday just makes sense. “They needed to get with the times. We’re not back a hundred years ago now.” \n \n Nearby, waitress Natalia Czarnik is laying tables for breakfast. She has worked the morning shifts at the early house for four years and says the early arrivals come to Slattery’s for the drink and stay for the food. “When the drinks start they begin to feel hungry but the main breakfast is the Guinness. It’s a mighty breakfast for everyone.” \n \n Most of the time, Czarnik enjoys chatting to the bleary-eyed all-nighters who fall through the door at 7am. “They’re usually very funny. Sometimes it’s hard to deal with them but we always have security.” \n \n Moments later, there’s a short commotion near the main entrance as six students with backpacks squeeze through the door. While they settle around a table near the blazing fire and order their pints, Faison Bunch explains how the group of friends from New York have arrived in Europe for a week-long trip around Ireland and the UK. \n \n They began their morning in McDonalds - following a 5am flight arrival - but then they heard the pubs were open. \n \n “We were just trying to find a place to go and I’m thinking when is the soonest we can drink a Guinness,” says Bunch. “Then we found Slattery’s was opening so it was like guys, let’s do it.” \n \n “We were in the cab on the way here and the guy driving us was like this is a big deal,” he adds before taking his first sip of Guinness. “We’re making history. So I guess this really is a good Friday.”']",2,"– For the first time in 91 years, thirsty Irish folk can get a pint in a pub on Good Friday. Since 1927, a law has required bars to keep closed on the holiday, which has traditionally seen drinkers gather in homes or on booze-selling trains. In January, however, Ireland's parliament passed legislation that ended the one-day prohibition. The Irish Times reports visitors to bars early Friday were pretty chill about the whole thing, though a doorman noted there ""were older people saying it's a disgrace."" Bar owners will be happy, though. The Vintners Federation of Ireland expects the move to generate as much as $49 million in alcohol sales, per the BBC."

166,"['Lawyers have filed a class action lawsuit against most major automakers over what attorneys call a deadly ""defect"" in keyless ignition systems. \n \n Keyless ignition systems, available on many new cars sold in the United States today, allow drivers to start the car with the press of a button while an electronic ""key fob"" remains in their pocket or purse. The car will not start if the key fob is not detected inside the vehicle. \n \n The ""defect"" alleged in the lawsuit is that, once the car has been started, these systems allow to it continue running even after the fob itself is no longer in the car. The lawsuit cited cases in which drivers have inadvertently left their vehicles running inside enclosed garages causing a build-up of toxic odorless carbon monoxide gas that has seeped into homes, including at least one case involving a Toyota Prius hybrid. \n \n There have been 13 deaths in these sorts of incidents, according to the lawsuit, and many more injuries. This is especially likely in cars that have very quiet, smooth-running engines. \n \n For example, in gasoline-electric hybrid cars, the engine may not be running at all when the driver first gets out of the vehicle. The engine could come on later, though, after power in the vehicles\' batteries runs low. \n \n General Motors (GM) recently recalled older models of the Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid to add software that would fix this very issue. Newer Volts have software that will shut the car off after a few minutes if the key fob leaves the vehicle. \n \n Many vehicles make a sound, such as a horn beep to alert drivers if they leave their vehicle while it\'s running. \n \n Many automakers have also added an ""auto-off"" feature to their newer cars and trucks, according to the lawsuilt but have not gone back to older vehicles already on the road and added the software. \n \n Among the automakers being sued are General Motors, Fiat Chrysler (FCAM), Toyota (TM), Honda (HMC) and others. Most automakers contacted by CNNMoney about this lawsuit have either not yet responded or have declined to respond because they have not seen the lawsuit. \n \n Ford Motor Co. said, in a statement, ""Ford takes the safety of our customers very seriously; the keyless ignition system has proven to be a safe and reliable innovative feature that has been well-received by customers.

NBC News—citing stats from a safety group—reports keyless ignitions have caused at least 19 deaths and more than two-dozen ""close calls"" since 2009. A Washington family of six was one of those close calls when their house filled with carbon monoxide in November. The father took his keyless ignition fob out of his van but forgot to turn the engine off. The van continued to run in the family's attached garage until its tank was empty. The president of Safety Research & Strategies, who calls keyless ignition ""an inherent design defect,"" sums up the problem: ""You need the fob to start the vehicle, but it plays absolutely no role in turning it off."" The ability to remove the keyless ignition fob and exit the car with the engine running is especially dangerous in many newer hybrid cars, in which the engine may only come on after the hybrid battery is drained and which often feature ""very quiet, smooth-running engines,"" CNN reports. Many manufacturers are including warning systems or auto-shutoffs in new models to address complaints, but a lawsuit filed against 10 manufacturers is pushing them to recall older models to add additional safety features. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which first highlighted the dangers of keyless ignition back in 2011, tells NBC it should finally have new safety requirements in place next month."

But now, after police interviews with nearly three dozen people who were on what students refer to as the ""drunk bus"" and the review of security footage and passenger cellphone videos, the accusers are the ones to be charged with assault, the Albany Times Union reports.

Eight of those photos were of their daughters—ages 1, 4, and 5—playing around at bath time. According to KTVK, a Walmart employee flagged the photos as pornographic and went to the police. The Demarees' daughters were taken away by Child Protective Safety workers and sent to live with their grandparents during the month-long investigation, Courthouse News reports. No charges were filed after judges ruled the photos were harmless pictures like countless parents have taken. In 2011, the Demarees sued the two social workers who took their daughters away without a court order. And on Tuesday—after a string of defeats for the family—a federal appeals court ruled the social workers ""acted unconstitutionally"" and violated the Demarees' rights. “The social workers did not have reasonable cause to believe the children were at risk of serious bodily harm or molestation,” the panel of judges ruled. They found there was no reason the social workers had to rush the children out of the home before first getting a court order. A lower court had dismissed the case against the social workers in 2014 based on qualified immunity. The detective behind the investigation settled with the Demarees earlier."

170,"['By Paul Tait \n \n KABUL (Reuters) - The withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan from next July will begin with a general ""thinning out"" of forces rather than any large-scale drawdown, the commander of U.S. and NATO forces said on Tuesday. \n \n Critics say U.S. President Barack Obama\'s strategy to begin pulling out troops has backfired, sending a signal to the Taliban that the United States was preparing to wind down at a time when U.S. and NATO forces were suffering record casualties. Five U.S. soldiers were killed on Tuesday, capping a bloody four days. \n \n It has also alarmed Afghan leaders, a spokesman for President Hamid Karzai last week saying the Taliban threat has not been eliminated and any timeline for withdrawal would only ""invigorate"" the Islamist insurgents. \n \n U.S. commanders have since tried to allay fears the timeline would not represent a wholesale departure. \n \n The withdrawal timetable however is certain to come under close scrutiny when NATO members meet in Lisbon in November and in a White House strategy review of the Afghan war in December, which Obama called for last year when he announced the July 2011 plan and 30,000 extra troops. \n \n Petraeus said the last of those extra troops would be in place in ""the next couple of days"", taking the total number of foreign troops under the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) umbrella in Afghanistan to almost 150,000. \n \n He said guidelines had been drawn up for the transition and repeated the pace of withdrawals would depend on ""conditions on the ground"", mainly security and the readiness of Afghan forces. \n \n ""These guidelines recognise that this is a process, not an event, in other words it will typically represent a thinning out of ISAF forces, not a hand-off per se,"" Petraeus told Reuters and two other news agencies in Kabul. \n \n ""In some cases, that transition dividend, in other words the forces no longer required, will go home, in some other cases they may be reinvested in a contiguous area, let\'s say within the same province to address security issues in neighbouring districts."" \n \n NATO NERVOUS \n \n He said the transition will likely ""occur in districts initially rather than in entire provinces"", adding this would likely not be possible in hard-fought areas. \n \n The suggestion of transitions at the district level appeared to catch NATO slightly off guard. Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said members had adopted documents based on responsibility being handed over province by province. \n \n ""But this does not leave out that we can transfer a more limited responsibility, for example security responsibility, district by district,"" he told reporters in Copenhagen. \n \n There is nervousness among Washington\'s NATO allies, who are coming under increasing pressure from a sceptical public to get out of a war they are not winning. Rasmussen said on Monday he hoped NATO states would agree in Lisbon to start handing over security responsibility next year. \n \n Petraeus reiterated areas of progress were being made despite increasing violence across Afghanistan. \n \n ""There\'s no question the Taliban are fighting back, but the toll on the Taliban leadership has been very hard,"" he said of recent campaigns in the south, east and north. \n \n ""I don\'t think anyone disagrees that the footprint of the Taliban has spread,"" Petraeus said. \n \n Military deaths have hit record levels this year, with at least 485 killed so far in 2010, compared with 521 in 2009. \n \n ISAF said five U.S. troops had been killed on Tuesday, along with another on Monday whose nationality was not given. At least 20 ISAF service members have been killed since Saturday. \n \n OPINION SPLIT \n \n Supporters of Obama\'s July 2011 timeline say it conveys a needed sense of urgency to Kabul that Afghans must quickly ramp up the size of their security forces for a gradual handover. \n \n But the strategy has certainly split U.S. opinion, even among Obama\'s Democrats, and will come under close scrutiny during mid-term Congressional elections in November. \n \n Karzai\'s credibility will also come under scrutiny, particularly after a fraud-marred presidential vote last year. \n \n While he is not running, Karzai\'s leadership will be tested at a parliamentary election on September 18, as will his commitment to good governance and stamping out rampant corruption. \n \n Petraeus stepped cautiously around questions about Karzai\'s leadership, saying advances had been made since last year\'s poll.', ""A roadside bomb attack killed four U.S. troops in eastern Afghanistan on Tuesday, the latest deaths in a particularly bloody spell that has left 18 service members dead since Saturday. \n \n In this Aug. 9, 2010 photo, an Afghan Army soldier wounded in combat in a nearby district is treated by an American trauma doctor at the Role 3 Military Hospital, at Kandahar Air Base, in Kandahar province,...

Another member of the international coalition whose nationality has not been released was killed Monday. \n \n Almost all of the recent coalition deaths have come in southern and eastern Afghanistan where the Taliban insurgency is most deeply entrenched and where fighting has been heaviest. \n \n Those areas are also closest to the mountainous border with Pakistan, where insurgents maintain safe havens and training bases to instruct recruits, including foreign fighters, who are later infiltrated into Afghanistan. \n \n NATO commanders have warned casualties will mount as coalition and Afghan forces enter areas under longtime Taliban control, particularly in the hard-line Islamic movement's spiritual heartland of Kandahar province. The NATO force swelled this month to more than 140,000 _ including 100,000 Americans _ with the arrival of the last of the reinforcements that President Barack Obama ordered to Afghanistan in a bid to turn the tide of the nearly 9-year war. \n \n Also Tuesday, the coalition said it killed two insurgents and wounded a third in an airstrike Monday on a Taliban commander in charge of logistics in Kandahar, including the coordination of homemade bomb attacks. \n \n A number of Taliban and allied Haqqani Network commanders were also detained in operations Monday, including one recently returned from teaching bomb-making techniques in Pakistan, NATO said. \n \n In Zabul province bordering Kandahar, insurgents on Monday night ambushed a convoy carrying food and other supplies, killing two private security guards and wounding five others, provincial government spokesman Mohammad Jan Rasoolyar said.""]",2,"– Four US troops were killed by a roadside bomb in eastern Afghanistan today, bringing the American death toll to 21 since Friday.

NATO commanders warn that casualties will keep rising as the offensive in the Taliban heartlands around Kandahar continues. America's top commander in Afghanistan says the last of the extra troops being sent to the country will be in place within days. He stressed that the withdrawal of US troops scheduled to begin in July next year will be very gradual and will depend on conditions on the ground. Guidelines recently drawn up ""recognize that this is a process, not an event. In other words it will typically represent a thinning out of ISAF forces, not a hand-off per se,"" Gen.

That led to Obama\'s call for military action, with the American leader arguing that strikes are needed to enforce a longstanding international taboo on the use of poison gas. \n \n Syria denies its forces unleashed chemical weapons, and al-Assad said government troops were on the receiving end of a gas attack. Al-Assad told ""CBS This Morning"" interviewer Charlie Rose on Monday that the West lacks ""a single shred of evidence"" that his government was behind the attack. \n \n Samples collected by U.N. weapons inspectors are still being tested, and even then, the inspection team was charged only with determining whether chemical weapons were used -- not who used them. But Washington says it knows the trajectory of the rockets used to deliver the gas, that Syrian commanders ordered troops to don gas masks and learned of fears by top Syrian officials that U.N. inspectors would discover evidence of the attack. \n \n JUST WATCHED Should Obama act without public support?

He doesn\'t have a credible means to threaten the United States."" \n \n The United Nations estimates that more than 100,000 people have been killed in Syria\'s civil war, now 2½ years old. Another 76 deaths were reported on Monday, according to the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, a network of opposition activists. \n \n Of Monday\'s fatalities, 37 were in Damascus and its suburbs, where the August 21 attack took place, the LCC reported. \n \n French intelligence believes that al-Assad ordered the attack because he feared a major rebel attack from the suburbs that could have endangered his control of Damascus and the route leading to the city\'s airport, according to a French Defense Ministry official who briefed reporters on background Monday. \n \n But a German newspaper reported Sunday that German intelligence intercepted communications that indicate al-Assad had repeatedly denied his military approval for chemical attacks. \n \n Calls to intervene have been shadowed by bitter memories of Iraq, when the Bush administration said that country\'s hidden arsenal of chemical and biological weapons and a clandestine nuclear weapons program posed a threat that required a U.S.-led invasion in 2003. Iraq was later found to have disbanded its weapons programs under U.N. sanctions in the 1990s. \n \n Lawmakers in Britain, which committed troops to Iraq, voted to preclude their military from participating in any strike. French President Francois Hollande supports a military response, but French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said in a statement Monday that the Russian proposal ""deserves a thorough examination."" \n \n Fabius said, however, that the Security Council needs to oversee the process; that it should start immediately; and the plan shouldn\'t let anyone off the hook for ordering a chemical attack. \n \n At the United Nations, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he is also considering asking the Security Council to demand the Syrian government immediately hand over its chemical weapons to be destroyed. Ban said Monday that if U.N. inspectors confirm the use of chemical weapons in Syria, it would be an ""abominable crime"" worthy of international response -- but he has previously warned against ""further militarization of the conflict"" in Syria. \n \n Could a \'goof\' be a solution? \n \n A senior State Department official who spoke on condition of anonymity said Kerry and Lavrov were on a previously scheduled call before Kerry flew back from London when Lavrov brought up his remarks. \n \n ""I saw your comments this morning,"" Lavrov said to Kerry, the State Department official said. The Russian foreign minister said he would speak about the issue but played down the idea that a proposal was on the table during the 14-minute conversation, the official said. \n \n Kerry told Lavrov that the United States ""is not going to \'play games,\'"" the official said. ""If there is a serious proposal, we will take a look."" \n \n One U.S. official called Kerry\'s remarks a ""major goof,"" adding that America\'s top diplomat ""clearly went off script."" And several State Department representatives tried to clarify Kerry\'s remarks later in the day, calling them a ""rhetorical argument."" \n \n ""His point was that this brutal dictator with a history of playing fast and loose with the facts cannot be trusted to turn over chemical weapons. Otherwise he would have done so long ago,"" State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said. ""That\'s why the world faces this moment."" \n \n The prospect of a diplomatic deal is likely going to make the Obama administration\'s attempts to make a case before Congress even more difficult, said Michael O\'Hanlon, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Lawmakers who are already debating whether to pass resolutions authorizing military action now may want to rewrite them, he said. \n \n ""It\'s going to obviously throw a monkey wrench in the gears on a number of things,"" he said. \n \n But it got a hopeful reception in Congress, where the chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee said she would welcome Syria\'s chemical disarmament ""to prevent an international strike."" \n \n ""I believe that Russia can be most effective in encouraging the Syrian president to stop any use of chemical weapons and place all his chemical munitions, as well as storage facilities, under United Nations control until they can be destroyed,"" said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California. \n \n Feinstein\'s House counterpart, Michigan Republican Rep. Mike Rogers, said Washington should review the Russian proposal to ""see if there\'s any teeth to their bark."" And Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tennessee, the ranking Republican on the chamber\'s Foreign Relations Committee, said the best way to reach a diplomatic solution to the conflict ""is for us as a nation to stay strong."" \n \n ""If it is real, and if Syria is willing to make immediate concrete steps, certainly that\'s something worth looking at,"" Corker said. ""But it\'s very difficult to tell if it\'s that or just a way of creating a fog around this whole issue."" \n \n Sen. Jack Reed, a leading Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, said the Lavrov proposal is a ""distinct change"" in Russia\'s stance, ""going from sort of defenders of the regime to now saying there\'s a real serious problem with chemical weapons in Syria."" \n \n ""It is very thoughtful,"" said Reed, of Rhode Island, who described himself as undecided on Syria. ""It goes to the essential objective that we should have, which is to deter the use of chemical weapons.

In a study published Wednesday in Biology Letters, marine biologists from the Institute of Marine Sciences at the University of Portsmouth in Britain describe a heretofore unobserved method of eating and coined a new term for it: ""kleptopredation."" The concept of kleptoparasitism has been around for a while; it's what hyenas do when they scare off an animal that's just killed its prey in order to steal the meal, Live Science explains. In kleptopredation, on the other hand, an animal waits until its prey has finished eating then just straight-up eats its prey and its prey's prey, which is currently sitting in its prey's belly. The marine biologists observed kleptopredation in a type of sea slug called a nudibranch. The study found that in 14 out of 25 cases, nudibranchs chose to eat hydroid polyps, its normal prey, while the polyps still had a belly full of zooplankton, their typical prey. Because the zooplankton inside the polyps accounts for about half of nudibranchs' diet, researchers believe the sea slugs actually favor consuming plankton rather than the polyps themselves, which nudibranchs appear to be using ""as living fishing nets."" Researchers believe other marine organisms are likely using kleptopredation as well, likely because it increases their nutrition intake. (This sea slug does something incredibly unusual.)"

Williamson/The Washington Post \n \n President Obama rejected a presidential permit for the pipeline, citing concerns about its impact on the climate. \n \n A big issue before President Obama is a proposal to approve a pipeline carrying fuel from Canada’s oil sands through America’s heartland to Texas. What’s at stake? Here’s a quick overview from “Down the Line: A Journey Along the Controversial Pipeline and Into America’s Energy Frontier.’’ \n \n A big issue before President Obama is a proposal to approve a pipeline carrying fuel from Canada’s oil sands through America’s heartland to Texas. What’s at stake? Here’s a quick overview from “Down the Line: A Journey Along the Controversial Pipeline and Into America’s Energy Frontier.’’ \n \n Eight things you should know about the Keystone XL pipeline \n \n Eight things you should know about the Keystone XL pipeline \n \n The State Department concluded in its final environmental assessment issued Friday that the proposed Keystone XL pipeline would be unlikely to alter global greenhouse gas emissions, but officials cautioned that they are still weighing whether the project would meet the test of President Obama’s broader climate strategy. \n \n Though the report acknowledged that tapping the Canadian oil sands for the pipeline would produce more greenhouse gases, the assessment also said that blocking the project would not prevent development of those resources. \n \n The report “is not a decision document,” said Kerri-Ann Jones, assistant secretary of state for oceans and international environmental and scientific affairs. “This document is only one factor that will be coming into the review process for this permit” sought by TransCanada, an energy giant based in Calgary, Alberta. \n \n The $5.4 billion pipeline, which would transport heavy crude from Canadian oil sands in Alberta into the heart of the U.S. pipeline network, has become the focus of intense controversy. Foes say it will contribute to climate change; supporters say it will secure U.S. oil supplies from a friendly neighbor and create U.S. construction jobs. \n \n The release of the long-awaited Final Environmental Impact Statement is certain to trigger an avalanche of lobbying aimed at Secretary of State John F. Kerry, who has made climate change a central focus of his career and will now begin preparing a decision. \n \n View Graphic Map of the Keystone XL pipeline. \n \n President Obama said in June that he would sign off on the proposal only if it “does not significantly exacerbate the climate problem.” \n \n The State Department report “includes a range of estimates of the project’s climate impacts, and that information will now need to be closely evaluated by Secretary Kerry and other relevant agency heads in the weeks ahead,” White House spokesman Matt Lehrich said in a statement Friday. \n \n The decision remains politically fraught for Democrats. Environmental activists fiercely oppose it, arguing that the pipeline could leak, would accelerate development of the greenhouse gas-intensive oil sands in Alberta and would increase the nation’s dependence on fossil fuels. \n \n Wendy Abrams, founder of the Chicago-based nonprofit group Cool Globes and a major Democratic campaign contributor, said she felt a “gut-wrenching pain for my kids” when she read the report. She said it made her question her past support of Obama and Kerry. “If they can’t get it done, what am I hoping for?” \n \n The State Department’s report includes 11 volumes of analysis on how the proposed pipeline would affect heavy-crude extraction in Canada’s oil sands and reaches the same conclusion as its draft report did in March: No single infrastructure project will alter the course of oil development in Alberta. \n \n The report said that “the proposed Project is unlikely to significantly affect the rate of extraction in oil sands areas (based on expected oil prices, oil-sands supply costs, transport costs, and supply-demand scenarios).” \n \n Last week, TransCanada began shipping oil through the southern leg of the Keystone pipeline, which runs from Cushing, Okla., to Port Arthur, Tex. But the company is still waiting for a State Department permit for the 1,179-mile northern leg that would carry heavy crude from Canada into Montana and run to the small town of Steele City, Neb. \n \n The U.S. State Department issues an environmental review of the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline, that played down the impact it would have on climate change. (Reuters) \n \n “We’re very pleased with the release and about being able to move to this next stage of the process,” said Russ Girling, chief executive of TransCanada. “The case for the Keystone XL, in our view, is as strong as ever.” \n \n He said it would take about two years to construct the northern leg, but he cautioned that summer is best for construction and that a long permit process could further delay the project. \n \n Jones, the State Department official, said the report “presents considerable analysis, but it does not answer the broader question about how a decision on the proposed project would fit into the broader national and international efforts to address climate change or other questions of foreign policy or energy security.” \n \n She added that the study relied on assumptions about pipeline capacity, oil prices and transportation and development costs that were “uncertain and changeable.” \n \n Oil industry officials welcomed the fact that the department had affirmed the idea that the pipeline decision did not have a major climate impact. \n \n “Time and time again, State reaches the same conclusion despite the unprecedented and thorough environmental review,” said Cindy Schild, the American Petroleum Institute’s senior manager for oil sands policy. She said that “it is hard to figure out how they could conclude that it is not in the national interest.” \n \n The report estimated the project would generate about 1,950 annual construction jobs in Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska and Kansas over a two-year period and contribute about $3.4 billion to the U.S. gross domestic product. It would generate about 50 jobs once in operation. \n \n In an interview this week, AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said members of his labor federation back the project. “We think that anything that’s going to create jobs, help the country and do it in an environmentally sound way ought to be done,” he said. \n \n The high-profile decision now enters a new phase, in which Kerry and his deputies will field public comments and internal feedback from eight agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency and the departments of Defense and Energy. The State Department will open a 30-day comment period on Feb. 5, and the agencies will have 90 days to weigh in. After a decision is issued, other agencies have 15 days to object. If one does, the president must decide whether to issue the permit. \n \n “It is hard to imagine how the president could justify rejection without turning the United States into a poster child for what the energy industry terms ‘above-ground’ risk,” said Robert McNally, president of the Rapidan Group consulting firm. “I don’t see how logically the president can reject it if he applies the criteria he laid out at Georgetown last year, i.e. whether or not the pipeline would severely exacerbate climate change.” \n \n The EPA has questioned whether the State Department has given sufficient weight to the project’s negative environmental impact. The final environmental impact statement notes that bitumen, the substance that is extracted in Canada and diluted in order to be transported to U.S. refineries, is more difficult to clean up than lighter crude if it spills. \n \n The report concludes that crude extracted from the oil sands results in 17 percent more greenhouse gas emissions than the average barrel of crude used in the United States but only 2 percent to 10 percent more than the heavy crude it would likely replace at Gulf Coast refineries. \n \n The assessment also said that a variety of rail transportation options would result in 28 percent to 42 percent more emissions than the pipeline. The State Department has cited rail as a reason why blocking the pipeline would not slow oil sands development, although a spate of oil train derailments — including a derailment Friday in southeast Mississippi — has highlighted the dangers of that alternative. \n \n Now that the State Department has finished its environmental analysis, it has some flexibility on timing. It could issue a decision either before the end of the 105-day agency comment period or long afterward. \n \n “Secretary Kerry is just really beginning his involvement in this process,” Jones said. “There is no timeline for his deliberations.” \n \n Environmental groups are organizing a “Day of Action” on Tuesday during which they plan to flood Kerry’s office with phone calls and e-mails. \n \n “To some extent, Secretary Kerry has gotten a pass to date,” said Tiernan Sittenfeld, the League of Conservation Voters’ senior vice president for government affairs. “Now that changes. This is a really a pivot point, and this is a real opportunity for him to live up to the climate record he has established through his very accomplished career.”', ""Environmentalists said they were dismayed at some of the report’s conclusions and disputed its objectivity, but they also said it offered Mr. Obama reasons to reject the pipeline. They said they planned to intensify efforts to try to influence Mr. Kerry’s decision. For more than two years, environmentalists have protested the project and been arrested in demonstrations against it around the country. But many Republicans and oil industry executives, who support the pipeline because they say it creates jobs and increases supplies from a friendly source of oil, embraced the findings. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n The State Department is expected to shortly release the results of an inspector general’s investigation into the preparation of an earlier draft of the environmental impact report. The investigation was ordered after an environmental group obtained documents indicating that some consultants for the firm that wrote the draft report had previously done work for TransCanada, the company seeking to build the pipeline. If investigators determine a conflict of interest in the preparation of that draft, the State Department may have to conduct a new environmental review. \n \n In light of the investigation, environmentalists were particularly critical of the report released on Friday. \n \n “In what could be perceived as eagerness to please the oil industry and Canadian government, the State Department is issuing this report amidst an ongoing investigation into conflicts of interest, and lying, by its contractor,” said Erich Pica, the president of Friends of the Earth. \n \n Some environmentalists saw reason for optimism in the review, which models several possible future oil market possibilities. Most involve a future of high oil prices and robust demand, in which the oil sands crude is rapidly developed with or without the Keystone pipeline. However, the report offers one alternative sequence, in which oil prices and demand are low. In that case, not building the pipeline might slow development, and thus slow carbon emissions. That possibility is unlikely, but it could provide the administration something to point to should it deny the project. \n \n “We’re taking the inclusion of that scenario as good news,” said Susan Casey-Lefkowitz, director of international programs at the Natural Resources Defense Council. \n \n The oil industry applauded the review. \n \n “After five years and five environmental reviews, time and time again the Department of State analysis has shown that the pipeline is safe for the environment,” said Cindy Schild, the senior manager of refining and oil sands programs at the American Petroleum Institute, which lobbies for the oil industry. \n \n There are political and strategic advantages to approving the pipeline: It would strengthen relations with Canada and provide a conduit for oil from a friendly neighbor. If the pipeline is approved this year, it could also help the re-election campaigns of two vulnerable Democratic senators from oil-rich states — Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana and Mark Begich of Alaska — while silencing critics who for years have urged the president to move ahead with the pipeline. \n \n Environmentalists said that if Mr. Obama were to approve the pipeline, it would destroy his efforts to make progress on climate change. Thomas F. Steyer, a California hedge fund billionaire and a major donor to Mr. Obama’s presidential campaigns, has started an advocacy group, NextGen Climate Action, that has spent heavily campaigning against the pipeline. \n \n Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

We’re headed in a terribly wrong direction with this project, and I don’t see how that large increase in carbon is going to be offset.” \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Although the pipeline is a potent political symbol, its true impact on both the environment and the economy would be more limited than either its supporters or its opponents suggest. \n \n The new State Department report concludes that the process used for producing the oil — by extracting what are called tar sands or oil sands from the Alberta forest — creates about 17 percent more greenhouse gas emissions than traditional oil. But the report concludes that this heavily polluting oil will still be brought to market. Energy companies are already moving the oil out of Canada by rail. \n \n “At the end of the day, there’s a consensus among most energy experts that the oil will get shipped to market no matter what,” said Robert McNally, an energy consultant who was a senior energy and economic adviser to President George W. Bush. “It’s less important than I think it was perceived to be a year ago, both politically and on oil markets.” \n \n The new State Department analysis took into account the growing global demand for oil and the rapidly growing practice of moving oil by rail in areas where pipelines have not been built. “Given the anticipated outlook of oil prices and the cost of development, no single project will likely affect the rate of extraction,” said a senior State Department official, who asked not to be named under the ground rules imposed by the department. \n \n But moving oil by rail has its own hazards. As the practice has increased in recent years, so have incidents of explosions of rail cars carrying oil. \n \n Supporters of the pipeline say it will create jobs, though the number may be limited. A study by the Cornell Global Labor Institute concluded that the pipeline would create about 3,900 construction jobs over two years. \n \n Privately, people close to Mr. Obama say that although he is committed to building a climate legacy, he does not see the pipeline as a central part of that effort. Instead, the president is moving forward with a set of Environmental Protection Agency regulations on coal-fired power plants, the nation’s largest source of greenhouse gas emissions. \n \n Those regulations do not have the potent political symbolism of the pipeline, but could have a far greater impact on the nation’s greenhouse gas emissions by freezing construction of new coal plants and closing hundreds of existing ones. \n \n Ahead of making his decision, Mr. Kerry will take counsel from the leaders of eight other government agencies: the Departments of Defense, Justice, Interior, Commerce, Transportation, Energy and Homeland Security and the E.P.A. It is unclear when the decision might be made, but some close to the process say it could take as long as a year. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Environmentalists are preparing to influence the next stages of the decision-making process. \n \n “This is the most scrutinized pipeline in the nation’s history,” said Brigham A. McCown, a former administrator of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. “The fact that it’s lasted as long as it has means one of two things. They’ve either done a very good, thorough job, or they’ve slowed it down due to political pressure.”""]",2,"– Environmentalists are going to hate this one: A State Department review of the controversial Keystone oil pipeline raises no major environmental objections, reports the New York Times. The report concludes that the proposed pipeline from Canada to Texas would not affect global greenhouse gas emissions in a significant way, reports the Washington Post. This doesn't mean the project is now a slam-dunk, but the environmental assessment was seen as one of its biggest remaining hurdles. President Obama has said that he would sign off on the pipeline only if it didn't ""significantly exacerbate"" carbon pollution, and the report seems to satisfy that requirement. So what's next? John Kerry and his State Department now must consider other factors beyond the environment—the economic impact, relations with Canada, etc.—in making a final decision. As one State official tells the Post: The report ""does not answer the broader question about how a decision on this potential pipeline fits in with broader national and international efforts to address climate change and climate priorities or other questions of foreign policy or energy security.""

We certainly understand the heartbreak felt by so many who worked so hard to elect Hillary Clinton, and it is a fundamental principle of our democracy to ensure that every vote is properly counted. \n \n Moreover, this election cycle was unique in the degree of foreign interference witnessed throughout the campaign: the U.S. government concluded that Russian state actors were behind the hacks of the Democratic National Committee and the personal email accounts of Hillary for America campaign officials, and just yesterday, the Washington Post reported that the Russian government was behind much of the “fake news” propaganda that circulated online in the closing weeks of the election. \n \n For all these reasons, we have quietly taken a number of steps in the last two weeks to rule in or out any possibility of outside interference in the vote tally in these critical battleground states. \n \n First, since the day after the election we have had lawyers and data scientists and analysts combing over the results to spot anomalies that would suggest a hacked result. These have included analysts both from within the campaign and outside, with backgrounds in politics, technology and academia. \n \n Second, we have had numerous meetings and calls with various outside experts to hear their concerns and to discuss and review their data and findings. As a part of this, we have also shared out data and findings with them. Most of those discussions have remained private, while at least one has unfortunately been the subject of leaks. \n \n Third, we have attempted to systematically catalogue and investigate every theory that has been presented to us within our ability to do so. \n \n Fourth, we have examined the laws and practices as they pertain to recounts, contests and audits. \n \n Fifth, and most importantly, we have monitored and staffed the post-election canvasses — where voting machine tapes are compared to poll-books, provisional ballots are resolved, and all of the math is double checked from election night. During that process, we have seen Secretary Clinton’s vote total grow, so that, today, her national popular vote lead now exceeds more than 2 million votes. \n \n In the coming days, we will continue to perform our due diligence and actively follow all further activities that are to occur prior to the certification of any election results. For instance, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania conduct post-election audits using a sampling of precincts. Michigan and many other states still do not. This is unfortunate; it is our strong belief that, in addition to an election canvass, every state should do this basic audit to ensure accuracy and public confidence in the election. \n \n Beyond the post-election audit, Green Party candidate Jill Stein announced Friday that she will exercise her right as a candidate to pursue a recount in the state of Wisconsin. She has indicated plans to also seek recounts in Pennsylvania and Michigan. \n \n Because we had not uncovered any actionable evidence of hacking or outside attempts to alter the voting technology, we had not planned to exercise this option ourselves, but now that a recount has been initiated in Wisconsin, we intend to participate in order to ensure the process proceeds in a manner that is fair to all sides. If Jill Stein follows through as she has promised and pursues recounts in Pennsylvania and Michigan, we will take the same approach in those states as well. We do so fully aware that the number of votes separating Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in the closest of these states — Michigan — well exceeds the largest margin ever overcome in a recount. But regardless of the potential to change the outcome in any of the states, we feel it is important, on principle, to ensure our campaign is legally represented in any court proceedings and represented on the ground in order to monitor the recount process itself. \n \n The campaign is grateful to all those who have expended time and effort to investigate various claims of abnormalities and irregularities. While that effort has not, in our view, resulted in evidence of manipulation of results, now that a recount is underway, we believe we have an obligation to the more than 64 million Americans who cast ballots for Hillary Clinton to participate in ongoing proceedings to ensure that an accurate vote count will be reported.', 'Play Facebook \n \n Twitter \n \n Google Plus \n \n Embed Hillary Clinton Backs Jill Stein Election Recount Campaign 1:13 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog \n \n Hillary Clinton\'s campaign intends to back the statewide election recount effort in the battleground state of Wisconsin spearheaded by third-party candidate Jill Stein. \n \n The Clinton team had been quiet about Stein\'s crusade, but campaign lawyer Marc Elias said that because a recount was set into motion Friday — and could begin as soon as next week — they want to see a ""fair"" process for all involved. \n \n ""Because we had not uncovered any actionable evidence of hacking or outside attempts to alter the voting technology, we had not planned to exercise this option ourselves,"" Elias wrote in a Medium post explaining the decision, ""but now that a recount has been initiated in Wisconsin, we intend to participate in order to ensure the process proceeds in a manner that is fair to all sides."" \n \n Play Facebook \n \n Twitter \n \n Google Plus \n \n Embed Could Stein\'s Recount Efforts Change the Outcome? 2:56 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog \n \n President-elect Donald Trump slammed the effort as a ""scam by the Green Party for an election that has already been conceded."" \n \n He also posted on Twitter, including a series of tweets early Sunday quoting Clinton\'s previous comments on respecting the outcome of the election and calling the recount effort ""sad."" \n \n The Green Party scam to fill up their coffers by asking for impossible recounts is now being joined by the badly defeated & demoralized Dems — Donald J.

However, the Wisconsin Election Commission staff announced Saturday that it has already pulled together a timeline it expects the commission to approve. \n \n The timeline, which would have the recount begin Thursday, follows federal law calling for it to be completed withing 35 days of Election Day.

NBC News reports the campaign announced Saturday it will participate in the recount in Wisconsin and possible recounts in Michigan and Pennsylvania to make sure the process is ""fair"" for everyone. ""We certainly understand the heartbreak felt by so many who worked so hard to elect Hillary Clinton, and it is a fundamental principle of our democracy to ensure that every vote is properly counted,"" campaign lawyer Marc Elias says in a post on Medium. The campaign was spurred to get involved in the recount partly based on reports that Russians hacked the DNC, tried to hack voter registration databases, and spread fake news about the election, according to the Washington Post. But that doesn't mean the Clinton campaign expects anything to change. Elias says they've had experts combing over the results for weeks and haven't found any ""evidence of manipulation."" And he notes that even in the closest of the three states, Michigan, Trump's lead ""well exceeds the largest margin ever overcome in a recount."" He adds that the Clinton campaign didn't initiate the recount efforts itself and had absolutely no plans to do so but now must monitor them ""on principle."" Clinton spokesperson Brian Fallon denies that Elias' post means the campaign isn't accepting the results of the election. ""We see no evidence of tampering so far,"" he tells the Post. ""Not sure what you could point to to suggest there is anything here that calls the results into question."""

But there have been warnings that others may follow, particularly beer companies, which are also heavily reliant on the prices of aluminum. \n \n None of the major brewers have announced hikes, but smaller craft brewers have felt the impact quicker and some have already had to make adjustments. Octopi Brewing in Waunakee, Wisconsin, told the CBC that after its US supplier of aluminum cans, citing the tariffs, hiked prices by 15%, it opted to pass the extra costs on to customers. \n \n ""It\'s terrible,"" CEO Isaac Showaki said. ""It\'s hitting our bottom line … we probably could have hired almost two people full-time."" \n \n In retaliation, China, a major aluminum exporter, has levied higher fees on a slew of US products, including soybeans and cars.

The Supreme Court has ruled that a startup... (Associated Press) \n \n The justices said by a 6-3 vote that Aereo Inc. is violating the broadcasters' copyrights by taking the signals for free. The ruling preserves the ability of the television networks to collect huge fees from cable and satellite systems that transmit their programming. \n \n Aereo is available in New York, Boston and Atlanta among 11 metropolitan areas and uses thousands of dime-size antennas to capture television signals and transmit them to subscribers who pay as little as $8 a month for the service. \n \n Some justices worried during arguments in April that a ruling for the broadcasters could also harm the burgeoning world of cloud computing, which gives users access to a vast online computer network that stores and processes information. \n \n But Justice Stephen Breyer in his majority opinion that the court did not intend to call cloud computing into question. \n \n Justices Antonin Scalia, Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas dissented. \n \n Broadcasters including ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC and PBS sued Aereo for copyright infringement, saying Aereo should pay for redistributing the programming the same way cable and satellite systems must or risk high-profile blackouts of channels that anger their subscribers. \n \n Aereo's service starts at $8 a month and is available in New York, Boston, Houston and Atlanta, among 11 metropolitan areas. Subscribers get about two dozen local over-the-air stations, plus the Bloomberg TV financial channel. \n \n In each market, Aereo has a data center with thousands of dime-size antennas. When a subscriber wants to watch a show live or record it, the company temporarily assigns the customer an antenna and transmits the program over the Internet to the subscriber's laptop, tablet, smartphone or even a big-screen TV with a Roku or Apple TV streaming device. \n \n The antenna is only used by one subscriber at a time, and Aereo says that's much like the situation at home, where a viewer uses a personal antenna to watch over-the-air broadcasts for free. \n \n The broadcasters and professional sports leagues also feared that nothing in the case would limit Aereo to local service. Major League Baseball and the National Football League have lucrative contracts with the television networks and closely guard the airing of their games. Aereo's model would pose a threat if, say, a consumer in New York could watch NFL games from anywhere through his Aereo subscription. \n \n .""]",3,"– President Trump's favored Diet Cokes will be climbing in price as a result of recently imposed tariffs.

178,"['In the context of a fascinating, detailed account of the sex scandal that ended the presidential candidacy of Gary Hart, political journalist Matt Bai writes: \n \n Back then, Hart was as close to a lock for the nomination — and likely the presidency — as any challenger of the modern era. According to Gallup, Hart had a double-digit lead over the rest of the potential Democratic field among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents. In a preview of the general election against the presumed Republican nominee, Vice President George H. W. Bush, Hart was polling over 50 percent among registered voters and beating Bush by 13 points, with only 11 percent saying they were undecided. He would have been very hard to stop. \n \n This is just wrong. Whoever won the Democratic nomination was highly unlikely to win the presidency, a topic that Gary King and I discuss in our epic-length 1993 paper, “Why Are American Presidential Election Campaign Polls So Variable When Votes Are So Predictable?” You know who else was leading Bush in the polls by 13 points? Michael Dukakis, and you know what happened to him. When the election finally came around, Bush beat Dukakis by nearly eight percentage points. Would a switch from wimpy Dukakis to tough-guy Hart have led 8 percent of Bush’s supporters to vote differently? I don’t think so, and I think it’s fair to say that my view represents the overwhelming opinion of political scientists, following decades of research by Bob Erikson, Steven Rosenstone, Doug Hibbs and many others on the predictability of presidential elections. \n \n As Jonathan Chait (a political reporter of the next generation after Bai, and more influenced by political science) wrote: \n \n Parties and candidates will kill themselves to move the needle a percentage point or two in a presidential race. And again, the fundamentals determine the bigger picture, but within that big picture political tactics and candidate quality still matters around the margins. \n \n A percentage point, sure, but overcoming an eight-point margin in the general election? I don’t think so. As I wrote in my discussion with Chait, I’m pretty sure that Mike Dukakis, David Mamet, Bill Clinton and the ghost of Lee Atwater will disagree with me on this one, but Dukakis actually performed just as well in 1988 as predicted based on the fundamentals. There is no evidence he was out-campaigned by Bush, nor is there evidence that Hart was so awesome that he could’ve done so much better. \n \n Let me emphasize that although general elections for president are largely predictable and the evidence is that they are decided by partisan and economic conditions much more than by candidates, the story is different for other sorts of elections. Here’s something I wrote a few years ago on why are primaries so hard to predict. \n \n Political science and political reporting are complementary. The changing role of political media in the United States is an interesting and important topic, and it needs to be understood in the context of the immutable and anomalous details of particular examples, including the saga of Gary Hart. Hart’s story is dramatic, and Bai may be correct that it forever changed American politics. But it almost certainly had no effect on the outcome of the 1988 presidential election.', '“We don’t need any of that,” were Hart’s parting words. \n \n The next morning, on May 3, The Herald reporters published a front-page article about Hart’s purported affair. At the end, they referred to a statement in which Hart challenged reporters interested in his personal life to follow him. Hart couldn’t have known it at the time, but his words — “follow me around” — would shadow him for the rest of his days. They would bury everything else he had ever said in public life. \n \n In the history of Washington scandal, only a few quotes — “I am not a crook,” “I did not have sexual relations with that woman” — have become as synonymous with a politician. In truth, though, Hart never issued any challenge to The Miami Herald’s reporters, or to anybody else, really. The words were spoken weeks earlier to E. J. Dionne Jr., who was then the top political reporter for The New York Times and was writing a profile for this magazine. Dionne discussed a broad range of topics with Hart and then reluctantly turned to the rumors of affairs. Hart was exasperated and he finally told Dionne: “Follow me around. I don’t care. I’m serious. If anybody wants to put a tail on me, go ahead. They’d be very bored.” \n \n Hart said this in an annoyed and sarcastic sort of way, in an obvious attempt to make a point. He was “serious” about the sentiment, all right, but only to the extent that a man who had been twice separated from his wife and dated other women over the years — with the full knowledge of his friends in the press corps and without having seen a single word written about it at the time — could have been serious about such a thing. Hart might as well have been suggesting that Martians beam down and run his campaign, for all the chance he thought there was that any reporter would actually resort to stalking him. Dionne certainly didn’t take the comment literally, though he suspected others might. “He did not think of it as a challenge,” Dionne would recall many years later. “And at the time, I did not think of it as a challenge.” \n \n As it happened, Dionne’s cover story was set to appear Sunday, May 3, the same day the Herald published its front-page exposé. No one at The Herald had a clue that Hart had issued any “challenge” on the previous Monday when Fiedler heard from his anonymous tipster or when he continued to chase the story during the week. All of this they did on their own, without any prodding from Hart. \n \n In those days before the Internet, however, The Times circulated printed copies of its magazine to other news media a few days early, so editors and producers could pick out anything that might be newsworthy and publicize it in their own weekend editions or Sunday shows. When Fiedler boarded his flight to Washington Saturday morning, eager to join the stakeout, he brought with him the advance copy of Dionne’s story, which had been sent to The Herald. Somewhere above the Atlantic seaboard, anyone sitting next to Fiedler would probably have seen him jolt upward in his seat as if suddenly receiving an electric shock. There it was, staring up at him from the page — Hart explicitly inviting him and his colleagues to do exactly the kind of surveillance they had undertaken the night before. \n \n The discovery of Hart’s supposed challenge, which the Herald reporters took from the advance copy of The Times Magazine on Saturday night and inserted at the end of their Sunday blockbuster — so that the two articles, referring to the same quote, appeared on newsstands simultaneously — probably eased any reservations the editors in Miami might have had about pushing the story into print before they had a chance to identify Rice and try to talk to her. Soon enough, as The Herald would put it in their longer reconstruction a week later, Gary Hart would be seen as “the gifted hero who had taunted the press to ‘follow me around.’ ” Everyone would know that Hart had goaded the press into hiding outside his townhouse and tracking his movements. Hart’s quote appeared to justify The Herald’s extraordinary investigation, and that’s all that mattered.', ""Hey, @ realDonaldTrump: While you obsess over my genes, your Admin is conducting DNA tests on little kids because you ripped them from their mamas & you are too incompetent to reunite them in time to meet a court order. Maybe you should focus on fixing the lives you're destroying."", '""Soon, a federal judge will decide what name and label to give the killing of Walter Scott. The same judge will determine what punishment former Officer Slager should receive.… We have confidence in the comprehensive federal sentencing process and we will continue to support the federal government\'s efforts in any way that is necessary and appropriate,"" she said.']",4,"– More than 25 years ago, Gary Hart's presidential campaign came to a screeching halt after a Miami Herald article investigating his supposed extramarital affairs and a photo of Hart with 29-year-old model Donna Rice sitting on his lap were published. Now, after years of speculation—and refusal by the Herald political reporter to ID the caller who initially filled him in on the photo—a Florida woman admits she's the one who phoned the Herald and also let the paper know that Rice was going to visit Hart in DC, the New York Times reports. Rice herself tells the Times that she thought former friend Dana Weems was somehow behind the leak, along with another pal, Lynn Armandt—and when Times writer Matt Bai called Weems, she reportedly sighed, then replied, ""Yeah. That was me."" (She also claims Armandt was standing next to her when she made the call, listening in.) The Herald story, photo, and ensuing scandal forced Hart to drop out of the running for the Democratic nomination (though the Washington Post disputes Bai's assertion that ""Hart was as close to a lock for the nomination—and likely the presidency—as any challenger of the modern era""). Weems, who has health issues from multiple sclerosis and now sells raincoats online, says Hart was actually enchanted with her—not Rice—and that Rice pursued Hart because she wanted to be famous, while Hart's philandering behavior (especially the thought of him getting away with it and becoming president) made Weems ""sick to her stomach."" She also tells the Times that she can't believe her secret has been safe all these years and that she was ""sorry to ruin [Hart's] life. I was young. I didn't know it would be that way.""

TMZ reports a lawsuit filed against the Carolina Panthers quarterback by the manager of a luxury hotel rental company claims he did nearly $100,000 in damage to an $11 million Beverly Hills mansion he rented in the wake of the Super Bowl. Despite agreeing to a no-partying policy, Newton allegedly held numerous parties during the 61 days he rented the house, breaking a fridge, causing water damage to the floors, destroying a $32,000 rug, and more. The rental company is looking to recoup damages plus the two months of rent it claims it lost while fixing the damage.

The state’s Republicans first had to wade through a widely expected political pileup in order to complete the next stage of Missouri’s convoluted nomination process.“It’s gonna be a bloodbath,” said Jay Zvirgzdins, 32, a fuzzy, blond-bearded, bespectacled Ron Paul fan, before his caucus Saturday morning in a little city called (really) Town and Country, Mo.He was waving his thermos at the crowd that had assembled to caucus at the Westminster Christian Academy, where Santorum had stopped by to speak to a few dozen fans and a handful of placard-wielding Mitt Romney supporters in this St. Louis suburb.The caucusing -- in which Missourians picked the delegates who will elect the delegates who will cast their votes for a Republican nominee, the layers of it all a bit like a giant political nesting doll -- went smoothly in some places, and more, um, bloodbath-like in others.The Kansas City Star reported that in Clay County, “arguments between Paul supporters and others became so intense the caucus chairman threatened to have voters removed by force.""Across the state, some argued that delegates should honor the February vote; others said that the delegates should be proportional.In St. Charles, political blogger John Combest tweeted that order broke down in the first 10 seconds of the caucus, with Santorum, Romney and Paul groups butting heads in a “mass hysteria” over how to proceed.State representative Matt Ehlen tried to take order, announcing that, as Combest tweeted, “The police are ready to shut us down.” As of last word, the caucus gave up and there had been no vote on delegates. “All we need is Ernie Hays on the organ to play ‘Three Blind Mice’ or the Jeopardy theme,” Combest tweeted.', 'Facebook \n \n Twitter \n \n Google Plus \n \n Embed 1:37 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog \n \n Two missing Kentucky teenagers suspected of a crime spree across the South have been spotted in Florida, where they were seen panhandling, police told NBC News on Friday. \n \n Grayson County, Georgia, Sheriff Norman Chaffins said 18-year-old Dalton Hayes and his 13-year-old girlfriend Cheyenne Phillips, may be staying in camps or homeless shelters and could have the weapons that were in one of the vehicles they allegedly stole. \n \n ""I think it started as a game or something funny,"" Chaffins said.

This spring's GOP primary battle is now a party, as GOP leaders and enthusiastic supporters squared off in one of Missouri's largest caucuses yesterday, reports ABC News. At least two people were arrested and a police helicopter was called in, after organizers and enthusiastic attendees in St. Charles County fought heatedly over the event's proceedings—in addition to a caucus' usual squabbling over rules and results, Ron Paul supporters apparently insisted on filming the caucus, despite that being against the rules. “It’s like the Hatfields and the McCoys around here,” said one GOP operative. Caucuses weren't much better in the rest of the state, with organizers using words like ""bloodbath"" and ""mass hysteria"" to describe them, reports the LA Times. But at least most of the caucuses were able to function. In Clay County, organizers threatened to remove rowdy Paul supporters, but did not actually do so. “It could have been messier,” said one committee chairman. “We were expecting a large contingent of Ron Paul voters.” Missouri's primary in February was nonbinding, and the caucus process of choosing delegates is relatively complicated and layered."

A former colleague said he sometimes wore two expensive watches at the same time — a Rolex and a Patek Philippe — one for each wrist. \n \n Mr. Kabila and his family own a network of homes and huge farms across Congo, sweeping up thousands of acres, analysts and former aides said. They also said Mr. Kabila was most at peace around animals. He is an avid breeder of cows, and he kept a menagerie of chimpanzees, a dik-dik (a small antelope), birds of prey and parrots at his house in urban Kinshasa. A recent visitor said at least one chimp still lived there, screeching hoots from a cage as guests arrive. \n \n But these days, the stress of the job seems to be eating at him. Mr. Kabila has put on weight. The few times he was spotted in public he had huge bags under his eyes. \n \n More whistle-blowers are coming forward, which may make him even less likely to quit if he believes that he can best protect himself and his assets by intimidating or neutralizing critics with his security forces. \n \n One Congolese government official said that on numerous occasions he had been instructed to take wheeled suitcases, stuffed with $100 bills totaling more than $7 million, to a minister’s office for “state’s use.” The money came from a government-controlled company. The official, along with several others, said it would be too dangerous for anyone but Mr. Kabila or his family to steal that blatantly. \n \n The Panama Papers — leaked confidential documents from a law firm in Panama — revealed that Mr. Kabila’s twin sister, Jaynet, using a different name, owned an indirect share in the nation’s largest mobile phone operator and through a company registered in Niue, in the South Pacific. \n \n Current and former Congolese officials described very complicated and suspicious business dealings involving foreign partners, joint ventures and lucrative mining concessions. One such deal recently attracted the attention of Britain’s Serious Fraud Office, which is investigating Congo’s cut-rate sale of mining rights through an Israeli tycoon who is a friend of Mr. Kabila’s.

His second—and constitutionally mandated final—term ended Monday at midnight. Only the 45-year-old Kabila refused to step down. Here's what you need to know: With Kabila refusing to relinquish power, violence is breaking out. The Guardian reports 20 people were killed as protesters clashed with security officials. Oddly, Kabila's chief diplomat tells Newsweek that Kabila would be guilty of treason if he stepped down. The country failed to hold an election in November as planned, and the diplomat says the constitution requires Kabila to stay in power until a successor is elected. But the ruling party states that won't happen until April 2018 at the earliest. The New York Times reports it might not be desire for power that's keeping Kabila from ceding the presidency but rather a fear he'll lose his fortune in the process. Investigators say Kabila has stolen millions in public assets through ""dubious mining rights sales"" and ""possible money-laundering schemes."" In the months leading up to the end of Kabila's second term, the Washington Post did an extremely rare public opinion poll in the Democratic Republic of Congo, finding that 81% of people don't want the constitution changed to give Kabila a third term and 74% want him to step down by the end of the year. The Guardian notes that the current situation isn't rare for the country. The Democratic Republic of Congo hasn't had a peaceful transfer of power since gaining independence 56 years ago and is facing what could be an especially violent period. Meanwhile, the Democratic Republic of Congo's former colonial ruler—Belgium—says it will ""re-examine"" its relationship with the country in the wake of what some are describing as a coup by Kabila, according to the Independent."

187,"[""Reproduction and Development \n \n Abyssinian ground hornbills are monogamous animals, with males helping care for females and young during the incubation stage. Breeding time depends upon location, with pairs residing in Nigeria and Uganda breeding in January, Kenyan pairs breeding in November, and West African populations breeding in June-August. Nests are constructed in the cavities of trees, with rock holes or synthetic cavities utilized when trees are unavailable. Males prepare the nest cavity by lining it with dry leaves; females will then lay one or two eggs over the course of five days. Incubation lasts 37 to 41 days, with the male providing food for the incubating female. \n \n Incubation for Abyssinian ground hornbills begins with the first egg, so one hatchling will mature more quickly and grow faster than its nest mate. Newly hatched chicks normally weigh about 2.5 ounces (70 grams), with both mother and father investing heavily in the hatchling's future. The second hatched chick will often die of starvation as its larger sibling prospers, with the stronger hornbill chick sometimes growing five times its first-hatched weight in its initial four days. Parents will protect and provide food for their offspring, which will remain with the pair for up to three years. Abyssinian ground hornbills breed about once every three years, with on average one chick surviving to adulthood every nine years."", 'Published on Sep 1, 2017 \n \n When it comes time to eat, Abyssinian ground hornbills pick up prey with their beak, toss it into the air and swallow it whole. But for Karl, the Zoo’s hornbill, eating was a challenge due to his worn down lower beak. To build a newer, stronger, better prosthetic beak for him, Zoo staff worked with museum specialists at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History. The skull of a hornbill who lived at the Zoo in the 1930s was exactly what animal keepers, veterinarians and exhibit specialists needed to engineer a 3-D printed beak. Now, Karl can once again use his natural behavior to eat and keep his belly full. #science', 'Specialists from the Smithsonian’s National Zoo and its National Museum of American History worked out a way to use a 3-D printer to make a new bill for an exotic bird that needed one. \n \n Specialists from the Smithsonian Institution have used a 3-D printer to help an unusual bird at the National Zoo keep its species going on into the future. \n \n The printer does not actually create new members of the Abyssinian ground hornbill family. \n \n But the zoo said Thursday that it has collaborated with the Museum of Natural History to build a new beak for a ground hornbill that badly needed one. \n \n Beaks are vital to the Abyssinian hornbill. Lacking teeth, it eats by picking up prey with the beak, tossing it aloft, and swallowing it. \n \n With his worn-down lower beak, Karl, the zoo\'s hornbill, had problems.

With only half a bottom beak, the black-plumed bird at Washington's National Zoo couldn't eat anything smaller than a mouse. And to do that, he had to sort of scrape his beak along the ground while tilting his head at just the right angle. Lacking teeth, Abyssinian ground hornbills scoop up morsels, which they flip in the air and swallow whole. Experts puzzled over how to help the 27-year-old bird eat, the Washington Post reports, but ill-fitting prosthetics kept falling off. Experts at the Smithsonian Institution then came up with a novel idea: Reaching into their vaults, they found a hornbill skull circa 1933 to use as a model, then turned to a 3D printer to build Karl a shiny new beak. In a fascinating video that outlines the process, specialists crafted the new appendage in stages with the help of the printer. Then they glued it onto a prone Karl. ""Fingers crossed it stays on,"" one of them says. Native to Africa, hornbills are about the size of a wild turkey. Males have blue and red coloring around their throats and long eyelashes they can flutter at mates they choose exclusively. For Karl's sake, his keepers hope with a full belly, he will be better able to keep up the latter end of the bargain. Vet James Steeil says the hope is that the high-tech prosthetic ""will provide Karl with a better avenue to eat for himself and hopefully propagate the species.""

They usually do — that\'s how sickly she is — and indicate how small Collins chose to get for the part. \n \n Writer/director Marti Noxon and star Lily Collins promote their film \'To the Bone,\' about a woman struggling with anorexia. (Photo: Eric Charbonneau, Invision for Netflix) \n \n Beefing up and slimming down for roles is all part of the job of an actor. But for Collins, 28, there was an added danger: She wanted to look like someone with anorexia, years after overcoming her own disordered eating, which included consuming nearly nothing, using diet pills and throwing up. \n \n ""I personally knew that this was something I needed to do to tell this story,"" says Collins, who struggled with both anorexia and bulimia. ""I wanted to be able to best exert my experiences on (Ellen) by going to the lengths I felt comfortable going to as an actor.” \n \n That meant looking thin enough to worry her fans, who ""lovingly, were concerned"" after seeing the actress in paparazzi photos taken while she was preparing for the movie. She won\'t disclose how much she lost, ""but I was held accountable by a nutritionist, by (our director), by my mother, by our producer,"" she says. \n \n ""There was never any time limit, there was never a (weight) number, (but) I didn’t want to get to the end of this experience and feel like I didn’t access what I needed to portray Ellen,"" says Collins, who on this day at the London West Hollywood hotel looks radiant and ""strong,"" as the film\'s writer/director Marti Noxon points out. ""I can honestly say I gave it everything that I could and was able to stay Lily."" \n \n Lily Collins felt that playing Ellen in \'To the Bone\' was part of her ""life\'s mission."" (Photo: Netflix) \n \n For some scenes in the film, which shows Ellen getting gradually sicker with a bruised spine (the result of obsessive crunches), sunken cheeks, furry arm hair (the body\'s way of keeping a too-thin body warm) and concave belly, Collins relied on special effects. ""Makeup, in general, is amazing,"" she says, citing a baggy wardrobe, collarbone and cheekbone prosthetics and plenty of lighting and shading tricks to make her look increasingly bony. \n \n But then there\'s the question: Even with the help of prosthetics, why take on a dangerous role at all? \n \n Collins saw it as the right way to bring eating disorders into the public discourse. \n \n It all felt serendipitous, because Noxon (who didn\'t know about Collins\' past struggles) sent her the script just days after the actress wrote an essay about eating disorders for her memoir, Unfiltered. \n \n Lily Collins, right, used baggy clothes, makeup and prosthetics to help her achieve the look of sickly Ellen. (Photo: Netflix) \n \n ""For me, it was a sign from the world saying, \'This is probably something that is actually bigger than you. There’s a larger thing in play here and both are going to be able to better inform one another,\'” Collins says. “When you have your life’s mission and the mission of a project merge like this so beautifully, that’s like total magic."" \n \n To Noxon, whose own experience with eating disorders inspired the movie, making To the Bone ""was a weird thing of touching old hurts ... to help people,"" she says. ""(Lily and I are) both recovered and healthy and living incredible, full lives beyond our wildest dreams. We can say, \'Look, we\'re here.\' "" \n \n Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2uNaiby', 'Keanu Reeves’ phoned-in outing as a dashing doctor is one of many low points in a film whose treatment of an important topic ranges from banal to bizarre \n \n Here is a US drama from Netflix about anorexia, notable only for its sheer extravagant awfulness. It’s a dismal TV movie of the week: trite, shallow, cautiously middlebrow and blandly complicit in the cult of female prettiness that it is supposedly criticising. \n \n Lily Collins plays Ellen, a talented young artist and college dropout who has issues with body image and anorexia. She is sent to a community treatment facility under the care of the charismatic and revolutionary Dr William Beckham, played by … Keanu Reeves. But judging from his torpid line-readings, Reeves might as well be playing a non-ass-kicking version of John Wick: none of Dr Beckham’s supposed charisma is evident from this performance and there is nothing revolutionary in his clinical approach. But he is supposed to be super attractive. (When Dr Beckham arrives smartly dressed at a day out he has organised for the patients, a gay patient unironically asks if he wants to turn her straight.) \n \n To the Bone confirms there are (almost) no good movies about anorexia Read more \n \n Ellen’s backstory is fraught with carefully packaged emotional pain. Her mom, Judy (Lili Taylor), has gone to live with another woman, and now Ellen stays with her chivvying stepmother and her dad. Weirdly, this dad doesn’t feature in the family therapy scene and never appears in the film. Ellen’s art about herself has apparently inspired another woman with anorexia to take her own life. Collins reacts to this appalling tragedy with mild consternation, as if someone has said something lame about her on Instagram. But the movie is very squeamish about actually showing us these supposedly radical and shocking images, or telling us anything substantial about her troubled admirer. \n \n As for the other patients, they are the usual smorgasbord of cut-out personalities, as seen in movies such as Girl, Interrupted, itself a lite version of One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest. Ellen finds an emotional connection with a quirky British dancer, Luke (Alex Sharp), and encouraged by Dr Beckham (in a particularly implausible moment that pokes up from a nest of unbelievability) she experiments with changing her identity and her name, calling herself Eli. \n \n Eventually, Eli must come to terms with her relationship with Judy, and the film features a scene in which she is redemptively fed by her with a baby’s bottle, a spectacle that does succeed in being climactically bizarre, at any rate. At the end of the film, precisely nothing useful or insightful is said about anorexia or anything else.', 'Anorexia is one of those subjects that seem tailor-made for a medium as darkly fascinated by bodies and self-destructive obsessions as film, and yet it always comes across as phony, simply because actors can never really look anorexic; thin and baggy-eyed is a long way from the sight of skin sucked so tightly over bones that it appears that a person’s body might crumple in on itself at any moment. That doesn’t mean that movies can’t tackle the psychology, but with only a few exceptions (e.g., the English writer-director Mike Leigh’s 1990 film Life Is Sweet, which depicts a young, working-class bulimic woman), films about eating disorders take the form of hokey, know-the-symptoms public service pamphlets aimed at teens. There’s a reason why the topic is popularly associated with cheesy TV movies. The Netflix-produced To The Bone, which was written and directed by TV veteran Marti Noxon (UnREAL, Girlfriends’ Guide To Divorce), isn’t going to change that perception. It’s snarkier and a little more self-conscious than the rest, but just as cornball. \n \n Lily Collins stars as Ellen, a 20-year-old, internet-famous anorexic artist from a well-to-do Los Angeles family who agrees to move into a group-home-style treatment center for young people with eating disorders run by the no-bullshit Dr. Beckham (Keanu Reeves). We know Ellen has an attitude problem, because she smokes cigarettes and is introduced bailing on the latest in a string of in-patient clinics by informing her therapy group to “suck my skinny balls”; and we know she doesn’t like her prissy, Southern-accented stepmom, Susan (Carrie Preston), because she rolls her eyes when the family’s plastic-surgery-addicted maid refers to Susan as her mother. (To The Bone takes place in one of those alternate universes where no one seems to grasp the concept of step-parenthood.) With the exception of her beloved stepsister, Kelly (Liana Liberato), Ellen is surrounded by grotesques: the maid; Susan; the other patients at her last treatment facility; her unseen father; even her hippie-dippie lesbian mom (Lili Taylor), who came out when Ellen was 13. \n \n So perhaps Dr. Beckham, who speaks in Reeves’ usual relaxation-tape cadence, just seems like a breath of fresh air, even if moving into the group home means sharing the dinner table with a new cast of broadly defined single-issue characters: the pregnant one; the bulimic one who stashes her vomit; the English, anorexic, ballet-dancing love interest (Broadway actor Alex Sharp, making his film debut), whose adorable retro sensibilities are represented by a bedroom decorated with a picture of Frank Sinatra and a poster that just says “Jazz Festival.” Noxon is an unremarkable, at times clumsy director with no sense of staging, but she has decent taste in attractive young actors—which, however, only adds to the bogusness of the movie’s conception of illness, treatment, and family, and spoils whatever point To The Bone might have to make. It’s only in retrospect that one starts to notice how little the movie actually addresses Ellen’s condition; somewhere in trying to externalize a character’s problems through corny and ham-fisted subplots, it loses her altogether. All that’s left is a body hung in chic, loose clothes and a pretty face framed by dark caterpillar brows.', ""Anorexia might be among the most exasperatingly misunderstood diseases out there. Anything from its perceived irrationality to the misuse of its name as a shorthand to describe any and all thin people furthers a misconception that glamorizes a life-threatening disease and equates it to a kind of stubbornness borne of privilege. Loosely based on the director’s own past struggle with the disease, Marti Noxon’s quietly affecting and ultimately optimistic To the Bone thankfully rejects all these erroneous beliefs from the start. Instead, it soberly treats eating disorders like anorexia and bulimia as addiction-related mental and physical ailments that rob people of a normal life. \n \n To the Bone is soundly written by Noxon herself and well-acted by a committed ensemble. Most importantly, it is refreshingly well-considered from start to finish. Not knowing in advance the film was based on the writer-director’s own experiences, I immediately felt the topic was in the hands of someone who knows precisely what she’s talking about. \n \n Indeed, you feel Noxon’s first-hand knowledge at work in the unexpected ways she shows her empathy for lead character Ellen (Lily Collins of Okja and Rules Don’t Apply, pitch-perfect in a career-shifting performance that should significantly raise her stock.) It is the kind of empathy that both understands the inner-workings of a young person coping with struggles foreign to the majority of humankind and confronts her unreservedly when necessary. In that sense, you feel a real, unburdened sort of amity between writer Noxon and subject Ellen throughout To the Bone. Moreover, you feel a similar kinship between director Noxon and actor Collins, which makes sense once you realize Collins has also suffered from anorexia. \n \n Living with her sister Anna (Kathryn Prescott) and her overbearing but well-meaning stepmother Susan (Carrie Preston) in Los Angeles, Ellen refuses to cooperate with their efforts to get her on the right nutritional track and silently suffers in the hands of her disorder. She purges what little food she eats, does excessive sit ups and stands in the way of any real recovery. Finally agreeing to check into a home for those with eating disorders—led by Dr. William Beckham (a wise and paternal Keanu Reeves)—Ellen starts a new routine of silent disobedience. But thanks to the charming and infinitely determined ex-dancer Luke (Alex Sharp), with whom she builds a real closeness, her edges gradually start to soften. And when Ellen's biological mother (played by Lili Taylor in a brief but memorable part) comes into the picture, Noxon brings all the emotions she had thus far built carefully home. \n \n In following Ellen’s new life, Noxon patiently sculpts the characters of her new home with small but remarkable details, enough to make them seem like real people with believable hardships as opposed to fillers intended solely to further Ellen’s story. Noxon films their collective journey with a hopeful disposition yet doesn’t disregard the fragile nature of their conditions: she doesn’t let you forget for a second how much work it is to hold onto positivity. While recent years have given us Krisha, Rachel Getting Married and Flight as stories of people battling different types of addiction, you need to look as far back as the year 2000 to land on 28 Days as a major film focusing solely on addiction and disease recovery. Given the school of thinking that approaches treating eating disorders as treating addiction, you can draw parallels between the makeshift rituals and tightknit closeness of the community portrayed in To the Bone to that of 28 Days. Still, To the Bone is nearly one-of-a-kind in the way it puts an unapologetically human, heartbreaking face on an oft-misrepresented disease. \n \n Click here for cast and crew information."", 'By Radar Staff \n \n Who needs expensive spa outings when you’ve got a spare bag of kitty litter at home?

Williams, 38, has been charged with homicide in the death of JonMarquis Stepich, who died Thursday night after allegedly being assaulted Sunday at his home on Highland Street in North Braddock. \n \n Mr. Williams was lodged in the Allegheny County Jail on $100,000 bond Monday on charges of aggravated assault, endangering the welfare of children and recklessly endangering another person stemming from the incident. The charge of homicide was added today after JonMarquis died at Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC shortly before 4:45 p.m. Thursday night. \n \n According to an affidavit filed by police, Mr. Williams said he spent much of Sunday afternoon drinking alcohol during an outing to Ohiopyle State Park with his girlfriend, JonMarquis and two other children. The group later went to West Virginia, and they returned to their home after a few hours. \n \n During the night, Mr. Williams tried to walk through the boy’s bedroom to get to a third-floor room and tripped over a basket of laundry. He told police he got angry that the boy hadn’t cleaned his room so he picked him up and “slammed” him onto the edge of the bed before JonMarquis fell to the floor. Mr. Williams told JonMarquis three times to get up, but the boy “was unresponsive” each time, according to the affidavit. \n \n He then carried JonMarquis downstairs and put him in a chair in the living room. Early Monday morning the couple took the boy, who was still unresponsive, to UPMC McKeesport, where medical staff evaluated him and rushed him to Children’s Hospital due to the severity of his injuries, police said. \n \n The boy was placed on a ventilator in the intensive care unit. He suffered a “herniated brain stem” and bruising to his head, neck, buttocks and chest area, the affidavit said. \n \n The Allegheny County medical examiner’s office said JonMarquis died from blunt force trauma to the head and ruled his death a homicide. \n \n Police said Mr. Williams will remain in the county jail without bail.']",6,"– Director Marti Noxon has been open about her past struggles with eating disorders and says she hopes her new film starring Lily Collins as Ellen, a young woman suffering from anorexia, will ""serve as a conversation starter about an issue that's too often clouded by secrecy and misconceptions,"" the Guardian noted in June. But ahead of To the Bone's release Friday on Netflix, plenty are discussing whether the film does more harm than good. Some reactions: Though To the Bone currently has an 81% rating from 21 critics on Rotten Tomatoes, Peter Bradshaw says it's ""notable only for its sheer extravagant awfulness."" Writing at the Guardian, he calls the film ""trite, shallow, cautiously middlebrow, and blandly complicit in the cult of female prettiness that it is supposedly criticizing."" Ignatiy Vishnevetsky at the AV Club notes ""how little the movie actually addresses Ellen's condition"" and leaves the impression only of ""a pretty face"" and ""a body hung in chic, loose clothes."" Christine Morgan of the Butterfly Foundation, which offers support for eating disorders, adds the film's ""graphic representations"" raise ""a very real risk of copycat behavior,"" per the Huffington Post. She wants to see Netflix add a warning to the film. Kristina Saffran of Project Heal, which helps fund treatment for people suffering from eating disorders, offers a different take. ""Triggers are everywhere in eating disorder recovery,"" she tells the Washington Post, adding ""it would have been impossible to make any sort of film that didn't have the potential to trigger somebody who is struggling."" Per the AP, Claire Mysko of the National Eating Disorders Association notes eating disorders are a ""serious public health issue"" that will affect 30 million Americans in their lifetimes, so ""having eating disorders discussed on a national platform like this is really important."" The film isn't just important, but also really good, adds Tomris Laffly at Film Journal International. It's ""refreshingly well-considered,"" portrays eating disorders as ""addiction-related mental and physical ailments that rob people of a normal life,"" and is ""ultimately optimistic,"" she writes. But specific concerns have been made about Collins, who has admitted to struggling with eating disorders and had to lose weight for the role of Ellen, reports USA Today. Collins, however, says the weight loss was necessary ""to tell this story"" and done safely with oversight from a nutritionist, filmmakers, and her mother."

Tiven, executive director of gay rights and reform group Immigration Equality, said in a statement. ""Until now, LGBT families and their lawyers had nothing to rely on but an oral promise that prosecutorial discretion would include all families. Today, DHS has responded to Congress and made that promise real."" \n \n DHS released guidelines in 2011 instructing agents to consider a variety of factors -- including family relationships, the age an individual came to the U.S. and other ties to the country -- when determining whether the immigrant is high-priority for deportation. \n \n More than 80 House Democrats, led by Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Rep. Mike Honda (D-Calif.) and Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), called in late July for the Department of Homeland Security to add a specific mention of same-sex couples to its guidelines. \n \n Napolitano responded on Thursday to that letter with individual, but identical, messages to each of those members. There will be official guidance next week to ICE offices around the country. \n \n ""In an effort to make clear the definition of the phrase \'family relationships,\' I have directed ICE to disseminate written guidance to the field that the interpretation of the phrase \'family relationships\' includes long-term, same-sex partners,"" she wrote in the letter.

Bogliolo entered the country legally under a tourist visa, and is still authorized to stay because her application for a green card is pending. But her application could be turned down because the federal government does not recognize same-sex couples under the Defense of Marriage Act. \n \n ""We\'re glad beyond measure that someone is recognizing our status and making us safer,"" Rickard said.

Beyond the down payment there was almost certainly a second payment, maybe a third."" \n \n Last year, a source close to Russia\'s weapons export monopoly Rosoboronexport said Syria had paid 20 percent of the contract price, but that the S-300 deal was frozen because of the country\'s civil war. \n \n The United States, France and Israel have all called on Russia to stop the missile delivery. \n \n More than 80,000 people have been killed in Syria since peaceful protests against four decades of Assad family rule morphed into a civil war, pitting the president\'s forces and his ally, Hezbollah, against Syrian rebels and a flow of Sunni Islamist militants who have come to help them from abroad. \n \n Moscow says the expiry of the EU embargo complicates U.S. and Russian-led efforts to set up a peace conference between the Syrian government and its opponents, who demand an immediate end to Assad family rule. \n \n GENEVA 2 CONFERENCE \n \n The interview with Assad was to be released on Thursday on Al Manar, a television station linked to Assad\'s ally, the Shi\'ite Muslim militant group Hezbollah. \n \n Assad said he planned to go to the ""Geneva 2"" conference, al-Akhbar reported, though he was unconvinced of a fruitful outcome and pledged to continue fighting the uprising. \n \n Officials in Israel, the United States\' main ally in the region, say the S-300 could reach deep into the Jewish state and threaten flights over its main commercial airport near Tel Aviv. \n \n Al-Akhbar said Assad also stressed ties between his forces and Hezbollah militants now openly fighting on the Syrian side of the Lebanese-Syrian frontier. ""Syria and Hezbollah are part of the same axis,"" al-Akhbar quoted him as telling al-Manar. \n \n ""The Syrian army is the one fighting and leading the battles against the armed group, and this fight will continue until all those who are called terrorists are eliminated."" \n \n Syria straddles the fault lines of several regional and sectarian conflicts, and the violence in the country is increasingly seeping across its borders. \n \n Israel, wary of any Syrian weapons being sent to Hezbollah in Lebanon, has already carried out three air strikes against Damascus to stop suspected transfers. \n \n A recent series of strikes in Damascus, which shook the entire capital, stoked an angry reaction from Syria. State media outlets said Syria would respond to any further attacks and would also allow militant groups to attack Israel from a shared border on the Golan Heights. \n \n Israel captured much of Syria\'s Golan Heights in a 1967 war and occupies the territory today, but Assad and his father, the deceased president Hafez al-Assad, had kept the border quiet for decades. \n \n ""The Syrian government will not stand in the way of any Syrian groups that want to wage a war of resistance to liberate the Golan,"" Assad was quoted as saying in the interview. \n \n Hezbollah has said it is willing to support groups that chose to launch operations from the Golan. \n \n Israel has become particularly wary of the S-300 shipments although Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon said on Tuesday that the shipments were not yet on their way. \n \n Earlier this month, Israel was reported to have told Washington that Syria had begun payments for a $900 million purchase of S-300s, with an initial deliver due within three months. \n \n (Additional reporting by Thomas Grove in Moscow; Editing by Mark Heinrich)', 'Russia reserves the right to provide Syria with state-of-the art air defense missiles, seeing it as a key deterrent against foreign intervention in the country, a top Russian official said Tuesday. \n \n FILE - In this undated file photo a Russian S-300 anti-aircraft missile system is on display in an undisclosed location in Russia. Russia\'s Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Tuesday, May 28,... (Associated Press) \n \n Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov wouldn\'t say whether Russia has shipped any of the long-range S-300 air defense missile systems, but added that Moscow isn\'t going to abandon the deal despite strong Western and Israeli criticism. \n \n ""We understand the concerns and signals sent to us from different capitals, we realize that many of our partners are concerned about the issue, "" Ryabkov said, adding that ""we have no reason to revise our stance."" \n \n ""We believe that such steps to a large extent help restrain some `hot heads\' considering a scenario to give an international dimension to this conflict,"" he said. \n \n Russia has been the key ally of the Syrian regime, protecting it from the United Nations sanctions and providing it with weapons despite the civil war there that has claimed over 70,000 lives. \n \n Ryabkov didn\'t say when the contract was signed or give any other details. \n \n It is unclear if Moscow has provided Damascus with any of the S-300s missiles, a powerful weapon that has a range of up to 200 kilometers (125 miles) and the capability to track down and strike multiple targets simultaneously. The weapon would be a major boost for Syria\'s air defense capabilities, including against neighboring countries that oppose Assad\'s regime. \n \n Ryabkov\'s statement comes a day after European Union\'s decision to lift an arms embargo to Syrian opposition. He criticized the EU decision, saying it would help ""fuel"" the conflict and defended the S-300 deal, saying the air defense weapons can\'t be used in the civil war against the opposition, which doesn\'t have aircraft.']",2,"– On the one hand, it's a fairly expected announcement: On the heels of Russia's confirmation of a missile deal with Syria, President Bashar al-Assad has confirmed that the initial shipment of S-300 air defense missiles was in fact delivered to his country, with the second portion of the order arriving today. But Assad's statement, made in an interview to air today on Al Manar TV, and reaction to it bear some noteworthy aspects: As the New York Times points out, Al Manar is a channel run by Hezbollah, and that choice of delivery method, in the Times' view, only enhances ""the confrontational atmosphere"" of Assad's statements. The interview was actually taped on Tuesday, according to a Beirut source. That same day, Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon firmly denied a weapons delivery had occurred, warning Russia that such a move could spur Israel to retaliate. ""If, by some fortune, [the missiles] arrive in Syria, we will know what to do,"" he said. Per the AP, the next day, Syria's foreign minister said in a TV interview that Damascus ""will retaliate immediately"" if Israel strikes Syrian soil again. (Reuters notes Israel has thus far launched three airstrikes against Syria in a bid to stop weapons transfers.) But the AP notes that with the S-300 system in hand, the Israeli air force's abilities are curtailed, as the S-300s will allow Syria to counter airstrikes launched from foreign airspace. What exactly are the S-300 systems capable of? A second Israeli minister says they have a range of up to 185 miles; the AP, which puts their range at 125 miles, reports they're able to track and strike multiple targets simultaneously. What does Israel have to say about all this? No statement has been issued yet."

195,"['Kerry Biggs needed help managing her chronic pain. \n \n Years of taking prescription medications to alleviate the pain caused by her fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis and other ailments had left the mother of two ""feeling foggy."" \n \n Desperate to find an alternative, Biggs tried kratom. Derived from the leaves of the kratom tree, a close relative of the coffee plant, it has been used for centuries in Southeast Asia for its medicinal properties. \n \n In small doses, kratom acts as a minor stimulant similar to caffeine. In larger doses its works as a painkiller and can act as an antidepressant for some people. \n \n ""It gave me a new lease on life,"" said Biggs, who was able to wean herself off prescription painkillers by using kratom. ""It dampened down my pain without all the side effects that come with taking prescription drugs."" \n \n That new lease on life came to an abrupt end last year, because Biggs lives in Wisconsin. In 2014, Wisconsin became the fourth state to ban kratom. \n \n Kratom was never mentioned by state legislators either before or after the vote that made it illegal. \n \n Instead, two of the chemicals in it were included on a list of synthetic opioids lawmakers classified as Schedule 1 drugs, despite the fact kratom is neither synthetic nor an opioid. \n \n No one in Madison has been able to explain how or why the chemicals ended up on the list, but their inclusion means kratom is now in the same category as heroin and cocaine. \n \n At a meeting of the Wisconsin Controlled Substances Board last week, board member Alan Bloom said he was surprised to see the kratom on the list of schedule substances. \n \n ""They stick out like a sore thumb,"" said Bloom, a professor of pharmacology and toxicology at the Medical College of Wisconsin. \n \n Bloom was blunt in his assessment of the scheduling of kratom. ""There\'s no scientific basis for it,"" he told his colleagues. \n \n But state lawmakers aren\'t required to rely on science in their decisions. In 2012, legislators in Indiana made kratom illegal by declaring it to be a synthetic drug. \n \n Tennessee and Vermont followed Indiana\'s example, treating a tree\'s leaves like something created in a lab. \n \n ""Most people in this country have never heard of kratom, and there\'s a lot of bad information out there about it,"" said Susan Ash, executive director of the American Kratom Association. \n \n Ash has used kratom since 2011 to manage the symptoms of advanced Lyme disease. She founded AKA last year to advocate for people who use kratom and combat misinformation and efforts to ban it. \n \n ""There are some companies out there who aren\'t interested in helping people and they are promoting kratom as a \'legal high.\' That\'s led to some hysterical stories in the media,"" Ash said. \n \n ""Usually it\'s a story by a local TV news crew. They usually claim it\'s a dangerous new synthetic drug, even though it\'s not synthetic and it\'s been used for hundreds of years in Asia.

The Irish people are voting Friday in a referendum that could see the removal of a near-total constitutional ban on abortion, enacted by another referendum 35 years ago with support from the Roman Catholic church. The vote to repeal or keep the eighth amendment—which views ""the right to life of the unborn"" as equal to that of the mother and therefore prohibits abortion in cases of rape, incest, and fatal fetal abnormalities—is expected to be close. Opinion polls showed ""repeal"" voters slightly ahead but up to 20% of voters undecided, reports the Guardian, noting the votes of thousands of Irish expatriates returning home for the referendum ""could be significant."" Prime Minister Leo Varadkar calls the vote a ""once in a generation decision,"" noting it could be another 35 years before abortion is revisited. Should voters choose repeal, a move backed by UN Human Rights Committee, the government will introduce legislation allowing unrestricted abortion via pill during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, with abortions also permitted until the 23rd week in cases of fatal fetal abnormality or when a woman's health is at risk. Any woman seeking an abortion would need to wait three days after meeting with a doctor, reports the Washington Post. Currently, some 3,500 Irish women travel abroad to get abortions each year, and though seeking or providing an abortion can carry a 14-year prison term, another 2,000 are believed to illegally procure abortion pills. The vote result is expected Saturday afternoon."

When a Customs search turned up 3.5 kilos of heroin in his Samsonite roller bag, Traore confessed to his role in a smuggling plot and agreed to cooperate with a federal sting operation. \n \n After a series of phone calls, Traore arranged to meet up with Francis Abankwa, a 50-year-old Metropolitan Transportation Authority bus driver, “at 6:51 PM at the bus stop at Grand Concourse and East Tremont in the Bronx, New York.” Traore boarded Abankwa’s bus with a Samsonite roller bag in tow, according to a court filing. \n \n As Abankwa drove along his route, he discussed “narcotics trafficking activity” with Traore, who was wearing a recording device.

And as the Daily News reports, it was the driver himself who ended up in handcuffs. The tale of the unusual bust involving 8 pounds of heroin worth $3 million began the morning of April 17, when customs officials at JFK busted a traveler from Africa with the drugs in his Samsonite. He agreed to proceed with his deal under the watch of federal agents and called the cell number he had been provided, reports the Smoking Gun. His contact turned out to be a 50-year-old bus driver for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority named Francis Abankwa. The traveler boarded Abankwa's bus in the Bronx with the drugs and stayed right through until the end of the route, remaining on board while all the other passengers exited. After he and Abankwa exited and started heading toward Abankwa's car, the feds swooped in for the arrest. Both face felony narcotics conspiracy charges, and Abankwa is looking at 10 years in prison if convicted. On the bright side, notes New York, ""at least they let Abankwa finish his route."""

Researchers analyzed 65 studies from 34 countries (one study was conducted in NYC in 1999; other locations included Cuba, England, Australia, Sweden, Turkey, and Ghana) and found that women were mistreated across income levels and locations. The mistreatment ran the gamut, from things like neglect, a refusal to provide pain meds, poor communication, or a lack of respect for a woman's preferred birth position, to the extreme: slapping, pinching, gags, threatened beatings, and verbal abuse. One study, conducted in Tanzania, recorded four self-reported instances of rape and three of sexual abuse. While the researchers write that their study provides ""a comprehensive, evidence-based typology of the mistreatment of women during childbirth,"" the New York Times notes it does not calculate any sort of global estimate of abuse, and some figures produced by the individual studies themselves are wide-ranging: 28% of women in that Tanzania study reported abuse, while 98% did in a study out of Nigeria.

After noting that ""attitudes towards LGBT people differ hugely across the country,"" it warns that travelers ""may be affected by legislation passed recently in the states of North Carolina and Mississippi."" It then dispenses some advice on staying safe. Specific suggestions include avoiding ""excessive physical shows of affection"" in public and remaining ""wary of new-found 'friends'—criminals sometimes exploit the generally open and relaxed nature of the gay scene."" The message also directs readers to the Human Rights Campaign website for further info. ""It is both frightening and embarrassing that one of our nation's staunchest allies has warned its citizens of the risks of traveling to North Carolina and Mississippi because of anti-LGBT laws passed by their elected officials,"" says HRC Global Director Ty Cobb. The advisory was issued right before President Obama's scheduled arrival in London Thursday to voice his misgivings at the idea of Britain defecting from the EU, per the Guardian.

200,"['Zynga likes casual games: the social games publisher\'s mobile growth has been fuelled by the popularity of Words With Friends and related titles. It\'s much less keen to be associated with casual sex, however. \n \n The company is suing fellow US firm Bang With Friends, which makes an app for Facebook and smartphones claiming to be ""the anonymous, simple, fun way to find friends who are down for the night"". \n \n According to Bloomberg, Zynga\'s lawsuit claims that the startup ""selected the name \'Bang With Friends\' for its casual sex matchmaking app with Zynga\'s game trademarks fully in mind"" when it launched in January 2013 as a Facebook-connected website. \n \n It has since rolled out iPhone and Android apps, with chief executive Colin Hodge claiming in June that Bang With Friends had signed up 1.1m users in its first five months, with ""over 200,000 successful matches"". \n \n Zynga isn\'t the first dispute for the startup over the nature of its business. Within days of the release of its iPhone app, Apple had removed it from its App Store, and it has yet to return. \n \n Zynga is seeking a court order to ban Bang With Friends from using its name for any social networking apps in the US, and is also demanding unspecified damages according to Bloomberg. \n \n The app works by getting people to sign in using their Facebook IDs, then pick the friends who they\'d like to become friends-with-benefits. If any of those friends have registered and reciprocated, both parties are alerted to the fact and left to make their own arrangements. \n \n Its promises of privacy were undermined in May when The Daily Dot discovered a link to show any Facebook user which of their friends were registered with Bang With Friends, although not who they had picked. The link still works two months later. \n \n Zynga is understandably sensitive about one of its flagship mobile brands, With Friends, being associated with a casual-sex dating app. \n \n The publisher is refocusing its business around mobile gaming, which accounted for 27% of its bookings in the second quarter of 2013 as the company\'s games attracted 57m monthly active mobile users. \n \n The With Friends games – including Words, Scramble, Matching, Gems, Chess, Hanging and newest addition Running With Friends – remain an important part of that strategy. \n \n Bang With Friends has yet to comment on the lawsuit, but as a startup thought to have raised $1m of seed funding so far, the company will be wary of a lengthy legal battle with a richer firm like Zynga.', 'Zynga Inc. (ZNGA) sued the maker of the “Bang With Friends” casual sex Internet application, claiming it infringes Zynga’s trademark for its “with friends” family of games. \n \n Bang With Friends Inc., which makes an application matching Facebook friends anonymously for casual sex, registered its Internet domain name last year, according to the complaint filed yesterday federal court in San Francisco. \n \n The company “selected the name ‘Bang With Friends’ for its casual sex matchmaking app with Zynga’s game trademarks fully in mind,” according to the complaint. The name infringes a trademark covering games such as “Words With Friends” and “Chess With Friends,” according to the filing. \n \n Zynga seeks a court order barring the company from using the name “Bang With Friends” in connection with any social-networking applications in the U.S. and unspecified damages. \n \n “As a technology company, we take intellectual property seriously, and will evaluate the case in detail once we receive a copy,” Bang With Friends said in an e-mailed statement. \n \n More than a dozen top managers have left Zynga since the company’s December 2011 initial public offering, as waning demand for its games on Facebook Inc. (FB)’s network has sent the shares down more than 70 percent, eroding the value of equity-based compensation. \n \n ‘Mafia Wars’ \n \n At the time of its IPO, Zynga was the largest maker of games played on Facebook, with popular titles such as “CityVille,” “FarmVille” and “Mafia Wars.” The IPO raised $1 billion, the biggest debut by a U.S. Internet company since Google Inc. raised $1.9 billion in its 2004 IPO, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. \n \n “Zynga filed a lawsuit to stop blatant infringement of its valuable ‘With Friends’ brand,” Renee Lawson, the company’s deputy general counsel, said in an e-mailed statement. “Zynga is compelled to file suit to prevent further consumer confusion and protect its intellectual property rights against infringement.” \n \n The case is Zynga Inc. v. Bang With Friends Inc., 13-03517, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San Francisco). \n \n To contact the reporter on this story: Joel Rosenblatt in San Francisco at jrosenblatt@bloomberg.net \n \n To contact the editor responsible for this story: Michael Hytha at mhytha@bloomberg.net.']",2,"– Zynga makes the popular apps ""Words With Friends"" and ""Chess With Friends."" But it does not make the popular app ""Bang With Friends."" The former are board games. The latter helps Facebook friends hook up for casual sex. Now the company is suing Bang With Friends Inc, claiming it tried to cash-in on Zynga's ""With Friends"" trademark, reports Bloomberg. The lawsuit seeks to bar the company from using the name ""Bang With Friends"" on any app in the US, and an unspecified amount of damages. Bang With Friends claims to have 1.1 million users and 200,000 ""matches"" under its belt, reports the Guardian. It works by allowing people to identify which Facebook friends they want to hook up with. If two friends mark each other as potential hookups, both are notified of the other's interest. ""We heard through media reports that Zynga has filed a trademark infringement claim with respect to the 'with friends' part of our name,"" Bang With Friends Inc tells Wired.

Hundreds of roads in the area have been... (Associated Press) \n \n Rescue teams are warning people in some Colorado towns isolated by devastating flooding against remaining there, telling them that they could face weeks without basic supplies, including running water and electricity. \n \n Helicopters and truck convoys of the National Guard carried the admonition Saturday into paralyzed canyon communities where thousands of stranded residents were eager to escape the Rocky Mountain foothills. But not everybody was willing to go. Dozens of people in hard hit Jamestown wanted to stay to watch over their homes. \n \n Authorities made clear that residents who chose not to leave might not get another chance for a while. Rescuers won\'t go back for people who insist on staying, Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle said. \n \n ""We\'re not trying to force anyone from their home. We\'re not trying to be forceful, but we\'re trying to be very factual and definitive about the consequences of their decision, and we hope that they will come down,"" Pelle said. \n \n Special education teacher Brian Shultz, 38, was torn about leaving his Jamestown home. \n \n ""I was thinking about staying. I could have lasted at least a year. I have a lot of training in wilderness survival,"" he said, adding that he probably had enough beer to last the whole time. \n \n As he sat outside a makeshift shelter at a high school, Shultz floated the idea of walking back into the funky mountain town. \n \n ""If we hike back, I would stay there and just live. I\'d rather be at our own house than staying at some other people\'s houses,"" he said. \n \n His wife, Meagan Harrington, gave him a wry smile. About 10 of their neighbors declined to evacuate, she said. \n \n ""They said they wouldn\'t force you, but it was strongly encouraged,"" she said. \n \n Shultz teared up behind his sunglasses as he compared his situation to that of his neighbors. \n \n ""At least all of our stuff\'s there and will be there when we get back. The people right by the river, their houses were washed away. Other people thought their houses were going to be OK, and then they started to go. It\'s just really devastating."" \n \n Across the foothills, rescuers made progress against the floodwaters. But they were still unable to go up many narrow canyon roads that were either underwater or washed out. \n \n Meanwhile, President Barack Obama signed a disaster declaration and ordered federal aid for Colorado. The White House said in a statement Saturday night that the action makes federal funding available to affected individuals in Boulder County. The government said that other counties could be added later. \n \n The city of Longmont ordered a curfew from 10 p.m. Saturday until 6 a.m. Sunday in flood zones and evacuation areas, urging residents to remain indoors. \n \n On Saturday, the surge of water reached the plains east of the mountains, cutting off more communities and diverting some rescue operations. \n \n Four people have been confirmed dead since the harrowing floods began Wednesday. And hundreds of others have not been heard from in the flood zone, which has grown to cover portions of an area nearly the size of Connecticut. \n \n Some of those who are unaccounted for may be stranded or injured. Others might have gotten out but not yet contacted friends and relatives, officials said. \n \n Police expected to find more bodies as the full scope of damage emerges. \n \n A woman was missing and presumed dead after witnesses saw floodwaters from the Big Thompson River destroy her home in the Cedar Cove area, Larimer County sheriff\'s spokesman John Schulz said. \n \n ""I expect that we\'re going to continue to receive reports of confirmed missing and confirmed fatalities throughout the next several days,"" he said. \n \n Two fatalities were identified by the Boulder County coroner Saturday as Wesley Quinlan and Wiyanna Nelson, both 19. \n \n Authorities believe the couple died when they were swept away after driving into floodwaters and then leaving their vehicle. Their cause of death is under investigation. \n \n The military put more troops on the ground and helicopters in the air to aid in the search-and-rescue effort. \n \n By Saturday night, 1,750 people and 300 pets had been evacuated from Boulder and Larimer County, National Guard Lt. James Goff said. \n \n The airlifts will continue Sunday with helicopter crews expanding their searches east to include Longmont, Fort Collins and Weld County. \n \n It was not clear how many people were still stranded. \n \n A helicopter taking Gov. John Hickenlooper on a tour of the flooded areas even got in the act, stopping twice to pick up six stranded people and their two pets. Terry Kishiyama\'s son flagged down a helicopter with his shirt after a three-day wait for rescue from a neighbor\'s house on higher ground. \n \n ""You could hear the choppers for miles and miles, but I didn\'t know if they were evacuating people. You see a chopper going down behind a ridge, and you have no clue,"" Kishiyama said. \n \n In addition to his son\'s efforts, Kishiyama said his wife shouted at the chopper, ""We have babies!"" \n \n More than 85 fifth-graders from Louisville were greeted by their parents and friends Saturday after they were rescued from an outdoor education center near Jamestown. \n \n Above Larimer County, rescue crews airlifted 475 people to safety and planned to resume helicopter searches on Sunday, weather permitting. \n \n Rain was expected to start up again in the mountains and foothills, with between a half-inch and 2 inches forecast to fall overnight, according to the National Weather Service. \n \n Crews also used inflatable boats to pick up families and pets from farmhouses on Saturday. Some evacuees on horseback had to be escorted to safe ground. \n \n Near Greeley, 35 miles east of the foothills, broad swaths of farmland had become lakes, and the raging South Platte and Poudre rivers surrounded more homes. \n \n In one Boulder neighborhood, residents turned back city crews and machinery that arrived to remove the makeshift berms and sand-filled trash bags protecting their homes. University of Colorado students helped homeowners improvise a way to divert the rising water from Gregory Creek. \n \n ""The residents know better than anybody else how the water flows through the neighborhood,"" said Colleen Scanlan Lyons. \n \n In communities where floodwaters began receding, homeowners had a chance to assess damage. \n \n In Laporte, Wendy Clark surveyed soggy carpets and furniture that got damaged by the Poudre River. \n \n ""This mud smells disgusting,"" she said.

We explore some of the basic statistical mechanical properties of the zombie model, including its phase diagram and critical exponents. We report on several variant models, including both homogeneous and inhomogeneous lattices, as well as allowing diffusive motion of infected hosts. We build up to a full scale simulation of an outbreak in the United States, and discover that for `realistic' parameters, we are largely doomed.""]",2,"– Drenched Colorado is staring down the possibility of four more inches of rain today, having already absorbed 15 inches amid devastating floods, and officials are now telling residents to get out while they can—or face weeks without power and running water.

After Felton was shot, witnesses described the suspect as a black man with a tall, thin build and dressed in all black clothing, Dugan said. \n \n Tampa Police Department \n \n He said the person of interest was ""nonchalantly walking"" in both videos, saying the individual may be ""able to flip a switch and go out and murder someone,"" based on the person\'s casual manner. \n \n ""Look how they\'re looking at their phone,"" Dugan said, adding that the individual could be ""able to put that away, hit a switch and go out and gun someone down."" \n \n Watch this video.

Now investigators are using helicopters equipped with night vision tools to try to find them, the sources said. \n \n Earlier Thursday, a police helicopter glimpsed what investigators believed to be the fugitives in the same area, near Crepy-en-Valois, France. \n \n Said Kouachi, left, and Cherif Kouachi are suspects in the Paris attack. \n \n Police flooded the region, with heavily armed officers canvassing the countryside and forests in search of the killers. They came after a gas station attendant reportedly said the armed brothers threatened him near Villers-Cotterets in Picardy, stole gas and food, then drove off late Thursday morning. \n \n About 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the gas station, police blocked a rural country road leading to the French village of Longpont. Authorities have not commented in any detail, but pictures showed heavily armed police officers with shields and helmets in the blocked-off area. \n \n Hours later, a CNN team witnessed a convoy of 30 to 40 police vehicles leaving a site near Longpont. \n \n Prime Minister Manuel Valls put the Picardy region on the highest alert level, that same level that the entire Ile-de-France region, including Paris, is already under. \n \n As the search for the suspects intensified, details emerged about their past travels -- and possible training abroad. \n \n Said Kouachi went to Yemen for training, a French official told CNN. The training he received included instruction from al Qaeda\'s affiliate there on how to fire weapons, a U.S. official said , citing information French intelligence provided to the United States. \n \n In addition to northern France, other parts of the country have also been under scrutiny. \n \n More than 80,000 police were deployed nationwide Thursday, France\'s interior minister said. \n \n Earlier Thursday, a gunman -- dressed in black and wearing what appeared to be a bulletproof vest, just like those who attacked the Charlie Hebdo offices -- shot and killed a female police officer in the Paris suburb of Montrouge. A municipal official was seriously wounded in that attack, France\'s interior minister said. One person was arrested, Paris Deputy Mayor Patrick Klugman said, though it\'s not known whether the shooter is still at large. \n \n Authorities have called that a terror attack, but they haven\'t connected it to Wednesday\'s slaying of 12 at the satirical magazine\'s Paris headquarters. \n \n Latest updates at 10:15 p.m. ET \n \n • Investigators found empty containers and gasoline inside a car driven by the suspects in the Charlie Hebdo attack, according to U.S. and Western officials who say they received information from French intelligence about the vehicle. The suspects may have intended to use the items to make rudimentary explosives such as Molotov cocktails, the officials told CNN\'s Pamela Brown, Barbara Starr and Deborah Feyerick. \n \n • The head of Britain\'s MI5 security service told an audience in London that his agency was offering French intelligence officials its ""full support"" as France responds to Wednesday\'s terror attack in Paris. \n \n • In the United States, the Paris Las Vegas resort said it also planned to dim the lights on its half-sized replica of the tower Thursday night. ""We stand with Paris in mourning the victims of the Charlie Hebdo attack,"" a spokeswoman for the hotel said. \n \n Charlie Hebdo to publish next Wednesday \n \n While its business is satire, Charlie Hebdo has been the subject of serious venom. \n \n That includes its publication of cartoons lampooning the Muslim prophet, Mohammed, which some found very offensive. \n \n The magazine\'s offices were fire-bombed after that in 2011 , on the same day the magazine was due to release an issue with a cover that appeared to poke fun at Islamic law. \n \n It was attacked again Wednesday, when two masked men entered its offices not far from the famed Notre Dame Cathedral and the Place de la Bastille. \n \n Map: Charlie Hebdo HQ, Paris \n \n On their way into the building, they asked exactly where the offices were. The men reportedly spoke fluent French with no accent. \n \n They barged in on the magazine\'s staff, while they were gathered for a lunchtime editorial meeting. The gunmen separated the men from the women and called out the names of cartoonists they intended to kill, said Dr. Gerald Kierzek, a physician who treated wounded patients and spoke with survivors. \n \n The shooting was not a random spray of bullets, but more of a precision execution, he said. \n \n The two said they were avenging the Prophet Mohammed and shouted ""Allahu akbar,"" which translates to ""God is great,"" Paris Prosecutor Francois Molins said. \n \n JUST WATCHED Paris attack\'s tragic timeline Replay More Videos ...

But they have pointed to one key clue found inside a getaway car the gunmen apparently used: Said Kouachi\'s identification card.

There was no mention of a claim of responsibility for the attack. \n \n Officials were running the brothers\' names through databases to look for connections with ISIS and al Qaeda. \n \n A third suspect, 18-year-old Hamyd Mourad, turned himself in to police, a source close to the case told the AFP news agency. In French media and on social media, classmates of Mourad, who is in his final year of high school, said he was with them at school at the time of the attack. \n \n Cazeneuve said that nine people overall have been detained in connection with the Charlie Hebdo attack. \n \n But the Kouachi brothers remain on the run. \n \n \'Parisians will not be afraid\' \n \n The victims\' names were splashed Thursday across newspapers as heroes for freedom of expression.

A police spokeswoman says Hamyd Mourad, 18, went to a police station, ""introduced himself, and was put in custody,"" reports the New York Times. According to some reports, the suspect turned himself in after seeing his name appear in social media and has told investigators he was in school at the time of the attack that killed 12 people, including four beloved French cartoonists at the satirical newspaper. Some who say they're his classmates have been maintaining the same thing, tweeting under the hashtag #MouradHamydInnocent. In other developments: A huge manhunt is underway for brothers Said Kouachi and Cherif Kouachi, who are believed to have links to a Yemeni terrorist network. Seven people connected to the suspects were arrested overnight in the Paris area and in the towns of Reims and Charleville-Mezieres, the BBC reports. France's prime minister says the brothers were already known to intelligence services and ""our main concern"" is preventing them from carrying out another attack. There have been unconfirmed reports that the brothers have been spotted on a highway in northern France, with weapons visible in the back of their vehicle, the Guardian reports. Tens of thousands of Parisians joined vigils last night, and France has declared today a day of national mourning. A moment of silence was observed at noon. In what a CNN affiliate describes as ""their only mistake,"" an identification card belonging to one of the Kouachi brothers was found in a getaway car after the attack. There are conflicting accounts on how the slaughter during a Charlie Hebdo editorial meeting unfolded. CNN reports that a doctor who treated survivors was told the killing wasn't random, but was a ""precision execution"" with the two masked attackers separating men from women, then reading out names of victims they wanted to kill. Others, however, including police sources and a writer who managed to sound the alarm, described the attack as complete carnage, with the gunmen trying to kill as many people as possible, the Guardian reports. Le Monde has published one bloody image of the interior of the magazine's office. It reports by way of Charlie Hebdo's lawyer that the next edition will be issued Wednesday, with a million copies being printed. The typical weekly circulation is 45,000."

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) estimates that there are only about 450 North Atlantic right whales left after 17 were reported dead this year, according to Phys.org. And the news of such high mortality was exacerbated by a low number in births in 2017.

Along with the low number of breeding females, a study published in Endangered Species Research suggests that entrapment in fishing lines spikes stress levels in males, reducing their ability to reproduce.

213,"['There’s a lot of talk swirling around right now that the Scion brand will be euthanized today. If this is true—and that remains a big if—it is just making official something that might as well have been real for a while: Scion is dead. Update: It’s official. Toyota will transition the Scion cars back to the Toyota brand instead. \n \n I have some emails and calls out to Toyota officials to get official confirmation, which we may get anyway at 9 a.m. today, but, if we’re totally honest, all this means is that someone at the mothership is finally calling it. \n \n Advertisement \n \n The as-yet-unconfirmed rumors showed up on the aptly-named-for-this CarBuzzard late yesterday, where they reported that: \n \n At a top-secret meeting this afternoon, employees were told that the division, which started with the xA and xB in 2002 as 2003 models, wouldn’t see it’s 14thanniversary. Those who were laid off were told they would need to reapply for other jobs at Toyota, which also means moving to Texas. A formal announcement will be made tomorrow morning at 9 am. \n \n Motor Trend and AutoGuide are running with the report too. (It’s also worth nothing that CarBuzzard’s site is now down, perhaps from this glut of sudden traffic.) We remain skeptical until we hear officially. \n \n Advertisement \n \n The timing does seem a bit strange, considering two new cars meant to re-vitalize Scion’s lineup, the iM and the iA, are just now hitting dealerships, which would suggest Toyota isn’t really all that interested in giving those cars a chance to see what they can do for the marque. \n \n The truth is Scion’s relevance has been gone since at least 2006, with the redesign of the original xB, and with it, any car that really made the brand stand out from Toyota. \n \n Sure, there’s fans of the nicely-proportioned tC, and, of course, Scion got the great Subaru BRZ/Toyota GT86 as the FR-S, but beyond that, there hasn’t been much to really differentiate the brand. \n \n I even just recently addressed this and suggested a new lineup for Scion that I guarantee (no guarantees from this author will be honored – Ed.) would save the brand, so I’m personally going to assume all this is happening so Toyota can re-introduce the brand with my proposed lineup. \n \n Advertisement \n \n It’ll be interesting to see if Scion’s cars will be re-badged (again) as Toyotas; will the FR-S become the GT86 in the US, too? Will the iM become an Auris? Will they keep Scion’s mixed-case-letter-names, but have Toyota badges? Who knows. \n \n Either way, it looks like we’ll know pretty soon. Get ready to pour some 10W-40 out on your office carpet. \n \n UPDATE: Toyota has confirmed Scion “will transition to Toyota.” The brand will be phased out and existing models will be badged as Toyotas instead. More to come. \n \n Advertisement \n \n (props donated to BJ Killeen and her secret source for finding this out before anyone, by the way.)', 'Scion \n \n We might have seen the Cadillac ELR\'s demise a mile away, but the rather sudden death of Scion caught many by surprise. The youth-oriented brand, meant to shepherd buyers up through Toyota\'s ranks, is moving to that great dealership in the sky after nearly 13 years on this planet. \n \n In a statement, the company acknowledged that Scion would be absorbed into the Toyota brand. ""This isn\'t a step backward for Scion; it\'s a leap forward for Toyota,"" said Jim Lentz, now the CEO of Toyota Motor North America (he was formerly a founding VP of Scion). \n \n Looking at sales numbers paints a grim picture for the value-conscious brand. In 2015, Scion sold a shade over 56,000 vehicles, which amounts to about two months\' worth of Toyota Camry sales. It started off well, but sales peaked in 2006, and its cars seemed to lose some of the inherent quirkiness that piqued interest early on. \n \n But there was promise! Scion gave us a look at the C-HR concept, which was supposed to presage a new compact crossover for the brand. The company also rolled out two models very recently, the iM and iA, and both were generally well received. And, of course, there\'s the always-good-for-a-bit-of-fun, rear-wheel-drive FR-S. \n \n The statement says that model-year 2017 Scion vehicles will be rebadged as Toyotas, but not every model will survive the jump. The FR-S, iA and iM will move over, as will the forthcoming production version of the C-HR, but the tC will not live beyond the 2016 model year. All current Scion customers can continue to visit Toyota dealerships for service. It appears that Scion\'s team, some 22 strong across marketing, sales and distribution roles, will be offered positions within Toyota, as well. \n \n From experiments with no-haggle pricing, to the ""monospec"" idea that did away with options packages, Scion was a company that did things a little differently, even if it was attached to a company that\'s used to change on a geological time scale (Toyota). Requiescat in pace.', 'The Scion C-HR concept car is presented at the 2015 Los Angeles Auto Show (Photo: Getty Images) \n \n Toyota has killed its ailing Scion brand after its quirky designs failed to catch on and low gasoline prices made small cars a tougher sell. \n \n The brand\'s vehicles will be re-badged as Toyota models beginning with the 2017 model-year. \n \n ""Clearly we don’t take the discontinuation of a brand lightly — something that we’ve invested enormous amount of personal resources in for 13 years,"" Bob Carter, senior vice president of automotive operations for Toyota Motor Sales, told reporters in a conference call. \n \n Toyota envisioned Scion as an entry point for cost-conscious, young buyers. In that respect, the strategy worked. The average age of a Scion buyer was 36 years old, and 70% of the brand\'s buyer\'s had never purchased a Toyota before. \n \n But critically panned design choices — such as the cramped iQ mini car — set the brand on a path toward irrelevancy for the average new-vehicle shopper. Carter acknowledged that the company failed to reach Millennial buyers through marketing. \n \n The last straw, you could say, was plunging gasoline prices, which have crushed sales of the type of small cars Scion sells. \n \n ""It just never got traction and it has been on life support for at least five years, if not longer,"" said Peter De Lorenzo, a former auto marketing executive and editor of Autoextremist.com, in an interview. ""But kudos to Toyota for admitting that it was superfluous and they were wasting a lot of money trying to make the brand survive."" \n \n The company joins other auto brands that have recently gone defunct, such as Chrysler\'s Plymouth, Ford\'s Mercury and GM\'s Hummer, Saturn, Saab, Pontiac and Oldsmobile. \n \n Scion\'s sales fell 3% in 2015 to 56,187 units. But that was down 24% from 73,507 in 2012 and down 68% from its high point of 173,034 units in 2006. \n \n Though Scion\'s struggles have been evident for some time, Toyota had invested design energy and marketing power in the brand until its dying breath. The company picked the Los Angeles Auto Show in November to reveal the C-HR concept small crossover. \n \n The FR-S sports car, iA sedan and iM 5-door hatchback will become Toyota models, in addition to the C-HR if it\'s produced.

Starting this fall all Scion models will be re-badged as Toyotas instead, the company announced today. \n \n \n \n You can almost see the strained smile on the face of Jim Lentz, founding VP of Scion and now CEO of Toyota North America as he, in their press release, says: \n \n \n \n “This isn’t a step backward for Scion; it’s a leap forward for Toyota.” \n \n The release goes on to say: \n \n As part of the brand transition, beginning in August 2016, MY17 Scion vehicles will be rebadged as Toyotas. The FR-S sports car, iA sedan and iM 5-door hatchback will become part of the Toyota family. The tC sports coupe will have a final release series edition and end production in August 2016. The C-HR, which recently debuted at the L.A. Auto Show, will be a part of the Toyota line-up. The service and repair process for Scion customers will be unaffected by this change as customers will continue to visit Toyota dealerships’ service departments. \n \n Scion was established in 2003 as a way to target younger buyers and bring them into the Toyota family, which long suffered from one of the oldest demographics in the industry. Scion boasted some success in that regard; Toyota says the brand has (or had, I guess) the youngest average buyer age in the business. \n \n Advertisement \n \n But Scion had long suffered from a product drought. For most of its history, it only had three or four models in the entire range, and has gone inexplicably long without any crossovers, currently the hottest and highly profitable segments in car-dom. Cars like the second-generation xB languished for years as competitors came up with better offerings. It seemed Scion never quite lived up to its full potential as a brand for the kids, and that’s kind of a shame. Worst of all, Scion hit its sales peak way back in 2006 with 173,000 cars sold; last year it moved just 56,000. \n \n At the very least, it brought American enthusiasts the rear-drive FR-S sports coupe, a joint effort with Subaru (and built by them too), which is a shit-ton of fun to drive. And hey! Now it’s going to come with a Toyota badge, which saves you the trouble of doing the swap yourself.']",4,"– Toyota's Scion brand has been ""euthanized,"" as Jalopnik puts it, with the car manufacturer announcing Wednesday the division will be killed, per a Toyota press release. The brand will be phased out, and existing models—including the MY17, FR-S sports car, iA sedan, iM hatchback, and C-HR concept car—will be folded into the Toyota lineup. The tC sports coupe will cease production entirely in August. ""This isn't a step backward for Scion; it's a leap forward for Toyota,"" says James Lentz, Toyota Motor North America's CEO and one of Scion's founders. Jalopnik notes the timing seems a ""bit strange,"" since two new Scion models are right now cruising into dealerships, but Lentz suggests the company simply did everything it wanted to do with the Scion, which started off as its own brand in 2003. ""Our goal was to make Toyota and our dealers stronger by learning how to better attract and engage young customers … [and] that's exactly what we have accomplished,"" he says. USA Today notes that goal was indeed achieved—in some respects. The average age of a Scion purchaser was 36—which the Wall Street Journal notes is almost 20 years younger than the average new car-buyer—and 70% of Scion buyers had never bought a Toyota before. But the brand was hampered by design problems and a limited number of models, among other issues, and sales started dropping after its 2006 peak: For comparison purposes, CNET points out that 56,000 Scions were sold in all of 2015—which equals about two months' worth of Camry sales. ""I just think the product was never really as compelling as it could have been or should have been,"" a Kelley Blue Book analyst says. No (publicly admitted) regrets from Toyota, though. ""Scion has allowed us to fast-track ideas that would have been challenging to test through the Toyota network,"" Lentz says. (A Forbes columnist thinks Toyota only has itself to blame.)"

In an initial cached version of the fundraising page, they do not mention attorney fees in the fundraising pitch. A cached version of the page from early Thursday morning then estimates that attorney fees will “likely to be another $1 million,"" while her page had set a goal of $4.5 million mid-day Thursday. \n \n As of noon on Thursday, the fundraising page now estimates that attorney fees “are likely to be another $2-3 million, then there are the costs of the statewide recount observers in all three states,” raising the total cost to “$6-7 million.” \n \n The page also notes that “we cannot guarantee a recount will happen in any of these states we are targeting. We can only pledge we will demand recounts in those states” and that “if we raise more than what\'s needed, the surplus will also go toward election integrity efforts and to promote voting system reform.” \n \n According to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics, Stein raised just $3,509,477 during the 2016 cycle, through the most recent FEC report on October 19, 2016. The next FEC filing is due on December 8. \n \n Bianca Padró Ocasio contributed to this report.', 'Like well-tailored gray power suits, matte red lipstick and generous pours of whiskey in between meetings, office climate standards are a throwback to the 1960s ""Mad Men"" era when males ruled the workplace. \n \n Temperatures are set based on formulas that aimed to optimize employees\' thermal comfort, a neutral condition of the body when it doesn\'t have to shiver to produce heat because it\'s too cold or sweat because it\'s too hot. It\'s based on four environmental factors: air temperature, radiant temperature, air velocity and humidity. And two personal factors: clothing and metabolic rate, the amount of energy required by the body to function. \n \n The problem, according to a study in Nature Climate Change on Monday, is that metabolic rates can vary widely across humans based on a number of factors -- size, weight, age, fitness level and the type of work being done -- and today\'s standards are based on the assumption that every worker is, you guessed it, a man. \n \n Or if you want to be really specific, a 40-year-old, 154-pound man. \n \n Any female worker who spends time sitting at a desk can tell you that that makes for a wretched day, especially in the summer when air conditioners are on high, and they have to wear wool clothes and run space heaters even when it\'s 90 degrees outside. Previous studies have shown that women prefer higher room temperatures by as much as 5.5 degrees, but they haven\'t had a lot of physiological data to back up their misery -- until now. \n \n [These two men control the thermostat in 9,000 federal buildings] \n \n To try to quantify how big the difference is between the optimal temperature for men vs. women, researchers from Maastrict University in the Netherlands recruited 16 women to sit inside a temperature chamber set at 75.2 degrees Fahrenheit (or 24 degrees Celsius), on the warmer end of a typical setting for an office. \n \n The women, who were an average age of 23 and weight of 144 pounds, wore the equivalent of summer clothing -- underwear, socks, a cotton T-shirt and cotton/polyester sweatpants -- and simulated light office work by sending e-mail or reading a book while sitting at a table. \n \n The current standards for office settings assume a metabolic rate that produces a resting heat of 60 to 70 watts per square meter. The researchers estimated that this model overestimated the heat production of women by up to 35 percent. \n \n Translation: The women were freezing their collective behinds off. \n \n Boris Kingma, a researcher in human biology at Maastricht and the lead author of the study, said it\'s time that government officials and building engineers reconsider how they calculate ideal temperatures. Kingma, who studies the impact of indoor environments on a person\'s health, said previous studies have shown that when the environment is out of balance with the temperature your body needs, your productivity goes down. \n \n ""If you want to describe the thermal demand of a population, then it should be representative of that population,"" Kingma said in an interview. \n \n [Are menopausal women to blame for why it\'s so cold in your office?] \n \n The impact of setting the thermostats too low is not only an issue of individual comfort but one that has major implications for energy usage and the environment. Kingma explained that the problem impacts construction of offices from the design phase. It can dictate where vents are put in, how much insulation is used, how powerful the heater and air conditioners need to be, and how companies estimate their energy bills. \n \n ""Because you\'re taking a value that only applies to a male you\'ve already made a huge assumption that is a mistake,"" he said. \n \n \n \n A Nest thermostat on a wall. (EPA/Nest Labs Inc.) \n \n ""[C]urrent indoor climate standards may intrinsically misrepresent thermal demand of the female,"" Kingma and his co-author Wouter van Marken Lichtenbelt wrote. \n \n ""Ultimately,"" they added, ""an accurate representation of thermal demand of all occupants leads to actual energy consumption predictions and real energy savings of buildings."" \n \n [How Americans fell in love with crazy amounts of air conditioning] \n \n Kingma and van Marken Lictenbelt\'s work builds on research out of Japan which found that the neutral temperature for Japanese women was 77.36 degrees while it was 71.78 for European and North American males. \n \n Two separate studies have shown that women tend to be more sensitive to temperature and report feeling more uncomfortably hot or uncomfortably cold than men at particular temperatures. \n \n In an opinion piece accompanying the study, researcher Joost van Hoof said the current comfort models for office environments ""add bias to predictions of the energy consumption of buildings."" \n \n [Frigid offices, freezing women, oblivious men: An air-conditioning investigation] \n \n Van Hoof, who researches technology and health at the Fontys University of Applied Sciences, calls for a ""large-scale re-evaluation in field studies"" to address the issue. \n \n ""The effects on energy consumption of increasing the design indoor temperature will become greater over time as climate change leads to increased outdoor temperatures,"" he wrote. \n \n What about those males who might be uncomfortably hot if the thermostat ticks up a few degrees?

At the Washington Post, David Weigel calls it ""the largest donation drive for a third party in history,"" but he's not too optimistic that it will amount to much, especially as plenty of cold water has been thrown on the argument that results ""may have been manipulated or hacked"" in those states.

The page expresses success: ""An election administrator went to jail. We also exposed the profound problems with DRE machines, which helped launch an election integrity movement."" But Weigel notes the vote remained virtually unchanged, with John Kerry picking up fewer than 300 votes; George W. Bush won the state by 118,457 votes. And a recount might not really be much of a recount in Pennsylvania, which mostly uses direct record electronic machines. ""In other races where those machines have been probed ... the recount has consisted of the machine results simply being scanned again,"" Weigel explains."

It has relied heavily on General Motors for any testing and doesn’t have a program that rivals Uber’s Advanced Technologies Group, a department in Uber dedicated to building self-driving technology. \n \n Waymo and Uber are fighting in court over self-driving technology that Waymo says was stolen by a former employee who founded another company that Uber later acquired. Uber says it did not steal or use Waymo secrets. \n \n Talks on the Waymo and Lyft collaboration between began last summer, a person familiar with the situation said. \n \n Lyft raised $600 million at a $7.5 billion valuation last month.', 'SAN FRANCISCO — As the race to bring self-driving vehicles to the public intensifies, two of Silicon Valley’s most prominent players are teaming up. \n \n Waymo, the self-driving car unit that operates under Google’s parent company, has signed a deal with the ride-hailing start-up Lyft, according to two people familiar with the agreement who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.

The Wall Street Journal and New York Times report on a Sunday announcement from the two companies on a sparsely detailed deal to work together to develop products and tech for autonomous vehicles. It's a deal the Times says has ""competitive implications"" for ride-hailing company Uber, which is currently being sued by Waymo, the self-driving unit for Google parent Alphabet, over allegedly stolen trade secrets. A Gartner transportation analyst tells the Journal that the teaming up of Waymo and Lyft, which Reuters notes is the second US ride service by volume, could prove ""very powerful"" and that No. 1 Uber could see this as a ""significant threat."" Both companies have already partnered with others in the industry—Lyft with GM, for example, to test self-driving Chevy Bolts, and Waymo installing its technology in Fiat Chrysler minivans. The Times notes these pairings highlight ""fluid"" relationships and ""shifting"" alliances for competitive advantage in the sector. The Lyft-Waymo partnership would seem to be a symbiotic one, offering a way for Lyft (which hasn't indicated it wants to create its own self-driving technology) to get into that sector, and Waymo to move from test phase to real-world application. Per the Journal, one wrench that could muck up the new partners' plans down the road: Waymo's ambitions, which could eventually push it into incorporating its technology into its own self-driving fleets."

It seems that one group in particular, called Turla, puts comments on her Instagram posts that seem like spam but are actually a kind of hidden code that provide instructions for its malware, reports security company ESET. As Engadget explains, it is clever but complicated, but it doesn't mean that browsing Britney's Instagram will infect your computer. In the example cited by ESET, the since-deleted comment on this photo supposedly came from asmith2155 and read, ""#2 hot make loved to her, uupss #Hot #X."" That comment, however, was actually an encrypted message that, once deciphered, helps infected systems communicate with the Turla mothership. In this case, the actual malware was in a Firefox browser extension masquerading as a security feature. But once in place, that malware needs to communicate with its ""command and control"" server to get instructions on what to do and how to send stolen data. A post at Boing Boing takes it from there: ""Turla moves the C&C server around, then hides the current address of the server in encrypted comments left on Britney Spears's image posts,"" it explains. ""The compromised systems check in with Spears's Instagram whenever they need to know where the C&C server is currently residing."" In the constantly evolving cat-and-mouse game between hackers and security systems, it's a safe bet the strategy already has changed.

221,"['VARNER, Ark. — The State of Arkansas, dismissing criticism that it intended to rush too many prisoners to their deaths too quickly, on Thursday night carried out its first execution in more than a decade. Using a lethal injection drug that has been the subject of sharp constitutional debate, the state plans to execute three more men by the end of the month, before its supply of the chemical expires. \n \n Ledell Lee, who was condemned to death for the murder of Debra Reese more than 20 years ago in a Little Rock suburb, died at 11:56 p.m. Central time at the Cummins Unit, a prison in southeast Arkansas, after the reprieves he had won in federal and state courts were overturned. He received injections of three drugs: midazolam, to render him unconscious; vecuronium bromide, to halt his breathing; and potassium chloride, to stop his heart. \n \n State officials administered the lethal injection at 11:44 p.m., after Mr. Lee, who requested holy communion as his last meal, wordlessly declined to make a final statement. Sean Murphy, a reporter for The Associated Press who witnessed the execution, said Mr. Lee was not visibly uncomfortable as he was put to death. The prisoner, Mr. Murphy said, was not responsive when the authorities performed consciousness checks. \n \n An evening of appeals kept Mr. Lee, 51, alive as his death warrant neared its midnight expiration. The United States Supreme Court, as well as a federal appeals court in St. Louis, issued temporary stays of execution while they considered his legal arguments.

Ledell Lee, a convicted murderer who'd been on death row for more than 20 years, was executed late Thursday after the US Supreme Court decided not to intervene, CNN reports. Prison officials say the 51-year-old inmate, who denied killing 26-year-old Debra Reese in 1993, requested Holy Communion as his last meal and declined to make a final statement. Neil Gorsuch voted with the majority in the Supreme Court's 5-4 decision to allow the execution to proceed, reports the New York Times. Lee, whose death warrant expired at midnight, took 12 minutes to die and was pronounced dead at 11:56pm. Arkansas had planned to execute eight inmates before the end of April, but court decisions spared the first three men and put the execution of a fourth in doubt, the AP reports. The ACLU and the Innocence Project had called for post-conviction DNA testing in the case of Lee, who was also convicted of two rapes and suspected of a second murder. In the attack Lee was executed for, Reese was sexually assaulted before being hit 36 times with a tire-thumping tool that her husband, a truck driver, had given her to protect herself with when he was on the road.

222,"['Former Q host Jian Ghomeshi is taking his fight against the CBC to “binding arbitration” after agreeing to drop a $55-million lawsuit for breach of confidence against the national broadcaster. Ghomeshi’s new civil lawyer, Jonathan Lisus, said Tuesday that he is on the case. He’s with Lax O’Sullivan Scott Lisus LLP. \n \n Jian Ghomeshi when he was host of the CBC radio show Q. His lawyer said Tuesday that his $55-million lawsuit against his former employer has been dismissed. ( CBC / THE CANADIAN PRESS ) \n \n “I represent Mr. Ghomeshi and confirm that the lawsuit between Mr. Ghomeshi and CBC has been resolved on the basis that CBC and Mr. Ghomeshi will address all issues in the lawsuit in binding arbitration in accordance with the collective agreement between them,” Lisus said in an email. Ghomeshi, a former unionized CBC employee, was fired on Sunday, Oct. 26. The CBC said in a statement issued that day that it had received information which “precluded” it from continuing to employ him. Ghomeshi took issue with that decision and sued, saying he had showed CBC personal information in good faith and they had used it against him in what he said amounted to a “breach of confidence.” \n \n Article Continued Below \n \n An ongoing Star investigation has shown that what Ghomeshi showed CBC executives was a video which revealed bruising on the torso of a woman he had dated. He also showed them text messages that referred to a “cracked rib.” A source said Ghomeshi had showed it as an example of how rough sex that causes bruising can be consensual. “Mr. Ghomeshi would not have shared information about his private life with the CBC had he appreciated the CBC would ultimately use the information provided to it to terminate his employment,” Ghomeshi’s former lawyers, Denton LLP, wrote in the claim, which was filed the day after he was fired. Within days of the suit being filed, CBC started a court process to have it dismissed. That process ended with the settlement last Friday. “The parties have reached a settlement; the lawsuit has been withdrawn but it still needs to be formalized through a court order,” CBC media relations chief Chuck Thompson told the Star on Tuesday. As part of the settlement, Ghomeshi must pay $18,000 in legal costs to the CBC. Thompson said he did not know whether that money had yet been paid. \n \n Though Denton LLP signed Friday’s settlement, it appears the firm is no longer acting for Ghomeshi. Neither of the Denton lawyers originally working on the lawsuit returned a Star request for comment. Toronto police said in October that detectives from its sex crimes unit were investigating allegations of sexual violence made against the fired CBC radio personality. Since then, at least three women have spoken with police in relation to the allegations. \n \n Article Continued Below \n \n The Star first reported in October that several women alleged Ghomeshi had punched, slapped or choked them without their consent. Hours after he was fired, Ghomeshi posted a long message on Facebook, in which he said the CBC fired him after it became aware of his interest in what he described as “adventurous forms of sex.” As of Tuesday, both Ghomeshi’s Facebook and Twitter sites had been removed from the Internet. Ghomeshi has previously said he will “meet these allegations directly.” Kevin Donovan can be reached at 416-869-4425 or kdonovan@thestar.ca \n \n Read more about:', 'Former radio host Jian Ghomeshi has agreed to withdraw a $55-million lawsuit against the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in the public broadcaster\'s favour, and to address his October dismissal from the corporation through a union grievance. \n \n ""The civil suit has been dismissed with costs in favour of the CBC,"" Chuck Thompson, head of public affairs for the CBC, said in an interview. \n \n The CBC will be awarded $18,000 in costs, although the suit\'s dismissal must still be formalized with a court order.

In scenes that mesmerized Arabs, the former leader appeared in a court-room cage during his trial on charges that ranged from corruption to complicity in the murder of protesters. \n \n More than a year on, the only legal grounds for Mubarak\'s continued detention rest on another corruption case which his lawyer, Fareed el-Deeb, said would be settled swiftly. \n \n ""All we have left is a simple administrative procedure that should take no more than 48 hours. He should be freed by the end of the week,"" Deeb told Reuters. \n \n Without confirming that Mubarak would be freed, a judicial source said the former leader would spend another two weeks behind bars before judicial authorities made a final decision in the outstanding case against him. \n \n Mubarak, along with his interior minister, was convicted and sentenced to life in prison last year for failing to stop the killing of protesters in the revolt that swept him from power. \n \n He still faces a retrial in that case after appeals from the prosecution and defense, but this would not necessarily require him to stay in jail. Mubarak did not appear at a hearing in the case on Saturday. He was also absent from Monday\'s proceedings. \n \n Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years, is being held at Tora prison on the southern outskirts of Cairo, the facility where senior members of the Muslim Brotherhood have been detained since they were arrested in a crackdown on the organization that began in July. \n \n The military removed President Mohamed Mursi, a senior Brotherhood official, on July 3 after mass protests against his rule. Mursi is in detention at an undisclosed location. \n \n He faces an investigation into accusations stemming from his escape from prison during the anti-Mubarak revolt.

Hosni Mubarak will be released from jail this week, his lawyer tells Reuters, after Egypt's judiciary nullified a corruption charge against the frail 85-year-old. Pending the dismissal of another corruption charge, Mubarak is free to roam the streets. ""He should be freed by the end of the week,"" says the lawyer; a judicial source says that figure is more like two weeks. Though Mubarak faces a retrial for the killing of protesters in 2011, the AP reports he cannot continue to be held in custody because of a two-year limit pending a final verdict. Elsewhere on the ground: Some 25 police officers have been massacred as Islamic militants in the Sinai peninsula—where attacks on security forces have soared since Mohamed Morsi was removed from office last month—ambushed a pair of minibuses carrying the officers and killed them execution-style in broad daylight, the AP reports. The Egyptian government says 36 detainees captured in recent days died after clashes with police, Reuters reports. Officials say the detainees, part of a convoy headed to a prison, rioted and captured a police officer. When tear gas was fired into a police van in an attempt to free the officer, the men suffocated. The Muslim Brotherhood says the incident was murder and the death toll was higher than the government admits. As European Union leaders met to discuss the crisis—and consider halting aid to Egypt—Britain's foreign minister gave a bleak assessment. It will take ""years, maybe decades"" for the trouble to ""play itself out,"" and there is only a limited amount Western powers can do, William Hague says. ""We have to do our best to support democratic institutions"" without picking sides, he tells the BBC."

And the winner by a landslide? Turkey, with 51% of the vote among a list of 10 destinations, including Paris, Italy and Hawaii. \n \n There\'s a reason these lists come out in the fall, when thoughts initally turn toward where to go next. \n \n ""It\'s to get people thinking about looking at a new way to see the world,"" says Frommers.com editorial director David Lytle.

Plus, its inclusion on the list is a reminder that not all of Japan was affected by the earthquake. \n \n Beirut – The city has experienced a renaissance in recent years, as many European travelers know. ""It\'s an urban hotspot full of smartly dressed people who have intelligent conversation,"" Lytle says. \n \n Ghana – Unlike some other African nations, this country has enjoyed long-time stability. As a former center of the slave trade, it\'s also on the heritage trail for African Americans. \n \n London\'s Greenwich neighborhood – Just 20 minutes from Central London, this Thames-side town has undergone a renaissance. And post-Olympics is a good time to visit London, since it\'s bound to be gussied up for the event, with bargains after the party\'s over. \n \n Girona, Spain – This Costa Brava town is popular among Brits, but is largely undiscovered by Americans.

Moreover, it\'s been relatively free of drug-related violence that has touched border towns and the some of the Mexico\'s western reaches. \n \n This year, Frommer\'s added some demographic picks to its list. They are: \n \n Family Destination: Great Smoky Mountains National Park \n \n Cruise Destination: Tromso, Norway \n \n Beach Destination: Hanalei Beach, Kauai, Hawaii \n \n Adventure Destination: Moab, Utah \n \n Food & Drink Destination: Lima, Peru \n \n City Break Destination: Chicago \n \n Endangered Destination: Aysen Region, Chile \n \n Value Destination: Albanian Riviera \n \n Destination to Get Lost: Whitsunday Islands, Australia']",2,"– What part of the globe should you trek to next year?

225,"['BERLIN — A telephone conversation on Friday between Germany ’s chancellor and Greece ’s president became the latest flashpoint in the war of words between Berlin and Athens in the unfolding crisis over Greece’s membership in the euro. \n \n All sides agree that Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke by telephone with President Karolos Papoulias on Friday. A spokesman for the caretaker government, Dimitris Tsiodras, said Ms. Merkel “conveyed to the president thoughts regarding a referendum that could be conducted in parallel to the elections, asking Greeks whether they want to remain in the euro zone.” \n \n A spokesman for Ms. Merkel’s government swiftly denied she had called for a referendum, but not before Greek politicians blasted the alleged proposal. The leftist leader Alexis Tsipras accused her of treating Greece like a “protectorate.” The Socialist Party stated that “referendums fall exclusively within the competencies of the government and the Greek Parliament, not the EU or other member states.” \n \n The Greek conservative leader Antonis Samaras called it “unacceptable” for Germany’s chancellor to issue such a proposal. \n \n The quick condemnation from Greek politicians illustrated unequivocally how raw feelings are in Athens over questions of sovereignty and underscored how the uncertainty over Greece’s future has turned rumors and unconfirmed reports into fuel for even more heated exchanges. The dispute was only the latest fallout from the instability in Greece, which continued to roil markets across Europe. \n \n Top European officials also contradicted each other Friday over planning for the possibility of a Greek exit from the euro. In the meantime a leading ratings agency downgraded 16 Spanish lenders. \n \n With a caretaker government now in place and only four weeks to go until the next round of parliamentary elections in Athens, a broad effort is underway by Germany and its European partners to make it clear to Greek voters exactly what is at stake when they cast ballots on June 17. \n \n Germany finds itself in a delicate position, not wanting to encourage the opposition forces in Athens that failed to form a government after the last election by appearing to interfere in the election, while simultaneously using all possible channels to communicate to Greek voters that their country’s future in the 17-member euro zone depends on electing a government that will uphold its loan agreement with the European Union, European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund. \n \n Comments by a European Union official, who joined businesses and financial firms in signaling that contingency plans are being drafted to deal with the potential fallout of a Greek exit, pointed to how real the readiness to cut Greece loose may be. “Today there are, both within the European Central Bank and the European Commission, services that are working on emergency scenarios in case Greece doesn’t make it,” the European trade commissioner, Karel De Gucht, said in an interview published Friday in the Belgian newspaper De Standaard. \n \n Mr. De Gucht’s comments prompted a rare public rebuke from a colleague, illustrating how the raw nerves are not just in Athens over the uncertainty surrounding Greece, which saw its credit rating downgraded further into junk territory by Fitch Ratings late Thursday, on concern over a lack of public and political support for the country’s bailout. \n \n “Karel De Gucht is responsible for trade. I am responsible for financial and economic affairs and relations with the E.C.B.,” the vice president of the European Union Commission, Olli Rehn, said during an event in London. “We are not working on the scenario of a Greek exit. We are working on the basis of a scenario of Greece staying in.” \n \n European Union offices in Brussels were closed Friday and a spokesman for Mr. De Gucht could not be immediately reached for comment. \n \n While continued support for Athens remains the official line, many influential people in Germany would like to see Greece driven from the euro zone, some as an example to other countries and others for what they say is its own good chance to recover. If Syriza, the party that opposes the terms of Greece’s current bailout plan, were to come out ahead in the next election and overplays its hand, it could find itself with an invitation to leave. \n \n Shares in Spanish banks fell at the opening of trading, Reuters reported, after the ratings agency Moody’s downgraded 16 lenders late Thursday, citing a weak economy and the government’s reduced ability to support troubled lenders.', 'In this picture provided by the German Government\'s Press Office, US President Barack Obama, fourth right, and clockwise: British Prime Minister David Cameron, the Russian Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev... (Associated Press) \n \n The United States and other members of the Group of Eight industrial nations agree that Europe\'s financial crisis must be addressed with a mix of growth and austerity measures, President Barack Obama said Saturday as leaders gathered for a discussion that also will cover world concerns about ups and downs in oil prices. \n \n ""All of us are absolutely committed to making sure that growth and stability and fiscal consolidation are part of an overall package,"" Obama said as he and other leaders gathered in shirt sleeves in a rustic cabin at this wooded presidential retreat in Maryland. \n \n Obama was referring to the debt crises in Greece and Spain, primarily, although he was not specific in brief remarks to reporters. \n \n Leaders of the United States, Germany, France, Canada, Italy, Britain, Russia, and Japan are trying to figure out how to tame Europe\'s debt crisis while also increasing the demand for goods and spurring job growth. \n \n Obama\'s argument for additional stimulus measures alongside belt-tightening is primarily aimed at Germany, the strongest member of the union of European countries that uses the common Euro currency, although Obama did not say so. German Chancellor Angela Merkel was seated a few places away from Obama at a small round table. \n \n Leaders of the world\'s economic powers say Germany should balance its push for European fiscal austerity with doses of stimulus spending to avoid a financial calamity with global repercussions. \n \n In talks Saturday, the leaders were looking to build consensus even though a decisive plan of action seemed out of reach for now. \n \n ""We\'ll also be talking about uncertainty in the energy markets and how to resolve some of those issues,"" Obama said at the start of discussions on the global economy. \n \n Obama chose the secluded Camp David setting in part to give leaders a chance for a freewheeling discussion out of sight of most media and far from the raucous protests that have accompanied previous meetings of the G-8. \n \n The G-8 session sets the stage for a far more consequential European summit in Brussels next week where the countries that share the euro as their currency hope to come together on specific steps to fight rising debt while spurring a recovery. \n \n The Camp David gathering opened with a Friday evening discussion focused on global trouble spots Iran and Syria. Obama said the session also touched on North Korea\'s aggression and hopeful signs of democratic change in Myanmar. \n \n ""We are unified on our approach to Iran,"" and hopeful of progress ahead of a diplomatic meeting with Iran next week, Obama said Saturday. \n \n Iran may have a peaceful nuclear energy program but misuse of that program for a nuclear weapon is unacceptable, Obama said. Ever-tighter economic sanctions cannot be loosened while the world encourages Iran to rein in its program, Obama said. \n \n ""All of us are firmly committed to continuing with the approach of sanctions and pressure in combination with diplomatic discussions,"" Obama said. ""And our hope is that we can resolve this issue in a peaceful fashion that respects Iran\'s sovereignty and its rights in the international community, but also recognizes its responsibilities."" \n \n On Syria, Obama said the group supports a United Nations cease-fire plan that has yet to be honored in full. He said a statement to be issued at the close of the G-8 summit will reflect that support for the plan brokered by envoy Kofi Annan, but also say that the plan has not taken hold fast enough. \n \n Most of the leaders are part of overlapping international coalitions formed to address the Iranian nuclear problem and the newer crisis in Syria, where an estimated 9,000 people have died in more than a year of violence that arose from the pro-democracy Arab uprisings. \n \n Faced with implacable Russian opposition to significant new United Nations punishments on the Syrian regime, U.S. officials are trying to get consensus among other allies about ways to promote the ouster of Syrian President Bashar Assad. \n \n ""We all believe that a peaceful resolution and political transition in Syria is preferable,"" Obama said Saturday. \n \n A senior U.S. official said one goal of the closed-door discussions at Camp David was to impress on Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev that other nations that share Russia\'s usual role at the forefront of international diplomacy are seeking ways to address the Syria debacle without Russian help. \n \n In what has been widely viewed as a snub, Russian President Vladimir Putin is skipping the G-8 summit. He sent Medvedev in his place. \n \n Later Saturday the leaders were returning to foreign affairs topics with discussion of Afghanistan and the Middle East. \n \n Obama established the tone for the G-8 on Friday after meeting with just-elected French President Francois Hollande, when he said the aim of the summit was to promote both fiscal consolidation and a ""strong growth agenda."" \n \n The two leaders, Obama said ""agree that this is an issue of extraordinary importance not only to the people of Europe but also to the world economy."" \n \n Hollande, elected May 6 as France\'s first Socialist president since 1995, advocates more spending to jolt the economy. His predecessor Nicolas Sarkozy partnered with Merkel in leading the eurozone to adopt a raft of austerity measures in response to the continent\'s fiscal problems. \n \n In a hint of the pressures facing the leaders, when Obama greeted Merkel and asked her how she was doing, the German leader only shrugged. \n \n ""Well, you have a few things on your mind,"" Obama said. \n \n A central economic topic, though hardly the only one confronting Europe, is the fate of Greece. That country is facing the most acute financial crisis of the eurozone and is set to hold elections June 17 after a previous vote May 6 resulted in a political deadlock. At issue is whether Greece abandons the euro to escape austerity measures. \n \n Hollande, after meeting with Obama at the White House, said, ""We share the same views, the fact that Greece must stay in the eurozone and that all of us must do what we can to that effect."" \n \n For Obama, Europe\'s fate is critical to his own political survival. An economic recession that spreads to the U.S. could damage an already slow recovery and boost the argument by his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, that the United States economy needs new leadership. \n \n There is a get-acquainted aspect to the session as well. \n \n The Camp David gathering, the largest collection of foreign leaders ever at the presidential retreat, is the first G-8 meeting for Hollande, for Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti and for Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writer Jamey Keaton contributed to this report.', 'CAMP DAVID, Md.—U.S. President Barack Obama on Saturday opened the first full day of an international summit taking place amid signs of economic slippage by saying that world leaders were committed to growth and stability. \n \n But deep uncertainty greeted leaders of the world\'s eight richest economies as they gathered here to discuss how to deal with the European debt crisis and fresh concerns that it could spark widespread financial turmoil. \n \n Mr. Obama, who welcomed leaders Friday night at this secluded presidential retreat for the start of the Group of Eight summit, intends to urge his counterparts, particularly German Chancellor Angela Merkel, to focus less on austerity and more on finding ways to stimulate economic growth. \n \n In his first formal comments Saturday morning, he didn\'t outline specific plans or goals for the talks. \n \n ""All of us are absolutely committed to making sure that growth and stability and fiscal consolidation are part of an overall package,"" he said, sitting at a wooden table with other leaders beside him in a lodge. \n \n G-8 Leaders Meet Photos View Slideshow European Pressphoto Agency G-8 leaders, from left, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda, Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti, Canada\'s Premier Stephen Harper, new French President Francois Hollande, U.S. President Barack Obama, British Prime Minister David Cameron, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, European Council president Herman van Rompuy and EU Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso focused on Iran, North Korea, Burma and Syria during the Friday night dinner. \n \n The threat of Greece exiting the euro-zone is heightening worry about economic stability in Europe and the potential for a return to global financial crisis. The issue is expected to dominate the conversations among G-8 leaders, whose first hourlong working session Saturday morning was to focus on the global economy. \n \n For Mr. Obama, who can do little more than nudge European leaders toward a solution, an economic crisis in Europe that spreads to the U.S. could be devastating to his re-election campaign. The U.S. economy is closely linked to Europe, and Americans consistently cite economic issues as their top concern in November\'s presidential election. \n \n Mrs. Merkel, Europe\'s chief driver of austerity, is a focus for Mr. Obama this weekend. White House officials have said he intends to push her to ease her strict preference for budget cutting as more of Europe risks falling into recession. \n \n Mrs. Merkel simply shrugged and smiled when Mr. Obama asked her how she has been as he greeted her at Camp David for dinner Friday night. \n \n ""Well, you have a few things on your mind,"" Mr. Obama told her. \n \n The president has some allies in his preferred approach to the European crisis. After his first meeting with new French President François Hollande at the White House Friday morning, Mr. Obama said the two leaders are in general agreement on prioritizing measures to boost economic growth over austerity. Mr. Hollande, like Mr. Obama, prefers implementing budget cuts over a longer period of time than other leaders, such as Mrs. Merkel, have wanted. \n \n Enlarge Image Close European Pressphoto Agency Leaders of the world\'s eight richest economies gathered in Camp David Saturday. \n \n On Friday Mr. Obama said G-8 leaders, including British Prime Minister David Cameron, Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda of Japan and Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti, will discuss ""how we can manage a responsible approach to fiscal consolidation that is coupled with a strong growth agenda."" \n \n ""Hopefully we\'ll get some stuff done,"" Mr. Obama told Mr. Monti as he arrived for dinner Friday night. \n \n The president made clear in his comments Saturday that the leaders would address other issues, including Iran, Syria, Afghanistan, North Korea and the role of women in global society. \n \n Mr. Obama said that the leaders ""are unified on our approach to Iran."" He said all agree Iran has the right to a peaceful nuclear program but said that atomic weapons are unacceptable. \n \n Still, Mr. Obama said that he and the other G-8 leaders ""are hopeful"" about international negotiations with Iran next week in Baghdad, but will maintain sanctions and other forms of pressure. \n \n ""And our hope is that we can resolve this issue in a peaceful fashion that respects Iran\'s sovereignty and its rights in the international community, but also recognizes its responsibilities."" \n \n On Syria, he said world leaders support a peace plan put forward by United Nations envoy Kofi Annan but are impatient for compliance by Damascus. \n \n He also struck a downbeat tone on North Korea, saying that Pyongyang won\'t be able to join the world community if it continues violating its international obligations, which he said all leaders agree on. \n \n This weekend\'s G-8 summit is the largest-ever gathering of world leaders at Camp David. The gathering comes ahead of a summit of European leaders next week, in which they are expected to focus on growth-boosting measures to complement the budget accord European officials have developed in recent months. \n \n Friday\'s dinner focused on several of the same issues Mr. Obama mentioned, including Iran, North Korea, Burma and Syria. A senior administration official said there is a sense of urgency surrounding next week\'s Baghdad talks. \n \n Many G-8 leaders will leave for Chicago Saturday night to attend a meeting of North Atlantic Treaty Organization members. \n \n Afghanistan will be the main focus of that two-day summit. \n \n Write to Carol E.

More precisely: Whether Obama can persuade Germany's Angela Merkel to ease up on her austerity strategy and mix in some stimulus, reports AP. If their greeting last night is any indication, some friction might already be apparent: When Obama asked how her how she has been, Merkel shrugged instead of responding, notes the Wall Street Journal. ""Well, you have a few things on your mind,"" Obama said. Bloomberg says the encounter ""underscores the tension surrounding the meeting,"" though not all the wire services were reading that much into it. One of the things she might have had on her mind, however, is a phone call with Greece's president yesterday in which Merkel reportedly pushed to have Greeks vote on whether they wanted to stay in the euro zone, reports the New York Times. Leftist leader Alexis Tsipras later criticized her for overstepping her bounds and treating Greece like a ""protectorate."""

Nuggent in a 2006 Chevrolet Aveo, and after inspecting the vehicle, they found air-horn equipment inside his car. \n \n Multiple neighbors responded to the scene and initiated a citizen’s arrest of Nuggent. \n \n Nuggent was taken into custody and is being charged with suspicion of disturbing the peace.

Vincent Martinez. \n \n In the back of the car, officers found an air tank with hoses connected to a device near the car’s gas pedal, Martinez said. When an officer tried the car’s horn, the sound of “a big truck or train” blasted from the diminutive hatchback, he said. \n \n The driver, identified as John W. Nuggent, admitted he was the man who for the last six weeks had been driving down the street in the middle of the night waking up residents, Martinez said. The target of Nuggent’s nuisance was a resident on the street with whom he had some sort of dispute, Martinez said. \n \n “I’ve been an officer for over 27 years and I don’t know if I’ve ever seen someone retaliate using an air horn,” Martinez said with a chuckle. “But people find very creative ways at getting at other people.” \n \n According to police, one of the residents who reported the horn told dispatchers on the phone Sunday that they’d actually seen the driver before, and that resident was able to positively identify Nuggent as the suspect. \n \n Nuggent was arrested on suspicion of disturbing the peace. \n \n “He’s been doing this for weeks, and we’ve been chasing him for weeks —– but we got him,” Lt.

On its Facebook page, the El Segundo Police Department noted that at around 4am Sunday, officers heard an ""extremely loud air-horn being actuated"" and followed the sound to a 2006 Chevy Aveo driving around, which they pulled over. Inside: driver John Nuggent and air horn equipment, which Nuggent admitted to using to stir residents out of sleep. Several locals emerged from their homes and made a citizen's arrest against Nuggent—an important fact, the San Diego Union-Tribune notes, with police explaining that officers can't be victims of ""disturbing the peace."" Had the residents not come out, the cops would only have been able to give Nuggent a slap on the wrist for a traffic infraction; now the charge gets prosecutable misdemeanor status, with a maximum of 90 days in jail, a $400 fine, or both if he's found guilty. Sgt. Vincent Martinez tells the Times the blare fest was apparently Nuggent's way of retaliating against someone in the area with whom he had a beef.

227,"['LOS ANGELES — People whose brains registered a stronger response to sexual cues were likely to have more sexual partners than those whose brains showed a reduced response, a researcher at UCLA’s Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior said today. \n \n “These are the first data we know of that link brain responses to actual sexual risk behaviors,” said Nicole Prause, who directs UCLA’s Sexual Psychophysiology and Affective Neuroscience Laboratory. \n \n The 40 men and 22 women — ranging in age from 18 to 40 — participating in the study were asked how many sexual partners they had in the past year. They also were shown 225 images that included non-sexual images and those that ranged from mildly sexual to explicitly sexual. \n \n Researchers used an electroencephalogram, or EEG, to gauge electrical activity in the brains of study participants. The scientists focused on a specific activity in the brain called late positive potential, which reacts to images based on emotional intensity. \n \n “The researchers found that participants who reported having had a higher number of sexual partners in the previous year exhibited similar late positive potential responses to both the graphic and less-graphic sexual images,” according to a UCLA statement. \n \n “Those who reported having had fewer intercourse partners in the previous year ... showed reduced late positive potential responses to the less explicit sexual images and greater response to the more graphic images.” \n \n Said Prause: “If your brain responds very strongly even to very tame pictures of sex, then you seem to be easily sexually excited in the real world, too,” \n \n She said that “if we show very explicit sex pictures, eventually everyone’s brain responds strongly. It is those weaker images, just hinting at sex, that show the difference.” \n \n Prause said the research could aid in the development of strategies for reducing risky sexual behavior, because those with stronger responses to subtle sexual cues may be more motivated to seek sex and more likely to engage in risky behaviors. \n \n The study is published in the current issue of Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience.', 'Four people died Wednesday morning in a crash in Blythe (map) involving a big rig and a tour bus that was traveling from El Paso, Texas, to Los Angeles, shutting down the freeway in both directions for more than 12 hours, authorities said. \n \n The incident began when a semi-truck carrying steel pipes and traveling eastbound on the 10 Freeway jackknifed about 2:15 a.m., spilling the pipes onto the eastbound and westbound lanes, said Terri Kasinga, spokeswoman for Caltrans. \n \n A bus that was traveling westbound on the freeway overturned after swerving to avoid the debris, and may have struck some of the pipes, Kasinga said. The bus, which was carrying 32 passengers, came to a stop about 40 to 50 feet from the roadway’s shoulder. \n \n Several people were injured, some critically, according to authorities. Some of the bus passengers who were unhurt were transported from the scene. \n \n The bus was operated by El-Paso Los Angeles Limousine Express Inc., according to the CHP. Federal records indicate that the transportation company has had no significant safety violations or vehicle maintenance issues in at least the last two years, The Times reported. \n \n The 10 Freeway was shut down in both directions, said Officer Jason Girard, spokesman for the California Highway Patrol. Traffic in the area was being rerouted onto frontage roads near the freeway, he said. \n \n One eastbound lane reopened by about 3:30 p.m., Caltrans said on Twitter. It was not known when other eastbound lanes or any westbound lanes would reopen, the agency said, adding that it was waiting for CHP. \n \n The following detours were in effect, according to the agency: \n \n Eastbound I-10: Use State Route 177 at Desert Center to State Route 62 and U.S. Route 95 to connect back to the 10 Freeway. \n \n Westbound I-10: Use exit No. 1 just west of the state line.

Sexual orientation is an innate characteristic of the human condition that cannot be changed, it is not a behavior, it is not a disease, and it is not synonymous with promiscuity as argued by Cardinal Aponte Martinez.” \n \n Last month, Pastor Wanda Rolon, an influential social conservative in Puerto Rico, said Martin was leading people to “hell.”"", ""Truly unbelievable, and most importantly, WRONG. \n \n Now that Ricky Martin has come out as a proud gay man, Cardinal Luis Aponte Martinez of San Juan Puerto Rico, has condemned the pop star and begged him to stop 'promoting' his homosexuality - all for the sake of his children! \n \n He said: \n \n “Personally, I admire Ricky for the great artistic gifts the Lord has endowed him, but please, for the love of his children, for whom I imagine he wants the best, try to set an example to our youth of the great values we all share, besides sex. The Roman Catholic church does not reject the homosexual [but] their immoral actions and behaviors, and trying to promote homosexuality or sexual promiscuity among our youth, indeed, is immoral regardless of where it comes from.” \n \n Ugh. We wonder if he even realizes how deeply hurtful those comments must be. \n \n Homosexuality and promiscuity DO NOT come hand in hand, and the fact that he would even suggest that him being a brave, open man unafraid to be honest about sexual preference is damaging to his CHILDREN, whom we're sure he would put everything aside in order to protect, is just shameful. \n \n If anything, he's teaching his kids to accept and love all parts of yourself, which is something we thought that Roman Catholic Church ALSO teaches! \n \n We think gay rights activist Pedro Julio Serrano said it best when he responded to the criticism with the following: \n \n “Homophobia disguised as religion and under the pretext of freedom of speech is still homophobia and it kills. Enough of wanting to impose a moral vision of human sexuality. Sexual orientation is an innate characteristic of the human condition that cannot be changed, it is not a behavior, it is not a disease, and it is not synonymous with promiscuity as argued by Cardinal Aponte Martinez.” \n \n Well said! \n \n The Cardinal should be ASHAMED of himself, and we hope he seriously re-evaluates the kind of message he's trying to promote to families who may not have a 'traditional' background! \n \n And, as for Ricky, we hope that he continues to do exactly what he's doing, because he is, and continues to be, an inspiration for many! \n \n [Image via WENN.] \n \n Tags: activist, cardinal luis aponte martinez, children, condemn, criticize, deplorable, equal rights, gay rights, lifestyle, pedro julio serrano, roman catholic church, san juan, sexuality, shameful""]",2,"– Cardinal Luis Aponte Martinez of San Juan, Puerto Rico, is a fan of Ricky Martin's ""artistic gifts,"" but he sure wishes the singer would stop promoting homosexuality.

While grumbling that the eurozone had much more serious problems to worry about — such as a possible Greek exit — Brussels acquiesced and melted them down. \n \n But this week Belgium resorted to a cunning ruse de guerre to outflank the French: it minted €2.50 and €10 coins which can only be used on its own territory. \n \n “We had a little problem with our French neighbours, for whom the battle seems to still be very sensitive today. We judged that it wouldn’t be worth having a diplomatic incident over,” Johan Van Overtveldt, Belgium’s finance minister told RTL television, explaining the decision to produce the novel denominations. \n \n French sensitivities over a battle that changed the course of European history are also evident in the line-up of guests at events to mark the bicentenary, which will take place from June 18. While the Belgians, Dutch and British are sending members of their royal families, France has instead opted for a “high representative”. \n \n The Belgian coins are technically legal tender, but their high pricetag means they are essentially collectors’ items. The €2.5 coins cost €6 each, and the €10 one €42. While shops would be under no obligation to accept them, Belgium’s Royal Mint said that they could always be exchanged at face value at the central bank. \n \n The €2.5 coin shows the Lion’s Mound, the most distinctive landmark on the battlefield south of Brussels, with an illustration of battle formations below. \n \n We had a little problem with our French neighbours, for whom the battle seems to still be very sensitive today. - Johan Van Overtveldt, Belgian finance minister \n \n The €10 sports a silhouette of Napoleon and two key scenes from the battle: the Duke of Wellington receiving news that relief from the Prussian army was on its way, and William, Prince of Orange, being wounded in the shoulder. \n \n Apart from the historic significance, Belgium is using the interest in Waterloo to generate tourism in French-speaking Wallonia, which currently attracts only a third of the tourists as Dutch-speaking Flanders, famous for Bruges and for its first world war battlefields.', 'These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

But the Office of Special Counsel, which enforces the Hatch Act, said Castro ""impermissibly mixed his personal political views with official government agency business."" \n \n Castro admitted the error. \n \n ""At the time, I believed that this disclaimer was what was required by the Hatch Act. However, your analysis provides that it was not sufficient,"" Castro said in a response to the Office of Special Counsel.

Violations of the Hatch Act can lead to a civil fine of as much as $1,000, but two legal experts with experience with the statute said they could not recall a case with facts similar to Castro's that was resolved with anything more dramatic than a reprimand. \n \n Still, the incident is another reminder that Castro is still a relative political newcomer and lacks the savvy and expertise of some others on Clinton’s short list.

Clinton is the ""most experienced, thoughtful, and prepared candidate for president that we have this year,"" Castro said during the interview, which was arranged through his office, involved discussion of HUD policies, and took place in front of the HUD seal. He told Couric that Clinton had a ""positive vision"" for the country and went on to describe Donald Trump as not prepared to be president. Before praising Clinton, Castro told Couric he was ""taking off my HUD hat for a second and just speaking individually,"" but he still ""impermissibly mixed his personal political views with official government agency business,"" according to the OSC report, which explains that federal employees are ""permitted to make partisan remarks when speaking in their personal capacity, but not when using their official title or when speaking about agency business."" Castro has admitted he goofed, and while he could be fined up to $1,000, he's highly unlikely to receive anything more than a reprimand for the Hatch Act violation.

237,"['Shortly after the combative presidential debate on Tuesday, Mitt Romney ’s campaign began running a striking new commercial that uses a former Obama supporter to contest the notion that Mr. Romney’s positions on abortion and contraception are “extreme.” \n \n Before dawn Wednesday, Democrats had taken to Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and television to ridicule Mr. Romney’s debate-night statement that he had collected “binders full of women” when he was a new governor in Massachusetts seeking “qualified” female appointees for his administration. \n \n And on the campaign trail and on the air, the candidates and their allies argued intensely all day over who would do more to help women. At the same time, the topic of whether the heated encounter Tuesday night had alienated the very female voters they were seeking to connect with became fodder for cable TV discussions. \n \n The level of intensity left little doubt that the election was coming down not only to a state-by-state fight for territory, but also to one for the allegiance of vital demographic groups, chief among them undecided women. \n \n Speaking in Mount Vernon, Iowa, Mr. Obama made his own reference to Mr. Romney’s “binders” comment, saying that there were enough talented women in the country that finding them required no special search. \n \n Mr. Romney, at a campaign rally in Chesapeake, Va., hit back. “This president has failed America’s women,” he said. “They’ve suffered in terms of getting jobs. They’ve suffered in terms of falling into poverty.” \n \n For Mr. Romney, the imperative, with less than three weeks until Election Day, is cutting into what has been Mr. Obama’s sizable lead among women. \n \n Their goal, Romney aides said, is to keep Mr. Obama’s lead among women, which in many polls has been in double digits, down to the low single digits. \n \n Key to that effort, they said, is changing the perception among undecided women that Mr. Romney holds very conservative positions on social issues, after a Republican primary campaign in which Mr. Romney was under constant pressure from the right. \n \n Through polling and focus groups, the Romney campaign has found that while undecided women said they were concerned primarily about economic issues, they were troubled by whether Mr. Romney’s positions on issues like abortion and contraception were too unyielding. \n \n Mr. Romney, who while running for governor in 2002 said he would govern as a supporter of abortion rights but subsequently came to shift his position, now opposes abortion except in cases of rape and incest. On access to contraception, Mr. Romney has emphasized his opposition to Obama administration policies that he says pressure religious employers to provide health insurance that covers contraception. \n \n He has not sought to limit access to contraception but has voiced support for a provision that would give other employers the right to deny coverage for contraception on moral grounds. \n \n Mr. Romney and his team have tried to address these concerns. They said perceptions of Mr. Romney’s positions had been unfairly shaped by Mr. Obama’s advertising, including ads focused on abortion rights. \n \n According to data from Kantar Media/CMAG, the Obama campaign and Democratic groups have run commercials relating to abortion about 30,000 times since July 2 — about 10 percent of their ads — including one that falsely claimed Mr. Romney’s opposition to abortion extended to cases of rape and incest. \n \n Mr. Romney’s latest television ad answering that barrage potentially creates the risk that it will remind voters of how Mr. Romney has altered his position on abortion over the course of his political career. \n \n Romney campaign strategists said they decided to release the ad this week because they believe it will have maximum impact as late-deciding voters tune in. \n \n The ad was produced within the last two weeks, after strategists identified Sara Minto of Ohio, one of their volunteers, as a plausible “ideal everywoman.”', 'UPDATED: The suspect is now in custody. See latest story here. \n \n ST. LOUIS • Two young children who remained with their father after he allegedly shot their baby sibling to death Tuesday were later found safe — but he remained on the run, police said. \n \n The 8-month-old baby boy was killed by his father, Diata R. Crockett, about 2 p.m. Tuesday in a domestic dispute, St. Louis police said. Crockett, 34, was reported to be “armed and dangerous.” \n \n The two children who remained in the car with Crockett after the shooting were dropped off Tuesday afternoon at the home of one of his relatives in Bellefontaine Neighbors, police said. They are Blaze Crockett, 3, and Ryker Crockett, 2. \n \n Police were trying to determine whether Diata Crockett or someone else left them there. \n \n On Tuesday evening, police recovered the rented Hyundai Sonata that Crockett had been driving. It was found parked in the 2900 block of Caddiefield Road at the Canfield Green apartments in Ferguson. There did not appear to be a manhunt for Crockett there. Officers left once the car was towed. \n \n Police Chief Sam Dotson said that Crockett has threatened suicide and violence against his family in the past. \n \n At a press conference at police headquarters, Dotson told reporters that Crockett forced his wife at gunpoint into a rental car in Bellefontaine Neighbors with Blaze and Ryker in the backseat and the infant, Reign Crockett, in his mother’s arms. The couple had six children in all. \n \n Then, at a stop sign near Riverview Boulevard and Interstate 270, the children’s mother “saw an opportunity to escape” and jumped out of the vehicle, Dotson said. \n \n Crockett then fired toward his wife, but fatally struck the infant instead, the chief said. The mother flagged down another driver, who took her and the baby to a hospital, Dotson said. They called authorities, and during an 11-minute 911 call, the driver said, “He’s trying to run us off the road.” \n \n They reached Christian Hospital, at 11133 Dunn Road in north St. Louis County, where the baby was pronounced dead. \n \n Though Crockett reportedly followed them there, police had not found any surveillance video showing his vehicle near the hospital, Dotson said. \n \n Authorities issued a national AMBER Alert for a rented black 2014 Hyundai Sonata being driven by Crockett. He was last seen wearing a lime green shirt and green pants. CrimeStoppers is offering up to a $5,000 reward in the case. \n \n “This is one of those days where it’s difficult to be a police officer,” Dotson said at the beginning of the press conference. “When there’s violence that involves children, that’s always difficult, and it makes me sometimes question humanity.” \n \n Dotson used the press conference as an opportunity to slight the state’s “lax gun laws,” and the court system. \n \n “I continue to see situations in St. Louis where our officers risk their lives to go out and do their job every day to arrest people with guns, and we don’t see outcomes that make our community any safer,” he said. \n \n Criminal record \n \n Crockett pleaded guilty in 2006 of first-degree burglary, third-degree assault and property damage charges from August 2003 in St. Louis, and completed a year of probation. \n \n He also pleaded guilty in 2011 to drug-related charges, unlawful use of a weapon, resisting arrest and forgery after St. Louis County police arrested him in September 2010. He was sentenced to five years in prison starting in May 2011. \n \n According to court documents, a county officer saw Crockett put two large clear plastic bags containing about 400 grams of marijuana under the seat of the car. When officers tried to arrest him, he ran, and police had to chase him, according to the documents. \n \n Officers found a loaded 9mm pistol in his waistband when he was arrested, and Crockett admitted he was a fugitive and had a probation warrant out for his arrest, according to the documents. \n \n He signed another person’s name to the arrest sheet and gave police a false name, and admitted to police that he intended to sell the marijuana, according to the documents. \n \n Kristen Taketa of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.', 'Since the late ’80s, Actors’ Equity has recognized the Los Angeles 99-Seat Theater Agreement, which allows members to showcase their work for negligible stipends. Now, the union is proposing to eliminate the agreement in favor of two new internal membership rules and one new agreement. \n \n The new agreement, if enacted as it is currently proposed, would require actors be paid minimum wage ($9 an hour in L.A. County) for rehearsal and performances, with no contributions to pension or health insurance. To many in the L.A. theater community, the proposal represents a threat to the city’s vibrant intimate-theater scene. \n \n Equity members in L.A. County can vote today through April 17 on the proposal (i.e., an “advisory referendum”). The outcome of the vote will be taken into account when Equity’s National Council meets April 21 to deliberate over the proposal and determine the final form of the new arrangement. \n \n NOAH WYLE, IN HIS OWN WORDS: \n \n In 17 years serving as artistic producer of Hollywood’s Blank Theatre Company, I’ve learned two things about running a small theater. \n \n The first is that you will spend most of your time engaged in an exhausting, bare-knuckled fight for survival. The second is that it’s worth it. \n \n The Blank operates a 49-seat black box on that stretch of Santa Monica Boulevard recently designated “Hollywood Theatre Row” by the Los Angeles City Council. We’re a membership company, dedicated to providing a home for artists and to the development of new works for the American stage. \n \n So why don’t we pay actors minimum wage for rehearsal hours? New works. 49 seats. The perfect recipe for a non-profit enterprise. All of our economics begin at that chokepoint: 49 seats x 4 shows a week = ticket sales alone won’t get us there. Keeping our doors open requires constant fundraising, grant writing and, above all, volunteerism. \n \n Call it “love of the craft,” esprit de corps or old-fashioned apprenticeship, we’ve survived because of a consensus of understanding: We are here to make theater, not money; that’s what TV and movies are for. Intimate theaters show we value you, the actor, by inviting you to create something new with us. You’re compensated by having a place to nurture your talent, showcase your abilities, satisfy your creativity and play roles the commercial entertainment machine would never let you play. \n \n This proposed amendment is the reignition of an old debate, and it’s not “How do we monetize art?” or “How do we compensate artists?” From our perspective, the pertinent question looks to be: How can Actors’ Equity secure more contract weeks in a town where the 99-Seat Plan is so widely used? \n \n The apparent strategy, with this proposal, is to force the closure of small theaters in the hope that they’ll consolidate into mid-sized theaters, thus generating more full Equity contracts. \n \n As a proud member of Equity, I understand the issue and applaud the intention, however misguided. As a small theater producer, however, I am extremely frustrated. \n \n Intimate theater producers have repeatedly proposed sitting down to negotiate a compromise with Equity before and after this proposal was announced, but Equity has not allowed such dialogue to occur. \n \n We are not anti-union, nor are we anti-minimum wage, but Equity’s failure to converse with us and/or articulate the complexity of the issue to its members has forced us to engage in a media campaign to give full context to the debate. \n \n Small theater provides opportunities for actors and directors to stretch and hone their skills. We offer an intimate, affordable theatrical experience to local audiences, play a vital role in the development of new work and are important economic stimulators for the entire County of Los Angeles. \n \n The current 99-Seat Plan may be flawed, but you do not rid your home of termites by setting fire to it. \n \n I will be voting NO on the referendum to eliminate the Los Angeles 99-Seat Plan. \n \n — NOAH WYLE \n \n (The views expressed by Wyle are his own and do not represent those of Variety.) \n \n See More:Guest Column: Charlayne Woodard Urges ‘Yes’ Vote on 99-Seat Theater Plan \n \n \n \n Noah Wyle, pictured below in the Blank’s production of “Lobster Alice”']",3,"– Women have surged to the forefront of the presidential race in the wake of Tuesday's debate, with both candidates furiously courting the demographic. Both candidates talked about women on the campaign trail—as did their surrogates—and the Romney campaign released a new ad shedding a more moderate light on his abortion stance. Elsewhere on the trail: ""What I can't understand is how (Romney) has gotten in this sort of 1950s time warp in terms of women,"" Joe Biden told a crowd in Colorado, referring to Romney's debate performance, in which he said women workers often had to rush home to make dinner for their kids, CNN reports, though it notes that Romney's comments scored well with women on the network's dial test. Romney and his surrogates, meanwhile, tried to court women by focusing on the economy. ""The No. 1 issue with women is jobs,"" said Rep. Marsha Blackburn. But the LA Times points out that polls in 12 swing states show abortion is the No. 1 issue with women, ranking it twice as important as jobs. Romney strategists tell the New York Times that their focus groups showed the same thing, which is why they've released a new ad in which a woman discovers that Romney ""doesn't oppose contraception at all"" and supports abortion in cases of rape, incest, and when the health of the mother is at stake. ""This issue is important to me, but I'm more concerned about the debt our children could be left with,"" she says. Meanwhile, the fallout from Romney's ""binders"" comment continues. The Boston Globe reported that during Romney's Bain tenure, the firm didn't have a single female partner—though the Washington Post notes that Meg Whitman did get her start there as a consultant."

His political instincts are phenomenal. He did something that no one could have imagined he'd be able to accomplish,” the first daughter told Fox News’s “Fox & Friends” in response to a question about her father’s oft-controversial Twitter habit. “I feel blessed just being part of the ride from day one and before.

Ted Cruz asked a judge in Chicago on Friday to dismiss a complaint by an Illinois voter who is challenging Ted Cruz\'s eligibility to run for president, because he was born in Canada. (Photo: Charles Dharapak, AP) \n \n CHICAGO — An attorney for the Ted Cruz campaign asked a Cook County judge Friday to dismiss an Illinois man\'s lawsuit challenging the Texas senator\'s eligibility to run for president, citing that the Republican hopeful wasn\'t properly served with the complaint. \n \n Lawrence Joyce, an Illinois voter and Ben Carson supporter, brought his complaint earlier this month to the Illinois State Board of Elections, which dismissed it. \n \n Now, he is appealing the case with the Cook County Circuit Court in Chicago, asking it to rule Cruz ineligible to run in next month\'s GOP primary in Illinois. Joyce challenges whether the senator from Texas meets the criteria to serve as president because he was born in Canada. \n \n Sharee Langenstein, an attorney for Cruz, said in court Friday it is ""very, very clear"" the Cook County court doesn\'t have jurisdiction to hear the case because state law stipulates the candidate be served with the complaint. Joyce, a pharmacist and attorney from Poplar Grove, Ill., failed to serve Cruz, whose home address is listed in his petition to be placed on the state\'s ballot, Langenstein said. \n \n The issue of whether Cruz is a ""natural-born"" citizen has been raised by others, including rival GOP presidential contender Donald Trump, who has threatened to file a lawsuit on the issue. Cruz maintains he meets the criteria because his mother is American-born. \n \n Judge Maureen Ward Kirby set a March 1 court date to hear arguments on the motion to dismiss. Joyce, who works the midnight shift at a hospital pharmacy, told the judge he wasn\'t available for arguments before then because of work commitments. The Illinois primary is March 15 and early voting has already begun. \n \n Despite the close timing, Joyce said it is worth letting his complaint play out. \n \n ""The nomination doesn\'t take place until July,"" Joyce said. ""So if a determination is made after the primary that Ted Cruz is not eligible to be president then certainly it would be incumbent upon the Republican National Committee not allow the name of Ted Cruz to be entered at the convention in July."" \n \n Voters in Alabama, Texas and New York also have filed legal challenges on whether Cruz meets the citizenship qualifications. The Indiana Board of Election on Friday rejected challenges on whether Cruz and fellow GOP presidential hopeful Sen. Marco Rubio meet the ""natural-born"" requirement. Rubio, whose parents immigrated from Cuba, was born in Florida. \n \n Cruz has dismissed the efforts as ""political mischief."" \n \n He defended his citizenship and right to run at a CNN candidates\' forum Wednesday, saying he was born in Canada to a U.S. citizen, making him an automatic U.S citizen. His mother was born in Wilmington, Del., Cruz said. \n \n “I never breathed a breath of air on this planet when I was not a U.S. citizen,” he said. “It was the act of being born that made me a U.S. citizen.” \n \n Contributing: Tony Cook and Chelsea Schneider, The Indianapolis Star \n \n Follow USA TODAY Chicago correspondent Aamer Madhani on Twitter: @AamerISmad \n \n Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1TuN4zk', 'U.S. Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz, speaks at a rally while campaigning with celebrity Phil Robertson at Springmaid Resort in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, February 19, 2016. \n \n CHICAGO An Illinois judge on Friday said she would decide next month whether she had jurisdiction over a voter\'s complaint that Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz should not be on the state\'s primary ballot because he was born in Canada. \n \n Lawrence Joyce, a lawyer and pharmacist, filed a complaint in January with the Illinois State Board of Elections saying that under the U.S. Constitution, the Texas senator cannot run for president since he is not a ""natural born"" citizen. Cruz was born in Calgary, Alberta of a Cuban father and an American mother. \n \n The Board rejected Joyce\'s complaint - saying Cruz became a natural-born citizen at the moment of his birth because of his mother\'s citizenship - so he petitioned the Cook County Circuit Court to review that decision. \n \n Circuit Court Judge Maureen Ward Kirby said she was not sure she had jurisdiction, and set a March 1 hearing for arguments on whether to dismiss the complaint. \n \n The complaint comes in the wake of repeated attacks on Cruz about his eligibility by New York businessman and presidential rival Donald Trump. \n \n Children born abroad to American citizens can immediately be registered as U.S. citizens through a consular report of birth abroad, but Joyce said that process is a form of naturalization. \n \n A Reuters/Ipsos poll in January found that one quarter of Republicans did not think Cruz was qualified to be president because of his birthplace.

243,"[""*UPDATE: The statistic above, which has been cited repeatedly including by PBS, may be wrong. Or at least it does not appear to be in the academic study that PBS referred to. Our readers and others have said that the correct percentage is ~2%-3%, not 9%. \n \n ORIGINAL: It has often been said that lotteries are a tax on the poor. \n \n And that's a fair description. \n \n Joe Weisenthal pointed out yesterday that poor people regularly buy lottery tickets, while rich people only buy them when the jackpots have gotten huge. \n \n What's less commonly realized is just how much money poor people spend on lottery tickets. \n \n According to a 2008 study, reported by PBS, households that earn less than $13,000 a year spend a staggering 9% of their income on lottery tickets. (via Scott Heiferman). \n \n That's 9% of an income that is presumably extraordinarily hard to live on to begin with. \n \n Rich, educated people tend to ridicule lottery players because the odds against winning are so astronomical. \n \n As PBS points out, you are 17-times more likely to get hit by falling airplane parts than you are to win the lottery. \n \n And you're 50-times more likely to get hit by lightning. \n \n But poor people keep on buying lottery tickets. \n \n Why? \n \n Because they're stupid? \n \n That's the popular explanation, at least among rich non-lottery players. \n \n But the more accurate explanation is probably that having any chance at radically improving their circumstances is probably better than having no chance. \n \n In any event, the fact that households that earn $13,000 or less spend 9% of their incomes on lottery tickets raises a few questions. \n \n First, are those households receiving money from the government in the form of food stamps, tax breaks, or welfare? \n \n If so, is it really fair to spend taxpayer money on lottery tickets? Is that what the folks who support assistance to poor households expect the money to be spent on? \n \n Second, given that lotteries are primarily used to generate revenue for states, might it not be fairer to just collect the revenue directly, as taxes? \n \n Or have lotteries discovered a magical way to tax people--one in which even anti-tax crusaders voluntarily choose to pay huge taxes in exchange for a minuscule chance of making a killing? \n \n Should the United States government raise ALL its tax revenue that way? \n \n Anyway, the finding that households earning $13,000 spend 9% of their precious dollars on lottery tickets is startling. And depressing. And it's worth thinking more about whether the government should really be sponsoring lotteries. \n \n SEE ALSO: 14 Lottery Winners Who Blew It All"", 'A woman known for trying to sneak onto planes without a ticket has been arrested at two Chicago airports.Chicago police spokeswoman Janel Sedevic says 63-year-old Marilyn Hartman was arrested April 24 for loitering in a restricted area at O\'Hare.

But how about the effect of lotteries on the poor? Apparently, it's a killer ""hidden tax""—because households banking less than $13,000 a year spend 9% of their annual income on lottery tickets. Business Insider found the shocking statistic in a PBS interview, and says it raises serious questions—like, are the poor too dumb to avoid odds 17 times worse than the chance of being hit by falling airplane parts? The likely answer: No, they're just grabbing at any chance to improve their circumstances. Looking behind the numbers, Business Insider poses more questions: With the poor receiving tax breaks, welfare, etc, is that money going straight into lottery tickets? Wouldn't it be better just to tax them? Or, in this tax-averse nation, is it better to raise all tax revenue through lotteries? While chewing on that, consider that some experts disagree with the 9% estimate, and say the poor throw away only 2% to 3% of their income on lottery tickets."

(Associated Press) \n \n TOKYO (AP) — A team of Japanese scientists have met the criteria for naming a new element, the synthetic highly radioactive element 113, more than a dozen years after they began working to create it. \n \n Kosuke Morita, who was leading the research at the government-affiliated Riken Nishina Center for Accelerator-Based Science, was notified of the decision on Thursday by the U.S.-based International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry. \n \n ""Now that we have conclusively demonstrated the existence of element 113, we plan to look to the unchartered territory of element 119 and beyond,"" Morita said in a statement. \n \n A joint working group of the IUPAC and International Union of Pure and Applied Physics also announced decisions on recognition of discoveries of elements 115, 117 and 118. \n \n Discoveries of atomic elements have often involved competition between scientists. The news is a morale booster for Riken, which has undergone a reorganization of some of its research following a scandal over stem-cell research. \n \n ""To scientists, this is of greater value than an Olympic gold medal,"" Ryoji Noyori, former Riken president and Nobel laureate in chemistry told reporters. \n \n Riken had earlier said japonium might be proposed as a name for element 113, which provisionally had been named ununtrium. \n \n However, Morita has no specific candidates under consideration. He said he planned to spend part of next year considering a name for the element. \n \n The IUPAC group gave collaborating teams from the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia; Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Oak Ridge, Tennessee the right to name elements 115 and 117. Separately, scientists from the Dubna laboratory and Lawrence Livermore were invited to name element 118. \n \n Element 113 sits between copernicium and flerovium on the periodic table. A joint team of scientists in Russia and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in the U.S. also were vying for naming rights for 113 after announcing its discovery in 2004. \n \n Morita and his group used Riken\'s linear accelerator and ion separator to search for new synthetic superheavy elements, beginning in the late 1980s. In 2003, his team began working to create element 113 by bombarding a thin layer of bismuth with zinc ions traveling at about 10 percent the speed of light, Riken said. \n \n Isotopes of element 113 have a very short half-life, lasting for less than a thousandth of a second, making its discovery very difficult.

He tells the Daily Beast that he ""utterly detests"" the Clintons and wouldn't hesitate to create a similar statue of Hillary Clinton. The statue in New York City's Union Square was quickly taken down, as was the one in Cleveland. ""NYC Parks stands firmly against any unpermitted erection in city parks, no matter how small,"" a Parks Department spokesperson tells Gothamist. ""People have asked if I was upset that the statues are being destroyed,"" Monroe tells the San Francisco Chronicle. ""Not at all. I wouldn't mind taking a baseball bat to one."""
246,"['Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. \n \n / Updated By Jane C. Timm \n \n Hours after President Donald Trump told a group of Missouri donors that Japanese regulators were dropping bowling balls on American automobiles to keep them off the market, the White House insisted the president\'s anecdote was just an allegory. \n \n ""Obviously, he\'s joking about this particular test,” Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Thursday afternoon, telling a reporter who said he’d covered the auto industry in Japan that Trump\'s anecdote was merely ""illustrative of creative practices” countries use to keep American goods out of their markets. \n \n But the president, delivering the story Wednesday evening, offered no indication that he was joking. He told donors that one American automaker had spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to build a model car to test the Japanese regulatory barriers, only to be foiled by this specific test. \n \n ""It’s called the bowling ball test. You know what that is? That’s where they take a bowling ball from 20 feet up in the air and drop it on the hood of the car. And if the hood dents, the car doesn’t qualify,” Trump said at a Missouri fundraiser, an audio recording of which was obtained by NBC News. “It’s horrible, the way we’re treated.” \n \n Reporters scrambled to find factual footing. Was it this Japanese pedestrian safety test, which employs a head-shaped object roughly the size of a bowling ball? Or maybe Trump was thinking of a Nissan ad, The Washington Post suggested. \n \n ""I have no idea what he was talking about,"" said Kristin Dziczek, a director at the independent research firm Center for Automotive Research. \n \n However, regulatory barriers are a very real issue in car exports, she said, as different countries employ different standards for things like emissions, safety and fuel economy. \n \n Japan is not the only place where the U.S. faces hurdles. The center estimated in one study that regulatory differences between the European Union and the United States cost the auto industry $3.3 billion to $4.2 billion per year — more than the tariffs imposed by the E.U. and U.S. on the foreign-made cars crossing borders. \n \n Dziczek said the Trans-Pacific Partnership eased the regulatory hurdles American automakers face selling cars in Japan, by allowing signatories to use the same expedited review processes domestic Japanese carmakers enjoyed with their vehicles. But Trump withdrew from the TPP shortly after his inauguration, sending the U.S. back to Square 1 when it comes to regulatory obstacles in the auto market. \n \n James Fatheree, vice president for Asia for the International Affairs Division of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, was also unfamiliar with Trump\'s claim. \n \n ""I’ve not heard about a bowling ball being dropped on a car,"" Fatheree told NBC News. ""Usually, automotive safety tests are not allegorical."" \n \n He said that in recent years, Japan has sought to help make it easier for exporters, as it did under the TPP trade deal. \n \n As for the supposed test being illustrative of real ""creative practices"" countries might use to keep American-made goods out, Fatheree said simply: ""No cars would pass that test.""', 'A remark made by U.S. President Donald Trump, that Japan drops bowling balls on U.S. cars during inspection to shut them out of the market, later described as a joke by the White House, has left Tokyo perplexed. \n \n During a fundraising speech in Missouri on Wednesday that was transcribed by The Washington Post on Thursday, Trump criticized Japan for conducting unfair inspections on U.S. cars to keep them out of the Japanese market. \n \n “It’s called the bowling ball test, do you know what that is? That’s where they take a bowling ball from 20 feet up in the air and they drop it on the hood of the car. And if the hood dents, then the car doesn’t qualify. Well, guess what, the roof dented a little bit, and they said, nope, this car doesn’t qualify. It’s horrible, the way we’re treated. It’s horrible,” he reportedly said. \n \n In Tokyo on Friday, a Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism Ministry official in charge of vehicle inspections said the president’s remarks were based on “a mere misunderstanding,” saying Japan has never conducted such tests. \n \n The official speculated that Trump may have been referring to a safety test that makes use of a spherical object resembling a human head to check damage caused to people — not vehicles — when cars hit pedestrians. \n \n The test, which is conducted in Japan, Europe, Russia and other countries according to a global standard, evaluates whether a car properly dents when it hits an object so as to reduce the damage to pedestrians, not whether it’s strong enough to stay intact after an accident, the official said. \n \n “I don’t think we have set stricter inspection standards than other countries. I think he has totally misunderstood,” the official said. \n \n After Trump’s remarks, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders explained Thursday that the president was “obviously … joking about this particular test,” video footage on CNN’s website showed. \n \n “But it illustrates the creative ways some countries are able to keep American goods out of their markets,” she said. \n \n Trump has often voiced dissatisfaction with Japan’s safety and environmental standards for automobiles, claiming it treats American automobiles unfairly despite the fact it imposes no tariffs on imported cars. \n \n But the transport ministry official said Japan has neither favored nor discriminated against automobiles of a certain country by conducting extra tests or imposing stricter inspection standards. \n \n “I’ve never heard of such a test. If we did that, I think our cars would also dent,” said Honda Motor Co. spokesman Hajime Kaneko with a chuckle. \n \n “Personally, I think our customers in Japan are more careful about the quality of their vehicles than customers in other countries. They even check carefully for uneven paint and slight misalignment,” which may have led to the impression that Japanese inspections are unfairly strict, he said. \n \n Representatives of Toyota Motor Corp. and Nissan Motor Co. declined to comment.', 'The White House announced that First Lady Melania Trump underwent an embolization procedure Monday to treat a benign kidney condition. \n \n According to the statement, the treatment was a success. However, she is expected to remain at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for the rest of the week. \n \n To find out what an embolization procedure entails and why it might be necessary, we spoke to Dr. Mark S. Litwin, professor and chairman of urology at UCLA. \n \n Below he explains what conditions are most frequently treated with embolization, how the procedure works and potential minor side effects the first lady might experience. \n \n Why do people get embolizations? \n \n The purpose of an embolization is to cut off the blood supply to a lesion to cause it to shrink and ultimately die off. \n \n What does an embolization procedure entail? \n \n It involves threading a very tiny catheter, which is a hollow tube, up through one of the arteries of the body. \n \n Usually it goes in through the top of the leg, and we thread it up through the aorta into the renal artery, which is the main artery that goes to the kidney. Then we put it into an artery that goes directly to the benign lesion. \n \n Once that’s done, typically we squirt in some foam, or what’s called a coil. That obstructs the small artery that goes to the lesion, thereby cutting off the blood supply. \n \n What types of kidney conditions are treated this way? \n \n There is a type of benign tumor of the kidney called an angiomyolipoma, which is composed of a collection of blood vessels and fat cells and sometimes some random muscle cells. These are benign, but sometimes they can cause discomfort or even cause bleeding in a patient, so we often will embolize those. \n \n The other one is an AVM, or arteriovenous malformation. An AVM is a pretty common thing we see throughout the body, but particularly in the kidney. It involves a collection of arteries and veins that kind of group themselves together in an abnormal way. It’s a benign condition, but it can cause bleeding in the urine, so we often embolize those. \n \n How long does the procedure usually take? \n \n It usually takes an hour or two. \n \n Is it common to stay in the hospital for a week after an embolization procedure? \n \n Embolizations for benign kidney conditions are usually done as an outpatient procedure — just come in the morning and go home that afternoon. \n \n Why someone would be in a hospital for a week for this, I have no idea. \n \n Are there possible side effects to worry about after an embolization? \n \n Any medical procedure has a potential risk of side effects, sure. \n \n The risk of an embolization includes minor things such as swelling and bruising or discomfort at the access point. That’s usually pretty minor. \n \n Also, if too large of an artery ends up getting embolized that can be problematic. If it’s not just the branch that goes to the lesion, but one of the more major branches, then one of the risks is you could end up embolizing a whole wedge of kidney. \n \n But if the patient is in a good medical center, those kinds of risks are pretty low. \n \n And just to be clear, that tube you use is really tiny, right? \n \n Yes. As we say in urology, it’s teeny weeny. \n \n Support our journalism Please consider subscribing today to support stories like this one.

""Obviously, he's joking about this particular test,” White House press chief Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Thursday, adding that the remark was ""illustrative of creative practices” used to block American products. Not everybody was buying that explanation, and Post reporter Josh Dawsey tweets that the president has previously brought up the supposed test in meetings. Colleague Philip Bump at the Post digs in, suggesting that perhaps Trump has morphed this Nissan ad into reality. A possibly more plausible explanation he offers is that the tale stems from an actual test Japan conducts in which a ""head-shaped object"" is fired at the hood of a car, the idea being to measure potential damage to a pedestrian. (Trump's comments about bluffing Canada's Justin Trudeau made the bigger headlines from the speech.)"

He paddled 60 miles the day before to round out his final effort. \n \n The milestone marks the triumphant close to the final chapter of a journey that began in Agadir, Morocco.

The organization, which oversees all professional swim competitions in the US, announced this week that the 20-year-old Stanford swimmer had been permanently banned. “USA Swimming condemns the crime and actions committed by Brock Turner, and all acts of sexual misconduct,” ABC News quotes USA Swimming as saying in a statement. Turner was expected to be a future Olympian, but the lifetime ban effectively ends that dream, according to Jezebel. The USA Swimming-sanctioned events from which Turner is banned include Olympic trials. Turner's membership with USA Swimming lapsed at the end of 2014, just before he raped the victim after a frat party in January 2015. ""Brock Turner is not a member of USA Swimming and, should he apply, he would not be eligible for membership,” says the USA Swimming statement. Had he been a member, he would have been kicked out for sexual misconduct in violation of the organization's rules of conduct. In addition to his six-month sentence—for which the judge is receiving blowback from potential jurors in other cases—Turner will have to register as a sex offender, CNN reports. Turner plans to appeal the sentence, but it's unlikely he'll ever represent the US as a professional swimmer."

Suu Kyi’s party won 49 of the first 54 seats declared for the lower house, where 330 seats were contested. \n \n Washington welcomed the election as a victory for Myanmar’s people but said it would watch for the democratic process to move forward before making any adjustments to U.S. sanctions. \n \n The vote was Myanmar’s first general election since its long-ruling military ceded power to President Thein Sein’s quasi-civilian government in 2011, ushering in a period of reform and opening up to foreign investment. \n \n The NLD said its own tally of results posted at polling stations around the country showed it was on track to win more than 70 percent of the seats being contested in parliament, above the two-thirds threshold it needs to form Myanmar’s first democratically elected government since the early 1960s. \n \n “They must accept the results, even though they don’t want to,” NLD spokesman Win Htein told Reuters, adding that in the populous central region, the Nobel peace laureate’s party looked set to take more than 90 percent of seats. \n \n Reuters was not able to independently verify the party’s own estimates of its performance. \n \n JUBILATION \n \n Traffic slowed to a walking pace through the jubilant crowd outside the NLD headquarters. Hundreds of people, many sporting the party’s color of red and a peacock logo, waved flags and cheered as results were announced and projected onto a screen hung from the building. \n \n “I’m very happy about the result,” said Hnin Si, 60, a trader in Yangon. “The people have suffered for 50 years. I believe Aung San Suu Kyi will make the country a better place.” \n \n The election was a landmark in Myanmar’s unsteady journey to democracy from the military dictatorship that made the former Burma a pariah state for so long. \n \n It is also a moment that Suu Kyi will relish after spending years under house arrest following Myanmar’s 1990 election, when the NLD won a landslide victory that was ignored by the junta. \n \n This time, the ruling party, which was created by the former junta and is led by retired military officers, as well as the chief of the armed forces have pledged to respect the result. \n \n But although the election appears to have dealt a decisive defeat to the USDP, a period of uncertainty still looms because it is not clear how Suu Kyi will share power easily with the still-dominant military. \n \n The junta-drafted constitution guarantees one-quarter of parliament’s seats to unelected members of the military and allows the commander-in-chief to nominate the head of three powerful ministries: interior, defense and border security. \n \n The charter also gives the armed forces the right to take over the government under certain circumstances. \n \n Supporters celebrate as they watch official results from the Union Election Commission on an LED screen in front of the National League for Democracy Party (NLD) head office in Yangon, November 9, 2015. REUTERS/Soe Zeya Tun \n \n BARRED FROM PRESIDENCY \n \n Even if the NLD gets the majority it needs, Suu Kyi is barred from taking the presidency herself under the constitution, written by the junta. Suu Kyi has said she will be the power behind the new president, regardless of a charter she has derided as “very silly”. \n \n White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the election was encouraging but cautioned there were still flaws in Myanmar’s political system, adding it was too soon to discuss any U.S. policy changes. \n \n Daniel Russel, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for East Asia, said that after 50 years of military dictatorship, “this was a hell of a step forward for the democratic process in Burma” but added: “Now comes the hard part.” \n \n For the United States and the international community to provide the kind of support Myanmar needed, Russel said, the transition from the current government to the future administration “is going to have to be credible.” \n \n Incomplete vote counts showed some powerful USDP politicians trailing in their bids for parliamentary seats. \n \n Among the losers was USDP chief Htay Oo, who told Reuters from the rural Irrawaddy delta heartlands that he was surprised by his defeat. \n \n Voting in the election was for the most part trouble-free, despite religious tensions fanned by Buddhist nationalists whose actions intimidated Myanmar’s Muslim minority in the run-up to the poll. \n \n But the NLD cried foul over advance votes that could boost the chances of a senior member of the ruling party. \n \n In an official complaint, it said it was “illogical” that the USDP could win 90 percent of advance votes - made by those unable to vote on election day - in Lashio, a township in the east of the country with a large military presence. \n \n Slideshow (13 Images) \n \n Its complaint followed concerns that some observers had not been given permission to monitor voting in military installations. \n \n The issue over advance votes taps memories of a previous election in 2010, which the NLD boycotted and the USDP won by what the Brussels-based think tank International Crisis Group called “massive manipulation” of the count, particularly of advance votes.', 'Baltimore police Lt. Brian Rice has opted for a bench trial during a pretrial motions hearing Tuesday. \n \n Rice is the highest-ranking officer charged in the in-custody death of Freddie Gray, and he is the fourth of six officers charged in connection with Gray\'s death to go on trial. \n \n Opening statements in the trial are set to start at 9:30 a.m. Thursday. \n \n Complete coverage: Live Updates | Special section | Timeline | Officers charged | Charging documents | Who\'s who \n \n Rice faces manslaughter, assault, reckless endangerment and misconduct in office charges in connection to Gray\'s death. The 25-year-old died on April 19, 2015, a week after he suffered a neck injury while in a police transport van. \n \n Baltimore Circuit Court Judge Barry Williams denied a motion to dismiss reckless endangerment and assault charges. The judge also denied a defense motion to dismiss charges based on defective prosecution. \n \n However Williams did rule that prosecutors cannot use 4,000 pages of training documents related to Rice’s in-service training that occurred while he was a police officer. \n \n The judge said prosecutors violated discovery rules by not turning those documents over to the defense in advance of trial. \n \n Chief Deputy State’s Attorney Michael Schatzow told the judge that prosecutors requested the documents from the Police Department late last year, but they did not receive the documents until Tuesday of last week, and only then did they turn over the documents to the defense. \n \n Baltimore police issued a statement Tuesday afternoon, saying, ""We received a written request from the State\'s Attorney\'s Office on June 18, 2016, in reference to training documents related to Lt. Brian Rice. The BPD immediately began to collect those documents, even paying overtime, to provide to the State\'s Attorney\'s Office. As with all requests for documents from the State\'s Attorney\'s Office, the BPD worked diligently to provide a timely and thorough response in this case. In fact, BPD extended employees\' work hours to locate and copy responsive records in order to produce them on time."" \n \n \n \n Williams rejected a request from defense attorney Michael Belsky to dismiss the charges, but he did say prosecutors should have asked police supervisors to send the documents sooner, or asked the court to issue a subpoena. \n \n ""Your office didn\'t do what it was supposed to do,"" Williams told Schatzow. \n \n Schatzow said prosecutors did not want to seek a subpoena. \n \n Williams is expected to hear Rice\'s case, which, like the other cases, will center on whether the officers were criminally responsible for Gray\'s death for not properly seat belting him in the van after he was arrested and shackled, and for not seeking medical attention when Gray asked for it. \n \n Rice is the officer who initiated the pursuit of Gray when he and two others were walking in west Baltimore on April 12, 2015. According to testimony in previous trials, Gray ran off after Rice made eye contact with him. \n \n Officers Garrett Miller and Edward Nero responded to the call. A short time later, Miller arrested Gray and he, along with Rice and Nero, loaded Gray, who was handcuffed and placed in shackles, into the van. \n \n Officer Caesar Goodson drove off with Gray, but stopped the van a few blocks later. At that time, Rice, Nero and Miller took Gray out of the van, placed him in leg shackles and placed him face-down on the floor of the vehicle. \n \n Increased scrutiny \n \n The trial for Rice comes as some are questioning whether prosecutors should continue with their cases against the officers. The state has yet to secure a conviction in any of the cases that went to trial. \n \n Goodson, the transport van driver, was found not guilty in June on all charges, including second-degree depraved heart murder. Nero, who like Goodson opted for a bench trial, was cleared of misdemeanor charges in May. The trial of William Porter ended in December with a hung jury. Porter is set to be retried in September. \n \n In recent weeks, Baltimore City State\'s Attorney Marilyn Mosby has come under scrutiny for her handling of the cases. Rice is among five of the charged officers who filed a defamation suit against Mosby. \n \n Also, George Washington University law professor John F. Banzhaf III has filed a complaint against Mosby with Maryland\'s Attorney Grievance Commission. \n \n Among other things, Banzhaf said in his 10-page complaint that Mosby appears to have violated Maryland\'s rules of professional conduct for lawyers, which requires that a prosecutor refrain from prosecuting a charge unless it is supported by probable cause. \n \n Tough case to prove \n \n University of Baltimore law professor David Jaros said like in the Nero and Goodson trials, prosecutors will have a difficult time gaining a conviction in this case. \n \n Jaros said the biggest new evidence the state will be able to present in this case that they did not in the other cases is the statement Rice gave to investigators in the days after Gray was injured. That could shed light into why Rice decided to call out a pursuit for Gray in the first place. \n \n The prosecution may also call co-defendants Porter and Miller to the stand. The state granted both limited immunity. Miller testified in Nero\'s trial that he was the one who physically arrested Gray. \n \n ""I\'m a former public defender and I have concerns about police misconduct and the treatment of those that are arrested,"" Jaros said. ""But as a lawyer who has sat in the courtroom for these trials, the evidence offered so far by the prosecution has not been sufficient to prove a crime beyond a reasonable doubt."" \n \n Despite the other acquittals, Jaros is not surprised Williams denied the motions to dismiss the charges. \n \n ""Judge Williams is hearing each of these cases in a vacuum,"" Jaros said. ""He must hear the evidence and rule on each case individually."" \n \n Jaros added: ""One thing we want to ask is, \'Do they have different evidence because of course the statements of Lt. Rice are admissible only against Lt. Rice and not the other defendants.\'"" \n \n University of Maryland law professor Doug Colbert agrees it will be tough to convict Rice. \n \n ""The prosecution will likely produce an expert witness to say that the defendant, Lt. Rice was aware and consciously disregarded a substantial risk of injury to Freddie Gray that led to his death,"" Colbert said. \n \n But despite the difficulties in the case, Colbert said that does not mean prosecutors should not move forward with the cases against the officers. \n \n ""It\'s a hard case for the prosecutors,"" Colbert said. ""It\'s rare for charges to be brought against a police officer, and even rarer to gain a conviction in a case like this. But the state\'s attorney\'s office is committed for speaking for victims like Freddie Gray and to show there is equal justice for people whose voices are rarely heard as crime victims."" \n \n WBAL-TV 11 News reporter David Collins and WBAL NewsRadio 1090 reporter Robert Lang contributed to this story.']",3,"– The opposition party led by Aung San Suu Kyi sounds very confident after elections that the Independent describes as the freest in Burma's history. Her National League for Democracy party is expected to make huge gains after Sunday's vote in the country's first free national election in 25 years, and numerous candidates from the ruling, military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party have already admitted defeat, the BBC reports. ""I think you all have the idea of the results,"" Suu Kyi told cheering supporters on Monday morning, though it's not clear whether the party will have the two-thirds majority in the country's parliament needed to form a government, reports Reuters. The election comes after decades of struggle by Suu Kyi, including 15 years under house arrest, but though she has said she wants to become president, the constitution bars her from the position because her two sons hold British nationality, the BBC notes. US Secretary of State John Kerry praised the election as a ""testament to the courage and sacrifice shown by the people of Burma over many decades"" while also describing the vote as ""far from perfect"" due to the disfranchisement of groups like the Muslim Rohingya minority and the reservation of seats in parliament for the military, reports the Guardian."
250,"['Television, as Dr Mumbo is sure everyone knows, is a happy place full of people with a sunny disposition. \n \n And they come no sunnier than Nine’s weather and news reader Amber Sherlock. \n \n But live television stress can make people behave in different ways. \n \n And imagine the stress that comes with the impending disaster of three women all about to go on air – and all wearing so much white they look like they came straight from the Pure Blonde Brewtopia commercial. \n \n This was the emergency that anchor Sherlock found herself facing yesterday, along with guest pundits, fellow Nine hack Julie Snook and psychologist Sandy Rae. \n \n Bad enough at a wedding. Imagine doing it on telly. \n \n And Rae had disobeyed Sherlock’s orders to put on a jacket. Which made Sherlock VERY unhappy as the trio prepared for a discussion during Nine’s 178-hour long daily afternoon news coverage. \n \n It would be fascinating to know how the off-air conversation at Nine News Now went, wouldn’t it? \n \n Happily, Dr Mumbo has acquired the tape…. \n \n Shortly before going on air, things got rather passive aggressive… \n \n To begin, Sherlock was talking about Snook in the third person, which is never a good start… \n \n “I need Julie to put a jacket on. I asked her before we came on… I told you two hours ago.” \n \n “I’m sorry, I’ve been flat out,” apologised Snook, suggesting somebody might find her a spare jacket. \n \n Meanwhile, the amount of notice Sherlock was claiming to have given to her colleague had increased by 30 minutes. “I made this clear two-and-a-half-hours ago…” \n \n Which was enough for Snook to suggest she might walk. \n \n “Amber, if it’s an issue, I can get on out of here…” \n \n “It is an issue. Go and grab a jacket…. I wasn’t saying it for no reason. The wardrobe girls will be furious downstairs.” \n \n Things then took on a shade of 2015’s viral blue and gold dress, with Snook declaring: “I’m wearing blue for one, Amber. I don’t…” \n \n Sherlock interrupted: “It doesn’t look like it. Get a producer. There’s one hanging up. Just get it…” \n \n Snook came back: “If there’s an issue I can just head on out and get back to work. I’m flat chat. I genuinely forgot.” \n \n The chatter then continued without vision as Snook once again suggested she drop out of the segment. “I’ll just jump on out, honestly.” \n \n “Fine, jump on out if that’s what you’d like to do,” snapped back Sherlock. “Come on, wearing a jacket. I asked you two-and-a-half hours ago. It’s not the hardest request.” \n \n There was then yet another reminder on how long ago they’d talked about it. “I know it’s not your issue. But we did talk about it two-and-a-half hours ago.” \n \n The audio then drops out for the next 20 seconds, before Snook reappears on screen, making herself comfortable in a, presumably borrowed, black jacket. \n \n Ten seconds later, the trio were on air, with beaming (if slightly fixed) smiles. \n \n Which set them up perfectly to talk about Donald Trump’s apparent predilection for golden showers. \n \n It was that sort of day.', 'Julie Snook is now known around the nation thanks to the revelations on Friday of Channel Nine\'s great White Top Debacle. \n \n Snook got her big break in Canberra where she worked across print, TV and radio. \n \n A leaked video of Snook being berated by fellow Nine presenter Amber Sherlock for also wearing a white top on air - and being directed by Sherlock to put on a jacket - went viral on Friday. \n \n While Sherlock was reportedly to be hauled before management, Snook\'s stocks rose as she handled the attack with aplomb, saying she was flat out, had simply forgot to put on a jacket and eventually did put on one.

Bush said that while it ""made sense\'\' to have federal courts review the case,... (Associated Press) \n \n The headline: ""Don\'t trust Jeb Bush with the power of the presidency."" \n \n The subject of many of the emails was Terri Schiavo. The letter-writer was her husband, Michael. \n \n Bush\'s effort to stop Michael Schiavo from removing his brain-damaged wife\'s feeding tube was a defining moment of Bush\'s time in office. \n \n Bush, a devout Catholic, sided with Terri Schiavo\'s parents in the end-of-life dispute and reached for unprecedented authority to intervene. Michael Schiavo said his wife did not want to be kept alive artificially. \n \n As Bush moves toward a run for president in 2016, Michael Schiavo has re-emerged, promising to campaign against Bush and remind voters about the ex-governor\'s role in the matter. \n \n ""I will be very active,"" Schiavo, a registered Republican, told The Associated Press in an interview. He said he plans to back Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton, should she run. \n \n To Schiavo, Bush ""owes the public, along with myself, a huge apology."" \n \n Asked last week about the case, Bush told the Tampa Bay Times: ""It\'s appropriate for people to err on the side of life. I\'m completely comfortable with it."" \n \n Bush\'s recently released emails are part of his attempt to define himself on his terms. Many of the emails deal with the Schiavo case. \n \n ""Please know that I respect the opinions of those who disagree with the actions I have taken,"" Bush wrote a constituent in 2005. ""This is a heart-wrenching case, and I have not taken any action without thought, reflection and an appreciation for other points of view."" \n \n Friends and advisers to Bush say his actions were driven largely by his faith, and they believe his effort to keep Schiavo alive — despite wide public disapproval — illustrates principled leadership. That could help in early presidential voting states such as Iowa and South Carolina, where social conservatives hold significant sway in the nominating process. \n \n ""Jeb felt strongly from a personal standpoint that she should be given a chance,"" said Al Cardenas, former chairman of the American Conservative Union. \n \n Terri Schiavo\'s parents, Bob and Mary Schindler, asked Bush for help. They disputed the diagnosis that she was in a ""chronic vegetative state"" and said that their daughter, as a Catholic, would not want to be taken off life support. \n \n ""For Mr. Bush, it was clearly about doing the right thing,"" said David Gibbs, the Schindlers\' lead lawyer. ""He knew the easiest thing would be for him to avoid the issue and just be the governor. But he felt in principle that one disabled woman was worth his time and attention. He showed genuine compassion."" \n \n Bush first intervened in 2003 as the Schindlers\' legal appeals were coming to an end. A judge\'s ruling that Michael Schiavo, Terri\'s legal guardian, could remove her feeding tube had withstood years of court challenges. But the governor took the unusual step of writing the judge and asking him to assign a different guardian. \n \n ""I normally would not address a letter to the judge in a pending legal proceeding,"" Bush wrote. ""However, my office has received over 27,000 emails reflecting understandable concern for the well-being of Terri Schiavo."" \n \n His request was rejected. \n \n On Oct. 21, 2003, six days after the feeding tube was removed, the GOP-controlled Legislature passed a one-page bill granting the governor the power to order the tube reinserted. Bush signed it into law, and a police-escorted ambulance moved her from a hospice to a hospital, where the tube was put back in. \n \n ""I honestly believe we did the right thing,"" Bush wrote a constituent who supported the move. \n \n Others weren\'t so sure, including some of the Republicans who shepherded the measure through the Legislature. ""I keep thinking, \'What if Terri Schiavo really didn\'t want this at all?\'"" the late Jim King, then Florida\'s state Senate president, said at the time. \n \n Nearly a year later, the Florida Supreme Court ruled the law unconstitutional. Bush appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, was rejected and asked Congress to intervene. Lawmakers, including then-Sen. Clinton, voted to give Terri Schiavo\'s parents legal standing to appeal anew in the federal courts, which then rejected their case. \n \n In a last-ditch effort, Bush tried to have the state Department of Children and Families take custody of Terri Schiavo, based on allegations that she had been abused by her husband and caregivers. The move was rebuffed by the presiding judge. \n \n On March 31, 2005, Terri Schiavo died. \n \n Even after that, Bush raised questions about Michael Schiavo\'s involvement in his wife\'s initial collapse and asked that a state prosecutor revisit the case. ""Jeb Bush had no right to do what he did,"" Michael Schiavo said in his letter to the newspaper. \n \n The prosecutor concluded there was no evidence of wrongdoing. \n \n ""Jeb Bush had no right to do what he did, and voters should consider what someone who used the power of government to hurt so many would do with the power of the presidency,"" Schiavo wrote. \n \n In a statement upon Terri Schiavo\'s death, Bush said he joined those in Florida and around the world who were ""deeply grieved by the way Terri died."" \n \n ""I remain convinced, however, that Terri\'s death is a window through which we can see the many issues left unresolved in our families and in our society. For that, we can be thankful for all that the life of Terri Schiavo has taught us."" \n \n ___ \n \n Follow Michael J.

Instead, John Rehm should have had the option of an assisted death, the group says. They call for ""aid in dying"" — allowing mentally competent, terminally ill adults to request life-ending medication from a doctor for a peaceful and painless death. It\'s legal in several states, but not Maryland. \n \n John Rehm met the definition, says Diane Rehm, a nationally syndicated talk show host for WAMU-FM in Washington. \n \n “Both of us had agreed that when the time came, we would be there for each other in whatever way was necessary,” she said. “So when he made up his mind, that was it.” \n \n ""He simply decided the end had come and he did not want to carry on this way."" \n \n She wasn’t happy about it, but understood his decision. He’d been in assisted living since November of 2012. “That was something we had both agreed we never wanted but at that point he had started falling and I couldn’t lift him,” said Rehm. \n \n By June of this year, John was very frail. There’s no cure for Parkinson’s, and the few available treatments eventually stop working. “He was so brave,” Rehm said. “He simply decided the end had come and he did not want to carry on this way. He could no longer feed himself, he couldn’t shower alone, he couldn’t stand alone.” \n \n The only option, his doctor told him, was to refuse all food and water. It’s not an easy way to die, as it takes anywhere from a few days or a few weeks to succumb to dehydration. It can be very painful, causing headaches, leg cramps and delirium. \n \n John Rehm’s doctor kept an eye on him, administering low doses of morphine to control the discomfort. “He did not seem to feel pain,” Rehm said. “We kept putting lotion on his lips and using tiny little sponges in his mouth to keep him comfortable.” \n \n It wasn’t easy to watch. “I wanted to take applesauce and put it in his mouth,” Rehm said. “But you can’t do that. You have to respect someone else’s wishes. You have to honor his desires. And he was finished with life. He said ‘I am looking forward to the next journey’,” she added. \n \n Polls show that 65 percent or more of the U.S. population supports having an option available to help people choose a quicker, more painless death, Compassion & Choices says. This is different from assisted suicide or euthanasia, the group stresses. “Assisted suicide is a crime in many states, including Oregon and Washington, where aid in dying is legal,” the group says. \n \n Assisted dying is also legal in Vermont and Montana. Several other states have considered the matter. \n \n ""I have no doubt that he was terminally ill and if he was in Oregon he would have qualified for aid in dying,"" said Barbara Coombs Lee, president of Compassion & Choices. \n \n ""He should have had better choices."" \n \n “We do not let our little animals suffer and people shouldn’t have to suffer.” \n \n In the United States, there\'s strong opposition, Coombs Lee says. ""There is a vocal and politically strong minority that opposes it vehemently,"" she said. ""They have all the power in the legislatures. The combination of organized medicine and organized religion is an extremely powerful combination in the halls of our nation’s legislatures."" \n \n Compassion & Choices says it doesn\'t support euthanasia or ""mercy killing,"" ""because someone else — not the dying person — chooses and acts to cause death."" What is called euthanasia and is legal in some European countries more closely resembles what the group calls aid in dying. \n \n It would allow a doctor to prescribe a lethal dose of drugs for a patient to take as he or she chose. “I would like to, in every state across the country, in every city, in every county, I would very much like to see a justification, an allowance, for aid in dying,” Rehm said. \n \n “We do not let our little animals suffer and people shouldn’t have to suffer.” \n \n Such a method could help patients ensure that loved ones are with them if they wish. As it happened, Rehm wasn’t there in her husband’s very last moments on June 23rd. \n \n “I spent the night there Sunday night the 22nd because I was afraid he was going to die that night and I didn’t want him to die alone,” she said. She and their dog Maxie slept beside John’s bed. \n \n “I will hopefully someday, with the help of a kind physician, be able to end my life when I choose."" \n \n “When the caregiver arrived at about 7:30 in the morning I said ‘I’ll run home and feed Maxie and take a shower and I’ll be back’.” A doctor called her soon after and said John, who was unconscious by this time, would likely die within the next 24 hours. But before she could get back, the caregiver called. John Rehm had died. “I got there 20 minutes too late,” Rehm said. \n \n Rehm doesn’t want that type of uncertainty for herself. “I will hopefully someday, with the help of a kind physician, be able to end my life when I choose,” she said. \n \n “I think there are so many reasons why people choose to end their lives and I am not talking about people who are desperate, who are miserable and lonely. I am talking about people who have lived their lives and are satisfied with what they have had and are really ready to let go,” she added. \n \n “I just think we ought to be able to create that space for ourselves where we can choose to die with dignity and with the aid of a physician.” \n \n As for her husband, Rehm said, “I will love him and miss him forever.”']",2,"– Diane Rehm is a distinctive voice beloved by the 2.6 million people who listen to her NPR show. She's also made the ethically precarious choice to become a voice in the right-to-die debate, and it's personal: As the Washington Post reports, the 78-year-old Rehm ran smack into the question of how to end life with dignity last year when her husband of 54 years, John, after a physically devastating battle with Parkinson's that would only get worse, decided his time had arrived. But because the couple lived in Maryland, which is not a right-to-die state, his doctor refused to help him end his life. And with Diane Rehm's high profile, her husband felt he could not ask her to help him. Which left John Rehm just one option: Stop eating and drinking. He did. His death took 10 days. ""I feel the way that John had to die was just totally inexcusable,"" Rehm tells the Post. ""It was not right."" Rehm is publicly working with end-of-life organization Compassion & Choices, and she's using her story—which she recounted to NBC last year—to help raise funds for the cause; she tells the Post she'd testify before Congress if asked. ""She brings gravitas, she brings her experience, and she brings a level of reason and sanity to this discussion that is severely lacking when you look at the opponents of death with dignity,"" says an expert with the University of Vermont, which is in one of only three states with right-to-die laws on the books. Rehm has also discussed the subject on her show. ""As strongly as I feel, I don’t want to use the program to proselytize my feelings,"" she said, but with cases like Brittany Maynard stoking national debate, she says, ""I do want to have more and more discussion about it because I feel it’s so important."" (Elsewhere today, an old right-to-die case may come back to haunt Jeb Bush.)"

253,"[""A sprawling U.S. mail sorting facility near the Opa-locka airport — the size of five football fields — took center stage Thursday when federal investigators discovered that at least one of the bomb-filled packages targeting an array of Democratic figures passed through the location. \n \n Where that package originated, however, remained unclear because the Opa-locka postal facility sorts hundreds of thousands of packages daily that come in and out of South Florida. The bigger mystery was who plotted the series of mailings and why. \n \n The package in question is likely the one that ended up Wednesday at the Sunrise congressional office of U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, according to a federal law enforcement official familiar with the probe. \n \n That package was originally sent to the office of former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder in the Washington, D.C., area, but it did not get delivered and was sent back to the return address, which was listed as the congresswoman’s office in Sunrise. Before it got there, it was rerouted through the giant Opa-locka mail sorting facility, the official said. \n \n Be the first to know. No one covers what is happening in our community better than we do. And with a digital subscription, you'll never miss a local story. SIGN ME UP! \n \n That development capped a frenetic day for the FBI-led counter-terrorism team leading a nationwide search. The packages containing crudely fashioned devices that looked like pipe bombs have now been recovered in South Florida, New York , the Washington, D.C., area, California and Delaware. They were sent to at least 10 prominent Democratic politicians and other vocal critics of President Donald Trump from presidential nominee Hillary Clinton to actor Robert De Niro. \n \n The U.S Postal Service directed investigators to Opa-locka after reviews of mail scans showed some of the devices had found their way through the massive sorting facility. \n \n On Friday, the FBI confirmed that an 11th package, similar in appearance to the others, was “recovered in Florida” and addressed to Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey. But in the brief news update, the agency did not say whether the manila envelope, which also listed Wasserman Schultz on the return address, was processed at the Opa-locka mail facility. \n \n It was also reported that a 12th package, addressed to James R. Clapper Jr., the former director of national intelligence, was intercepted at a New York City mail facility. The package was addressed to Clapper at CNN’s news offices in New York. \n \n The bombing devices — clearly aiming to shake up the political landscape just two weeks before the midterm elections — were so poorly constructed that at least one source involved in the investigation told The Miami Herald that they could not detonate. Whether they were intentionally designed that way was not known. \n \n After news media reported on the Opa-locka mail facility’s connection to the bomb threats late Thursday, the Miami-Dade County Police Department dispatched a bomb squad and K-9 unit to do a sweep of the place. No explosive devices were found. \n \n U.S. postal inspectors in Florida and the other states are combing databases to see if there are any other suspicious packages en route to more potential political targets. \n \n The South Florida connection was just the latest development in a widening probe into the threatening mailings."", 'Image copyright Rex Features Image caption Gaby Scanlon had been celebrating her 18th birthday when she drank the cocktail \n \n A wine bar has been fined £100,000 after a woman drank a cocktail containing liquid nitrogen and had to have her stomach removed. \n \n Gaby Scanlon, of Heysham, Lancashire, was served the Nitro-Jagermeister while celebrating her 18th birthday in 2012. \n \n Oscar\'s Wine Bar in Lancaster previously admitted health and safety failings, at Preston Crown Court. \n \n The court heard Ms Scanlon was left close to death after drinking the £3.95 shot. \n \n She was taken to Lancaster Royal Infirmary, where a CT scan found a large perforation in her stomach. \n \n Ms Scanlon, now 20, spent three weeks in hospital, undergoing surgery to remove her stomach and connect her oesophagus directly to her small bowel. \n \n \'Smoke from nose\' \n \n Her solicitors told the court the experience, on 4 October 2012, had ""completely changed"" her life. \n \n She now suffers from ""episodes of agonising pain"", has to avoid some foods and can no longer enjoy eating, they said. \n \n Image copyright PA Image caption Oscar\'s director Andrew Dunn, of Old Earswick, York, pleaded not guilty to his part in the company\'s failings \n \n Describing the moment she drank the shot, Ms Scanlon told the court: ""I turned to the man and asked if it was okay to drink.

At no time did they see anything warning them of the risks of ingestion. \n \n ""The essence of this calamity was the ignorance on the part of the company.""']",2,"– A huge postal facility in south Florida was evacuated Thursday night as the search for the person who sent pipe bombs to leading Democrats and other critics of President Trump continued. Miami-Dade County police officers, K-9 units, and federal agents could be seen entering the Opa-locka mail sorting and distribution facility, WPTV reports. The US Postal Service directed law enforcement to the facility after discovering some of the packages passed through the facility, but since Opa-locka handles hundreds of thousands of packages from Florida and further afield daily, the source of the packages remains unclear, reports the Miami Herald. Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen told Fox News that the packages ""originated, some of them, from Florida."" She added: ""I am confident that this person or people will be brought to justice."" The number of packages intercepted rose to at least 10 Thursday when pipe bombs sent to Robert De Niro and Joe Biden were found, and authorities have warned that there could be more out there. None of the packages exploded, and although they contained batteries and timers, authorities say they would not have blown up when opened. Law enforcement officials tell the AP that it's unclear whether they were poorly designed or were never intended to explode.

256,"[""I went into today's Apple's Watch event ready to be convinced. I wanted Cook and Co to settle the nagging unease I had around the timepiece, to show me this is a smartwatch worth owning. \n \n Instead, I'm wholly disappointed. You know that empty feeling you get when your favorite sports team blows an early lead? Yeah, that's about how I feel right now. \n \n I'm still impressed with the Apple Watch's design, don't get me wrong. I think it's one of the sleeker if not the sleekest-looking smartwatches around. And the ability to customize the actual hardware of the timepiece is something other watches should envy. \n \n Article continues below \n \n I also appreciated how Apple played up the Watch's health and fitness features today. As someone who is constantly looking for external motivation to get my butt out of my desk chair, Christy Turlington Burns running a half marathon with an Apple Watch strapped to her wrist resonated with me. MAYBE I CAN DO THAT, TOO. \n \n But then things flatlined. Kevin Lynch, vice president of technology at Apple, took us on a too-long journey through the airport, drew a poor excuse for a flower, talked to his dog groomer and viewed a garage camera to see who was entering his house. \n \n I get the real-world-application demonstration, but the entire time all I could think was a) I don't want to look down at my wrist that often during the day and b) I can already do all of that on my phone. \n \n And then came the kill shot: the price. \n \n The Apple Watch Sport starts at $349 (£299, AU$499), the smaller stainless steel Watch eases users in at $549 (£479, AU$799) and the 18-karat gold Apple Watch Edition has an entry price of $10,000 (£8,000, AU$14,000). \n \n Yes. $10,000. \n \n Apple has fallen into its usual trap: creating a product that has all the bells and whistles with a price to match. Mind you, I think that's a bad thing - I don't have $300+ to spend on a watch. I'll turn to Fitbit to reach my fitness goals and pull out my phone when I need to tell the time or, you know, answer a phone call. If I do decide I want a smartwatch, there are far more affordable ones I'll buy instead. \n \n I know, I know. Apple isn't in the business of making cheap hardware, and that $10,000 Watch isn't for the everyday buyer. But as someone who wants access to Apple products yet doesn't have the bankroll to do so, I can't help but feel ignored and pretty put off by Apple's strategy, one that's continued right into its wearables. You aren't making this smartwatch for me, Apple. And I don't like that. \n \n We'll see if over time there's a price drop, and whether enough buyers find the upfront cost worth the investment. As more apps come to the Apple Watch, it could become useful enough that - if the price falls, too - I'll seriously consider buying one. \n \n It's just that today Apple had a chance to get me on-board the iWatch train. It whiffed, and I'm still here, standing on the platform."", 'Over its nearly 40 years of existence, Apple has addressed itself to many audiences: nerds, teenagers, parents, students, writers, photographers. So it’s interesting in 2015 to consider “Think different,” nearly two decades out. This requires some delicacy, because “Think different” is an ad, and ads are just propaganda with a profit motive and rarely to be taken at their word. \n \n And yet. With “Think different,” Apple was at the very least addressing itself to people who were not incumbent. (That status quo, unnamed in the ads, was of course Microsoft—which made serious machines preferred by people of business.) Apple made technology for people who wanted to change the world, not the people who ran it. \n \n Which was always a little rich, because Apple devices weren’t cheap. The Apple pitch was one of exceptionalism: Apple alone combined pre-existing technology with incremental advances and holistic, humane design. Buy an Apple phone/laptop/music player, and you didn’t get an amalgam of specifications, software, and capacity. You got an experience. \n \n And even as Apple has expanded, even as it has sold more than 700 million iPhones, this has remained to some degree its pitch. Apple products are expensive but they’re within reach of a middle-class American, and they were loved as quality machines. The Apple developer Alexei Baboulevitch makes this point well, I think: \n \n We loved our iPods and iPhones for their sleek design and smooth [user interface], even when people dismissed them as “expensive toys.” We knew our $2000 laptops were incredible for the price, even while people mocked us for not buying cheap, creaky Windows machines. When Android and Windows users poked fun at our platforms for lacking in free tools, we lauded the benefits of carefully crafted, paid-up-front software. We let our Apple logos shine bright because we were proud to be affiliated with one of the few companies that seemed philosophically bent on setting a new standard for mass-market products. \n \n High quality for the mass-market: This was Apple. \n \n Today’s messaging was a little different. \n \n The company announced new laptops: They will be available in gold. It showed us an example Apple Watch user: She was Christy Turlington Burns, a supermodel who Apple’s video shows taking time off from philanthropic work in Tanzania to run a half-marathon around Kilimanjaro. \n \n And even the less-obviously luxe marketing seemed tailored to an aloof elite: You can call an Uber with your watch now! If you forget to stand up every so often (perhaps because your trans-Pacific first-class Emirates seat is just so comfortable), your watch will remind you to walk around a little! \n \n But these are details. Most will correctly fixate on the price of the most expensive watch, the 18-karat-gold Apple Watch Edition. Apple hasn’t released an upper price window for these watches, but Tim Cook mentioned on-stage Monday they started at $10,000.']",2,"– Yesterday's Apple event included big revelations about the Apple Watch, not the least of which is that the most expensive model will start at $10,000. And that's a shame, writes Robinson Meyer at the Atlantic. Considering that Apple has catered to ""misfits and rebels"" for much of its almost 40-year history and was fighting off bankruptcy less than two decades ago, this latest move feels ""a little different,"" Meyer writes. During yesterday's event, the Apple Watch was showcased on the wrist of supermodel Christy Turlington Burns, who runs half-marathons around Kilimanjaro when she can get away from her philanthropic work in Tanzania. That's just one example Meyer cites of yesterday's marketing, most of which was ""tailored to an aloof elite."" Apple products have never been cheap, but they stayed ""within reach of a middle-class American,"" Meyer notes. But the 18-karat-gold Apple Watch Edition is clearly out of grasp for most. ""The prices grate,"" Meyer writes. ""And they grate not because they're so expensive, but because they're gratuitously expensive."" As the Edition model will ""have the same innards"" as the $349 Apple Watch Sport, ""the only difference is that Apple is manufacturing a status symbol with the Edition.""

257,"['Like the fabled Goldilocks, a woman’s weight gain during pregnancy may be a matter of striking a middling balance. New research from Kaiser Permanente shows that women who gain too much or too little weight during pregnancy may predispose their children for the future development of obesity. \n \n Published Sunday in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the study is one of the largest to examine the effects of neonatal weight on childhood obesity. Researchers reviewed the electronic health records of more than 4,100 obstetrical patients from diverse racial backgrounds in Northern California. \n \n After reviewing the records of children born to these women by ages 2 and 5, they found a much higher incidence of obesity among children born to mothers who’d gained more than the recommended weight during pregnancy, at 20.4 percent compared to a “normal” rate of 14.5 percent. Conversely, mothers who’d gained less than the recommended weight gave birth to children with a higher chance of developing obesity, at 19.5 percent. \n \n And healthy moms especially should take note. Women of normal body mass index (BMI) who gained less than the recommended amount of weight were 63 percent more likely than others to bear a child who became overweight or obese. Likewise, women with normal BMI who failed to gain the recommended weight during pregnancy were 80 percent more likely to birth a baby who develops a weight problem, senior researcher Monique M. Hedderson said in a news release. \n \n ""The stronger association we found among normal weight women who gained too much or too little weight during pregnancy suggests that perhaps weight gain in pregnancy may have an impact on the child that is independent of genetic factors,"" Hedderson said. \n \n Follow Us \n \n The womb apparently sets the pace for certain metabolic functions, says study leader Sneha Sridhar. ""Gaining either too little or too much weight in pregnancy may permanently affect mechanisms that manage energy balance and metabolism in the offspring, such as appetite control and energy expenditure,"" she said. ""This could potentially have long-term effects on the child\'s subsequent growth and weight."" \n \n The researchers used BMI and pregnancy weight-gain recommendations from the Institute of Medicine, a nonprofit think-tank based in Washington, D.C. For obese women with BMIs of 30 or higher, health experts there recommend neonatal weight gain of 11 to 20 pounds, with 15 to 25 pounds for overweight women. Women who are underweight should gain the most at 28 to 40 pounds. \n \n The researchers also defined childhood obesity at ages 2 and 5 as greater than the 85th percentile of child growth standards from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.', 'About 1 in 4 women now are obese at the time they become pregnant. Credit: Pregnancy photo via Shutterstock \n \n Women who gain either more or less weight than recommended during pregnancy may be more likely to have an overweight child, a new study has found. \n \n Researchers looked at health records of 4,145 women, and the medical records of their children between ages 2 and 5. \n \n They found that among women who had a normal body mass index (BMI) before pregnancy, those who gained less than the recommended amount (of 25 to 35 pounds) were 63 percent more likely to have a child who became overweight or obese, compared with those who gained the recommended amount. [7 Ways Pregnant Women Affect Babies] \n \n Similarly, women with a normal BMI before pregnancy who gained more weight than recommended were 80 percent more likely to have an overweight or obese child, according to the study published today (April 14) in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology. \n \n ""Gaining either too little or too much weight in pregnancy may permanently affect mechanisms that manage energy balance and metabolism in the offspring, such as appetite control and energy expenditure,"" said study researcher Sneha Sridhar, a public health researcher at Kaiser Permanente division of research in Oakland, Calif. \n \n ""This could potentially have long-term effects on the child\'s subsequent growth and weight,"" Sridhar said. \n \n Previous studies have shown that gaining too much weight during pregnancy can increase the risk of gestational diabetes for the mother, as well as increase the risk of health problems for the child, such as childhood obesity. But other studies have also shown that gaining too little weight during pregnancy can lead to complications such as preterm birth and small infants. \n \n In the study, the researchers also found that among all women who gained more than the recommended weight during pregnancy, 20.4 percent had children who were overweight or obese, compared with 19.5 percent of women who gained less than the recommended weight and 14.5 percent of women who gained weight within the guidelines. \n \n Women in the study were members of Kaiser Permanente health care plans in Northern California, and were racially diverse. They had completed a health survey between 2007 and 2009 and subsequently had a baby, the researchers said. \n \n As for the children, the researchers considered a child overweight or obese if he or she had a BMI greater than 85 percent of children in their age group, following the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention child growth standards. \n \n Obesity is partly genetic, but the finding that even normal weight women were more likely to have overweight children if they gained too much or too little weight during pregnancy, suggests that weight conditions during pregnancy may affect the child independently of genetic factors, said Monique Hedderson, another researcher on the study. \n \n In fact, the impact of inappropriate weight gain during pregnancy on child\'s weight appeared to be stronger among normal weight women than among those who were obese or underweight before pregnancy, the researchers said. \n \n According to the Institute of Medicine, the amount of weight that women are recommended to gain during pregnancy depends on their BMI before pregnancy. Obese women who have a BMI of 30 or greater are recommended to gain between 11 and 20 pounds during pregnancy, and overweight women (with a BMI between 25 and 29) are recommended to gain 15 to 25 pounds. Underweight women (with a BMI less than 18.5) are recommended to gain 28 to 40 pounds. \n \n Email Bahar Gholipour or follow her @alterwired. Follow us @LiveScience, Facebook & Google+.

Gaining either too much or too little weight can both result in a greater chance that child will be obese, LiveScience reports. The research followed 4,145 women and their kids between ages 2 and 5. What they found: Women with a normal body mass index before pregnancy are advised to gain 25 to 35 pounds; those who gained less were 63% more likely to have an overweight or obese kid. Moms in that group who gained more than that recommended amount were 80% more likely to have an overweight or obese kid. Of all women who gained less than the recommended amount of weight, some 19.5% had overweight or obese kids. Of those who gained more, 20.4% had kids in that category; that's compared to 14.5% of kids whose moms gained the recommended amount of weight. Why? ""Gaining either too little or too much weight in pregnancy may permanently affect mechanisms that manage energy balance and metabolism in the offspring, such as appetite control and energy expenditure,"" a researcher says.

Italy\'s was just above 6 percent. \n \n ""The financial markets ... aren\'t relaxing their pressure on Spain. Doubts continue regarding the construction of Europe, about the present and the future of the euro,"" Treasury Minister Cristobal Montoro told the Spanish Senate during a budget hearing. \n \n ""The ECB must respond firmly, with reliability, to these market pressures that are still trying to derail the joint euro project."" \n \n Within a few hours of the election result - a narrow win for Greek parties committed to the terms of a European Union/International Monetary Fund bailout - financial markets reacted as if nothing had changed. \n \n The response underlined the essential problem facing the euro zone; short-term improvements to the climate do not address the root problem that finances are perilously tight in the middle of an economic downturn. \n \n ""While Greek euro exit fears have ... eased, this (election) outcome does little to alleviate the weak fundamentals that currently weigh on Spain and Italy,"" Michala Marcussen, an economist at Societe Generale, said in a research note. \n \n Even so, a meltdown at the prospect of a Greek government pledged to reneging on its commitments and possibly forcing Greece out of the euro zone was averted, so leaders of Italy and Spain welcomed the narrow victory for Greek mainstream parties. \n \n ""This allows us to have a more serene vision for the future of the European Union and for the euro zone,"" Italian Prime Minster Mario Monti told reporters in Mexico upon arriving for a G-20 summit. \n \n Also speaking before the same meeting, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy greeted the election outcome as ""good news for Greece, very good news for the European Union, for the euro and also for Spain"". \n \n Rajoy, like Montoro on Monday, has repeatedly called for the ECB to act to defend the euro zone, implicitly wanting it to resume a massive bond-buying programme that held down yields of government debt in recent months. The ECB is reluctant to fire up the programme again. \n \n COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION \n \n For Italy and Spain, the bond market reaction to the Greek vote suggested that the euro zone crisis needs a comprehensive solution before markets can start to build confidence. \n \n The share and currency markets were also underwhelmed by the Greek results. After an initial spike, Europe\'s top shares and the euro were flat within a couple of hours of opening on Monday. \n \n Sceptics don\'t have to look far to see why: Spanish banks\' bad loans rose to the highest percentage of their outstanding portfolios since April 1994, according to the Bank of Spain. \n \n An audit later this week is expected to show Spanish banks needing between 60 billion and 70 billion euros (47.90- 56.2 billion pounds) in capital. \n \n There were mixed signals from Germany about whether it would tolerate a slight easing of demands on Greece. \n \n It is also unclear how deep the divisions will be between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande over easing back on austerity programmes in favour of growth. These questions are the kind that keep markets on edge and drive investors away from what they see as riskier assets. \n \n ""Our concern remains that little will be delivered in terms of additional risk-sharing measures, leaving markets, and as such the economies, vulnerable to renewed stress,"" said Marcussen of Societe General. \n \n (Written by Jeremy Gaunt; Editing by Peter Graff)', 'The Chicago Tribune filed a lawsuit against Mayor Rahm Emanuel on Thursday over claims he violated open records laws by failing to disclose personal emails and text messages used to conduct official city business. \n \n The complaint, filed in Cook County Circuit Court, asks a judge for an injunction to force the former White House chief of staff to produce documents, as well as having him declared in violation of the Illinois Local Records Act. \n \n The newspaper, which filed a lawsuit over email chains in June, argued that its Freedom of Information Act requests to Emanuel\'s administration have been ""met with a pattern of non-compliance, partial compliance, delay and obfuscation,"" according to the lawsuit. \n \n ""We are seeking the release of public records on matters of great interest to citizens, but the city refuses to divulge them,"" Tribune Editor Gerould Kern said in a statement.

President Barack Obama has sought to reassure Americans by saying authorities are equipped to prevent attacks in the U.S. \n \n The day after Salata got through security in Utah, TSA officials in Washington announced enhanced security for certain inbound international flights in response to an explosion aboard a Russian passenger jet after takeoff from Egypt. \n \n Salata was detained when the woman who had left the pass checked in using a replacement ticket that had been uploaded to her phone. \n \n TSA spokeswoman Lori Dankers said an agent made a mistake in identifying Salata, but the man was properly screened to determine if he was carrying anything dangerous. \n \n ""There are multiple layers of security in place,"" Dankers said in an email to the newspaper.

263,"['After exploring a world populated by “anthropomorphic rabbits and a pair of gay lovers” for over 30 years, “Simpsons” creator Matt Groening is putting down his pen and ending his highly acclaimed comic strip, “Life in Hell.” \n \n The last “Life in Hell,” Groening’s 1,669th strip, was released on Friday, June 15. For the next four weeks, editors will have their choice of strips from Groening’s extensive archive before they close up shop in July on Friday the 13, which seems oddly appropriate. \n \n “I’ve had great fun, in a Sisyphean kind of way, but the time has come to let Binky and Sheba and Bongo and Akbar and Jeff take some time off,” Groening, 58, said by email. \n \n “It’s hard to imagine how the business model that sustained alternative social-commentary and political cartooning for two decades (and is now all but dead) would have evolved had papers not discovered the power of Groening’s strip and its ability to attract readers,” said syndicated cartoonist Ted Rall by phone. \n \n \n \n The popularity of “Life in Hell” opened a path for a new breed of alternative cartoonists to appear in alt-weeklies across the country, cartoonists like Tom Tomorrow, Ruben Bolling, Ward Sutton, Keith Knight and Rall. It also showcased the power of sharp, biting cartoons to editors looking to attain and grow a new group of readers. \n \n “Groening is modern cartooning’s rock God, a Moses who came down from the mountain (or the East Village office of the Voice) and handed us the rules we followed,” said Rall. \n \n “Life in Hell”‘s newspaper count has dwindled over the years as cutbacks and consolidation forced out many features. Syndicated by Acme Features Syndicate, which Groening created, the strip hit a peak of nearly 380 papers in the early 1990s. In recent years, the strip appeared in less than 40. \n \n One high-profile cancellation came from LA Weekly, which removed the strip back in 2009 due to budget cuts. Pandora Young, an editor for Mediabistro’s FishbowlLA (and a former LA Weekly staffer), was incensed by the news. \n \n “Groening has been good to the Weekly over the years — making himself available to the staff for interviews, illustrating covers for the Weekly for the paper’s small standard fee despite his enormous success, and continuing to read the paper itself,” Young wrote when she found out. \n \n “Dropping the cartoon seems incredibly short-sighted, so it’s probably safe to assume it was a decision made by the corporate offices in Phoenix.” \n \n “Life in Hell” actually earned Groening his big break in Hollywood. It started running in Wet Magazine in 1978, then moved to the now-defunct LA Reader, where Groening worked. The strip eventually made its way to LA Weekly. Its popularity grew, amassing a client list of more than 250 papers, when producer Polly Platt noticed “Life in Hell” and showed it to actor/producer James L. Brooks. \n \n Brooks contacted Groening and wanted him to develop a series of “bumpers” based on “Life in Hell” for “The Tracey Ullman Show.” Groening was a bit apprehensive at the thought of handing over the rights to his characters, so he created the Simpsons to fill the slot. \n \n For Sondra Gatewood, who has handled syndication duties for Groening over the years, the end of “Life in Hell” is bittersweet. \n \n “It’s been a delight working for Matt Groening for the past 24 years, and the ending of ‘Life in Hell’ leaves me with mixed and melancholic feelings,” said Gatewood by phone. \n \n “I’ve thought about comic strips every day for the past 24 years. How does it get any better than that?” \n \n This is the final “Life is Hell” strip, which ran Friday, June 15. \n \n Rob Tornoe is a political cartoonist and a Poynter contributor.

But unlike the no-less-crudely drawn Springfield crew that debuted on Fox in 1987, they belonged to Matt Groening free and clear in the panels of Life in Hell, the syndicated weekly comic strip that the part-time cartoonist discontinued last week after 32 years. With a new season of Futurama starting on June 20th and more than 500 episodes of The Simpsons in the can, the question isn\'t so much why Groening is quitting Life in Hell, but rather how he kept it so incisive and funny for so long. \n \n Why pull the plug on Life in Hell now? Did you simply run out of jokes? \n \n It\'s pretty obvious that I ran out of jokes a couple of decades ago – but that doesn\'t stop any cartoonist! \n \n Seriously, though, what drove you to keep drawing it week after week for all those years? \n \n When I started doing the comic strip, it was a great forum for all of my creativity. I\'d think about the comic strip all week, spend a day drawing it, and then start thinking about the next one. It was my complete and total focus. Then The Simpsons came along to preoccupy me, and I decided to see how long I could keep the comic strip going. Actually, a TV producer sneered at the strip and said, ""Why do you bother? Give it up."" Because of that, I dug in my heels and kept it going two decades longer than I might have. I also liked the idea of having one slice of my creative output being completely solo, unlike TV animation. It\'s very satisfying to sit down at a drawing table by yourself and solve a puzzle with a deadline. \n \n How many papers were you in when you called it quits? \n \n Thirty-eight. Weekly papers are having a tough time because of the Internet and all the problems of print journalism. I was proud to be in those papers, and I wish I could continue, but I gave it a shot for 30-odd years. I want to see if I can use the time I spent working on the strip to do something else creative, maybe something more ambitious. The comic strip kept me tethered to the drawing table every week and it will be nice to see what happens without it. \n \n How many newspapers printed Hell at its peak? \n \n It was in 250 papers for a while. I remember walking down Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles with Gary Panter one day, and both of us being thrilled when we saw our strips soaking in the gutter. We were part of the landscape! \n \n How many Life in Hell strips have you drawn altogether? \n \n I don\'t know. Around 1,700 or so. \n \n How has it changed over the decades? \n \n It\'s gotten simpler. I stopped drawing backgrounds around the time I got into TV animation and began to focus on characters and dialog, with some exceptions. I didn\'t feel like I had to make a grand statement the way I did in some of my earlier strips. \n \n Any plans to do anything with the Hell characters elsewhere? \n \n I\'m probably going to continue to do calendars, and there are many, many strips I haven\'t collected in books. I\'ve toyed with the idea of putting out a complete edition. I may even do the strip again, I don\'t know. But probably not. \n \n What are Life in Hell\'s biggest artistic inspirations? \n \n First would be Charles Schultz\'s Peanuts, a strip about neurotic turmoil that was drawn very simply. As astute followers of Life in Hell will notice, Akbar and Jeff wear the same striped T-shirt as Charlie Brown. Peanuts was very important to me. I remember one comic in which Lucy makes a row of sand sculptures with her bucket and then stomps each one in succession. She looks at Charlie Brown and says, ""I am torn between the desire to create and the desire to destroy."" As a kid I thought, ""That\'s me! I can relate!"" There\'s also Jules Feiffer, because he was able to do a weekly comic strip in the Village Voice as well as books and screenplays and everything else. He was a great role model. And then of course my former Evergreen State College classmate Lynda Barry, whose Ernie Pook\'s Comeek didn\'t treat the comic strip like old-time vaudeville. It wasn\'t setup, setup, punch line. She\'s an underacknowledged pioneer of a lot of things people are doing in graphic novels and graphic memoirs. \n \n Which Hell strips are you proudest of? \n \n I like all of the early relationship strips that were collected in Love Is Hell, where I pretended to be an expert in relationships and did comics like ""The Nine Types of Boyfriends,"" ""Sixteen Ways to End a Relationship,"" ""Twenty-Four Things Not to Say in Bed,"" and other arbitrarily numbered lists. My very favorite strips over the years, however, were the self-indulgently parental ones in which I tape recorded and then illustrated my kids\' arguments and stories. Now they say, ""We\'re not funny anymore, Dad. And neither are you."" \n \n How did you wrap it all up? What happens in the final ""Life in Hell""? \n \n Binky says to his girlfriend, ""Just once I want to hear the three sweetest little words in life come from your lips."" She says, ""I forgive you."" And he says, ""Close enough!""']",2,"– Matt Groening has decided to pull the plug on acclaimed comic strip Life in Hell, 34 years after he started it and many years after its anthropomorphic rabbits and gay lovers were eclipsed by his other creations. Groening, 58, started the strip when he was a struggling artist in 1978 and kept producing it weekly even after becoming a multimillionaire, although cuts to comic pages nationwide saw its circulation fall to fewer than 40 publications from a peak of 380. In the mid-80s, Groening was asked to animate the strip's characters for the Tracey Ullman Show, but, unwilling to hand over the rights to his creations, came up with new characters—the Simpsons. In a Rolling Stone interview, Groening says he kept doing the strip because he enjoyed ""one slice of my creative output being completely solo,"" and because he ""dug in his heels"" when a sneering TV executive asked him why he bothered to continue with it. ""I’ve had great fun, in a Sisyphean kind of way, but the time has come to let Binky and Sheba and Bongo and Akbar and Jeff take some time off,"" Groening tells Poynter. The final Life in Hell strip, the 1,669th, was released on Friday. Click here to see it."
264,"['Glacial Melting: A recent study provides the first ""direct"" evidence that Canadian Arctic temperatures in the last century exceeded the peak warmth of the earlier Holocene Thermal Maximum, suggesting today\'s unusual warming period can only be caused by greenhouse gases Image: World Resources Institute/Flickr \n \n Scientists have long known that the Arctic is warming faster than the rest of the globe, even as they had less of a grasp of how recent trends compare to thousands of years ago. \n \n Now, a new study aims to fill the knowledge gap by concluding that recent summer warming in the eastern Canadian Arctic is unprecedented in more than 44,000 years. Prior research documented melt and temperature dynamics going back about 2,000 to 4,000 years in comparison, said study lead author Gifford Miller, associate director of the Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research at the University of Colorado, Boulder. \n \n The findings, published online in Geophysical Research Letters this week, counter the conclusions of some prior studies suggesting that natural forces -- along with greenhouse gases -- may be contributing to some of the extensive Arctic warming. The study also suggests that climate models are underestimating Arctic changes, as their past predictions were off by more than 2 degrees Celsius. \n \n ""Our study pushes the clock way back,"" said Scott Lehman, a research professor at the institute and co-author of the paper. \n \n The scientists concluded that the level of warming now matches or goes beyond what occurred during a natural warm period about 5,000 to 10,000 years ago, known as the Holocene Thermal Maximum. The study provides the first ""direct"" evidence that Canadian Arctic temperatures in the last century exceeded the peak warmth of that earlier thermal maximum, the scientists said. \n \n Discovery linked to ancient vegetation \n \n The fact that certain ice caps did not melt during the Holocene Thermal Maximum, despite the extreme warmth at the time, suggests that today\'s unusual warming period can only be caused by greenhouse gases, Miller said. \n \n ""Nothing else out there can explain it,"" Miller said. Based on the Earth\'s current position in relation to the sun, the region should be cooling in the summer, not warming, he said. \n \n The scientists benefited from a discovery of vegetation on Baffin Island in the Canadian territory of Nunavut. When ice caps receded on the island in recent decades, they revealed mosses long entombed in the ice. \n \n The mosses became exposed recently, in the past year or so. A longer period would have eroded or blown them away, according to the study. Therefore, the scientists determined that the last time the vegetation appeared was during melting of the ice caps. \n \n Via radiocarbon dating of 365 vegetation samples, they determined that some of the newly exposed mosses from four of the ice caps were at least 40,000 years old. ""We never expected to find plants that old,"" Miller said. \n \n Their old age means that the ice caps entombing them had not melted for at least that long, staying colder than the present day through the peak warmth of the Holocene thermal maximum. \n \n During that time, about 5,000 to 10,000 years ago, the eastern Canadian Arctic was closer to the sun in the summer than now, because of natural variabilities in Earth\'s orbit. The amount of solar radiation hitting the area was about 9 percent higher than now. \n \n Some of the tested vegetation samples were younger, indicating that their ice cap resting places on Baffin Island melted during the peak Holocene warmth 5,000 to 10,000 years ago. However, the melted caps were very close to the ones that remained intact for at least 44,000 years, Miller said. \n \n Are models underestimating warming? \n \n ""Those ice caps that didn\'t melt, you can throw a stone at a slightly lower ice cap that did melt. They are all mixed in together,"" Miller said. That means that average summer temperatures now are unprecedented in the region in comparison to the past 44,000 years, the study said. The scientists studied 110 ice caps on Baffin Island in total.', 'CU-Boulder Professor Gifford Miller is shown here collecting dead plant samples from beneath a Baffin Island ice cap. Credit: Gifford Miller, University of Colorado Boulder (Phys.org) —The heat is on, at least in the Arctic. Average summer temperatures in the Eastern Canadian Arctic during the last 100 years are higher now than during any century in the past 44,000 years and perhaps as long ago as 120,000 years, says a new University of Colorado Boulder study. \n \n The study is the first direct evidence the present warmth in the Eastern Canadian Arctic exceeds the peak warmth there in the Early Holocene, when the amount of the sun\'s energy reaching the Northern Hemisphere in summer was roughly 9 percent greater than today, said CU-Boulder geological sciences Professor Gifford Miller, study leader. The Holocene is a geological epoch that began after Earth\'s last glacial period ended roughly 11,700 years ago and which continues today. \n \n Miller and his colleagues used dead moss clumps emerging from receding ice caps on Baffin Island as tiny clocks. At four different ice caps, radiocarbon dates show the mosses had not been exposed to the elements since at least 44,000 to 51,000 years ago. \n \n Since radiocarbon dating is only accurate to about 50,000 years and because Earth\'s geological record shows it was in a glaciation stage prior to that time, the indications are that Canadian Arctic temperatures today have not been matched or exceeded for roughly 120,000 years, Miller said. \n \n ""The key piece here is just how unprecedented the warming of Arctic Canada is,"" said Miller, also a fellow at CU-Boulder\'s Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research. ""This study really says the warming we are seeing is outside any kind of known natural variability, and it has to be due to increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere."" \n \n A paper on the subject appeared online Oct. 23 in Geophysical Research Letters, a journal published by the American Geophysical Union. Co-authors include CU-Boulder Senior Research Associate Scott Lehman, former CU-Boulder doctoral student and now Prescott College Professor Kurt Refsnider, University of California Irvine researcher John Southon and University of Wisconsin, Madison Research Associate Yafang Zhong. The National Science Foundation provided the primary funding for the study. \n \n Miller and his colleagues compiled the age distribution of 145 radiocarbon-dated plants in the highlands of Baffin Island that were exposed by ice recession during the year they were collected by the researchers. All samples collected were within 1 meter of the ice caps, which are generally receding by 2 to 3 meters a year. ""The oldest radiocarbon dates were a total shock to me,"" said Miller. \n \n Located just east of Greenland, the 196,000-square-mile Baffin Island is the fifth largest island in the world. Most of it lies above the Arctic Circle. Many of the ice caps on the highlands of Baffin Island rest on relatively flat terrain, usually frozen to their beds. ""Where the ice is cold and thin, it doesn\'t flow, so the ancient landscape on which they formed is preserved pretty much intact,"" said Miller. \n \n To reconstruct the past climate of Baffin Island beyond the limit of radiocarbon dating, Miller and his team used data from ice cores previously retrieved by international teams from the nearby Greenland Ice Sheet. \n \n The ice cores showed that the youngest time interval from which summer temperatures in the Arctic were plausibly as warm as today is about 120,000 years ago, near the end of the last interglacial period. ""We suggest this is the most likely age of these samples,"" said Miller. \n \n The new study also showed summer temperatures cooled in the Canadian Arctic by about 5 degrees Fahrenheit from roughly 5,000 years ago to about 100 years ago – a period that included the Little Ice Age from 1275 to about 1900. \n \n ""Although the Arctic has been warming since about 1900, the most significant warming in the Baffin Island region didn\'t really start until the 1970s,"" said Miller. ""And it is really in the past 20 years that the warming signal from that region has been just stunning. All of Baffin Island is melting, and we expect all of the ice caps to eventually disappear, even if there is no additional warming."" \n \n Temperatures across the Arctic have been rising substantially in recent decades as a result of the buildup of greenhouse gases in Earth\'s atmosphere. Studies by CU-Boulder researchers in Greenland indicate temperatures on the ice sheet have climbed 7 degrees Fahrenheit since 1991. \n \n A 2012 study by Miller and colleagues using radiocarbon-dated mosses that emerged from under the Baffin Island ice caps and sediment cores from Iceland suggested that the trigger for the Little Ice Age was likely a combination of exploding tropical volcanoes – which ejected tiny aerosols that reflected sunlight back into space – and a decrease in solar radiation. \n \n Explore further: Baffin Island ice caps shrink by 50 percent since 1950s, study']",2,"– The Arctic's current warming trend is the worst it's experienced in at least 44,000 years—and possibly even longer—a new study has concluded. Scientists examining vegetation in the Canadian Arctic found recently-exposed moss that, based on radiocarbon dating, was between 44,000 and 51,000 years old—meaning the ice surrounding it hadn't melted in at least that long, Scientific American reports. ""Our study pushes the clock way back,"" says one researcher at the University of Colorado. What's more, because radiocarbon dating is only accurate to about 50,000 years, and geological records show a glacial period preceding that, it's probable that current temperatures actually haven't been seen in 120,000 years, the lead researcher tells Phys.org. That the ice is melting now, but failed to melt during the extremely warm Holocene Thermal Maximum, is a sign that this isn't natural variance, and is almost surely caused by greenhouse gases, he adds.

Powder director Victor Salva was convicted in 1988 of of sexual misconduct for molesting a 12-year-old actor who appeared his film Clownhouse. \n \n Numerous celebrities have spoken up for Gunn, including a number of the Guardians of the Galaxy castmembers. \n \n Gunn apologized for the tweets and said they did not reflect the person he has become. However, he said he accepted Disney\'s decision. \n \n An online petition created by a fan, asking Disney to rehire Gunn, has gained more than 200,000 signatures.', 'A student at Georgia Southern University shared an allegedly racist student text message that caused concern on campus. \n \n The student, in screening a new roommate, mistakenly sent out a text to the wrong person, in which she used the slur. \n \n The student apologized, saying she meant to type “triggerish” but that was autocorrected by her phone to the slur. \n \n “I meant to say triggerfish, meaning like, you seemed really cool nothing that triggered a red flag! I’m so embarrassed I apologize,” Courtney Schaefer said by phone. \n \n Friday, university president Shelley C. Nickel sent a message to the community saying “the use of such racist comments is offensive” and doesn’t reflect university standards. \n \n But Georgia Southern students Marah Giddens and Alexandria Duvet feel a press release isn’t enough, and both said they wanted to know whether further action would be taken. \n \n “These things have been happening on our campus and campuses all over the country,” Giddens said. “If someone isn’t punished for their racism and bigotry then what will ignite a change?” \n \n The university declined to comment about whether there were plans for further action. \n \n Will Creeley, with the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, said there ares different ways universities can choose to handle such incidents depending on severity, pervasion and persistence. \n \n “The basic rule is that public universities like Georgia Southern are government actors and they are bound to uphold the First Amendment on campus,” he said. “At a public university bound by the First Amendment, the use of a racial slur might be protected speech.” \n \n But, he said, the university is also obliged to abide by Title VI of the Civil Rights Act Of 1964, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, and national origin. \n \n “Under Title VI, Georgia Southern has to take action if one student is creating a hostile environment against another student,” Creeley said. \n \n “If a student continues to use that slur or does other things to that student that makes it unreasonable for that student to continue to use the dorms or attend the university, then you’ve established a hostile environment.” \n \n The case is similar to that of Natalia Martinez, a Georgia State University soccer player who withdrew from university early this year after receiving backlash from students for using a racial slur on a social media post. \n \n Martinez was suspended from the soccer team and voluntarily dropped out of her courses after a petition with more than 1,000 signatures to expel her. \n \n There’s a third option, Creeley said, which would be of more value to all students. \n \n “[Georgia Southern] should also recognize that students coming to college can be educated. In some ways, discipline is allowing the student to come off easy, the work towards education is arguably more productive,” he said.']",2,"– Bobcat Goldthwait thinks Disney might want to remove his voice from one of its upcoming theme park attractions, so as not to appear ""hypocritical.""

Goldthwait had another suggestion for Disney, too: ""I think James Woods may have recorded a voice for this new attraction, too. Why not check out some of his whacky past tweets?! They’re a hoot!""

REUTERS/Carlo Allegri \n \n The FBI’s disclosure that it is investigating more emails as part of a probe into Clinton’s use of a private email server gave fresh energy to Trump. \n \n At rallies in New Hampshire, Maine and Iowa, Trump hit hard on his message that Clinton is a corrupt leader who cannot be trusted and he pulled back a bit on his charge that the political system is rigged against him. \n \n Trump called the new development part of “the biggest political scandal since Watergate,” the 1970s scandal that forced the resignation of Republican President Richard Nixon. \n \n Trump abruptly changed his tune after repeatedly attacking FBI Director James Comey in the last three months for not indicting Clinton for her handling of classified information while U.S. secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. \n \n “As you know, I’ve had plenty of words about the FBI lately, but I give them great credit for having the courage to right this horrible wrong. Justice will prevail,” Trump said in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. \n \n Trump has spent weeks railing about a “rigged system,” accusing the Clinton campaign of coordinating attacks on him with the U.S. news media after a 2005 video surfaced of him boasting about groping women. \n \n “It might not be as rigged as I thought,” Trump told a crowd in Manchester, New Hampshire. \n \n By Cedar Rapids, however, he was still criticizing “the corrupt political class” and calling the news media dishonest. \n \n At each stop, Trump’s supporters cheered loudly and chanted “lock her up” when the New York businessman talked about Clinton’s new headache, a sign that his boosters see the importance of some good news for his campaign with 10 days left until the Nov. 8 election. \n \n Trump noted that he is competitive in opinion polls nationally and in some states where the election is likely to be decided, but admitted he has got some distance to go. \n \n The new disclosures, he said, might help him. \n \n “We have gaps but we are really moving and I just wanted to say that because I don’t know what’s going to happen now,” he said.', 'Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta listens backstage to the democratic nominee at a rally in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, on Jan. 30, 2016. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post) \n \n This post has been updated with Hillary Clinton\'s comments. \n \n Hillary Clinton\'s campaign could have gone a few different ways with its response to the bombshell news that the FBI is looking into more emails related to its investigation of the Democratic nominee. \n \n It went with angry. \n \n The campaign\'s just-released statement, from chairman John Podesta, is remarkable. It begins by not-so-subtly suggesting that this is at least partially a political response to Republicans\' continued second-guessing of how the FBI handled its investigation, along with FBI Director James B. Comey\'s July conclusion that no ""reasonable prosecutor"" would bring charges against Clinton. \n \n ""Upon completing this investigation more than three months ago, FBI Director Comey declared no reasonable prosecutor would move forward with a case like this and added that it was not even a close call,"" Podesta said. ""In the months since, Donald Trump and his Republican allies have been baselessly second-guessing the FBI and, in both public and private, browbeating the career officials there to revisit their conclusion in a desperate attempt to harm Hillary Clinton\'s presidential campaign."" \n \n Podesta then called on the FBI to offer more details about what exactly is happening with the emails, which sources have told The Washington Post are actually from an unrelated investigation into disgraced former congressman Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.), who has separated from his wife, top Clinton aide Huma Abedin. \n \n Podesta also sounds furious that the FBI basically let people draw their own conclusions -- and let Republicans mischaracterize the announcement -- based on a three-paragraph letter and didn\'t provide more detail. \n \n ""Already, we have seen characterizations that the FBI is \'reopening\' an investigation, but Comey\'s words do not match that characterization,"" Podesta said. ""Director Comey\'s letter refers to emails that have come to light in an unrelated case, but we have no idea what those emails are, and the director himself notes they may not even be significant."" \n \n Podesta concludes: ""It is extraordinary that we would see something like this just 11 days out from a presidential election. The director owes it to the American people to immediately provide the full details of what he is now examining. We are confident this will not produce any conclusions different from the one the FBI reached in July."" \n \n FBI Director James Comey testified before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee July 7, about the recommendation that Hillary Clinton not be prosecuted for her handling of government emails on a private server. (Reuters) \n \n To be clear, the Clinton campaign has decided to fight this politically — not to play it off as some small thing and wait for more information. It is serving notice that Republicans won\'t be the only ones applying political pressure to the FBI as it decides what to do over the next two weeks. \n \n Podesta\'s first comments really drive that home. There is a reason the statement begins by pointing to the fact that this matter had been concluded before Republicans sought to keep re-raising it. Podesta saying that Republicans are ""browbeating"" career (i.e. nonpolitical) officials to ""revisit their conclusion"" suggests strongly that he\'s accused the FBI of reacting to that pressure — even if he doesn\'t directly say that. \n \n Expect more of this combative tone in the days ahead. \n \n Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton spoke to reporters Oct. 28 in Des Moines. (The Washington Post) \n \n Update: Clinton herself echoed Podesta\'s call for more disclosure in a delivered statement Friday night -- and also appeared somewhat exasperated by the lack of detail. \n \n ""We\'ve heard these rumors, and we don\'t know what to believe, and I\'m sure there will be even more rumors. That\'s why it is incumbent upon the FBI to tell us what they are talking about,"" Clinton, said, drawing out her syllables for emphasis. ""Because right now, your guess is as good as mine, and I don\'t think that\'s good enough."" \n \n Clinton said these details should be released ""without any delay."" \n \n ""Even Director Comey said that this information may not be significant,"" she said, ""so let\'s get it out."" \n \n Other Democrats offered similarly critical comments about the FBI. \n \n DNC Chair Donna Brazile called the announcement ""irresponsible."" \n \n ""Now, 11 days away from the election, [Comey] released a vague letter that immediately led to rampant speculation in the news media,"" Brazile said. ""This would be an irresponsible action at any time and, unsurprisingly, Donald Trump and Republicans are rushing to politicize this episode without any of the facts. \n \n Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), meanwhile, called it ""appalling."" \n \n ""The FBI has a history of extreme caution near Election Day so as not to influence the results,"" Feinstein said. ""Today’s break from that tradition is appalling.”', 'A CAREFUL listener to President Obama’s comments Friday on the destruction of a Malaysian airliner over Ukraine could discern where the president places responsibility for what he rightly called “an outrage of unspeakable proportions.” \n \n Mr. Obama said the United States was confident that the plane was shot down by a surface-to-air missile launched from an area controlled by Ukrainian separatists. He also said that the insurgents can’t shoot down planes “without sophisticated equipment and sophisticated training, and that is coming from Russia.” \n \n What was missing from the president’s comments was a clear moral conclusion about the regime of Vladi\xadmir Putin or an articulation of how the United States will respond to the killing of 298 innocent people, other than by “investigating exactly what happened and putting forward the facts.” An atrocity committed as a byproduct of Moscow’s attempt to violently break apart a sovereign nation demands a firmer response. \n \n It’s true that not all the facts are known — for example, whether Russian personnel had a direct role in manning the SA-11 surface-to-air missile system that U.S. officials say “likely” downed the plane. A Pentagon spokesman said Friday that “it strains credulity” that the rebels could have operated a system capable of striking a high-flying airliner without Russian help. Mr. Obama was right to insist on an unhampered international investigation and a cease-fire to allow it to go forward. However, since Moscow’s proxies are already removing evidence and preventing investigators from exploring the crash site, his insistence on its own isn’t worth much. The administration needs a strategy for enforcing the president’s words. \n \n Mr. Obama blamed Russia for continuing to stoke the rebellion in eastern Ukraine and hinted that his administration could add to the sanctions it has imposed on Moscow. But his pledge that “the United States is going to continue to lead efforts within the world community to de-escalate the situation” was at odds with the reality that he has allowed Germany and France to take over efforts to broker a cease-fire. The terms they have promoted, with implicit White House support, cater to Russia. They would create a negotiating group that included Mr. Putin’s regime and the insurgents but not Western governments, and they would not require the rebels to disarm or Russia to withdraw its mercenaries and heavy weapons. The likely result would be another of the “frozen conflicts” Russia has used to destabilize neighbors such as Georgia and Moldova. \n \n Pro-Russian fighters walk at the site of a crashed Malaysia Airlines passenger plane near the village of Hrabove, Ukraine, eastern Ukraine Friday, July 18, 2014. (Dmitry Lovetsky/AP) \n \n A meaningful response to the shootdown will not come from the “world community,” and it may not come from the European Union, which has been deadlocked over adopting significant sanctions. But the United States has the power to take steps, particularly in the financial sector, that could force Mr. Putin to choose between continued aggression in Ukraine and saving the Russian economy. It can also provide Ukraine with military assistance to counter Russia’s supplies to the rebels. If Mr. Obama leads, other nations are more likely to take steps, too. \n \n Mr. Obama said that the Malaysia Airlines tragedy should be “a wake-up call” about “the consequences to an escalating conflict in eastern Ukraine.” He was speaking about the Europeans, but the message also applies to the White House. Half-steps and symbolic gestures will not stop Russia’s aggression or the atrocities it produces.', 'Update \n \n While commercials for this body fragrance imply people will be drawn to the user, this encounter with the deodorant had people fleeing a building in Seattle on Friday. \n \n A can of Axe body spray is being blamed for an incident that had the Seattle Fire Department evacuating a University District church and daycare center, and calling in a hazmat team. \n \n A backpack left in a bathroom was giving off ""cough inducing fumes"" on March 18, according to the Seattle Police Department.

At a Friday night press conference in Iowa, Clinton told reporters that she wants the FBI to release the ""full and complete facts"" about its renewed probe, which centers on emails found on devices seized during the unrelated Anthony Weiner sexting investigation. Clinton—who was cleared by the FBI in July—told reporters that she is confident that whatever issue investigators found ""will not change the conclusion reached in July,"" making it ""imperative that the bureau explain this issue in question, whatever it is, without any delay,"" CNN reports. A round-up of coverage: Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta used sterner words than Clinton, saying FBI Director James Comey ""owes it to the American people"" to explain the move immediately, reports the Washington Post. ""It is extraordinary that we would see something like this just 11 days out from a presidential election,"" said Podesta. He said that based on what little information the FBI has provided, it could be a mischaracterization even to say the investigation has been ""reopened."" Podesta suggested the move was politically motivated. ""In the months since, Donald Trump and his Republican allies have been baselessly second-guessing the FBI and, in both public and private, browbeating the career officials there to revisit their conclusion in a desperate attempt to harm Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign,"" he said. At rallies in Maine and New Hampshire Friday, Trump did not conceal his glee at what he described as a correction of a ""grave miscarriage of justice."" ""This is the biggest political scandal since Watergate, and I'm sure it will be properly handled from this point forward,"" he told a crowd in Maine, adding that he hope justice will be ""fully served,"" reports Reuters. Top Republicans including Paul Ryan also welcomed the development, the New York Times reports. ""Hillary Clinton has nobody but herself to blame,"" the House speaker said in a statement. ""She was entrusted with some of our nation’s most important secrets, and she betrayed that trust by carelessly mishandling highly classified information."" In a letter to FBI employees, Comey explained his decision to break tradition and inform Congress about a politically sensitive investigation so close to an election. ""I feel an obligation to do so given that I testified repeatedly in recent months that our investigation was completed,"" Comey said. ""I also think it would be misleading to the American people were we not to supplement the record."" Politico reports that while it is too early to gauge the impact on Clinton's White House hopes, the race was already tightening and the email development is likely to bring her poll numbers further down. A recent Fox News poll found that 84% of independent voters do not consider Clinton honest or trustworthy. Analysts say that for Clinton, one of the worst aspects of the development is the involvement of Weiner and his multiple sex scandals. He is the estranged husband of top Clinton aide Huma Abedin, who left him in August. ""The whole campaign is now smeared with sex, corruption, and scandal,"" Democratic strategist Hank Sheinkopf tells Reuters."

The signal response has been assessed over low (20 to 120 ppb) as well as higher (1-15 ppm range) levels. The sensor has been applied to monitor potential FA fumes of some artwork in two locations: the Tate’s gallery in London, during the display of several pieces of Damien Hirst, as well as in the Summer Palace in Beijing. In the first case, one of Hirst’s main subjects is the setting-up of giant fish tanks filled by thousands of liters of FA, in which intact biological specimens are immersed, such as zebras, cows, calves, even sharks. The parallelepiped-shaped basins are then covered with a lid and fully sealed with silicon gums. It has been found that the tanks are surrounded by FA fumes, constantly exuded in the atmosphere (likely via the sealant), reaching levels of 5 ppm, one order of magnitude higher than the 0.5 ppm limit set up by legislation.

274,"['Whether it\'s an embarrassing situation at work or a bad date, everyone has memories they\'d rather forget, and now new research suggests a way to do just that. \n \n In the study, researchers found that trying to push away your thoughts about the less obvious, background aspects of such memories was key to intentionally forgetting something. Those background aspects may include the smells and sounds related to the actual events you\'d rather not remember. \n \n For example, if you wanted to forget the details of a conversation you just had, ""you could push out of your mind a song playing in the background, or thoughts related to a scene happening outside your window or something like that,"" said study co-author Jeremy Manning, an assistant professor of psychological and brain sciences at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire. \n \n Although the researchers did not examine the details of the strategies people in the study employed to mentally push out certain thoughts, researchers have previously suggested two main strategies that might help in this process, Manning said. [7 Thoughts That Are Bad For You] \n \n One strategy is to clear one\'s mind and deliberately try to think of nothing, and the other involves trying fill one\'s mind with thoughts about something very different than whatever a person is trying to forget. ""If you don\'t want to think of the color blue, you think of green things instead, or red,"" Manning told Live Science. ""Or, ifyou don\'t want to think of one song, you try to distract yourself with another song."" \n \n In the new study, the researchers looked at 25 people ages 19 to 34. The researchers gave the participants lists of words to study while showing them images of outdoor scenes, such as forests, mountains and beaches. The researchers then asked the people to try to either remember the words on the list or forget them. Meanwhile, the researchers scanned the people\'s brains to look at their brain activity throughout the experiment. \n \n Results showed that when the people were asked to forget the words, they tried to push out of their minds thoughts related to the images they had been shown while studying the words. ""It\'s like intentionally pushing thoughts of your grandmother\'s cooking out of your mind if you don\'t want to think about your grandmother at that moment,"" Manning said in a statement. \n \n However, this pushing out of the images did not occur when the people were asked to remember the words, according to the study, published May 5 in the journal Psychonomic Bulletin & Review. [Why You Forget: 5 Strange Facts About Memory] \n \n It also turned out that that when the people were told to forget the words, the more they pushed away their thoughts about the images, the fewer words they were actually able to recall later on. This finding shows that the process is effective at facilitating forgetting, the researchers said. \n \n Though studies of memory often focus on how people remember things, forgetting can sometimes be beneficial, too, Manning said. For example, some people, such as soldiers with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), may want to forget traumatic events, he said. ""Or we might want to get outdated information \'out of our head,\' so we can focus on learning new material,"" he said.

Originally published on Live Science.', 'HANOVER, N.H. - Context plays a big role in our memories, both good and bad. Bruce Springsteen\'s ""Born to Run"" on the car radio, for example, may remind you of your first love -- or your first speeding ticket. But a Dartmouth- and Princeton-led brain scanning study shows that people can intentionally forget past experiences by changing how they think about the context of those memories. \n \n The findings have a range of potential applications centered on enhancing desired memories, such as developing new educational tools, or diminishing harmful memories, including treatments for post-traumatic stress disorder. \n \n The study appears in the journal Psychonomic Bulletin and Review. A PDF is available on request. \n \n Since Ancient Greece, memory theorists have known that we use context -- or the situation we\'re in, including sights, sounds, smells, where we are, who we are with -- to organize and retrieve our memories. But the Dartmouth- and Princeton-led team wanted to know whether and how people can intentionally forget past experiences. They designed a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment to specifically track thoughts related to memories\' contexts, and put a new twist on a centuries-old psychological research technique of having subjects memorize and recall a list of unrelated words. In the new study, researchers showed participants images of outdoor scenes, such as forests, mountains and beaches, as they studied two lists of random words, manipulating whether they were told to forget or remember the first list prior to studying the second list. \n \n ""Our hope was the scene images would bias the background, or contextual, thoughts that people had as they studied the words to include scene-related thoughts,"" says lead author Jeremy Manning, an assistant professor of psychological and brain sciences at Dartmouth. ""We used fMRI to track how much people were thinking of scene-related things at each moment during our experiment. That allowed us to track, on a moment-by-moment basis, how those scene or context representations faded in and out of people\'s thoughts over time."" \n \n The study\'s participants were told to either forget or remember the random words presented to them interspersed between scene images. Right after they were told to forget, the fMRI showed that they ""flushed out"" the scene-related activity from their brains. \n \n ""It\'s like intentionally pushing thoughts of your grandmother\'s cooking out of your mind if you don\'t want to think about your grandmother at that moment,"" Manning says. ""We were able to physically measure and quantify that process using brain data."" \n \n But when the researchers told participants to remember the studied list rather than forget it, this flushing out of scene-related thoughts didn\'t occur. Further, the amount that people flushed out scene-related thoughts predicted how many of the studied words they would later remember, which shows the process is effective at facilitating forgetting. \n \n The study has two important implications. ""First, memory studies are often concerned with how we remember rather than how we forget, and forgetting is typically viewed as a \'failure\' in some sense, but sometimes forgetting can be beneficial, too,"" Manning says. ""For example, we might want to forget a traumatic event, such as soldiers with PTSD. Or we might want to get old information \'out of our head,\' so we can focus on learning new material. Our study identified one mechanism that supports these processes."" \n \n The second implication is more subtle but also important. ""It\'s very difficult to specifically identify the neural representations of contextual information,"" Manning says. ""If you consider the context you experience something in, we\'re really referring to the enormously complex, seemingly random thoughts you had during that experience. Those thoughts are presumably idiosyncratic to you as an individual, and they\'re also potentially unique to that specific moment. So, tracking the neural representations of these things is extremely challenging because we only ever have one measurement of a particular context. Therefore, you can\'t directly train a computer to recognize what context \'looks like\' in the brain because context is a continually moving and evolving target. In our study, we sidestepped this issue using a novel experimental manipulation -- we biased people to incorporate those scene images into the thoughts they had when they studied new words. Since those scenes were common across people and over time, we were able to use fMRI to track the associated mental representations from moment to moment."" \n \n ### \n \n Dartmouth Assistant Professor Jeremy Manning is available to comment at Jeremy.R.Manning@dartmouth.edu. \n \n The study, which included scientists at Bard College and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champagne, was supported by the John Templeton Foundation, the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation.']",2,"– There are plenty of people who might benefit from intentionally forgetting certain memories—those who've been in combat, or suffered some form of abuse, for instance, and consequently struggle with post-traumatic stress disorder. Now researchers at Dartmouth report in the journal Psychonomic Bulletin & Review that they've figured out a way to help people do that through ""contextually mediated intentional forgetting."" In less academic jargon: If we want to forget certain memories, we should try to clear our minds of the context related to them. ""It's like intentionally pushing thoughts of your grandmother's cooking out of your mind if you don't want to think about your grandmother at that moment,"" says lead author Jeremy Manning in a press release. ""We were able to physically measure and quantify that process using brain data."" In their brain imaging study of 25 participants ages 19 to 34, researchers found that if they alternated images of words and outdoor scenes—think forests or beaches—and then asked participants to try to forget those words, people tried to ""flush out"" thoughts related to the images. Those who most successfully pushed those images out of mind recalled the fewest number of words. So to forget an awkward conversation, Manning tells Live Science we should try to forget other things that happened in the background as it took place: the song playing, for instance, perhaps by thinking of another song. As Manning puts it, ""If you don't want to think of the color blue, you think of green things instead."" (In other news, memories lost to dementia may be retrievable.)"

276,"['PRETORIA (Reuters) - “Blade Runner” Oscar Pistorius told a friend to take the blame for him accidentally firing a pistol under the table in a packed Johannesburg restaurant in January 2013, a month before he killed his girlfriend, his murder trial heard on Wednesday. \n \n Testifying at the trial of the South African Olympic and Paralympic track star, professional boxer Kevin Lerena described how he, Pistorius and two others had been having dinner at Tashas restaurant when the gun went off. \n \n The charge of firing a gun in a public place is part of prosecution attempts to portray the 27-year-old athlete, who shot dead model Reeva Steenkamp on February 14 last year, as a firearms-obsessed hot-head. \n \n Pistorius denies murdering Steenkamp, saying he fired four rounds from a 9 mm pistol through a locked toilet door at his luxury Pretoria home after mistaking her for an intruder. \n \n Lerena, who goes by the ring name “The KO Kid”, said one of the group at the table in Tashas, Darren Fresco, passed his pistol under the table to Pistorius during the lunch, telling him there was “one up”, indicating a round was in the chamber. \n \n “A shot went off. Then there was just complete silence,” Lerena said. “I looked down at the floor and exactly where I looked down, where my foot was, there was a hole in the floor.” \n \n “I had a little graze on my toe, but I wasn’t hurt,” he added. \n \n Restaurant owner Jason Loupis told the court 220 diners had been present at the time.

REUTERS/Alon Skuy/Pool \n \n “TAKE THE BLAME” \n \n Pistorius immediately apologized to his friends and checked they had not been hurt, but then turned to Fresco and asked him to take responsibility, Lerena said. \n \n “‘Please take the blame for me - there’s too much media hype around me’,” Lerena quoted Pistorius as saying. “‘Take the blame because this can be big.’” \n \n When the restaurant owners came up to investigate, Fresco told them the gun had fallen out of the pocket of his tracksuit trousers. \n \n “I said to him ‘What’s the first rule of owning a gun? Safety first?’” Maria Loupis said. “He said ‘Yes’ and I hit him over the head.” \n \n Pistorius paid the bill and the group left, she added. \n \n At the Pretoria High Court, Pistorius’ defense team wound up its cross-examination of a third prosecution witness who said he had heard shouts and screams from Pistorius’ house before shots were fired on the night Steenkamp died. \n \n Earlier, lead defense advocate Barry Roux tried to undermine the testimony of wife and husband Michelle Burger and Charl Johnson, who lived 177 meters (195 yards) away in an adjacent housing complex, as being too similar to be credible. \n \n “You could just as well have stood together in the witness box,” he said, earning his second rebuke of the three-day-old trial from Judge Thokozile Masipa. \n \n Besides denying murder, Pistorius, who had his disabled lower legs amputated as a baby and now runs on carbon fiber prosthetic “blades”, has pleaded not guilty to the Tashas gun charge. \n \n Slideshow (14 Images) \n \n He is also accused of putting a bullet through the sun roof of a former girlfriend’s car in a separate incident. \n \n The trial is being broadcast daily on live television, a first for South Africa, although most witnesses have asked for their faces not to be shown to protect their identity. \n \n Johnson, the neighbor, said on Wednesday he had received “intimidating” phone calls the previous night from people who had heard his phone number read out in court during his wife’s earlier cross-examination.', 'Oscar Pistorius places his hand over his face while sitting in the dock in court on the third day of his trial at the high court in Pretoria, South Africa, Wednesday, March 5, 2014. Pistorius is charged... (Associated Press) \n \n PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) — Oscar Pistorius asked a friend to take the blame after a pistol was accidentally fired in a Johannesburg restaurant weeks before the double-amputee runner fatally shot his girlfriend, a witness testified Wednesday at Pistorius\' murder trial. \n \n The testimony by boxer Kevin Lerena relates to firearms charges against Pistorius, and raises questions about the character of a man who insists he accidentally shot dead Reeva Steenkamp in his home in the early hours of Feb. 14 last year. Prosecutors allege he intentionally shot Steenkamp, his 29-year-old girlfriend. \n \n Lerena said the restaurant shooting happened when he and Pistorius and two other friends were in a restaurant in the swank Melrose Arch area of Johannesburg in January 2013. One friend, Darren Fresco, passed his gun to Pistorius under the table and told him that there was a bullet in the chamber, Lerena said. Then a shot went off, puncturing the floor near Lerena\'s foot, he said. \n \n ""There was just complete silence,"" said Lerena, who described being in shock and having blood where his toe was grazed in the incident. Then, he said, Pistorius apologized, saying: ""Are you OK? Is everybody OK?"" \n \n Before the restaurant management approached the table, Lerena said, Pistorius asked Fresco to say he was responsible for the gunshot. \n \n ""\'Just say it was you. I don\'t want any tension around me,\'"" Lerena remembered Pistorius saying. ""\'There\'s too much media hype around me.\'"" \n \n Lerena said they paid the bill and left the restaurant and he never spoke about the incident. Two days after Pistorius shot Steenkamp, he said, he woke up to find over 100 missed calls on his telephone as media from around the world tried to contact him to ask about the gun incident. \n \n Chief defense lawyer Barry Roux attempted to establish it was noisy in the restaurant, which the manager testified Wednesday was full with over 200 customers, and that Pistorius did not hear Fresco say the gun was ""one-up"" — or that there was a bullet in the chamber — when he passed it. \n \n But Lerena\'s testimony that Pistorius asked a friend to ""take the rap"" wasn\'t challenged. \n \n ""He (Pistorius) did say, \'Fresco, take the blame because this could be big.\'"" Lerena said in court. \n \n The wife of the restaurant manager also said in her brief testimony that the shot went off near to where a child was sitting. \n \n Pistorius, the world-famous athlete and first amputee to run at the Olympics, is charged with murder and three other offenses: Two relating to the shooting of a gun in public and another count of illegal possession of ammunition. He pleaded not guilty to all four charges. \n \n Earlier Wednesday, Roux sought to undermine the prosecution testimony of a couple who say they heard a woman\'s screams and gunfire the night that Pistorius killed Steenkamp. Telephone records will show that the banging sounds the neighbors heard were not gunshots but a distressed Pistorius breaking down the toilet door with a cricket bat after realizing he had shot Steenkamp when she was in the toilet, thinking it was an intruder, Roux asserted. \n \n Throwing doubt on the witnesses\' recollection of the sequence in the early hours is crucial for Pistorius\' defense after the state maintained there was a loud argument on the night he shot Steenkamp through a door in his bathroom and the screams and shouts were before a gun was fired. \n \n Pistorius\' team wants to show the screams were Pistorius calling for help after the accidental killing and before he used the bat on the door. \n \n Charl Johnson and his wife Michelle Burger have testified to hearing a woman screaming, a man shouting for help and then gunshots. During his cross-examination of Johnson, Roux said call records will show Pistorius called an estate manager at around 3:19 a.m. and soon after he bashed in the door with the bat. \n \n In Johnson and Burger\'s testimony, they say they heard what they described as shots straight after making a call to security at 3:16 a.m. The similar times show the sounds were the bat on the door, Roux argued. \n \n ""There is only one thing you could have heard, because it coincides precisely,"" Roux said to Johnson. ""That was the time that he (Pistorius) broke down the door (with the bat)."" \n \n Johnson replied: ""I am convinced the sound I heard was gunshots."" \n \n Pistorius, 27, was a globally admired athlete whose career peaked when he ran in the 2012 Olympics.

The incident, which came just weeks before Pistorius fatally shot girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, started when the third friend Darren Fresco passed his pistol to Pistorius under the table, Lerena said. Fresco told Pistorius there was a bullet in the chamber, but Pistorius' lawyer says it was too noisy for Pistorius to hear that, the AP reports. After the shot went off, grazing Lerena's toe, Pistorius apologized to everyone, but as management approached, Lerena says Pistorius beseeched Fresco, ""Just say it was you. I don't want any tension around me. There's too much media hype around me. ... Take the blame because this could be big."" Pistorius' lawyer claims the athlete actually confronted Fresco, angry that the gun was loaded, and Fresco offered to take the blame. Lerena disputed that, the Wall Street Journal reports.

277,"['One of the companies, Concord Management and Consulting, has fought the special counsel’s charges in court, demanding that the government demonstrate it willfully violated the law. Friday’s criminal complaint, with its detailed descriptions of the conspiracy continuing for months after February’s indictment, appears to do just that. \n \n Image An image provided by the Justice Department shows a social media post used in the influence campaign. \n \n Earlier Russian influence campaigns stood out for their clumsiness — Facebook posts from the Internet Research Agency, another arm of Project Lakhta that conducted Russia’s social media disruption campaign in 2016, often contained broken English and off-topic cultural references. \n \n But the new operations appear to have been more sophisticated, with smoother messaging and a better command of American political discourse that allowed for more precisely targeted campaigns. Operatives instructed their colleagues to frame posts about former Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who tangled frequently with Mr. Trump before he died in August, as an “anti-Trump geezer.” Speaker Paul D. Ryan, they said, should be described as “an absolute nobody.” \n \n Operatives were instructed to attack Republicans who failed to sufficiently champion the construction of the border wall that Mr. Trump has sought; to stress the need for strict voter identification laws, especially in “blue states”; and to highlight “scandals that took place when Mueller headed the F.B.I.” in an attempt to discredit the special counsel’s investigation. \n \n Acknowledging the time difference between Russia and the United States, one conspirator advised the others to post in the morning to attract liberal audiences during the American evening — “L.G.B.T. groups are often active at night,” the operative wrote — and to seek out conservatives awake in the morning by posting just before they left work for the day. \n \n They also developed strategies for blending in to partisan American audiences. “If you write posts in a liberal group … you must not use Breitbart titles,” read one message sent to the Russian group, referring to the conservative American news site. “On the contrary, if you write posts in a conservative group, do not use Washington Post or BuzzFeed’s titles.” \n \n The group also gave suggestions, some of them racist, for reaching specific affinity groups. One member suggested keeping posts simple when they were aimed at lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender groups of color, writing that “colored L.G.B.T. are less sophisticated than white; therefore, complicated phrases and messages do not work.” \n \n Framing suggestions often accompanied news stories shared by the group’s members, according to the complaint. One story, originally posted by the conservative news site World Net Daily, was titled “The 8 Dirtiest Scandals of Robert Mueller No One Is Talking About.” When instructing a group member to share the story on social media, an unnamed member of the Russian group urged colleagues to “emphasize that the work of this commission is damaging to the country and is aimed to declare impeachment of Trump,” according to the complaint.', 'Teenage pregnancy rates have almost halved since the birth of social media as a global phenomenon, official figures show. \n \n The rate of pregnancies among girls under 18 in England and Wales has dropped by 45 per cent since 2007 and now stands at the lowest level since records began almost 50 years ago, according to the Office for National Statistics. \n \n The startling decrease has prompted a host of theories including sex education classes paying off, changing attitudes to young motherhood and the impact of immigration. \n \n But other have speculated that it could be that young people are simply spending less time physically in each other’s company because of social media – a phenomenon which went global around 2007, the year after Facebook expanded beyond university campuses. \n \n Teenage pregnancies \n \n Year Conception rate 1969 47.1 1970 52.7 1971 54.9 1972 54.5 1973 53 1974 48.9 1975 44.6 1976 41.1 1977 40.1 1978 41.4 1979 41.9 1980 39.3 1981 38.8 1982 39 1983 40 1984 43.1 1985 44.4 1986 44.1 1987 45.1 1988 46.3 1989 46.9 1990 47.7 1991 44.6 1992 43.5 1993 42.5 1994 41.9 1995 41.9 1996 46.3 1997 45.9 1998 47.1 1999 45.1 2000 43.9 2001 42.7 2002 43 2003 42.3 2004 41.8 2005 41.6 2006 40.8#Facebook goes global 2007 41.6 2008 39.9 2009 37.2 2010 34.3 2011 30.9 2012 27.9 2013 24.5 2014 22.9 \n \n The drop in teenage pregnancies has been accompanied by evidence of decreases in other traditionally risky behaviours such as drinking and drug taking. \n \n Children’s charities and experts have repeatedly warned that the explosion of social media is exposing young people to new dangers from online bullying to “sexting” and sexual exploitation by strangers. \n \n But the new figures suggest that the change in how teenagers conduct their social lives could also be helping make them safer. \n \n • Whatever happened to feckless youth?

Prof David Paton \n \n “People [appear to be] spending time at home - rather than sitting at bus stops with a bottle of vodka they are doing it remotely with their friends.” \n \n He argued that better access to contraception could not explain the fall as it coincides with cuts to sexual health services in many areas amid a period of major austerity. \n \n One other possibility, he said, was that major improvements in schools in areas such as London around the same time might have played a part. \n \n But he added: “Nobody really knows why we’ve got this sudden change around about 2007 to 2008.” \n \n Meanwhile the number of pregnancies among older women rose, continuing a long-term trend towards later motherhood. \n \n Photo: Alamy Stock Photo/Posed by models \n \n Notably, the figures also show that 7.8 per cent of pregnancies involving married women ended in an abortion – the highest level for 12 years. \n \n Yet among unmarried women the abortion rate fell slightly from 31.2 per cent of conceptions to 31 per cent. \n \n Clare Murphy, director of external affairs at the abortion provider British Pregnancy Advisory Service (Bpas) said access to contraception and sex education had “undoubtedly” played a part in the declining teenage pregnancy rate but she agreed with Prof Paton’s suggestion of a social media effect. \n \n “The plummeting level of teenage drinking, for example, may be reducing the likelihood of unprotected sex, and teenagers are also increasingly socialising online, limiting the opportunities for sexual activity,” she said. \n \n She added: “As we have seen decreases in conception rates among the under-25s, the largest rise was for women aged 35-39 (a percentage increase of 2.3 per cent). \n \n “Women are increasingly being chivvied about starting their families in their 20s, but the reality is many will wait until their 30s to do so. \n \n “The reasons for this are diverse and will include the time it takes to obtain financial and career security, and not least finding the right person to embark on parenthood with. \n \n “Rather than chastising women, we should support their choices. \n \n “There may be some increased risks with later motherhood, but these need to be kept well in perspective, and women respected as the best judges of when it is best for them to have children.”']",2,"– The FBI has been warning for a while that the Russians would try to interfere in the midterms, and the Justice Department has just brought a criminal case alleging just that. The feds charged a 44-year-old Russian woman, Elena Khusyaynova, with conspiracy to defraud the US, reports the Washington Post. Prosecutors say Khusyaynova ran an operation funded by a Russian oligarch whose aim was to “spread distrust towards candidates for U.S. political office and the U.S. political system” by bombarding social media with divisive messages on issues from immigration to gun control to the NFL anthem protests. As Politico notes, this is the first criminal case alleging Russian interference in the 2018 elections. Khusyaynova is a foreign national who lives in St. Petersburg, and she was not in custody. Khusyaynova works for an oligarch named Yevgeny V. Prigozhin, described by the New York Times as a close ally of Vladimir Putin who was previously indicted for interference in the 2016 election.

Now scientists engaged in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence say that lone repeating fast radio burst (FRB) is being heard twittering away. \n \n FRBs are bright, millisecond-long pulses of radio signals from beyond the Milky Way that were first identified only a decade ago. Suggested explanations include everything from neutron star outbursts to alien civilizations using some form of directed energy to propel a spacecraft. \n \n One burst first observed in 2012, named FRB 121102, was later found to repeat in 2015. On Saturday, UC Berkeley postdoctoral researcher Dr. Vishal Gajjar used the Breakthrough Listen backend instrument at the Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia to target FRB 121102 once again. After observing for five hours and across the entire 4 to 8 GHz frequency band, Gajjar and the Listen team analyzed the 400 terabytes of data gathered and found 15 new pulses from FRB 121102. \n \n ""The possible implications are two folds,"" Gajjar told me via email Tuesday. ""This detection at such a high frequency helps us scrutinize many (of FRB 121102\'s) origin models. The frequency structure we see across our total band of 4 to 8 GHz also allows us to understand the intervening medium between us and the source."" \n \n The location of FRB 121102 has already been previously traced to a dwarf galaxy about 3 billion light years away, but what exactly might be sending out such strong signals from there remains a mystery. Gajjar says that the repeating nature and current state of heightened activity for FRB 121102 does seem to rule out some of the most destructive explanations, such as colliding black holes. \n \n ""As the source is going into another active state means that the origin models associated with some sort of cataclysmic events are less likely to be the case of FRB 121102,"" he said. ""It should be noted that they can still be valid for other FRBs."" \n \n Whatever or whoever sent out the bright radio bursts, they left their source a very long time ago when the only life here on Earth was single-celled. Perhaps some ancient intelligent species was clued in to the emergence of life on our planet and knew that a signal sent would reach us just as we were becoming technologically sophisticated for the first time? \n \n Perhaps, but given the current lack of evidence of such extra-terrestrial life, a natural phenomenon like a pulsar seems a more likely explanation. \n \n The Breakthrough Listen team urged other astronomers to make follow-up observations of FRB 121102 during its current state of heightened activity in an Astronomer\'s Telegram post that first reported the new results on Monday.

280,"['The female mosquitoes that spread dengue and yellow fever didn’t always rely on human blood to nourish their eggs. Their ancestors fed on furrier animals in the forest. But then, thousands of years ago, some of these bloodsuckers made a smart switch: They began biting humans and hitchhiked all over the globe, spreading disease in their wake. \n \n “It was a really good evolutionary move,” says Leslie B. Vosshall, the Robin Chemers Neustein Professor and head of Rockefeller’s Laboratory of Neurogenetics and Behavior as well as a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator. “We provide the ideal lifestyle for mosquitoes. We always have water around for them to breed in, we are hairless and we live in large groups.” \n \n To understand the evolutionary basis of this attraction, Vosshall and her colleagues examined the genes that drive some mosquitoes to prefer humans. Their findings, published in the November 13 issue of Nature, suggest that human-loving mosquitos are attracted to our scent. “They’ve acquired a love for human body odor, and that’s a key step in specializing on us,” she says. \n \n The quest to understand what makes some mosquitoes prefer humans began in Rabai, Kenya. In the 1960s and 1970s, scientists visiting the region observed two distinct populations living just hundreds of meters apart. Black mosquitoes, a subspecies called Aedes aegypti formosus, tended to lay its eggs outdoors and preferred to bite forest animals. Their light-brown cousins, Aedes aegypti aegypti, tended to breed indoors in water jugs and mostly hunted humans. “We think we can get a glimpse of what happened thousands of years ago by looking at this little village in Kenya because the players are still there,” Vosshall says. \n \n In 2009, Carolyn McBride, who was a postdoc in Vosshall’s laboratory at the time, and her co-investigators traveled to Rabai to see if these two groups still existed. The team used turkey basters to collect larvae from tree holes in the forest and sieved larvae from clay pots and metal cans inside people’s homes. Back in the lab in New York they reared the insects and discovered that the observations that researchers had made years earlier seemed to hold true: The insects collected indoors tended to be light brown, and when given the option to bite humans or guinea pigs, they mostly choose humans. Those collected in the forest were black and tended to prefer the laboratory guinea pigs. \n \n To zero in on the genes responsible for the human-loving mosquitoes’ preference, the researchers crossbred the mosquitoes, creating thousands of genetically diverse grandchildren. And then they sorted those mosquitoes based on their odor preference and compared the two groups. \n \n “We knew that these mosquitoes had evolved a love for the way we smell,” Vosshall says. So she and her colleagues looked specifically for genes that had higher levels of expression in the human-loving insects’ antennae. These structures contain proteins called odorant receptors that pick up different scents. \n \n Vosshall and her colleagues found 14 genes strongly linked to liking humans, but one odor receptor gene — Or4 — stood out. “It’s very highly expressed in human-preferring mosquitoes,” Vosshall says. \n \n The researchers guessed that Or4 must be detecting some aroma in human body odor. To figure out which one, they asked volunteers to wear pantyhose for 24 hours. And then they placed those stinky stockings in a machine designed to separate their scent into the hundreds of individual chemicals that make up body odor. The researchers came up with one match, a chemical called sulcatone that was not found in pantyhose worn by guinea pigs. \n \n Sulcatone is an important odor that gives humans our distinctive scent, but there are likely other odors and other genes that help explain mosquitoes’ attraction to humans. In fact, adding sulcatone to the guinea pig odor didn’t make guinea pig scent more appealing to human-loving mosquitoes. McBride, now at Princeton University, plans to look for other factors to help explain how mosquitoes transitioned from harmless animal-biting insects into deadly vectors of human disease. \n \n The switch from preferring animals to humans involves a variety of behavior adjustments: Mosquitoes had to become comfortable living around humans, entering their homes, breeding in clean water found in water jugs instead of the muddy water found in tree holes. “There’s a whole suite of things that mosquitoes have to change about their lifestyle to live around humans,” Vosshall says. “This paper provides the first genetic insight into what happened thousands of years ago when some mosquitoes made this switch.”', 'Texas Gov. Rick Perry isn’t having any part of President Barack Obama’s health care law. \n \n In a letter to Secretary Kathleen Sebelius on Monday, Perry pledged that he won’t create a state insurance exchange or implement the optional Medicaid expansion. “I oppose both the expansion of Medicaid as provided in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the creation of a so-called ‘state’ insurance exchange, because both represent brazen intrusions into the sovereignty of our state,” Perry said. \n \n Text Size - \n \n + \n \n reset \n \n “I stand proudly with the growing chorus of governors who reject the Obamacare power grab. ...Neither a ‘state’ exchange nor the expansion of Medicaid under the Orwellian-named PPACA would result in better ‘patient protection’ or in more ‘affordable care,” Perry said. \n \n Perry has been hinting he won’t go through with implementing the health care law since the Supreme Court’s decision to uphold it in late June, calling it “a stomach punch to the American economy” in a statement on the day of the ruling. \n \n His state has one of the largest populations of people eligible for the Medicaid expansion.

A new study digs into the genes that led to this evolutionary shift, which had many mosquitoes give up on furry forest animals—and it relied on guinea pigs and pantyhose to reach its conclusion. As Rockefeller University explains, school researchers studied two types of mosquitoes in Rabai, Kenya, whose disparate behavior was first observed in the 1960s. Aedes aegypti formosus (black mosquitoes) favor forest creatures, while the brown-bodied Aedes aegypti aegypti prefer humans. The researchers headed to Rabai five years ago, collected mosquito larvae, and confirmed those preferences were still the case after breeding them in the lab. They then began a process of cross-breeding and sorting that ultimately allowed them to identify an odor-receptor gene, Or4, that was much more highly expressed in human-preferring mosquitoes. To suss out which odor Or4 was homing in on, the researchers had human volunteers and guinea pigs don pantyhose for 24 hours. A machine then sorted out each individual chemical, and one called sulcatone was present only in the stockings worn by humans.

This year, the sandwich purveyor is planning to shut about 500 more of its U.S. shops. Last year, more than 800 stores went dark, with the total U.S. count dropping to 25,908. It also closed restaurants in 2016. \n \n “We want to be sure that we have the best location,” Chief Executive Officer Suzanne Greco, 60, said in a phone interview. “We focused in the past on restaurant count. We’re focused now on strengthening market share.” \n \n “Store count isn’t everything,” she said. “It’s about growing the business.” \n \n Closing Up Shop Sandwich chain Subway is pulling back U.S. growth amid more competition Source: Company, Technomic \n \n The sandwich shop, founded more than 50 years ago, is struggling to boost sales in the U.S. as newer, more modern chains emerge. Greco said Subway had been hurt by fierce competition in the U.S., including from a resurgent McDonald’s Corp., whose domestic system sales rose 3.4 percent last year, according to data from researcher Technomic. Subway’s fell 4.4 percent. \n \n It’s also now faced with supermarkets and gas stations that are selling more grab-and-go fare, putting immense pressure on Subway to be faster and more convenient. Along with the closures, some locations are being relocated, and Subway is now using data from SiteZeus to choose better real estate, Greco said. \n \n Rewards Program \n \n Subway is banking on a new loyalty program, along with menu innovation, to boost traffic. The rewards system, which offers $2 discounts and free items, is available for the chain’s domestic and Canadian locations. It’s also remodeling stores for a sleeker look with touch-screen ordering kiosks. \n \n But the real opportunity for expansion is abroad, Greco said. This year, the chain will add more than 1,000 locations outside of North America, and is focused on growth in countries including the U.K., Germany, South Korea, India, China and Mexico. \n \n Milford, Connecticut-based Subway is owned by Doctor’s Associates Inc. and was founded about 53 years ago by Fred DeLuca and Peter Buck. Greco took over in 2015 after the death of DeLuca, her older brother. The chain, which has about 43,700 stores globally, is entirely owned by franchisees. \n \n While there have been recent management changes at Subway, Greco says she’s not going anywhere. \n \n “Subway is in my blood, I’ve been here since Day One,” she said. “I still have some good years ahead of me.”', 'LOS ANGELES — Two years after Lions Gate released the fifth and supposedly final installment of its “Twilight” movie series, the studio has devised an unusual franchise-rekindling effort — and it may hold clues about Facebook’s future in Hollywood. \n \n Lions Gate and Stephenie Meyer, the creator of the vampires-and-werewolves “Twilight” saga, on Tuesday announced plans to select five aspiring female directors to make short films based on “Twilight” characters.

The case only alleges mishandling of donations on the PayPal Giving Fund platform, not money donated to a charity that simply goes through a PayPal account. And donations to large charities are most likely not affected. \n \n Here\'s the issue: PayPal offers to use its Giving Fund for donations to organizations that aren\'t yet signed up on the platform. But, as it acknowledges on its website, it will only distribute money to organizations that have a Giving Fund account, in addition to their standard PayPal account. \n \n Many larger national and international charities have both accounts. But ""hundreds of thousands of smaller charities"" have not gone through the process, the lawsuit says. \n \n U.S. Charitable Giving Sees Big Bump In 2016 Charitable Giving Sees Big Bump In 2016 Listen · 3:54 3:54 \n \n Nevertheless, those charities are listed on the Giving Fund site, without any indication that they aren\'t set up to receive funds. \n \n PayPal says that when such a charity receives a donation, PayPal will contact the organization ""at regular intervals ... in order to enroll them"" — and that after six months, if they don\'t enroll, the funds may be ""reassigned."" \n \n The lawsuit, however, says that PayPal and the Giving Fund ""generally fail"" to inform charities that there are funds waiting for them. Meanwhile, the donor receives a misleading confirmation that their donation went through, and PayPal accrues interest on the donation for six months before redirecting it to another group, the suit alleges. \n \n The donor would continue to believe their donation went through without a hitch, and the would-be recipient of the funds would never know that the donation had been attempted. \n \n The lawsuit was filed by Terry Kass and the nonprofit Friends for Health, on behalf of anyone else who was affected by the practice. \n \n Kass attempted to donate money to Friends for Health and a number of other charities, the suit says, but only $100 of $3,250 actually went through to the organization of her choice. By chance, after talking to one intended recipient, a local legal aid clinic, she realized her donation was missing — and contacted PayPal repeatedly for an explanation. \n \n She was told multiple times that her donations were delivered, the suit says. Then a PayPal employee explained the need for the organizations to register for accounts, and said that otherwise the company would ""redistribute these funds to similar charities."" \n \n A PayPal spokesperson told NPR by email that the company is reviewing the lawsuit and is ""fully prepared to defend ourselves vigorously."" \n \n The company says the Giving Fund ""does not hold any donations in interest bearing accounts, and therefore earns no interest on charitable donations,"" and that when a donation is received for a charity that isn\'t enrolled in the Fund, the company contacts the nonprofit ""to notify them of the gift and help them enroll.""', 'Justin Timberlake delivered a gift to a victim of this month\'s deadly school shooting in Texas in a surprise hospital visit that brought a smile to the young girl\'s face. \n \n Interested in Santa Fe School Shooting?

Yet it's hard to diagnose and many doctors don't look for, let alone spot, the deadly condition. So what is it? Often confused with blood poisoning, sepsis occurs when the body responds in a toxic way to an infection (anything from pneumonia to a UTI). As the Sepsis Alliance puts it, ""Your body’s immune system, which is supposed to fight off the infection, goes into overdrive and begins to attack your body."" Sepsis can cause tissue damage or multiple organ failure, landed 400,000 Medicare beneficiaries in ICUs across the country in 2013 alone, and plays a role in 33% to 50% of all US hospital deaths. It cost $5.5 billion for those initial Medicare hospitalizations in 2013, yet triggers return visits 40% of the time. And as far as percentages go, here's another big one: A report based on 2011 data found sepsis ""resulted in an aggregate cost of $20.3 billion or 5.2%"" of what America spent on all hospitalizations that year. Treatment may improve as hospitals create sepsis teams and new prediction tools, as well as investigate treatments; antibiotics and fluids alone can save lives, notes the Sepsis Alliance, which in 2013 reported only 44% of Americans had ever heard of sepsis. Meanwhile, experts are advising people with symptoms like depression, anxiety, forgetfulness, and weakness to seek faster hospitalization. Root causes include smoking, alcoholism, pollution, and pulmonary problems, a professor told Frontline magazine years ago. But problems persist: In Canada, hundreds of malpractice cases in recent years involved sepsis, usually over poor diagnosis, the National Post reports.

He told detectives and friends that they should look for her in the mountains because she liked going there. But investigators were skeptical because her wallet, cellphone and other personal belongings were left behind.

The rules for women and men, however, have been in place and enforced for decades, including under former Speaker Nancy Pelosi. \n \n Ryan clarified that he had nothing to do with the creation of the rules, though as speaker, he can ask House officers to change them. \n \n “The sergeant-at-arms was simply enforcing the same interpretation of the rules as under my predecessors,” Ryan said. “This is nothing new and it’s certainly not something that I devised.” \n \n Sign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

So that is why we will be working with the sergeant-at-arms to ensure the enforcement of appropriate business attire is updated.” \n \n The change to the dress code, which is enforced on members and reporters alike, comes just as some female Democratic lawmakers had also quietly been discussing a protest against the rules. \n \n But even some Republican women have started pushing back on the rules, creating an even greater headache for Ryan. On Wednesday, Rep. Martha McSally of Arizona, took to the floor to purposefully flout the dress code — and she made sure lawmakers knew it. \n \n ""Before I yield back, I want to point out I\'m standing here in my professional attire, which happens to be a sleeveless dress and open-toed shoes,"" she quipped.']",2,"– After some uproar about how the House of Representatives enforces its dress code, Speaker Paul Ryan said Thursday he and the House sergeant-at-arms will work to update it. The dress code calls for professional attire in the House chamber and the Speaker's lobby, and some female journalists have recently not been allowed to enter the Speaker's lobby due to sleeveless dresses or open-toed shoes. Critics say the dress code is selectively enforced; GOP Rep. Martha McSally even did so Wednesday during a speech on the House floor. ""The sergeant-at-arms was simply enforcing the same interpretation of the rules as under my predecessors,"" Ryan said, per the Hill. ""It's nothing new and certainly not something that I devised. At the same time, that doesn't mean that enforcement couldn't stand to be a bit modernized."" Politico notes that the dress code has also been called sexist, and adds that female Democrats were considering a protest. In other dress code news, Goldman Sachs has relaxed its own dress code—at least for one class of employees. Tech employees are now allowed to ""exercise judgment in determining when to adapt to business attire,"" per a memo from late June obtained by Reuters Thursday. Though the memo didn't specifically say whether the techie ""uniform"" of hoodies and sneakers would be deemed acceptable, Reuters notes that the move was designed to attract talent to its tech division via a more casual environment. Wall Street banks have been finding it difficult to compete with Silicon Valley companies and hedge funds for tech talent. The rest of the Goldman Sachs employees will still be expected to adhere to the normal dress code."
288,"[""Since publishing a letter to the editor in the Daily Princetonian Friday, some people have asked me to clarify whether I intended it to be read as satire. \n \n My letter was serious. \n \n I sincerely feel that too much focus has been placed on encouraging young women only to achieve professionally. I understand that this can be seen as retrogressive, but for those women who aspire to what used to be thought of as a traditional life with home and family, there is almost no ink addressing personal fulfillment outside of the workplace. Specifically, finding lifelong friends and the right partner with whom to share a life and raise a family. \n \n Again, I understand that all women don't want marriage (to men or other women) and or children, but for those that do, identifying the right partner is critical. One of the criteria by which I am defining the right partner is someone with shared educational and intellectual appreciation. Yes, that can be found after college and outside of Princeton, but the concentration of outstanding men (and women) will never be greater than it is as a student. I wanted to encourage the wonderful young women on Princeton's campus to take advantage of this while they can. From a sheer numbers perspective, the odds will never be as good again. \n \n The popularity of Nikki Mueller's video (I Went to Princeton, Bitch) comically attests to the difficulty Princeton women face from men who are threatened by their academic credentials. It doesn't address how unsatisfying it is for exceptionally well educated women to be with men who are not their intellectual equal. I am divorced. I did not marry a Princeton man. I wish I had. \n \n The extreme reaction to my letter is astonishing. Honestly, it was intended as little more than honest advice from a Jewish mother. \n \n And, yes, this is exactly the advice I would give my daughters. \n \n RELATED ON HUFFPOST WOMEN: 7 Questions For The Alumna Telling Princeton Women To 'Find A Husband'"", 'This is an entirely foreign scenario for most people, which adds an extra element of terror. But it’s also a scenario one segment of the population is uniquely familiar with: the military. And in recent years, a number of doctors have become convinced that the lessons learned in battles abroad could also be used to protect people at home: In mass shootings and terror attacks, perhaps civilians could be their own first responders. \n \n On the Saturday morning after the attacks in Paris, students in a martial-arts studio I attend in Boston settled down for a three-hour workshop in tactical first aid for civilians, led by David Schaffner, a former U.S. Army medic who served in Iraq and Afghanistan. The timing of the workshop was a coincidence, but it caused Schaffner to grimace and speed through his PowerPoint slides outlining the usefulness of these skills. “I don’t think I really have to explain the relevance to anyone after last night,” he said. \n \n Tactical first aid for civilians, he explained, is an adaptation of what the U.S. military calls Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC)—a response to the realization that soldiers were dying on the battlefield from survivable wounds before they could make it to a hospital. A 2012 study found that almost a quarter of deaths in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were “potentially survivable,” and 90 percent of deaths overall occurred before the casualty could be treated at a medical center. Numbers like those, including a statistic that 90 percent of those with potentially survivable wounds died specifically from “uncontrolled blood loss,” have recently led both the military and civilian groups to focus on techniques that can be performed quickly with minimal training by non-medical personnel, in the hope that future deaths might be avoided. \n \n Tactical Combat Casualty Care involves not just medical techniques, but threat recognition and situational awareness. The 1996 paper by members of the Army and Navy medical corps that established the TCCC guidelines divided care into three stages: 1) “care under fire”; 2) “tactical field care,” or “the care rendered by the medic or corpsman once he and the casualty are no longer under effective hostile fire” but have not yet been picked up for transportation to a medical center; and 3) “combat casualty evacuation care” once in a vehicle en route to a medical center. \n \n The main concern during “care under fire,” as explained by Schaffner, is not actual medical attention but “handling the immediate situation”; in other words, moving oneself, and the wounded person, to a safer area. The only medical intervention at this stage would be, if possible, to stop major bleeding from an extremity wound with a tourniquet—a compression device placed on the limb above the wound. (Although tourniquets are now judged to be safer than previously thought, those wishing to provide first aid should always seek out instruction from a professional, and be aware of local laws governing the provision of first aid in emergency situations.)', 'A homeless man whose face was mostly chewed off in a bizarre attack along a busy Miami street is now `awake and alert,"" according to doctors at Jackson Memorial Hospital\'s Ryder Trauma Center. \n \n A photograph shown to reporters Tuesday portrayed Ronald Poppo walking down a hospital hallway, supported by hospital staff on either side of him. \n \n Doctors were planning to talk more about his condition at a Tuesday news conference. \n \n The photo showed the upper two-thirds of Poppo\'s face covered in scabs. He\'s missing his nose and both eye sockets were covered, one with gauze and one with what appeared to be a skin graft. His gray beard was trimmed, leaving a mustache over his upper lip. \n \n Poppo has been at Jackson Memorial Hospital since he was attacked May 26 by Rudy Eugene. Emergency callers reported seeing a naked man swinging naked from a light pole on Miami\'s MacArthur Causeway a few minutes before the attack. \n \n Surveillance video from a nearby building shows Eugene stripping Poppo and pummeling him before appearing to lie on top of him. \n \n A police officer shot and killed Eugene. Autopsy results are still pending.']",3,"– Donna Brazile joins the brouhaha over a letter a Princeton mother wrote to the school newspaper urging female students—""the daughters I never had""—to make sure they find their future husbands on campus before graduating. Gee, writes Democratic strategist Brazile at CNN, if only that letter came out when she was in college 30 years ago, ""perhaps I could have avoided the costly mistake of focusing on what makes me come alive and then pursuing it for a living."" She could have skipped all those ""pesky classes"" and ""instead concentrated on designing my hair, makeup, attire, and personality to create the perfect man-catching machine.""

289,"['A nurse who contracted Ebola at the Dallas hospital where she worked plans to sue the hospital\'s parent company, Texas Health Resources, hoping to be a ""voice for other nurses,"" her lawyer said today. \n \n In the suit, which Nina Pham plans to file Monday, the 26-year-old nurse alleges that Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital didn\'t train the staff to treat Ebola and didn\'t give them proper protective gear, which left parts of their skin exposed, her lawyer Charla Aldous said. \n \n ""One of the most concerning things about the way [the hospital] handled this entire process is you\'ve got a young lady who has this disease which she should not have. And if they properly trained her and given her the proper personal protective equipment to wear, she would not have gotten the disease,"" Aldous said. \n \n Aldous said Pham hopes the suit will ""help make sure that hospitals and big corporations properly train their nurses and healthcare providers."" \n \n ""This is not something that Nina chose,"" Aldous said, but ""She\'s hoping that through this lawsuit she can make it a change for the better for all nurses."" \n \n Pham is still coping with Ebola\'s after-effects, including nightmares and body aches, her lawyer said. \n \n ""She has not gone back to work yet and she is working on recovering,"" Aldous said. ""I don\'t know if she\'ll ever be a nurse again."" \n \n Texas Health Resources spokesperson Wendell Watson said in a statement: ""Nina Pham bravely served Texas Health Dallas during a most difficult time. We continue to support and wish the best for her, and we remain optimistic that constructive dialogue can resolve this matter."" \n \n Last fall, Pham cared for Liberian native Thomas Eric Duncan, who flew to the U.S. and was diagnosed with Ebola at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital. \n \n Pham took care of Duncan when he was especially contagious, and on Oct. 8, Duncan died from the virus. \n \n Pham tested positive for Ebola on Oct. 11, marking the first Ebola transmission on U.S. soil. \n \n On Oct. 16, Pham was transferred to the National Institutes of Health\'s hospital in Bethesda, Maryland. She was discharged on Oct. 24. \n \n At the news conference announcing Pham\'s discharge, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the NIH, said she tested negative for Ebola five times, and that it wasn\'t clear which treatment saved her because they were all experimental. \n \n ""I want to first tell you what a great pleasure and in many respects, a privilege ... to have the opportunity to treat and care for and get to know such an extremely courageous and lovely person,"" Fauci said, adding that she represents the health care workers who ""put themselves on the line."" \n \n Pham\'s dog, Bentley, was also quarantined for several weeks, over fears that he, too, would develop Ebola. \n \n ABC News\' Sarah Herndon and Doug Vollmayer contributed to this report.', 'She went home and later had a fever of “99-point- something,” about 2 degrees above her normal temperature. Pham said she called the hospital and the Dallas County health department, and was told to monitor her temperature. But unless her temperature reached 100.4, they told her, she should not be concerned. \n \n The day after Duncan died, Pham said she met with someone from the CDC and the hospital’s employee health manager to walk through her care of Duncan and how she protected herself. \n \n She woke up early Oct. 10 with a temperature of 100.6. Pham said she called the Presbyterian emergency room and told them who she was and that she was coming to the hospital. She drove to the hospital, where she was put in isolation. Her boyfriend at the time was quarantined but remained Ebola-free. They stopped seeing each other soon after, and Pham is currently not dating anyone. \n \n When she was admitted to Presbyterian, Pham said, she made it clear that she did not want any information released about her medical condition. \n \n “I wanted to protect my privacy, and I asked several times ... to put be as ‘no info’ or at least change my name to Jane Doe,” Pham said. “I don’t think that ever happened.” \n \n When a test confirmed that she did have Ebola, “I broke down crying” and was in disbelief. \n \n “It was very scary,” she said. “My time at Presbyterian is a bit blurry just because I was in and out of having to take pain medications and just being very, very, very fatigued the whole time. One of the hardest things about having Ebola was the extreme amount of fatigue.” \n \n Pham said she received three experimental drugs and “one glimmer of hope” when she found out that Brantly could give her plasma. Brantly, a doctor from Fort Worth, contracted Ebola in July while treating patients in Liberia. The plasma of Ebola survivors is helpful in the treatment of others fighting the disease. \n \n Although Pham was always being watched and she talked with her family on the phone, she was lonely, she said. \n \n Pham remains on the payroll at Texas Health Presbyterian but isn’t working. “I’m still trying to figure out what I want to do next. It’s been such a life-changing experience, a traumatizing experience, too,” Pham said. \n \n “Just knowing the whole world’s watching but you’re so isolated and the people that are coming [in to care for me] are risking their lives,” Pham said. “Touching me is life-threatening. It’s very lonely.” \n \n By the fifth day of isolation, Pham was sitting up in a chair. She thought she was doing better. But a doctor came in to talk about “end-of-life decisions” with her. \n \n The day Pham was transferred to NIH, a notation was made in her medical file that “she does not have the mental capability to make end-of-life decisions,” Aldous said. But PR people from Texas Health were trying to talk to her for a media release “about how much she loves Presbyterian,” Aldous said. \n \n Texas Health, with a PR firm’s help, developed a slogan — “Presby Proud” — aimed at restoring the community’s faith in the beleaguered hospital. \n \n Before Pham’s flight to Maryland on Oct. 16, she said, a doctor wearing a video camera under his protective hood came into her room and said he was filming her for educational purposes. Pham said she did not give permission for the video, which was released to the media. \n \n “Thanks for getting well. Thanks for being part of the volunteer team to take care of our first patient,” a man’s voice said in the video. “It means a lot. This has been a huge effort by all of you guys.”']",2,"– Nina Pham beat Ebola; now she's taking on the place where she caught it. Pham, who contracted the virus while caring for dying patient Thomas Eric Duncan at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas, tells the Dallas Morning News that she is suing the parent company of the hospital that made her a ""symbol of corporate neglect."" Among her accusations: A lack of training. Pham says the only Ebola training that nurses caring for Duncan initially received was a printout of guidelines her supervisor had found online, and all she knew about the disease was what she had learned in nursing school years earlier. A lack of equipment. Pham says the hospital at first did not supply proper protective gear, leaving nurses with their skin exposed, and nurses were only given hazmat suits after days of asking for them. She says decisions about protective gear had to be made by the nurses themselves ""on the fly."" No respect for privacy. Pham says that after she was placed in an isolation unit, the hospital not only disregarded her request not to have her name released—it also didn't ask her permission before giving the media a video of her taken by a doctor. Her lawyer tells the Morning News Pham was treated as a ""PR pawn"" and was asked about a media release ""about how much she loves Presbyterian"" on the same day a note was added to her medical files saying ""she does not have the mental capability to make end-of-life decisions."" The 26-year-old was declared Ebola-free in October, but she tells the Morning News she still suffers lingering problems, including insomnia, body aches, and hair loss. She has been warned that the aftereffects of experimental drugs used to treat her could include organ failure and vision loss, and she isn't sure if she'll be able to have children—or work as a nurse again. She is seeking damages, but her lawyer tells ABC News that she also aims to be a ""voice for other nurses"" and wants the lawsuit to ""help make sure that hospitals and big corporations properly train their nurses and health-care providers."""
290,"['BERKELEY, Calif., March 2 (UPI) -- Over the last two decades, scientists have gone back and forth on whether or not ultra-small bacteria exist. But now, for the first time, there\'s photographic proof. \n \n Researchers at Department of Energy\'s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the University of California, Berkeley, have captured detailed images of the micro-bacteria. The images, produced by high-powered microscopes, detail what scientists say is an example of life at its smallest state. \n \n ""These newly described ultra-small bacteria are an example of a subset of the microbial life on earth that we know almost nothing about,"" researcher Jill Banfield, an Earth and planetary science professor at Berkeley, explained in a press release. ""They\'re enigmatic."" \n \n Scientists say the bacteria are common, and found in most groundwater samples. \n \n ""These bacteria are detected in many environments and they probably play important roles in microbial communities and ecosystems,"" Banfield added. ""But we don\'t yet fully understand what these ultra-small bacteria do."" \n \n The cells of the super-small bacteria feature an average volume of 0.009 cubic microns. For perspective, scientists say as many as 150,000 cells of the newly detailed bacteria could fit on the end of a strand of human hair. \n \n Scientists used a filter that combs out any particles or organisms larger than 0.2 microns, and then used a newly developed cryo plunger to flash-freeze the tiny bacteria for transport to the lab. \n \n Detailed genetic analysis showed that the bacteria\'s genome lacks many important functions, which scientists say means the cells likely need to rely on each other to survive -- existing in groups. Imagery shows that the cells are outfitted with tiny appendages called pili that likely allow them to derive support from their cell neighbors. \n \n ""There isn\'t a consensus over how small a free-living organism can be, and what the space optimization strategies may be for a cell at the lower size limit for life,"" said co-author Birgit Luef. ""Our research is a significant step in characterizing the size, shape, and internal structure of ultra-small cells."" \n \n The new research, funded by the Department of Energy\'s Office of Science, was published Monday in the journal Nature Communications.', ""Just how small can life get?

Scientists had to catch the hard-to-spot microbes by using a new portable cryo plunger, which flash-froze groundwater to near absolute zero (about -458F) to keep the cells intact while they were in transit. \n \n The snapshots may not look like much, but they're revealing a lot about lifeforms at this extremely miniscule size. For one thing, their metabolisms are so minimal that they likely depend on resources from other bacteria to stay alive. While there's still a lot that remains a mystery (it's not certain what half of the genes do), this up-close imagery could eventually fill in a lot of blanks in biology -- it's clear that there's a world of unusual organisms that have gone largely unnoticed. \n \n [Image credit: Berkeley Lab]"", ""A third video has surfaced of former Ravens running back Ray Rice's domestic violence incident and subsequent arrest following an altercation with his now-wife, Janay, in an Atlantic City, N.J., casino. \n \n The video, obtained by ABC News, displays security footage taken after Rice punched Janay in a casino elevator in February.

Mike Pence, who has yet to say whether he\'ll sign the measure into law, veto it or let it become law without his signature. \n \n 4:10 p.m. UPDATE: \n \n The Indiana House voted 66-30 to alter the divisive ""religious freedom"" law to remove fears that it would allow businesses to discriminate against gays and lesbians. \n \n The Indiana Senate was expected to quickly follow suit and send the changes to Gov. Mike Pence, who has yet to say whether he will accept the revisions. \n \n The changes would make it clear that the law cannot be used to discriminate based on sexual orientation and gender identity. \n \n Updated at 2:30 p.m: \n \n What appeared to be a group effort Thursday morning to fix Indiana\'s divisive ""religious freedom"" law dissolved into a Republican power play as the GOP kicked out Democrat committee members before taking a vote on the changes. \n \n As of 1 p.m., Democrats were meeting privately to decide whether to sign off on the clarifying measure, which they said doesn\'t go far enough to protect gays and lesbians from discrimination. \n \n But by 2:30 p.m., Republicans had removed the Democrat committee members, so they could move the bill without Democrat support to the full House and Senate for a final vote today. \n \n \n \n Democrats said the changes didn\'t go far enough. They wanted a repeal of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, or full civil rights protections for gays and lesbians. \n \n Earlier story: \n \n Business, civic and sports leaders who demanded a fix to Indiana\'s divisive ""religious freedom"" law flanked Republican legislative leaders Thursday as they announced a new measure that would prohibit the law from being used to discriminate based on sexual orientation and gender identity. \n \n Those leaders had overwhelmingly opposed the law, which many feared would allow discrimination against the LGBT community. But they embraced the fix unveiled Thursday morning and began to try to repair the damage that the controversy has wrought on Indianapolis\' once sterling reputation as a welcoming convention and sports city. \n \n Speaking at the news conference were Allison Melangton, who headed planning for the 2012 Super Bowl in Indianapolis, Jim Morris, vice chairman of the Pacers, former Indianapolis Mayor Bart Peterson and Salesforce Marketing Cloud CEO Scott McCorkle. \n \n Senate President Pro Tem David Long, R-Fort Wayne, and House Speaker Brian Bosma, R-Indianapolis, presented the clarifying measure at a 9 a.m. Statehouse news conference and presented the proposal to lawmakers at a 9:30 a.m. committee meeting. \n \n ""Hoosier hospitality had to be restored,"" Bosma said during the news conference, where he apologized ""not for actions taken, but the message received."" \n \n ""Is the damage able to be turned back?"" he said. ""That remains to be seen."" \n \n The leaders were referring to intense backlash that rained down on Indiana after Gov. Mike Pence signed the bill during a private ceremony last week. Conventions have canceled or threatened to move events that bring millions of dollars into the state. Prominent business executives have halted expansion plans or canceled travel to the state. The NCAA, which is holding the men\'s Final Four in Indianapolis this week, has also expressed concerns about the law. \n \n ""It was never intended to discriminate against anyone,"" Long said. ""That perception led to the national protests we\'ve seen."" \n \n Peterson, now a vice president with Eli Lilly, said the words ""gender identity"" and ""sexual orientation"" will appear in state law in context of anti-discrimination for first time. \n \n ""The healing needs to begin right now,"" he said. \n \n Salesforce\'s McCorkle lauded his employees and Indiana residents for coming out strong against the bill. \n \n The tech company had previously said it would no longer send employees and customers to Indiana in light of what it saw as the passing of a discriminatory law. \n \n ""I\'ve lived in Indiana my entire life ... this state has given me so much. I\'ve love Indiana,"" McCorkle said. \n \n Chris Douglas, founding president of Indianapolis Rainbow Chamber of Commerce, said Indiana is a ""loving state."" \n \n ""Much of our work has been done over many years to achieve progress in Indiana,"" said Douglas, whose group promotes the interests of the LGBT community in the city\'s economic development. \n \n At the committee hearing that followed the news conference, Eric Miller of Advance America, which lobbied for the original religious freedom law, said the proposed changes would ""destroy"" the law. \n \n ""Among the things that will happen, Christian bakers, florists and photographers would now be forced by the government to participate in a homosexual wedding or else they would be punished by the government,"" Miller\'s group said in a blog post. \n \n Some Christian conservatives who had supported the original law called for Pence to veto the changes. \n \n The proposed new language — worked out during private, marathon negotiations on Wednesday between Republican legislative leaders, key business and sports officials and the governor\'s staff — would alter the Indiana Religious Freedom Restoration Act, or RFRA, to ensure it does not discriminate against gay and lesbian customers of Indiana businesses. But it stops short of providing statewide protections against discrimination of gay, lesbian and transgender people. \n \n Pence called for ""clarifying"" language over the weekend in an effort to stem the tide of criticism and economic blows. But it was unclear as of Thursday afternoon whether the governor would support the new language. \n \n The measure could put to rest some of the harsher criticisms that Indiana Republicans have suffered through in the past week. But it is unlikely to make either liberal or conservative activists happy and easily prefaces a future Statehouse battle over LGBT protections. \n \n In fact, Long said he thought it was likely lawmakers would take up full LGBT protections next year. \n \n The compromise legislation specifies that the new religious freedom law cannot be used as a legal defense to discriminate against patrons based on their sexual orientation or gender identity. \n \n The proposal goes much further than a ""preamble"" that was proposed earlier in the week, and, if it stands, would be the first time any protections against discrimination have been extended to gays and lesbians in state law. But it doesn\'t go as far as establishing gays and lesbians as a protected class of citizens statewide or repealing the law outright, both things Republican leaders have said they could not support. \n \n Specifically, the new language says the RFRA does not authorize a provider — including businesses or individuals — to refuse to offer or provide services, facilities, goods, employment, housing or public accommodation to any member of the public based on sexual orientation or gender identity, in addition to race, color, religion, ancestry, age, national origin, disability, sex or military service. \n \n The proposed language exempts churches or other nonprofit religious organizations — including affiliated schools — from the definition of ""provider."" \n \n Democrats insist the changes don\'t go far enough. They want a repeal of the RFRA and full civil rights protections for gays and lesbians. \n \n Long, Bosma and the Rainbow Chamber\'s Douglas all said they didn\'t think there was enough time for a robust discussion on that issue now — but that a debate over that issue was likely next year. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Read or Share this story: http://indy.st/1aiQd1I', 'Please enable Javascript to watch this video \n \n UPDATE: Amendment passes House 66-30, Senate also approves with 34-16 vote. Gov Pence signed the bill Thursday evening. \n \n INDIANAPOLIS (April 2, 2015) – Standing among a group of Indianapolis business and community leaders, Statehouse leaders said they had fixed the divisive Religious Freedom Restoration Act that created a national outcry. \n \n House Speaker Brian Bosma, R-Indianapolis, and Senate President Pro Tem David Long, R-Fort Wayne, said they consulted with business leaders and members of the LGBT community to fix the bill. \n \n Both said the law had been misrepresented and needed to be changed because of the perception that it could be used to discriminate against the LGBT community.

The bill now moves to Gov. Pence\'s desk to be signed into law. \n \n ""It was clear that the perception had to be addressed. Hoosier hospitality had to be restored,"" Bosma said about the law, which created an outcry after Gov. Mike Pence signed it last week. “We’re here to announce that it’s fixed.” \n \n “We’re clarifying what it doesn’t do today,” Long said. “I think the people standing behind us believe that we have (fixed problems with the law).” \n \n Bart Peterson, a former Indianapolis mayor who now works for Eli Lilly, said public policy matters and words matter. He said lawmakers and community leaders had worked very hard over the past few days to reach a compromise. \n \n ""The future of Indiana was at stake,"" Peterson said. ""The healing needs to begin right now. For the first time ever, the words \'sexual orientation\' and \'gender identity\' appear in an Indiana statute."" \n \n Peterson said he had complete confidence that Indiana would rebound and that Thursday\'s changes ""showed the world what the people of Indiana are really made of."" \n \n Scott McCorkle, one of several business leaders in attendance, thanked his employees and Indiana residents for coming out strongly against the law. Salesforce had been one of the most vocal opponents of RFRA. \n \n Please enable Javascript to watch this video \n \n “I love Indiana, and I know you do, too.” McCorkle said. “At the time of Indiana’s greatest need, it was inspiring to see so many people come together and give back to the state that they love, too. Today is a positive first step, but it is a first step in a larger discussion that we acknowledge the importance of equal rights for all.” \n \n Chris Douglas, founding president of Indianapolis Rainbow Chamber of Commerce and an eighth generation Hoosier, described Indiana as a “great state” and said Hoosiers of all faiths and economic background called for change. \n \n “The measure announced today, for the first time in Indiana law establishes sexual orientation and gender identity in the context of recognizing and protecting our rights as equal citizens of the state of Indiana. We know that this is only the beginning.” \n \n Angie\'s List CEO Bill Oesterle came out strongly against the clarification: \n \n “Our position is that this \'fix\' is insufficient. There was no repeal of RFRA and no end to discrimination of homosexuals in Indiana. Employers in most of the state of Indiana can fire a person simply for being Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender or Questioning. That’s just not right and that’s the real issue here. Our employees deserve to live, work and travel with open accommodations in any part of the state."" -Angie’s List CEO Bill Oesterle \n \n Freedom Indiana, a grassroots advocacy group, called Thursday\'s announcement a first step but said there was more work to be done: \n \n “The changes proposed by the Legislature represent a step in the right direction that takes us closer to achieving our goal of passing the Fairness for All Hoosiers Act. “Today, the harm has been lessened, but we have not reached the day when LGBT Hoosiers can be assured that they can live their lives with freedom from discrimination. “It’s long past time to enact a comprehensive nondiscrimination law, and we must continue to work to ensure, once and for all, that the RFRA cannot be used to discriminate against or hurt anyone. “Thousands of Hoosiers and millions of Americans spoke loudly and clearly that discrimination cannot be tolerated in any form. That outcry has made all the difference. “Facing tremendous economic damage and mounting public pressure, particularly from leading businesses in the state, lawmakers have responded with a measure to reduce the harm caused by the new law and include positive references to sexual orientation and gender identity for the first time in Indiana state law. “These changes represent an important step forward. They fall short in many ways, and our work is far from over. “Statewide nondiscrimination protections for LGBT Hoosiers still do not exist, meaning discrimination is still legal in most of the state. “Businesses in Indiana, and many other employers looking to do business with our state, have made it clear that the state must pass a statewide nondiscrimination law that protects all Hoosiers from discrimination and ensures that Indiana is seen as a welcoming place to visit and do business. “Some of the country’s leading companies – trend setters and innovators – came togetherto voice their support for laws to end discrimination of any kind. “It’s time to pass a comprehensive nondiscrimination law, and we will continue to work with our allies to ensure that the RFRA cannot be used to discriminate or harm anyone. “Indiana businesses have shown they are ready to lead. We look forward to working with them to pass statewide protections against discrimination. That campaign begins today.” \n \n Eric Miller of Advance America, a grassroots group with a focus on pro-family and pro-church issues, blasted the changes: \n \n “The Indiana General Assembly should not destroy in less than 36 hours the Religious Freedom Restoration Act that took over 65 days to go through the legislative process earlier this year.” “It is wrong for the senators and representatives to vote on a bill that has been written in the last few hours behind closed doors and out of sight of the public. It is wrong for the senators and representatives to make a sham of the legislative process and vote on this bill that has never had one public committee hearing in the Senate or the House.” “The proposed change to Indiana’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act is not a ‘fix’ but a hammer to destroy religious freedom for Hoosiers around the state – and it was all done behind closed doors!” \n \n Indiana University, which had criticized the law, released a statement saying it was ""grateful"" that lawmakers had acted quickly to clarify it: \n \n Indiana University expresses its appreciation and support for this clarifying language, which ensures that nothing in the Religious Freedom Restoration Act will provide legal protection for, or in any way promote or permit, discrimination in any form on the basis of a person’s sexual orientation or their race, color, religion, ancestry, age, national origin, disability, sex, gender identity or military service. We are grateful for the hard work and good intentions of those who have earnestly labored in recent days to address this problem. Indiana University asks all Hoosiers to remember that religious liberty and equal protection under the law are both cornerstones of our democracy and they should not be in conflict with each other. Our system of government works best when people of good will come together to reconcile their differences and find common ground. We are pleased that this has happened in this situation, and it is our hope and expectation that this clarification will now allow all Hoosiers to put this matter behind us and work together to promote a better image and indeed a better future for the State of Indiana. \n \n The NCAA, which has also expressed concerns about the law, issued this statement: \n \n “We are very pleased the Indiana legislature is taking action to amend Senate Bill 101 so that it is clear individuals cannot be discriminated against. NCAA core values call for an environment that is inclusive and non-discriminatory for our student-athletes, membership, fans, staff and their families. We look forward to the amended bill being passed quickly and signed into law expeditiously by the governor.” Mark Emmert, NCAA president \n \n Indianapolis Mayor Greg Ballard issued the following statement:']",2,"– Those calling for a ""fix"" are getting it, Indiana's top Republicans said at a press conference this morning. Senate President Pro Tem David Long and House Speaker Brian Bosma announced changes this morning that ""clarify"" the state's controversial new religious freedom law and aim to protect gays and lesbians. ""We're here to announce that it's fixed,"" Bosma said, though he insisted the compromise language wasn't needed to change the actual law, but ""to clarify the perception"" of that law. The compromise measure states that the law can't be used to discriminate against customers of a business based on their sexual orientation or gender identity, the Indianapolis Star reported earlier. Churches and other nonprofit religious organizations, including schools, are exempted, but the protection does extend to housing and employment. The proposal is officially being presented to lawmakers now that the press conference is over, the Star notes. The measure was put together by GOP leaders alongside business leaders, and Gov. Mike Pence's chief of staff met with the group late yesterday, but no one has said whether Pence will sign it, and the chief of staff said last night that the governor still needs to review it. But, the Atlantic notes, Pence did say Tuesday that he wanted to sign such a clarifying bill, and that he wanted it by week's end. Asked if there are enough votes to pass the compromise in the legislature, both Bosma and Long gave a firm ""yes."" They also both made it clear they believe they've satisfied both sides of the debate, but the Star noted earlier that the deal ""is unlikely to make either liberal or conservative activists"" 100% happy. Asked specifically about the case of the pizzeria refusing to cater a gay wedding, Bosma said, ""We can unequivocally say that RFRA cannot be used to discriminate against anyone,"" but individual cases of how people attempt to use it will be decided by the courts."

294,"['The world’s oldest known wild bird is a Laysan albatross named Wisdom. Since wildlife experts first banded her in 1956, Wisdom has raised as many as 35 chicks. And at the ripe old age of 68, she has laid yet another egg, according to Gizmodo’s Ryan F. Mandelbaum. \n \n On November 29, Wisdom was spotted at the Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge, a haven for nesting seabirds on the northern end of the Hawaiian archipelago. More than three million birds, 1.2 million of which are albatross, come to the atoll every year to breed. “Every square foot of land, and much of the ground underfoot is occupied by a nesting bird,” Beth Flint, a biologist with the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service, said in a blog post. “It’s like another world.” \n \n The USFWS has confirmed that Wisdom and her mate, Akeakamai, are looking after a new egg, taking turns between tending to the nest and searching for food. As is typical for the species, the couple has laid just one egg, and if all goes well, they will care for the hatchling for around five and a half months before it sets off on its own. \n \n Wisdom and Akeakamai have been returning to Midway every year since 2006 to breed, which is somewhat unusual; according to the USFWS, albatross will often take a year off between breeding seasons to rest. Granted, Wisdom seems to be a pretty robust bird. Layson albatross are known to live several decades, with average life spans stretching from 12 to 40 years old, but Wisdom shows no signs of slowing down as she inches closer to 70. \n \n Wisdom first came onto researchers’ radar in 1956, when a biologist named Chandler Robbins banded her during his first season studying albatross on the Midway Atoll. She was at least six years old at the time, which is why scientists believe Wisdom is now around 68, but there was nothing particularly remarkable about her back then. She was just one of hundreds of thousands of albatross breeding on Midway that year. \n \n Forty-six years and one remarkable coincidence later, Robbins stumbled upon Wisdom once again amid a mass convergence of albatross on Midway, realizing that he had been the one who banded her many decades earlier. Robbins died last year, but biologists are continuing to keep a close eye on her and the other albatross that regularly flock to the atoll. The birds spend 90 percent of their lives in the air and at sea, making them difficult to track, but bird surveys and banding projects can help researchers gain a better understanding of albatross migratory patterns and life cycles. \n \n “This information helps scientists make better management decisions that ensure seabirds have the habitat and resources they need in the future,” the USFWS writes in its blog post. \n \n Managing Laysan albatross habitats has become increasingly important in recent years. The birds are classified as a “near threatened” species, with climate change and sea living rise posing a major threat to their future. Laysan albatross nest on low-lying islands, which “will likely be submerged by rising sea levels as a result of climate change in this century,” according to the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. Laysan albatross are also vulnerable to predation by dogs, cats, mongoose and even invasive mice, which have been known to attack the birds while they nest. \n \n “They haven’t really evolved with predators on land. Their only natural predators really are sharks, and those are in the ocean,” Aisha Rickli-Rahman, a biological program crew lead with the USFWS, explained earlier this year. “They have this very, very programmed behavior to stay on these eggs, because they have put all of their energy into this one egg.” \n \n Because albatross are not prolific breeders, the success of each egg is important to the overall population. And so albatross like Wisdom, who has been raising chicks for decades, are vital to the health of the species. Last year, in fact, biologists observed a chick that Wisdom fledged in 2001 just a few feet away from her nest on Midway. \n \n “Midway Atoll’s habitat doesn’t just contain millions of birds, it contains countless generations and families of albatrosses,” says Kelly Goodale, a USFWS refuge biologist. “If you can imagine when Wisdom returns home she is likely surrounded by what were once her chicks and potentially their chicks.”', 'In sea mariner lore, an albatross is considered a good omen, and for almost seven decades, one bird has spread generations of blessings across the Pacific Ocean. \n \n Wisdom, a 68-year-old Laysan albatross believed to be the world’s oldest known wild bird, has returned to her home at the Midway Atoll national wildlife refuge for yet another winter – and laid yet another egg to add to the already impressive brood that she has built up over an impressive lifetime. \n \n Biologists with the US Fish and Wildlife Service think the almost-septuagenarian has birthed and raised as many as 36 chicks over the years. Should her latest egg with her longtime lover, Akeakamai, hatch, fledge and take to the open sea, it will be her 37th. \n \n Trump administration plans to weaken protections for sage grouse Read more \n \n Wisdom was first banded in 1956 by biologist Chandler Robbins, who estimated that she was about five years old at the time. The biologist and bird met again in 2002 when he went to band her and recognized that she had been one of the 8,400 birds he recorded during his first season, 46 years previously. \n \n Albatrosses are known for their long life spans and often outlive their researchers – Robbins died in 2017 at the age 98 – but what makes Wisdom unique is that researchers have been able to monitor her habits for so long. She may or may not be the oldest wild bird, but she is the oldest known wild bird, and her habits have been lovingly documented by the fish and wildlife service over social media. \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest Oceanographer Dr Sylvia Earle, and Wisdom, the oldest known living Laysan albatross, at Midway Atoll national wildlife refuge. Photograph: Susan Middleton/USFWS - Pacific Region \n \n And because so much of her background and history is known, researchers are learning more about her species by observing her. To a human, 68 years old may seem preposterous to still be laying eggs, but Wisdom and the other few documented examples of albatrosses in their 50s and 60s who do not appear to have trouble breeding at that age show the situation may be different for birds, said Beth Flint, a USFWS wildlife biologist. \n \n Like many albatrosses, Wisdom returns nearly every year to the place she was born for nesting and mating. Midway Atoll, a two-and-a-half-sq-mile island belonging to the US that was the site of the decisive Battle of Midway during the second world war, remains mostly uninhabited when it comes to humans. But come winter, more than 1m Laysan albatrosses flock to the beaches to nest. \n \n Albatrosses spend 90% of their lives at sea, soaring over the northern Pacific Ocean and feeding on squid and fish eggs. The fish and wildlife service estimates that Wisdom has clocked more than 6m miles in her travels – according to the Cornell lab of ornithology, Laysan albatrosses can range anywhere from the Aleutian Islands and the southern Bering Sea to Costa Rica. \n \n Endangered Hawaiian monk seals face new challenge: eels stuck up their noses Read more \n \n Albatrosses take mating and nesting seriously, forming bonds with their mates for life. The Cornell lab describes their courtship displays as elaborate; they include “coordinated movements in which the birds touch bills, spread one or both wings, bob their heads, place their bill under one wing, and pause with their bill pointed at the sky”. \n \n Once they’ve met their mates, the birds will rendezvous at the same nest site every winter – and go through some iteration of the courtship process again, Flint said. \n \n “There is preening and a dance,” she said. “They’re very tactile animals. They sit closely and preen each other and snuggle. We can’t know what they’re feeling, but they exhibit the kind of behaviors that reinforce a bond and a connection.” \n \n Researchers first noted Wisdom’s relationship with Akeakamai in 2006 and are unsure if she had other mates before Akeakamai. But albatrosses are believers in co-parenting, and will take turns incubating an egg, caring for the chick and foraging for food over the ocean. Should this egg survive, Wisdom and Akeakamai will spend about seven months on Midway Atoll incubating and raising their chick. \n \n Albatrosses lay only one egg a year, and because it’s such a lengthy and energy-consuming process to both incubate and raise a healthy chick, most do not do it annually. While researchers are still collecting data regarding the frequency at which Laysan albatrosses breed, Wisdom “does seem to be exceptional in that she has bred for a number of years consecutively and has not taken a break”, Flint said. \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest Wisdom, a 68-year-old Laysan albatross, protects her egg. Photograph: USFWS - Pacific Region \n \n Wisdom has managed to raise a number of chicks who have gone on to raise chicks of their own, she has also faced hardship. In 2015, her egg was reported missing, which biologists say is just what happens sometimes. \n \n But her fertile contributions to the continuation of her species make every homecoming a celebration for scientists. Last year, they observed a chick that she fledged in 2001 setting up a nest just a few feet away. It was the first time one of her chicks had been documented returning to nest. \n \n “Midway Atoll’s habitat doesn’t just contain millions of birds, it contains countless generations and families of albatrosses,” Kelly Goodale, a fish and wildlife service refuge biologist, said in a blogpost. “If you can imagine when Wisdom returns home, she is likely surrounded by what were once her chicks and potentially their chicks.”']",2,"– Dear tired moms of the world: Meet Wisdom, whose dozens of young ones are about to gain another sibling. The Guardian notes that while it may indeed seem ""preposterous"" for a 68-year-old human to still be having kids, it's apparently different for some birds, including this Laysan albatross that's about to witness her 37th egg hatch at the Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge in the Pacific Ocean near Hawaii. The US Fish and Wildlife Service has confirmed the existence of the new egg at the refuge, where Wisdom and her mate, Akeakamai, have headed to once a year for the past 12 years to mate, per Smithsonian.com. An ID band was first placed on Wisdom in 1956 by birder Chandler Robbins, who himself died just last year at the age of 98. That band has made it possible for researchers to keep tabs on Wisdom over the decades, offering invaluable insight into the albatross's habits in the wild. What makes Wisdom somewhat ""exceptional"" even among her own kind is that most albatrosses, which can only lay one egg a year, don't typically do so annually, as the process of taking care of it is a grueling one. Wisdom, however, ""has bred for a number of years consecutively and has not taken a break,"" a Fish and Wildlife Service biologist says. Also noteworthy: Wisdom was able to create this egg with the help of her ""longtime lover"" Akeakamai, and the Guardian dives further into just how seriously albatrosses take their romantic relationships, engaging in yearly courting rituals to keep the fires burning.

B&N originally had not specified why Pareneros, who did not receive severance, was fired, the Wall Street Journal reports.

297,"['A museum exhibition in Doha that was supposed to open a “bridge of friendship” between Greece and Qatar ended in embarrassment for both after a Greek cultural minister refused to let Qatari officials cover the genitalia of two traditional Greek nudes. \n \n Qatar Museums Authority’s “Olympics: Past and Present” exhibition at the Qatar Olympic and Sports Museum opened March 27 with what it has been described as the largest showcase of its kind tracing the ancient and modern Olympic Games. \n \n The statues in question, dating to between the sixth and second centuries B.C., were to be the centerpiece of the “Olympia: Myth – Cult – Games” section, which takes visitors through the history of ancient Olympia with more than 600 original objects on loan from the National Archeological Museum, the Numismatic Museum and the Museum of Olympia, birthplace of the games. \n \n The cultural exchange was widely regarded as a way for cash-strapped Greece to woo investors from the energy-rich Persian Gulf emirate, which has filed two unsuccessful bids in recent years to host the Olympic Games. \n \n In January, Greek Prime Minister Antonis Samaras announced that Qatar would invest as much as €1 billion ($1.3 billion) in a joint fund with Athens. Shortly afterward, the emir of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, bought six isles in the Ionian Sea for his three wives and 24 children. Then, in March, Greece’s junior minister for culture, Costas Tzavaras, traveled to Doha on a bridge-building mission to tour the then-forthcoming Olympics exhibit, and that’s when relations between the two nations soured. \n \n “Organizers in Qatar wanted to cover up the statues’ members with black cloth,” a culture ministry source told Agence France-Presse. “So they were never put on display. They went back into storage and returned [to Greece] on April 19.” \n \n The statues, a Classical Greek youth and a Roman-era copy of an athlete, are now back on display at the National Archeological Museum. Like the Olympic competitors of antiquity they depict, both are shown sporting in the nude. \n \n Qatari officials insisted the drapes were a precautionary measure to avoid “scandalizing” female visitors, but, in the end, Greece objected, saying the statues should be displayed in all their anatomical glory. \n \n A representative of the Qatar Museums Authority, or QMA, told Doha News that initial AFP reports last week were false, and that the statues’ removal was “not due to censorship.” \n \n “The decision to remove the objects was based on the flow of the exhibition, awareness of the outreach to all schools and families in Qatar, and desire to be sensitive to community needs and standards,” the QMA representative said. \n \n Doha News explained that residents of the Middle East hold conflicting views on the arts, citing a survey last year showing that six out of 10 Arabs expressed support for government censorship of the arts. \n \n Respondents said regulatory bodies and state-affiliated institutions were necessary, given that art could be “inappropriate” and offend “religious beliefs.” \n \n Interestingly, while QMA authorities reportedly deemed the male genitalia too tantalizing for female visitors, they seemed to have had no problem with female breasts scandalizing the males. Statues like the partially bare-breasted Nike remain intact and on view in Doha through the end of June.', 'It was a spat that nobody wanted – neither the Greeks, the Qataris nor, say officials, the two nude statues that sparked the furore. \n \n But in a classic clash of cultures, Greece has found itself at odds with the oil-rich state – a nation it is keen to woo financially – over the presentation of masterworks depicting athletes in an exhibition dedicated to the Olympic games. \n \n ""The statues are now back at the National Archaeological Museum in Athens,"" said a culture ministry official. \n \n The dispute, though authorities are not calling it that, broke when Greece\'s culture minister, Costas Tzavaras, arrived in Doha last month to discover the ""anatomically challenging"" treasures cloaked in cloth for fear of offending female spectators. \n \n ""In a society where there are certain laws and traditions authorities felt women would be scandalised by seeing such things, even on statues,"" added the official who was present at the time. \n \n ""The minister, of course, said while he totally respected local customs he couldn\'t accept the antiquities not being exhibited in their natural state,"" she told the Guardian. ""They were great works of art and aesthetically it was wrong."" \n \n The statues, an archaic-era Greek youth and a Roman-era copy of a classical athlete, were to be the centrepiece of an exhibition entitled Olympic Games: Past and Present. Bankrupt Greece was delighted to facilitate when organisers in Doha got in touch. Mired in its worst economic crisis in modern times, the debt-stricken country is eager for investment from the Gulf state, which this year promised to pour €1bn into a joint investment fund. \n \n In another hopeful sign, the emir of Qatar, Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, recently bought six isles in the Ionian sea with a view to building palaces on them for his three wives and 24 children. \n \n Visiting the Qatari capital for the opening of the show, Tzavaras seized the opportunity to describe the exhibition as ""opening a bridge of friendship"" between the countries. The discovery of the covered-up antiquities was a setback few had envisaged. \n \n ""We don\'t want to portray it as a row, and we certainly didn\'t want it to overshadow the exhibition,"" explained the official. ""It was all very friendly. When they turned down our request (to remove the cloth) the statues were boxed up again and sent back to Athens."" \n \n Mystery, nonetheless, shrouds the affair. The show, which had previously been hosted in Berlin, features more than 700 artworks from around Greece, including numerous nude statues. It remains unclear why Qatari authorities had taken such umbrage over the antiquities in question, although officials in Athens described the young athletes – both from Eleusis – as being especially beautiful.']",2,"– A pair of stone penises have gotten in the way of a museum exhibition billed as a ""bridge of friendship"" between Qatar and Greece. Two statues of nude male athletes were among 600 Greek archaeological treasures on loan to Qatar for an Olympic-themed exhibition, but Greece's culture minister kicked up a fuss when he visited the Gulf nation and found the statues' private parts covered up, the Guardian reports. Officials in Qatar said the statues were covered up to avoid offending female visitors, but the culture minister said he ""couldn't accept the antiquities not being exhibited in their natural state,"" a Greek official says. ""They were great works of art and aesthetically it was wrong."" After the two sides failed to reach agreement, Qatar returned the offending statues to Greece. The exhibition has gone ahead with the remaining artworks—including some statues of bare-breasted women that Qatari officials don't seem to mind, the International Business Times notes."

(Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg) \n \n President Obama is fond of telling Congress that it should pass things with the overwhelming support of the American people, including (among other things) comprehensive immigration reform, increasing the minimum wage, and increasing gun background checks. \n \n And yet, Obama could soon be in a position of vetoing something with a similar amount of support: the Keystone XL pipeline. \n \n Poll after poll has shown support for Keystone is somewhere between very strong and overwhelming. A Pew Research Center survey this month showed support for the project at nearly two-to-one, 59 percent to 31 percent. And that was about the lowest level of support we\'ve seen to date. Support has registered as high as two-thirds of Americans. \n \n And as another recent Pew poll showed, it\'s not just Republicans and independents driving support for the project. In fact, basically the only group that opposes it is the most liberal of Democrats. \n \n According to Pew\'s breakdown from June, three of the four Democratic-leaning groups -- including religious Democrats, young Democrats and the most moderate Democratic leaners -- all supported the project two-to-one. \n \n Which is a long way of saying that Obama would likely have very few supporters were he to wield his veto pen, as the White House suggests he will following votes by the House and Senate -- which by all indications will approve the bill. \n \n The White House, if it does veto the bill, will apparently argue that it can\'t approve it before the lengthy State Department review of the project\'s environmental impact is complete -- along with a Supreme Court case in Nebraska concerning a key part of the pipeline\'s route. That\'s fine, but it still remains that a strong majority of Americans are pretty keen on getting the pipeline done. \n \n The question from there is how strongly Americans feel. On issues like the raising the minimum wage and increasing background checks, support is overwhelming but soft, and the opposition is often louder than the proponents, despite being a small minority. Which means there is little outcry when Congress doesn\'t comply with public opinion. \n \n On Keystone, a March Washington Post-ABC News poll showed 62 percent of American believed ""strongly"" that the project would create a significant number of jobs -- though we would note that the vast majority of the jobs would be temporary -- while just 28 percent ""strongly"" believed that it would pose significant risks to the environment. \n \n The first thing to know about the Keystone pipeline? It already exists. Here\'s a breakdown of the pipeline\'s various parts. (Gillian Brockell, Jhaan Elker and Kate M. Tobey/The Washington Post) \n \n Obama has only vetoed two pieces of legislation so far in his presidency. Such is the benefit of controlling one of chambers of Congress (the Senate) for all six years. \n \n Republicans hope having control of both chambers will mean, rather than the Senate effectively vetoing bills from the GOP-controlled House by not voting on them, they will be able to put the decision in Obama\'s hands, at which point public pressure on something like Keystone could be brought to bear. \n \n And it looks like Obama will quickly be forced into making one of his toughest veto decisions -- at least when it comes to the court of public opinion.']",2,"– Janet Napolitano is officially headed for an exit on stage left, which invites the question of who will succeed her at Homeland Security.

But people will watch movies and TV shows practically anywhere. \n \n Streaming-video giant Netflix found that more people are watching video outside their homes. About 67% of people now watch movies and TV shows in public, according to an online survey it commissioned of 37,000 adults around the world. It was conducted between late August and early September. \n \n The most popular public places to stream are on planes, buses, or commuting, the survey found. But 26% of respondents also said they’ve binged shows and movies at work. People in the US were more likely to stream from the office, while users around the world were more likely to stream during their commutes. \n \n A small group—about 7% worldwide—said they’ve watched movies and TV shows in public restrooms (to say nothing of those who have streamed from the privacy of their own bathrooms). \n \n They’re not shy about it, either. A fifth of respondents admitted to crying while bingeing in public. Another 17% were so engrossed in a show or movie that they missed their stop on their commute (hopefully not while driving). And 45% said they’d caught someone spying on their screens; 11% said they had a show spoiled after looking on another person’s screen. Only 18% said they felt embarrassed about watching in public. \n \n A lot of this public bingeing is driven by the rise in mobile viewing. In the US, for one, audiences are spending more time on smartphones and tablets than in years passed, Nielsen data shows (pdf). And smartphone usage proliferates worldwide. \n \n For Netflix, mobile still makes up a small chunk of overall viewing. Netflix said it was about 10% as of 2016. But the company also said half of its users stream from a smartphone during any given month. Its audience is now around 110 million subscribers worldwide. \n \n A year ago, the platform also added a download feature so subscribers could save titles to watch offline. That’s made it easier to stream on the go. \n \n Read next: Indian commuters are coping with their terrible commutes by watching Netflix', ""LOS ANGELES (November 14, 2017) - In a world with 2.4 billion smartphone (1) users, mobile viewing is on the rise and “binge-free zones” are a thing of the past. But as millions of people take full advantage of Netflix to stream and download anytime and anywhere, private binge behaviors are now on public display. \n \n So why are 67% of people globally willing to expose their entertainment emotions to watch outside their homes? Because public bingers rank having access to movies or shows higher than food and water as “essential” items for travelling or commuting (2). Just be prepared that streaming Stranger Things while surrounded by strangers is making social norms go upside down. And catching someone snooping on your screen during a risque scene or LOL’ing on a crowded train is the new normal. \n \n We’re Being Watched While We’re Watching \n \n Nearly half (45%) of those watching on the go have caught a backseat binger snooping on their screen. But there’s no reason to call Chief Hopper - only 18% of public bingers have felt embarrassed about what they’re watching and 77% refuse to turn off their show or movie. There’s no shame in our stream game. \n \n We’re Spoiling Shows for Screen Snoopers (Sorry!) \n \n Screen snooping can have real consequences! Eleven percent of public bingers have had a show or movie spoiled by seeing someone else’s screen. The risk is even greater if you plan to sneak a peak in South Korea where 24% have suffered from spoilers. \n \n We’re Being Interrupted By Strangers \n \n More than a quarter (27%) of public bingers have had a stranger interrupt their show or movie to start a conversation about what they’re watching. But that doesn’t mean we have to pull a Kingpin. Episode intruders are likely just jealous we remembered to download our shows before leaving the house. \n \n We Wear Our Shows On Our Sleeves \n \n No matter how meticulously we curate our lives on social media, there’s no filter for laughter or tears in real life. The majority of public bingers have laughed out loud and one in five have even cried while watching in public. Globally, Mexico, Colombia and Chile are the most outwardly emotional countries. Conversely, it’s unlikely to see a German bawling while they binge. \n \n Ultimately, a spoiled show or a steamy scene streamed with a stranger is worth the awkwardness if it means we get to keep watching what we love. So next time you’re packing your bags, don’t forget to pack your favorite binge, too. \n \n Methodology \n \n *The survey was conducted by SurveyMonkey from August 24 - September 7, 2017 and based on 37,056 responses. The sample was balanced by age and gender and representative of an adult online population who watch movies and TV shows via streaming services in public settings in The United States, Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, France, Germany, India, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, Netherlands, Philippines, Poland, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, Thailand and Turkey. \n \n (1) An estimated 2.4bn people will use a smartphone this year, an increase of 10.8 per cent, according to eMarketer’s latest forecast. \n \n (2) When asked to rank travel or commuting “essentials” public bingers globally listed “access to movies and tv shows” higher than food and beverages. (30% versus 25% and 23%, respectively). \n \n ABOUT NETFLIX \n \n Netflix is the world's leading internet entertainment service with over 109 million members in over 190 countries enjoying more than 125 million hours of TV shows and movies per day, including original series, documentaries and feature films.

304,"['STOCKTON — This Gold Rush-era port city, an epicenter of California\'s agricultural exports, will become the nation\'s largest city to seek protection under the U.S. bankruptcy code after its City Council on Tuesday stopped bond payments, slashed employee health and retirement benefits and adopted a day-to-day survival budget. \n \n \n \n City Manager Bob Deis likened the process to cutting off an arm to save the body. He is expected to file bankruptcy papers immediately. \n \n \n \n A Delta wind had scrubbed the Central Valley sky blue as residents gathered hours early for the 5:30 p.m. meeting. \n \n \n \n CHAT: Discuss at 9 a.m. Wednesday \n \n \n \n Most knew what the night held; bankruptcy has been a long time coming. Stockton has been in negotiations with its creditors since late March under AB 506, a new California law requiring mediation before a municipality can file for reorganization of debt. It was the first use of the law, and policy analysts who watched its torturous and tedious progress have titled their report on it ""Death by a Thousand Meetings."" Mediations ended Monday at midnight. \n \n \n \n Recent council meetings have been boisterous and contentious. Tuesday night\'s meeting was quieter, with an evident sadness on faces in the packed audience. Many residents said they were there mostly to hear for themselves that the day so long expected had finally come. \n \n \n \n ""It\'s a seminal moment in this city\'s history and I needed to be here,"" said Dwight Williams, who runs a nonprofit housing organization. ""I can\'t just read about this in tomorrow\'s paper. I need to hear for myself if there is some inkling as to where we go from here."" \n \n \n \n La Vonne Belli, 84, said she was there to hear what people had to say. \n \n \n \n ""I don\'t mean those people up there on the dais in their comfortable chairs. I mean the little people, the real people,"" she said. ""The ones who have to keep muddling through somehow."" \n \n \n \n Almost all who spoke to the council began with some version of: ""I was born and raised here."" \n \n \n \n Although a city of almost 300,000, Stockton is a place where many families have known one another for generations. The most impassioned speakers argued on behalf of others, with the main rallying cry a plea to keep health insurance for retirees with illnesses. A high school student spoke of his aunt, a retired city worker with cancer, and a retired fire chief spoke of his former secretary who cares for her ill husband. \n \n \n \n ""People look at me and say, \'Well he can afford his own insurance,\' and I can,"" said Gary Gillis, the retired chief. ""But how about the ones who mowed the lawns, went in the sewers, typed my letters? We have to protect the most vulnerable among us."" \n \n \n \n Experts say there are no clear answers to what comes next for Stockton or how its fall will affect the rest of the state. Other cities hit hard by the housing bust and state budget crisis are negotiating with employee unions for concessions and are watching to see if municipal bankruptcy proves medicine or poison. \n \n \n \n The stated purpose of AB 506 — to forestall a municipal bankruptcy — failed, but several bankruptcy attorneys said the mediation may help Stockton avoid the string of lawsuits that faced the smaller city of Vallejo, which recently emerged from a bankruptcy case filed in 2008. \n \n \n \n How Stockton found itself so mired in debt can be seen everywhere in the city\'s core. There is a sparkling marina, high-rise hotel and promenade financed by credit in the mid-2000s, mere blocks from where mothers won\'t let their children play in the yard because of violence. \n \n \n \n During the economic boom, this working-class city with pockets of entrenched poverty tried to reinvent itself as a draw to Bay Area refugees and a popular site for conventions. It offered generous city employee pension plans and benefits. \n \n \n \n Vast housing tracts of two-story homes were built at the city\'s edges. Private citizens, like the city, bought on credit. Those neighborhoods would soon have among the highest rates of foreclosures in the nation. \n \n \n \n Indeed, when the bust came, few places fell as hard as Stockton. The city has the second-highest rate of foreclosures in the country and the second-highest rate of violent crime in the state. \n \n \n \n The city made $90 million in drastic cuts from the general fund in the last three years, including reducing the police department by 25%, the fire department by 30%, and cutting pay and benefits to all employees. There is a state investigation into whether Stockton\'s financial devastation was entirely due to shortsighted optimism or if there was corruption. The state mediation law requires assigning blame. \n \n \n \n But on Tuesday some of the blame and anger seemed to be set aside for a moment. \n \n \n \n ""All that\'s left is sadness,"" said Gillis, who said he lived his boyhood dream by becoming fire chief in his hometown. ""Stockton has the most good, solid, down-to-earth people you\'ll ever meet. And now things are going to get even harder for many of them."" \n \n \n \n diana.marcum@latimes.com', 'The Atlanta Journal-Constitution \n \n BIRMINGHAM, Ala. – A final Deep South stand could be at hand for the Newt Gingrich campaign, as it said victories in Tuesday’s primaries in Alabama and Mississippi are crucial to remaining in the Republican presidential race. \n \n Gingrich resisted cries that he ditch his campaign Wednesday after winning just one state – his old home of Georgia – on Super Tuesday, and he scrapped plans to visit the Kansas caucuses to focus on the pair of states he thinks he can win next week. \n \n “We are staying in this race because I believe it is going to be impossible for a moderate to win in the general election,” Gingrich said at a rally in Montgomery, Ala., one of three he held in the state Wednesday, greeted by hundreds of enthusiastic supporters at each turn. \n \n His rivals and others turned up the pressure to get him to leave, starting with allies of former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum who argue that Santorum – who has much better standing in national polls, more state wins and more delegates – is the best candidate for conservatives to rally around against former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney. \n \n If Gingrich remains in the race “it’s only a hindrance to a conservative alternative to Romney,” said Stuart Roy, an adviser to a Santorum-aligned Super PAC, the Red, White and Blue Fund. \n \n Longtime conservative activist Richard Viguerie argued that Gingrich should endorse Santorum and at this point Gingrich ""can either be a kingmaker or a spoiler"" in a statement on a conservative website. \n \n The talk put Gingrich on the defensive during his appearance on Bill Bennett’s “Morning in America” radio show Wednesday. \n \n The former Georgia congressman credited Santorum with having a “terrific” month. But he highlighted how the former Pennsylvania senator lost -- by a wide margin -- his 2006 election bid to keep his U.S. Senate seat. \n \n “If I thought he was a slam dunk to beat Romney and to beat Obama, I would really consider getting out. I don’t,” Gingrich said. “I think each of the three candidates has strengths and weaknesses and that this is a very healthy vetting process.” \n \n The former U.S. House speaker then pointed to past Democratic and Republican presidential candidates who stuck it out for months on the campaign trail and went on to win their party’s nomination. Bennett, who served as President Ronald Reagan’s secretary of education, asked Gingrich if the Republican Party was “bleeding” from the protracted battle for the nomination. Gingrich responded that some people said Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton “were bleeding [in the 2008 primaries] except John McCain didn’t use that four-month period very well. The fact is he lost the presidency.” \n \n Bennett pressed Gingrich: “Can you say: ‘If I can’t break out of the South, I can’t win one state outside the South, or if I continue to trail the numbers of Santorum that I am trailing now, then I am not going to go forever.’” \n \n Gingrich didn’t budge. \n \n “No, because if you asked Rick Santorum that question immediately after Nevada, what would we have said?” Gingrich responded. “He had been running fourth for a month and – including me – people were saying maybe he should drop out. He ignored all those. He now has had a terrific month. I think you have to wait and see how the race goes on.” \n \n The Romney campaign argued that it is already too late to stop him. It distributed a memo from political director Rich Beeson laying out the delegate race and concluding: “As Governor Romney’s opponents attempt to ignore the basic principles of math, the only person’s odds of winning they are increasing are President Obama’s.” \n \n According to the Associated Press, after Super Tuesday Romney leads with 415 convention delegates, followed by Santorum with 176, Gingrich with 105 and Texas Rep. Ron Paul with 47. \n \n The Gingrich campaign circulated math of its own from Atlanta attorney and campaign adviser Randy Evans, who argues that the huge delegate prizes in Texas and California in late May and early June make it worth staying in. \n \n The argument hinges on winning big in Alabama and Mississippi. Spokesman R.C. Hammond said Gingrich territory is a swath from Spartanburg, S.C., to West Texas that is “the heart and soul of the Republican Party.” \n \n Those states “all need to go to Gingrich,” he said. \n \n Hammond said the campaign, perpetually low on funding, plans to purchase advertising in the two states touting Gingrich’s promise to reduce gas prices to $2.50 a gallon. He appeared at a Texaco station in Pell City, Ala., and posed in front of a gas pump to emphasize the point. \n \n The Gingrich argument for remaining in the race hinges both on hopeful math and faith that there is time left for another dramatic turn in a race that has seen plenty of them. \n \n “If we win both Alabama and Mississippi next Tuesday night this is a whole new race,” Gingrich said at a rally in Pell City, “for, I think, the ninth time.” \n \n The Associated Press contributed to this article.', 'Lady Gaga furious after Paris show postponed for a second time; apologizes to fans on Twitter \n \n Pizzello/AP Lady Gaga was forced to postpone a show in Paris for the second time. \n \n After snowy weather forced Lady Gaga to postpone her concert in Paris on Sunday for a second time, the pop monster is left hoping the third time will be the charm. \n \n The concert was postponed for the first time in October amid nationwide strikes over the government’s plan to raise the country\'s retirement age. \n \n This weekend, it was snowy weather that forced authorities to ban big trucks from driving through the city. \n \n Concert organizers said Gaga would be able to take the stage Monday, and that the show originally slated for Sunday would be rescheduled for Tuesday. \n \n \n \n Despite the near-nationwide shutdown, the pop diva took to Twitter to vent about her crew\'s transportation woes as she was miserably stuck on a bus. \n \n ""All 28 of my trucks for the Monsterball were detained by the French government going on over 26 hrs, 2 of my employees were arrested trying to get into Paris so we could perform,"" she tweeted on Sunday.

The fire department was cut by 30%, and other city employees by 40%. Employee pay and benefits, once perhaps overly generous, were also cut.

305,"['Photo: Getty \n \n It’s becoming increasingly clear that Facebook has never faced a scandal like the one it’s currently fighting through. Revelations over the weekend about its reckless sharing of user data sent its stock price plunging on Monday, and fresh calls for regulations on the social media network are looking more real than ever. \n \n In the last few days, multiple outlets broke various facets of the story: Facebook has known since 2015 that Cambridge Analytica, a data-mining company hired by President Trump’s election campaign, improperly obtained the personal data of 50 million of the network’s users—and the social giant failed to do much of anything about it. In a blog post on Friday, Facebook said it has suspended the accounts of Cambridge Analytica and its parent company, SCL, while it investigates their alleged failure to comply with an agreement to delete the ill-gotten data. \n \n Advertisement \n \n The particulars of this case are relatively complex, but the most important thing to understand is that Facebook collects an enormous amount of data about its users, and it lost control of that data. When it found out, it asked the bad actors responsible to promise they would delete the data. Now Facebook claims that Cambridge Analytica and SCL may have failed to fulfill that promise. And whatever you do, Facebook execs say, don’t call this a “breach.” \n \n So after years of Facebook big shots telling us to just trust them when it comes to the ways it handles our data and targets us with advertising, a third-party allegedly violated Facebook’s trust. In the past, the company has met such scandals with a mixture of outright denials and promises to change, while mostly maintaining the status quo—and its bottom line just kept growing. On Monday, early market signs showed the dam could be breaking. \n \n This morning, Reuters reported that Facebook’s stock fell more than 4 percent in premarket trading. That trend has continued thoughout the day, with the stock down about 6.42 percent at the time of writing. Ripple effects spread to the Dow and Nasdaq as well. And analysts are warning investors to stay away from buying the dip right now. According to Reuters: \n \n One Wall Street analyst said the reports raised ‘systemic problems’ with Facebook’s business model and a number said it could spur far deeper regulatory scrutiny of the platform... ‘We think this episode is another indication of systemic problems at Facebook,’ said Brian Wieser, analyst at New York-based brokerage Pivotal Research Group, which already has a ‘sell’ rating on a stock that rose 60 percent last year. Wieser argued that regulatory risks for the company would intensify and enhanced use of data in advertising would be at greater risk than before. He added, however, that it was unlikely to have a meaningful impact on the company’s business for now, with advertisers unlikely to ‘suddenly change the trajectory of their spending growth on the platform.’ \n \n Advertisement \n \n It’s true that Facebook has previously weathered similar storms by either outright denying any issues exist or promising to just keep tweaking that algorithm and rolling out new terms of service. But this time feels a bit different. \n \n Lawmakers around the world have vocally called for regulations, hearings, and investigations into this incident over the last few days and more continue to chime in. New Jersey Rep. Frank Pallone insisted on Monday that “the Energy and Commerce Committee must hold hearings soon.” That follows Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobucher’s demand that Mark Zuckerberg appear to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee and Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden grilling him with questions. \n \n On top of that, experts say that this case could easily be determined as a violation of the FTC’s consent decree that resolved a previous privacy case in 2011. If FTC investigators decided to throw the book at Facebook, they could potentially levy “trillions of dollars” worth of fines against the company. \n \n Advertisement \n \n British Prime Minister Theresa May released a statement on Monday expressing her concerns about the story, and British Parliament member Damian Collins went further, saying, “Someone has to take responsibility for this. It’s time for Mark Zuckerberg to stop hiding behind his Facebook page.” \n \n In the past, Zuckerberg has typically addressed controversies with long essays on his personal Facebook page and promises to do better. But so far, the CEO has been quiet about this particular controversy. We’ve reached out to Facebook to ask if it has a timeframe for when Zuckerberg plans to address this incident personally and we’ll update this post when we receive a reply. \n \n Facebook’s growth and revenue have consistently gone up over the years, but in late January the company reported that people were spending less time on the platform and it experienced its first-ever decline in daily users. As awareness grows about this incident, public wariness of Facebook is certain to increase. After all, how many other “non-breaches” have occurred just like this one? \n \n \n \n Advertisement \n \n But it’s lawmakers, above all, that Facebook and its investors need to fear. Protracted investigations and hearings could have a chilling effect on the company’s stock as uncertainty grows. It will likely be alone in any fights against Washington as the tech industry looks for a sacrificial lamb to offer up in penance for its sins. And politicians around the globe are dealing with populist uprisings fueled by outside actors agitating through Facebook—in other words, they have an ax to grind. \n \n All of the mega-corporations of tech have misdeeds to account for, but Facebook is relatively unique in the ways that its platform has been used, and the extremely personal information it collects. \n \n Christopher Wylie, the Cambridge Analytics employee who blew the whistle on this case, claimed in an interview with The Guardian that he “made Steve Bannon’s psychological warfare tool.” While Wylie may have made the tool, it seems more and more clear that Mark Zuckerberg provided the steel, the forge, and the target. \n \n Advertisement \n \n [Reuters, Bloomberg]', 'Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Cambridge Analytica: What we know so far \n \n It\'s a sensational story containing allegations of sleaze, psychological manipulation and data misuse that has provoked an internationally furious response. \n \n Tech giant Facebook and data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica are at the centre of a dispute over the harvesting and use of personal data - and whether it was used to influence the outcome of the US 2016 presidential election or the UK Brexit referendum. \n \n Both firms deny any wrongdoing. \n \n The boss of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, has since been suspended, while Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has been called on by a Commons parliamentary committee to give evidence. \n \n How has Cambridge Analytica been accused of sleazy tactics? \n \n Channel 4 News sent an undercover reporter to meet executives from data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica, following reports by the journalist Carole Cadwalladr in the Observer newspaper. \n \n The firm had been credited with helping Donald Trump to presidential victory. \n \n The reporter posed as a Sri Lankan businessman wanting to influence a local election. \n \n Cambridge Analytica boss Alexander Nix was apparently filmed giving examples of how his firm could discredit political rivals by arranging various smear campaigns, including setting up encounters with prostitutes and staging situations in which apparent bribery could be caught on camera. \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Alexander Nix, CEO, Cambridge Analytica: ""These sort of tactics are very effective"" \n \n The firm denies all the claims and says the documentary was ""edited and scripted to grossly represent the nature of those conversations"". It claims the conversations were led by the reporters. \n \n ""I must emphatically state that Cambridge Analytica does not condone or engage in entrapment, bribes or so-called \'honey traps\', and nor does it use untrue material for any purpose,"" said Mr Nix. \n \n What was Facebook\'s role? \n \n In 2014 a quiz on Facebook invited users to find out their personality type. \n \n Image copyright Getty Images \n \n It was developed by University of Cambridge academic Aleksandr Kogan (the university has no connections with Cambridge Analytica). \n \n As was common with apps and games at that time, it was designed to harvest not only the user data of the person taking part in the quiz, but also the data of their friends. \n \n Facebook has since changed the amount of data developers can scrape in this way. \n \n Christopher Wylie, who worked with Cambridge Analytica, alleges that because 270,000 people took the quiz, the data of some 50 million users, mainly in the US, was harvested without their explicit consent via their friend networks. \n \n Mr Wylie claims the data was sold to Cambridge Analytica, which then used it to psychologically profile people and deliver pro-Trump material to them. \n \n Cambridge Analytica denies any of it was used as part of the services it provided to the Trump campaign. \n \n Is this against Facebook\'s terms? \n \n The data was gathered using Facebook\'s infrastructure at that time, and many other developers had taken advantage of it - but the data was not authorised for them to share with others. \n \n The other key point is that even the people directly taking part in the personality quiz would have had no idea that they were potentially sharing their data with Donald Trump\'s election campaign. \n \n Facebook say when they learned their rules had been breached, they removed the app and demanded assurances that the information had been deleted. \n \n Cambridge Analytica claims that it never used the data, and deleted it when Facebook told it to. \n \n Both Facebook and the UK Information Commissioner want to find out whether it was properly destroyed, as Mr Wylie claims it was not. \n \n What has the official response been? \n \n Image copyright Getty Images Image caption There are calls for Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg to testify before Congress \n \n US senators have called on Mark Zuckerberg to testify before Congress about how Facebook will protect users. \n \n In the UK, the chairman of a parliamentary committee, Damian Collins, has summoned Mr Zuckerberg to explain the ""catastrophic failure"" to MPs. \n \n The head of the European Parliament said it would investigate to see if the data was misused. \n \n A spokesman for Prime Minister Theresa May said she was ""very concerned"" about the revelations. \n \n Meanwhile, Cambridge Analytica has suspended its chief executive, Alexander Nix, saying his comments ""do not represent the values or operations of the firm"". \n \n And the academic who created the app at the centre of the storm, Dr Aleksandr Kogan, said he has been made ""a scapegoat"". \n \n How can you protect your data? \n \n There are a few things to be aware of if you want to restrict who has access to your data. \n \n Keep an eye on apps, especially those which require you to log in using your Facebook account - they often have a very wide range of permissions and many are specifically designed to pick up your data \n \n Use an ad blocker to limit advertising \n \n Look at your Facebook security settings and make sure you are aware of what is enabled. Check the individual app settings to see whether you have given them permission to view your friends as well as yourself. \n \n You can download a copy of the data Facebook holds on you, although it is not comprehensive. There is a download button at the bottom of the General Account Settings tab. However bear in mind that your data may be less secure sitting on your laptop than it is on Facebook\'s servers, if your device is hacked. \n \n You can of course, simply leave Facebook, but the campaign group Privacy International warns that privacy concerns extend beyond the social network. \n \n ""The current focus is on protecting your data being exploited by third parties, but your data is being exploited all the time,"" said a spokeswoman. \n \n ""Many apps on your phone will have permission to access location data, your entire phone book and so on. It is just the tip of the iceberg.""', 'Amid calls for investigation and a #DeleteFacebook campaign, company releases an official statement but its figurehead keeps quiet \n \n The chief executive of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, has remained silent over the more than 48 hours since the Observer revealed the harvesting of 50 million users’ personal data, even as his company is buffeted by mounting calls for investigation and regulation, falling stock prices and a social media campaign to #DeleteFacebook. \n \n \n \n Facebook’s shares slid 6.77% on Monday following the news, knocking $36bn off the company’s valuation as investors worried about the consequences of the revelations. Zuckerberg owns 16% of the company and personally saw his fortune fall $5.5bn to $69bn, according to Forbes’ live tracker of the world’s wealthiest people. \n \n Cambridge Analytica boasts of dirty tricks to swing elections Read more \n \n The embattled social media company announced on Monday that it will engage a digital forensics firm to conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica to determine whether or not the firm still has copies of the data in question. \n \n The Observer reported this weekend that a company called Global Science Research (GSR) harvested tens of millions of Facebook profiles and sold the data to Cambridge Analytica. The New York Times reported on Saturday that Cambridge Analytica still possesses “most or all” of the harvested data. Cambridge Analytica has denied knowing that the data was obtained improperly. \n \n “If this data still exists, it would be a grave violation of Facebook’s policies and an unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments these groups made,” Facebook said in a statement. \n \n The engagement of the digital forensics firm Stroz Friedberg is unlikely to assuage officials in the US or UK, where lawmakers have issued calls for Zuckerberg to testify about the data breach. Representatives of Stroz Friedberg were at Cambridge Analytica’s office in London on Monday evening when the UK Information Commissioner’s Office asked them to leave so the authorities could pursue its own investigation, Facebook said hours after the first announcement. \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest ‘It’s time for Mark Zuckerberg to stop hiding behind his Facebook page,’ a Conservative politician said. Photograph: NurPhoto/NurPhoto via Getty Images \n \n On Monday, the US senator Ron Wyden sent Zuckerberg a detailed list of questions related to the breach, with a demand for answers by 13 April. Two members of the Senate judiciary committee, Democrat Amy Klobuchar and Republican John Kennedy, called for hearings with the CEOs of Facebook, Twitter and Google. \n \n “It’s time for Mark Zuckerberg to stop hiding behind his Facebook page,” said the Conservative MP Damian Collins, chair of the digital, culture, media and sport select committee. \n \n Referencing the government’s request for Facebook’s auditors to leave Cambridge Analytica’s offices, Collins tweeted: “These investigations need to be undertaken by the proper authorities.” \n \n The three social media companies testified in Washington last fall, following the revelation that their platforms had been used by foreign agents seeking to illegally influence the US presidential election. All three companies sent their general counsels, a move that was criticized at the time. It is unlikely that Zuckerberg will be able to avoid congressional questioning a second time. \n \n Experts have long criticized Facebook’s privacy practices, but their warnings have done little to dissuade users – now numbering more than 2 billion around the world – from signing up for the platform. \n \n Facebook employs psychologist whose firm sold data to Cambridge Analytica Read more \n \n Whether the scandal will result in actual change in user trust of the company remains to be seen, but the hashtag #DeleteFacebook trended on Twitter on Monday as users shared their intention to log off the social network for good. Others tweeted #WheresZuck, in reference to the executive’s silence. \n \n Also on Monday, the New York Times reported that Facebook’s chief security officer, Alex Stamos, would be leaving the company following disagreements with other executives over the handling of the investigation into the Russian influence operation. \n \n Stamos obliquely referenced the report on Twitter, though he did not issue a full denial, writing: “Despite the rumors, I’m still fully engaged with my work at Facebook. It’s true that my role did change. I’m currently spending more time exploring emerging security risks and working on election security.” \n \n The Times reported that Stamos’ responsibilities were reassigned in December and that almost all of the 120 people on his team were transferred to other departments, but that he had agreed to remain at the company through August. \n \n “Alex Stamos continues to be the chief security officer (CSO) at Facebook,” a Facebook spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “He has held this position for nearly three years and leads our security efforts especially around emerging security risks. He is a valued member of the team and we are grateful for all he does each and every day.” \n \n Stamos is one of a small handful of Facebook executives who addressed the data harvesting scandal on Twitter over the weekend while Zuckerberg and Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, said nothing.', 'The backlash comes as Facebook and other big internet firms are under scrutiny for how Russia manipulated their platforms before and after the 2016 presidential election.

Above, displays of social-media posts at a House panel hearing in November. Photo: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg News \n \n Facebook Inc. FB -5.23% confronted an intensifying crisis as political leaders in the U.S. and Europe called for aggressive inquiries into whether the technology giant failed to stop improper access and handling of user data, scrutiny that sent the company’s stock to its biggest decline in four years. \n \n The uproar pushed Facebook’s stock down 6.8% to $172.56 Monday, wiping out about $36 billion in market value as the episode reignited concerns over how Facebook, Alphabet Inc.’s GOOGL -0.82% Google and other internet firms handle user data that is at the core of advertising businesses that have made them among the richest companies on Earth. \n \n The backlash has raised anew the prospect of tighter regulation of the social-network company and other big internet firms that already are under scrutiny for how Russia manipulated their platforms before and after the 2016 presidential election. Internally, Facebook executives and employees have fiercely debated how to respond to the additional scrutiny. \n \n The latest controversy centers on whether Cambridge Analytica, which helped the Trump campaign in 2016, collected and used without permission data from the accounts of millions of users obtained through a Facebook app developed by an academic at the University of Cambridge. Facebook on Friday said it suspended Cambridge Analytica—along with an associated firm, the academic and another individual—as it investigates reports that the firm kept user records for years after saying it had destroyed them. Cambridge Analytica has said it complied with Facebook’s rules. \n \n Republican and Democratic lawmakers called for tech-company leaders, including Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, to appear before Congress to explain how they protect user data from being exploited by third-party companies for advertising and other targeting purposes. \n \n “Facebook, Google, and Twitter have amassed unprecedented amounts of personal data and use this data when selling advertising, including political advertisements,” said Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn.) and John Kennedy (R., La.) in a joint statement on Monday. “The lack of oversight on how data is stored and how political advertisements are sold raises concerns about the integrity of American elections as well as privacy rights.” \n \n Related Video The Kremlin-backed Internet Research Agency, a.k.a. the Troll Factory, \u200bused fake social media accounts before and after the 2016 U.S. election to collect sensitive personal information on Americans, a Wall Street Journal investigation has found.

Klobuchar and Kennedy are members of the Judiciary Committee and have asked the panel’s chairman, Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa), to hold hearings. A spokesman for Mr. Grassley said no decision had been made to whether to hold such a hearing as the panel was “currently gathering information and taking steps to inform any action by the committee.” \n \n They join others on Capitol Hill and in Europe calling for additional scrutiny of tech companies and Cambridge’s practices. Other senior members of Congress are calling for either additional investigations or renewed steps to curb abuse in digital advertising. \n \n Ron Wyden (D., Ore.), wrote a letter to Mr. Zuckerberg demanding answers to a series of questions about media reports on how Cambridge Analytica used the Facebook data. Mr. Wyden said the incident calls into question a number of issues, including “the prudence and desirability of Facebook’s business practices and the dangers of monetizing consumers’ private information.” \n \n Sen. John Thune (R., S.D.), chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over some technology issues, said he was planning to send a request to Facebook for more information. Facebook has a “responsibility to make sure that that data is used in an appropriate way,” Mr. Thune said. \n \n Newsletter Sign-up \n \n Meanwhile, the European Parliament’s president, Antonio Tajani, on Monday said “allegations of misuse of Facebook user data is an unacceptable violation of our citizens’ privacy rights” and vowed that Parliament will investigate fully. \n \n The EU’s justice chief, Věra Jourová, said she expected “companies to take more responsibility when handling our personal data.” She said she would seek clarifications from Facebook and would discuss the matter with U.S. government officials on her scheduled trip to the U.S. this week. \n \n Facebook executives have struggled to find responses that didn’t fuel more recrimination—repeating a pattern that has played out over the company’s response to a string of crises over the past 18 months. Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser said the weekend’s episode was another sign of “systemic problems” within the company. Mr. Wieser has a “sell” rating on the stock. \n \n Several executives took to Twitter over the weekend to argue that Cambridge’s use of data, if confirmed, would be an abuse but wouldn’t constitute a data breach because the records were gathered through proper channels. \n \n Andrew Bosworth, a senior Facebook executive, wrote in a Facebook post on Monday that Cambridge’s actions amounted to a breach of trust. “Much of the critique that has emerged over the weekend is valid and I am following it closely and listening,” he said. \n \n Facebook Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos on Saturday deleted several tweets arguing against the use of the “data breach” term, later saying his remarks were factually correct but he “should have done a better job weighing in.” Mr. Stamos said he thought it was important for Facebook executives to talk about these complex issues publicly, but “I don’t know how to do that in this media environment.” \n \n Mr. Stamos has been at the center of Facebook’s response to the Russian manipulation efforts, and he and other security officials have argued internally that Facebook should publicly disclose more about that activity. Mr. Stamos has indicated that he plans to leave Facebook in August, people familiar with the situation said on Monday. \n \n Facebook began in 2007 letting outsiders access its “social graph”—the friend connections, interests and “likes” that linked its user base together. A range of organizations were allowed to use the information, including political campaigns. President Barack Obama’s 2012 re-election campaign, for example, created a voter-outreach app that analyzed users’ Facebook connections and encouraged users to reach out to potential Obama supporters among them. \n \n By 2015, Facebook had largely stopped access to users’ friend connections, though political campaigns could still find would-be supporters by buying ads and using Facebook’s targeting tools. \n \n Facebook has said it had learned in 2015 that Aleksandr Kogan, a psychology professor at the University of Cambridge, broke its data policies when he shared user data gleaned from his personality-prediction app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” with parties that included Cambridge Analytica. \n \n At the time, Facebook’s platform rules allowed Mr. Kogan to glean information about those who downloaded the app—as well as many data points about their friends. Facebook has since restricted access to friend data. \n \n Facebook said when it learned in 2015 that Mr. Kogan’s company shared data with Cambridge Analytica in violation of its terms of service, it obtained legal agreements to delete the information from the firm and Mr. Kogan, along with a man named Christopher Wylie, who worked with Cambridge Analytica. Facebook now is investigating whether the parties kept the data anyway. \n \n A Cambridge Analytica spokesman said in a statement that its political division didn’t use Facebook data collected by Mr. Kogan’s company. The firm said that it deleted all data it received after it became clear that Mr. Kogan violated Facebook’s policies. Mr. Kogan didn’t respond to a request to comment and Mr. Wylie couldn’t reached to comment. \n \n About 270,000 people downloaded the app, giving Mr. Kogan access to information such as the cities they lived in, the content they had liked, or information about their friends, Facebook has said. According to a report in the New York Times, as many as 50 million Facebook users were swept up in the data collection. \n \n On Monday, Facebook said it hired a digital forensics firm, Stroz Friedberg, to do a “comprehensive audit” of Cambridge Analytica, which agreed to give “complete access” to its servers and systems. \n \n Facebook also asked Mr. Kogan and Mr. Wylie to agree to an audit; the company said that Mr. Kogan provided a verbal agreement, while Mr. Wylie declined. Facebook said the audits were part of a broader review conducted by the company to determine whether the parties deleted the user data as they certified some years ago. \n \n “If this data still exists, it would be a grave violation of Facebook’s policies and an unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments these groups made,” Facebook said. \n \n —Natalia Drozdiak in Brussels and Sam Schechner in Paris contributed to this article.', ""This video has been removed.

From 2007 he took over the company’s elections division, and claims to have worked on more than 40 campaigns globally. Many of SCL’s projects are secret, so that may be a low estimate. He set up Cambridge Analytica to work in America, with investment from US hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer. He has been both hailed as a visionary – featuring on Wired’s list of “25 Geniuses who are creating the future of business” – and derided as a snake oil salesman. Controversies Cambridge Analytica has come under scrutiny for its role in elections on both sides of the Atlantic, working on Brexit and Donald Trump’s election team. It is a key subject in two inquiries in the UK – by the Electoral Commission, into the firm’s possible role in the EU referendum, and the Information Commissioner’s Office, into data analytics for political purposes – and one in the US, as part of special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into Trump-Russia collusion. The Observer revealed this week that the company had harvested millions of Facebook profiles of US voters, in one of the tech giant’s biggest ever data breaches, and used them to build a powerful software program to predict and influence choices at the ballot box. Emma Graham-Harrison Photograph: The Washington Post \n \n The company, and Nix, are under pressure from politicians in the US and the UK to explain how it handled the data and what role the information played in its campaigns, if any. \n \n Play Video 3:41 What is the Cambridge Analytica scandal? - video explainer \n \n The Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham criticised Cambridge Analytica for being “unco-operative” with her investigation as she confirmed that her watchdog would apply for a warrant to help her examine the firm’s activities. \n \n Cambridge Analytica has sold itself as the ultimate hi-tech consultant, winning votes by using data to pinpoint target groups and design messages that will appeal powerfully to their interests, although it denies using Facebook information in its work. \n \n \n \n But in the undercover investigation by Channel 4 News, in association with the Observer, executives claimed to offer a much darker range of services. \n \n \n \n No 10 'very concerned' over Facebook data breach by Cambridge Analytica Read more \n \n In a series of meetings with a reporter posing as a representative of a wealthy Sri Lankan family seeking political influence, Cambridge Analytica executives initially denied the company was in the business of using entrapment techniques. \n \n But Nix later detailed the dirty tricks the company would be prepared to pull behind the scenes to help its clients. \n \n \n \n When the reporter asked if Cambridge Analytica could offer investigations into the damaging secrets of rivals, Nix said it worked with former spies from Britain and Israel to look for political dirt. He also volunteered that his team were ready to go further than an investigation. \n \n \n \n “Oh, we do a lot more than that,” he said over dinner at an exclusive hotel in London. “Deep digging is interesting, but you know equally effective can be just to go and speak to the incumbents and to offer them a deal that’s too good to be true and make sure that that’s video recorded. \n \n “You know these sort of tactics are very effective, instantly having video evidence of corruption.” \n \n Nix suggested one possible scenario, in which the managing director of Cambridge Analytica’s political division, Mark Turnbull, would pose as a wealthy developer looking to exchange campaign finance for land. “I’m a master of disguise,” Turnbull said. \n \n Another option, Nix suggested, would be to create a sex scandal. “Send some girls around to the candidate’s house, we have lots of history of things,” he told the reporter. “We could bring some Ukrainians in on holiday with us, you know what I’m saying.” \n \n \n \n He said these were hypothetical scenarios, but suggested his ideas were based on precedent. “Please don’t pay too much attention to what I’m saying, because I’m just giving you examples of what can be done, what has been done.” \n \n \n \n Any work may have stayed out of the spotlight partly because Cambridge Analytica works hard to cover traces of its operations, Nix said, using a shifting network of names and front groups. \n \n \n \n “We’re used to operating through different vehicles, in the shadows, and I look forward to building a very long-term and secretive relationship with you,” Nix told the source in a first phone call. \n \n \n \n Cambridge Analytica sometimes contracts under a different name, so that there are no records of its involvement, Turnbull said. That does not only protect the company, but also makes its work more efficient, he is recorded saying. \n \n “It has to happen without anyone thinking it’s propaganda, because the moment you think ‘that’s propaganda’ the next question is: ‘Who’s put that out?’” \n \n He added: “It may be that we have to contract under a different name ... a different entity, with a different name, so that no record exists with our name attached to this at all.” \n \n In a recent project in eastern Europe, the company sent a team but “no one even knew they were there, they were just ghosted in, did the work, ghosted out”, Turnbull said. \n \n Covers include the setting up of fake academic projects, sometimes simply going in on tourist visas, as former employees have told the Guardian they did for US elections – apparently employed in violation of Federal law. \n \n \n \n Nix also offered details regarding the services of professional ex-spies from Britain and Israel. “We have two projects at the moment, which involve doing deep deep depth research on the opposition and providing source ... really damaging source material, that we can decide how to deploy in the course of the campaign.” \n \n Denham told Channel 4 News that she had issued a demand for access to Cambridge Analytica earlier this month. They were given until 6pm on Monday to respond to it, but she said the company had been “unco-operative” with the investigation and that she would be applying to the courts on Tuesday for a warrant. “We need to get in there. We need to look at the databases. We need to look at the servers and understand how data was processed or deleted by Cambridge Analytica. There are a lot of conflicting stories about the data,” she said. \n \n Cambridge Analytica said the Channel 4 News investigation contained false claims, factual inaccuracies and substantial mischaracterisations. \n \n \n \n It accused Channel 4 of setting out to entrap staff by initiating a conversation about unethical practices. It rejected any suggestion that the company used fake news, honey traps, bribes or entrapment. \n \n It said: “We entirely refute any allegation that Cambridge Anlytica or any of its affiliates use entrapment, bribes or so-called ‘honey-traps’ for any purpose whatsoever … Cambridge Analytica does not use untrue material for any purpose.” \n \n Of the suggestions they used honey trap techniques, the company said: “Our executives humoured these questions and actively encouraged the prospective client to further disclose his intentions.” \n \n Play Video 13:04 Cambridge Analytica whistleblower: 'We spent $1m harvesting millions of Facebook profiles' – video \n \n In a later statement Cambridge Analytica accused Channel 4 News of attempting to entrap its executives by initiating a conversation about unethical practices, which it insisted the company did not use. \n \n Admitting he misjudged the situation, Nix said: “In playing along with this line of conversation … we entertained a series of ludicrous hypothetical scenarios. I am aware how this looks … I deeply regret my role in the meeting and I have already apologised to staff. I should have recognised where the prospective client was taking our conversations and ended the relationship sooner.” \n \n \n \n On Saturday, Cambridge Analytica denied it had done anything wrong in relation to the handling of Facebook data. \n \n “Cambridge Analytica only receives and uses data that has been obtained legally and fairly. Our robust data protection policies comply with US, international, European Union, and national regulations,” it said.""]",5,"– Facebook's latest trouble is only getting worse. The company's stock slid nearly 7% on Monday, the biggest decline in four years, as it deals with allegations that it allowed people's personal data to be manipulated during the 2016 campaign, reports the Wall Street Journal. The new scandal specifically involves the data-mining company Cambridge Analytica, which worked for the Trump campaign and is accused of improperly obtaining the data of 50 million Facebook users without much trouble. The story continues to widen: Different: The details of this mess are complex, ""but the most important thing to understand is that Facebook collects an enormous amount of data about its users, and it lost control of that data,"" writes Rhett Jones at Gizmodo. Yes, Facebook has weathered similar controversies, but this feels different, he adds. For one thing, lawmakers in the US and Europe are demanding accountability, raising the prospect of investigations, hearings, and penalties. Stephen Colbert: The late-night host weighed in on the scandal Monday, declaring that ""free will is an illusion."" Cambridge Analytica reportedly created psychological profiles so it could bombard users with targeted ads and stories. Colbert takes Facebook to task for allegedly being informed of these tactics and failing to stop them. See the video. Where's Zuckerberg? Silent so far amid the scandal is Mark Zuckerberg, notes Julie Carrie Wong at the Guardian. He might not want to wait too much longer: The hashtag #WheresZuck was trending, as was #DeleteFacebook. Similar theme: The editorial page of the New York Times also takes Facebook to task for its response and thinks lawmakers should look into whether the company violated its own 2011 consent decree with the FTC about protecting users' data.

To back up anti-abortion omnibus bill HB 1411, which passed the state legislature earlier this month, conservative legislators have offered a list of places women can go for birth control, pap smears, and other reproductive services once Planned Parenthood is barred from taking Medicaid. That list includes dozens of elementary and middle schools, several dental practices, and at least one optometry center. \n \n Christina Cauterucci Christina Cauterucci is a Slate staff writer. \n \n \n \n If Gov. Rick Scott signs HB 1411, the bill will, for all practical purposes, defund Planned Parenthood by prohibiting state-funded organizations from working with health centers that provide abortions in any cases other than rape, incest, or conditions that threaten the pregnant woman’s life. Women on Medicaid, for instance, will not be able to obtain contraception or any other medical services, abortion-related or not, from Planned Parenthood or any other abortion provider. \n \n Advertisement \n \n \n \n The Supreme Court has placed an ambiguous limit on states’ ability to restrict abortion. In order to maintain that the law does not impose an “undue burden” on women—a threshold established by 1992’s Planned Parenthood v. Casey—lawmakers must prove that women are still able to obtain an abortion in the state. Though that threshold doesn’t apply to publicly funded reproductive health care, Florida Democratic Rep. Lori Berman demanded that the bill’s co-sponsor, Colleen Burton, prove her claim that there will still be plenty of places for people, especially women in poverty, to get breast exams, contraception, and the like. \n \n The list of federally qualified health centers that Burton claims provide “family planning services” is laughable, mainly because it’s half-populated by K-12 schools. Nevertheless, proponents of HB 1411 have used this list to pooh-pooh concerns for women’s health, claiming that there are 29 public health clinics for every Planned Parenthood in the state; therefore, the argument goes, no poor women will miss Planned Parenthood when it’s gone. The Guardian reports that in 2010, according to Guttmacher Institute data, there were just five public health clinics that offered family planning services for every Florida Planned Parenthood. \n \n Anti-choice legislators in Ohio and Louisiana have pulled similar tricks, shrugging off warnings of a reproductive health care shortage by recommending that their states’ women get UTI treatment and STI screenings from food banks and ophthalmologists.']",2,"– eHarmony is pretty serious about about pairing ""deeply compatible singles,"" but if its 29 Dimensions® of Compatibility can't find you your perfect mate, the dating site will soon offer a Plan B: Pay $5,000 for eH+, which lands you your very own personal counselor for a year who will essentially be your human matchmaker.

Fishermen hunt dolphins in the shallows of a cove in Taiji, western Japan, January 21, 2014. \n \n TAIJI, Japan (Reuters) - Japanese fishermen drove a large group of dolphins into the shallows on Tuesday and, hiding from reporters and TV cameras behind a tarpaulin, killed at least 30 as the annual dolphin hunt that sparked protest in the West entered its final stages. \n \n Both the U.S. and British ambassadors to Japan have strongly criticized the ""drive killings"" of dolphins citing the ""terrible suffering"" inflicted on the marine mammals. \n \n Every year the fishermen of Taiji, in western Wakayama prefecture, drive hundreds of dolphins into a cove, select some for sale to marine parks, release some and kill the rest for meat. \n \n On Tuesday, at least 30 dolphins out of the group of more than 200 held in the cove since Friday were herded by boat engines and nets into a killing area of the Taiji cove. \n \n Fishermen waiting in the shallow waters by the shore, some in wet suits with snorkeling masks on their faces, wrestled the dolphins into submission and tied their tails with ropes to stop them from escaping. \n \n Before the killing began, fishermen pulled a tarpaulin in front of the cove to prevent activists and reporters from seeing the killing. A large pool of blood seeped under the tarpaulin and spread across the cove. \n \n ""A metal rod was stabbed into their spinal cord, where they were left to bleed out, suffocate and die. After a traumatic four days held captive in the killing cove, they experienced violent captive selection, being separated from their family, and then eventually were killed today,"" Sea Shepherd Conservation Society activist Melissa Sehgal told Reuters. \n \n The annual hunt has long been a source of controversy and was the topic of ""The Cove"", an Oscar-winning documentary that brought Taiji into the international spotlight. \n \n Activists say that out of this year\'s group more than 50 dolphins were driven away to be sold to aquariums. Those not killed on Tuesday were released, they said. \n \n ""UK opposes all forms of dolphin and porpoise drives; they cause terrible suffering. We regularly raise (the issue) with Japan,"" said the British Ambassador to Japan, Timothy Hitchens, in a tweet on Monday. Caroline Kennedy, the U.S. envoy to Tokyo, has also said she was ""deeply concerned"" about the hunt. \n \n Japan maintains that killing dolphins is not banned under any international treaty and that the animals are not endangered. \n \n Yoshinobu Nisaka, the governor of Wakayama prefecture where Taiji is located, rejected Kennedy\'s concerns. \n \n ""Dietary culture varies and it is the wisdom of civilization to mutually respect other standpoints unless the world faces a lack of resources,"" Nisaka was quoted by Kyodo news agency as telling reporters. \n \n The Taiji fishing union rejected Reuters requests for comment. \n \n The dolphin hunting season runs yearly from September to March. Sea Shepherd said around 600 marine mammals had been killed this season before Tuesday\'s slaughter. \n \n Monitoring is difficult, with fishermen erecting tarpaulins over their killing area and blocking access to the cove. \n \n (Writing and additional reporting by Antoni Slodkowski; Editing by Nick Macfie)', '""I don\'t know what guys go through. I think being in this locker room and hearing stories from these guys, it\'s a tough time in this world. America is not perfect and we all know that,"" he added.

All I know is guys have the right to say what they want to say and that\'s what makes America great. I\'m going to stand there for my guys in the locker room and be there for them as teammates.""']",3,"– Japanese fishermen have wrapped up their annual dolphin hunt and slaughter in Taiji cove amid international protests. CNN reports that some 500 bottlenose dolphins were driven into the cove—a larger number than usual, though Sea Shepherd Conservation Society is sticking with its original claim that 250 or so dolphins were involved. As always, some were captured to be sold to aquariums, others slaughtered for their meat, and the rest released; a member of the local fishermen's union says fewer than 100 fell into those first two categories. But Sea Shepherd, which has tweeted and streamed video through the whole hunt, claims that ""many will die at sea from the last 4 days."" It claims that 52 were sold into captivity, 41 were killed, and the remaining 130 to 140 were released. Sea Shepherd has described horrific scenes as dozens of dolphins were dragged into a tent to be slaughtered, reports the Sydney Morning Herald. That tent was apparently an attempt on the fishermen's part to keep prying eyes away. Reuters reports that in advance of the killing they put a tarpaulin in place; blood streamed out from under it. The Japanese government has shrugged off criticism of the hunt from diplomats including US Ambassador to Japan Caroline Kennedy. ""Dolphin fishing is a form of traditional fishing in our country,"" a government spokesman says. ""We will explain Japan's position to the American side.""

310,"['While Donald Trump was running for president in late 2015 and early 2016, his company was pursuing a plan to develop a massive Trump Tower in Moscow, according to several people familiar with the proposal and new records reviewed by Trump Organization lawyers. \n \n As part of the discussions, a Russian-born real estate developer urged Trump to come to Moscow to tout the proposal and suggested that he could get President Vladimir Putin to say “great things” about Trump, according to several people who have been briefed on his correspondence. \n \n The developer, Felix Sater, predicted in a November 2015 email that he and Trump Organization leaders would soon be celebrating — both one of the biggest residential projects in real estate history and Donald Trump’s election as president, according to two of the people with knowledge of the exchange. \n \n Sater wrote to Trump Organization Executive Vice President Michael Cohen “something to the effect of, ‘Can you believe two guys from Brooklyn are going to elect a president?’ ” said one person briefed on the email exchange. Sater emigrated from what was then the Soviet Union when he was 6 and grew up in Brooklyn. \n \n Trump never went to Moscow as Sater proposed. And although investors and Trump’s company signed a letter of intent, they lacked the land and permits to proceed and the project was abandoned at the end of January 2016, just before the presidential primaries began, several people familiar with the proposal said. \n \n Nevertheless, the details of the deal, which have not previously been disclosed, provide evidence that Trump’s business was actively pursuing significant commercial interests in Russia at the same time he was campaigning to be president — and in a position to determine U.S.-Russia relations. The new details from the emails, which are scheduled to be turned over to congressional investigators soon, also point to the likelihood of additional contacts between Russia-connected individuals and Trump associates during his presidential bid. \n \n White House officials declined to comment for this report. Cohen, a longtime Trump legal adviser, declined to comment, but his attorney, Stephen Ryan, said his client “has been cooperating and will continue to cooperate with both the House and Senate intelligence committees, including providing them with documents and information and answering any questions they may have about the Moscow building proposal.” \n \n In recent months, contacts between high-ranking and lower- level Trump aides and Russians have emerged. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, then a U.S. senator and campaign adviser, twice met Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. \n \n Donald Trump Jr. organized a June 2016 meeting with campaign aide Jared Kushner, campaign manager Paul Manafort and a Russian lawyer after the president’s eldest son was promised that the lawyer would bring damaging information about Hillary Clinton as part of a Russian government effort to help the campaign. \n \n Internal emails also show campaign adviser George Papadopoulos repeatedly sought to organize meetings with campaign officials, including Trump, and Putin or other Russians. His efforts were rebuffed. \n \n The negotiations for the Moscow project ended before Trump’s business ties to Russia had become a major issue in the campaign. Trump denied having any business connections to Russia in July 2016, tweeting, “for the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia” and then insisting at a news conference the following day, “I have nothing to do with Russia.” \n \n While campaigning during the 2016 election, President Trump’s company was pursuing a plan to develop a massive Trump Tower in Moscow, according to several people familiar with the proposal. (Amber Ferguson/The Washington Post) \n \n Discussions about the Moscow project began in earnest in September 2015, according to people briefed on the deal. An unidentified investor planned to build the project and, under a licensing agreement, put Trump’s name on it. Cohen acted as a lead negotiator for the Trump Organization. It is unclear how involved or aware Trump was of the negotiations. \n \n As the talks progressed, Trump voiced numerous supportive comments about Putin, setting himself apart from his Republican rivals for the nomination. \n \n By the end of 2015, Putin began offering praise in return. \n \n “He says that he wants to move to another, closer level of relations. Can we really not welcome that? Of course, we welcome that,” Putin told reporters during his annual end-of-the year news conference. He called Trump a “colorful and talented” person. Trump said afterward that the compliment was an “honor.” \n \n Though Putin’s comments came shortly after Sater suggested that the Russian president would speak favorably about Trump, there is no indication that the two are connected. \n \n There is no public record that Trump has ever spoken about the effort to build a Trump Tower in 2015 and 2016. \n \n Trump’s interests in building in Moscow, however, are long-standing. He had attempted to build a Trump property for three decades, starting with a failed effort in 1987 to partner with the Soviet government on a hotel project. \n \n “Russia is one of the hottest places in the world for investment,” he said in a 2007 court deposition. \n \n “We will be in Moscow at some point,” he promised in the deposition. \n \n Sater was involved in at least one of those previous efforts. In 2005, the Trump Organization gave his development company, the Bayrock Group, an exclusive one-year deal to attempt to build a Moscow Trump Tower. Sater located a site for the project — an abandoned pencil factory — and worked closely with Trump on the deal, which did not come to fruition. \n \n In an unrelated court case in 2008, Sater said in a deposition that he would personally provide Trump “verbal updates” on the deal. \n \n “When I’d come back, pop my head into Mr. Trump’s office and tell him, you know, ‘Moving forward on the Moscow deal.’ And he would say, ‘All right,’ ” Sater said. \n \n In the same testimony, Sater described traveling with Trump’s children, including joining Ivanka and Donald Trump Jr. on a trip to Moscow at their father’s request. \n \n “They were on their way by themselves, and he was all concerned,” Sater said. “He asked if I wouldn’t mind joining them and looking after them while they were in Moscow.” \n \n Alan Garten, a lawyer for the Trump Organization, told The Washington Post last year that Sater happened to be in Moscow at the same time as Trump’s two adult children. “There was no accompanying them to Moscow,” he said. \n \n Neither Sater nor his attorney responded to requests for comment. \n \n Trump has repeatedly tried to distance himself from Sater, who served time in jail after assaulting a man with the stem of a broken margarita glass during a 1991 bar fight and then pleaded guilty in 1998 to his role in an organized- crime-linked stock fraud. Sater’s sentencing was delayed for years while he cooperated with the federal government on a series of criminal and national security-related investigations, federal officials have said. \n \n During that time, Sater worked as an executive with Bayrock, whose offices were in Trump Tower, and brokered deals to license Trump’s name for developments in multiple U.S. and foreign cities. In 2010, Trump allowed Sater to briefly work out of Trump Organization office space and use a business card that identified him as a “senior adviser to Donald Trump.” \n \n Still, when asked about Sater in 2013 court deposition, Trump said: “If he were sitting in the room right now, I really wouldn’t know what he looked like.” He added that he had spoken with Sater “not many” times.', 'WSJ\'s Farnaz Fassihi has details of crackdowns imposed by the Iranian government on Internet users and Internet cafe owners. AP Photo. \n \n Iran is mounting new clampdowns on Internet expression, including rules that will impose layers of surveillance in the country\'s popular Internet cafes, as Tehran\'s political establishment comes under increasing strains from economic turmoil and threats of more international sanctions. \n \n In the most sweeping move, Iran issued regulations giving Internet cafes 15 days to install security cameras, start collecting detailed personal information on customers and document users\' online footprints. \n \n Until now, Iran\'s cybercafes have been a youth-culture mainstay of most towns and neighborhoods, used not only by activists but also by other Iranians who believe the security of their home computers is already compromised. \n \n Iranian users also have reported more blocked sites this week, as well as new barriers to accessing social-networking services. Internet connections, too, have bogged down. \n \n Enlarge Image Close Agence France-Presse/Getty Images An Iranian woman at a cybercafe in Tehran last year. \n \n The network slowdown likely heralds the arrival of an initiative Iran has been readying—a ""halal"" domestic intranet that it has said will insulate its citizens from Western ideology and un-Islamic culture, and eventually replace the Internet. This week\'s slowdown came amid tests of the Iranian intranet, according to domestic media reports that cited a spokesman for a union of computer-systems firms. He said the intranet is set to go live within a few weeks. \n \n Taken together, the moves represent Iran\'s boldest attempts to control flows of online information—a persistent thorn in the side of Tehran\'s political establishment since activists used the Internet to plan and document mass protests against what they said was a rigged election that returned President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to office in 2009. \n \n The video surveillance brings Iran further into the vanguard of nations that have sought to keep tabs on Internet use. Libya under Moammar Gadhafi ran extensive web-monitoring operations. China has sophisticated website filtering and an army of censors patrolling chat rooms. China and Cuba require Internet-cafe users to present identification. \n \n Enlarge Image Close Reuters New laws on these cafes are seen as a bid to head off protests like those in 2009. \n \n Tehran is imposing the crackdown amid a politically fraught run-up to Iran\'s March 2 parliamentary elections. Reformist political parties have already boycotted the vote. Meanwhile, Iran faces deepening economic pressures. International sanctions have crimped foreign sales and investments, inflation has been steep and the currency has dropped 40% against the U.S. dollar since late December. \n \n The rial\'s record lows have come in part as the European Union and U.S. have threatened to place sanctions on Iran\'s central bank and impose an embargo on Iranian crude for what they allege is Iran\'s pursuit of nuclear weapons, a charge Tehran denies. A recent rhetorical battle between Iranian and U.S. military officials about access to waters of the Persian Gulf—through which one-fifth of the world\'s oil passes daily—raised fears of a possible military confrontation. \n \n The BBC Persian documentary ""The Ayatollah\'s Seal"" was jammed by Iran on Eutelsat\'s W3A satellite in September, leaving images scrambled and incomprehensible. Video courtesy Lenziran.com, an Iranian affairs website. \n \n With the latest moves, the government is aiming to sow fear ahead of elections and curtail planned protests, say activists and observers in Iran and abroad. The Iranian judiciary announced last week that any calls to boycott elections, delivered on social-networking sites or by email, would be considered crimes against national security. \n \n ""They want to execute a plan where no one has protection, so they can trace whoever is involved in what they perceive as antigovernment activity at any given moment and at any location,"" said Ehsan Norouzi, an Iranian cybersecurity expert who left Iran after 2009 and now lives in Germany. \n \n Tehran hasn\'t directly commented on the measures. The Islamic Republic, however, has long battled the Internet\'s influence and tried to filter access to sites, such as pornography or even fashion, that didn\'t fit within the norms of a conservative Islamic society. Since 2009, Iranian officials have widened their Internet monitoring to fight what they say is a ""soft war"" of culture and ideology against it, That year they formed the Cyber Police, a task force drawn from various security arms, which the government says has trained some 250,000 members. \n \n In the past week, Iranian Internet users say the government has blocked access to VPNs—secure Internet networks that are located abroad—and foiled one of the ways users have attempted to gain entry to closed websites such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. In recent weeks the government also has targeted a popular currency-tracking site and pages belonging to prominent politicians, among others. \n \n ""They are closing in on us, and we are already feeling the dire impact of these announcements. Everyone is afraid,"" a prominent student activist said in an email exchange from Iran. ""It will make it very difficult for us to tell the world what\'s happening here."" \n \n The new rules on cybercafes, issued by the Cyber Police and published Wednesday in several Iranian newspapers, require customers at the cafes to provide their name, father\'s name, address, telephone and national identification numbers before logging on. \n \n The venues must install security cameras that will let the government match users to the computer they used. They also must log each user\'s browsing history, including the IP addresses of every Internet page visited. This data, along with the video images, must be saved for six months and provided to the Cyber Police on demand, according to the regulation. \n \n ""These rules are aimed at promoting transparency and organization for Internet businesses and offer more protection against online abuse,"" according to the text of the regulation. \n \n Internet cafe owners in Tehran expressed anger at the rules, saying they would cause customers to shun their establishments, forcing them to close. ""Do they think I\'m running a security shop, to ask people for their ID number and put a guard above their head to monitor their Web activity? Are they insane?"" the owner of a well-known Tehran Internet cafe said by telephone. \n \n Separately, Iran\'s government appears to have enlisted an army of users to promote it on the Internet. \n \n A conservative cleric blogger based in the holy Shiite city of Qum, Ahmad Najimi, said in his blog last week that the government was paying hackers hired in the network known as the ""Cyber Army"" the equivalent of $7 per hour to swarm the Web with positive comments about the Islamic Republic and post negative comments against dissidents. \n \n That is consistent with comments from the Revolutionary Guards Corps\' commander in Tehran, General Hossein Hamedani, who in October announced the creation of two Cyber War centers in the capital. Gen.

Though Stephen Rankin was charged with first-degree murder, a jury convicted him of the lesser charge and recommended he spend two and a half years in prison, reports the Guardian. He faced up to 10. Prosecutors said Rankin, 36, intentionally killed 18-year-old shoplifting suspect William Chapman in a Walmart parking lot on April 22, 2015, after Chapman resisted arrest. However, Rankin—a US Navy veteran with training in mixed martial arts—said he shot Chapman twice in self-defense as Chapman ""came towards me aggressively"" after a Taser was knocked from Rankin's hand as the two scuffled. ""I felt I needed to save my life,"" he said, adding he immediately gave Chapman CPR. The Guardian reports Rankin also shot and killed an unarmed man from Kazakhstan in 2011, though Judge Johnny Morrison ruled jurors couldn't hear about that since a grand jury declined to indict Rankin. In that case, Rankin said 26-year-old Kirill Denyakin, shot 11 times, reached into his waistband and charged at him. Prosecutors also couldn't share with the jury text messages Rankin sent before Chapman's death; one read ""people are just bad,"" another referenced Sodom and Gomorrah. It's not clear whether Chapman actually stole something from Walmart. Rankin is due to be sentenced Oct. 12, though his lawyers plan to appeal. The Virginian-Pilot reports he's the 13th US officer to have a jury convict him of murder or manslaughter since 2005."

The last exposure to others was likely on June 14. \n \n Additional Information from the Larimer County Health Department: \n \n Plague can spread through rodent populations in a localized area often resulting in mass animal “die-offs.” The only animals with confirmed plague so far this year in Larimer County were in an area of Soapstone Natural area this is not open to the public. \n \n In recent decades, an average of seven human plague cases are reported each year nationwide according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Most human cases in the United States are scattered in rural areas and occur predominantly in two regions: \n \n Northern New Mexico, northern Arizona, and southern Colorado \n \n California, southern Oregon, and far western Nevada \n \n Bubonic plague is the most common form of the disease in humans (about 80% of cases) Symptoms begin two to six days after the bite of an infected flea, or contact with an infected rodent or cat. Typical symptoms include swollen lymph nodes, sudden onset of fever or chills, severe headache, extreme exhaustion, and a general feeling of illness. Bubonic plague can be successfully treated when diagnosed promptly. If you have had a possible exposure to infected rodents or fleas and are experiencing these symptoms, consult a physician as soon as possible. \n \n Septicemic plague occurs when the bacteria enter the bloodstream directly and spread throughout the body. Pneumonic plague can occur when bacteria a directly inhaled, or can be from secondary spread of bubonic or septicemic plague. The recent fatal case appears to have had a septicemic plague infection. These forms are highly fatal unless treated promptly; unfortunately there are often no localizing signs to suggest plague. \n \n Cats are infected from flea bites or by direct contact with infected rodents. Plague infected cats will generally have a history of roaming freely in rural or semi-rural areas and their owners often report that they are known predators. \n \n Infected cats frequently exhibit swelling and sores around the mouth, head, and neck, and appear to be ill. Seek veterinary care for such animals. Since domestic cats and dogs can carry infected fleas into the home environment, it is also important to consult your veterinarian for information about flea control for your pets. While dogs rarely appear sick from plague, it is still important that they are treated for fleas as they can still carry them into the home. \n \n TIPS TO PREVENT PLAGUE \n \n Avoid contact with all sick and dead rodents and rabbits.

She and her partner, Gjermund Roesholt, and their daughter had been trapping at Einarson Lake for the last three months, the coroner said. \n \n Thé\u200borêt with 10-month-old daughter Adele Roesholt. (Submitted by Josianne Gauthier) \n \n Einarson Lake is located more than 400 km northeast of Whitehorse, near the border between Yukon and the Northwest Territories. \n \n Roesholt was away from the cabin on the family\'s trapline when the attack occurred, Jones said. He came back just before 3 p.m. and was immediately charged by a grizzly bear, about 100 metres from the cabin. \n \n Roesholt managed to shoot the bear, killing it. He then went to the cabin, where he found the bodies of his partner and child outside. \n \n He used an emergency beacon device to call for help. \n \n That call went to RCMP in Mayo, a village of 200 people and the closest settlement to the cabin.

But, you never know."" \n \n Brian Melanson is a fellow trapper in the area. He said his trapline is near the one owned by the couple.

(Facebook) \n \n A Whitehorse French immersion teacher and her infant are dead after a grizzly bear attack at their trapper’s cabin in a remote area of central Yukon, their bodies discovered by her partner as he returned home from a trapline. \n \n Valérie Théorêt, 37, and her daughter, 10-month-old Adele Roesholt, were killed by a grizzly bear on Nov. 26 at their cabin in the Einarson Lake area, according to a press release by the Yukon Coroner’s Service. \n \n The lake is about 200 kilometres northeast of Mayo, near the Yukon-Northwest Territories border. \n \n Authorities were notified about the deaths after Théorêt’s partner, Gjermund Røsholt, activated an emergency alarm at 3:45 p.m. Monday, the press release says. \n \n Gjermund was returning from a trapline around 3 p.m. when, about 100 metres away from the cabin he shared with Théorêt and Adele, a grizzly bear charged him and he was “forced to shoot the bear dead.” \n \n Gjermund continued his approach to the cabin, where, just outside, he discovered Théorêt and Adele’s bodies. \n \n The two appear to have gone outside for a walk sometime between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. when they were fatally attacked by the grizzly, the release says, adding that the family had been trapping in the area for the past three months. \n \n The Yukon Coroner’s Service is continuing its investigation with the assistance of Mayo RCMP, the RCMP’s forensic identification section and Environment Yukon. \n \n Environment Yukon will also be performing a necropsy on the bear. \n \n Théorêt was a Grade 6 late French-immersion teacher at Whitehorse Elementary School, department of education spokesperson Michele Royle confirmed Nov. 27, adding that counsellors will be present at the school over the coming days to support students and staff. \n \n L’association franco-yukonnaise (AFY) will also be hosting a support and sharing event for community members at the Centre de la francophonie in downtown Whitehorse Nov. 29, according to a post on AFY’s Facebook page. A psychotherapist will be available on-site. \n \n In an “about your teacher” section on a student website created for the 2017-18 school year, Théorêt, who, at that point had taught at Whitehorse Elementary for six years, wrote that she was born and raised in Quebec before moving to the Yukon in 2005. \n \n “My mother tongue is French and I am very grateful to be bilingual now,” Théorêt wrote, adding that she also spoke basic Spanish and was learning Norwegian because her partner was from Norway. \n \n “I am also passionate about outdoors, sports, nature, arts and music,” she wrote, adding that she coached Grade 7 basketball. “This is what my summer revolved around so I am starting the year rested and full of energy.” \n \n Old news articles and blog posts show that Théorêt participated in orienteering events, and, in 2007, was a handler for the Yukon Quest 300. \n \n Prior to teaching, Théorêt wrote, she had studied and worked in graphic design for 12 years. She was the art director for Whitehorse’s Aasman Brand Communications for close to five years, leaving the company in 2010 to pursue teaching, according to a blog post on Aasman’s website. \n \n Théorêt appears to have continued pursuing her passion for design on the side, setting up an online store where she sold fabrics, wallpapers and gift wraps featuring custom designs. \n \n She also appears to have been an active in her partner’s company, Wildtracks Adventure Services. The company’s website advertises guiding services for trapping, hunting and fishing in the Yukon, and also sells custom fur and animal products. Gjermund is listed as a wild guide and consultant; Théorêt, a designer and artisan of fur products; and Adele, a fur lover. \n \n Fatal bear attacks are rare in the Yukon. One of the last documented human deaths involving a bear encounter took place in October 2014, when 42-year-old Claudia Huber was mauled by a grizzly bear outside her home near Johnson’s Crossing. However, a coroner’s investigation later determined that Huber had, in fact, been killed by a stray bullet that her husband had fired at the bear during the attack. \n \n There have only been two other bear attacks in the Yukon over the 22 years, Environment Yukon spokesperson Roxanne Stasyszyn said in an email Nov. 28 — one in Ross River in 2006, and in Kluane National Park in 1996. \n \n Stasyszyn also wrote that it’s not unusual to see bear activity in the Yukon “well into November and even January,” explaining that bears that aren’t hibernating by this time are either still foraging because they’re finding food sources that make it worthwhile, are lacking fat stores to successfully hibernate, or have lost or had their dens disturbed. \n \n Contact Jackie Hong at jackie.hong@yukon-news.com']",2,"– Tragedy in the Yukon: A woman and her 10-month-old daughter were killed by a grizzly bear at a cabin in a remote part of the Canadian territory, authorities say.

Just ask, apparently. A fraudster emailed MacEwan University in 2017 seeking roughly $9 million (USD) and the school sent it right off, the Toronto Star reports. To be fair, the Edmonton school was busy constructing a $137 million building featuring dance halls and music studios, so the request from Clark Builders, a company on the project, made sense. Only after sending the money did MacEwan learn that Clark Builders never received it and the email's purported author hadn't worked there in years. The funds really went to a Montreal bank account that previously held under $60. From there, over $1 million of it went to East Asia and back to appear legitimate—an international route that made it harder for the RCMP to trace. But trace it they did. According to court documents, most of the money returned to Canada as a loan to Vancouver-based Hoi Fu Enterprises Ltd. The loan came from a Chinese company that, via intermediaries, bought Canadian dollars from a supposed Hong Kong company that had received the Montreal money. And presto, Hoi Fu received about $764,000 in loans to help pay a big new mortgage. Luckily, MacEwan recovered over 92% of lost funds, in part by suing Hoi Fu and seizing money from the bank. The school also set up anti-phishing measures to avoid getting fooled again. ""We knew we were at fault ... and we accept that,"" a school rep tells the CBC.

We also examined whether continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) use is associated with delayed onset of cognitive decline. \n \n Methods: From the ADNI cohort, 3 subsets with progressively stringent criteria were created in a step-wise manner. Age at MCI or AD-dementia onset was the main outcome variable. Analyses were performed separately for each subset in untreated SDB+ vs SDB− and untreated SDB+ vs CPAP+ groups. Chi-square and t tests were performed to examine between-group differences. Survival analyses were performed using the Kaplan–Meier method, compared by the log-rank test, and assessed by multivariate Cox regression adjusting for potential confounders. \n \n Results: SDB+ patients had a younger age at MCI onset in all subsets (MC1: 72.63 vs 83.67; MC2: 72.15 vs 83.45; MC3: 77.40 vs 89.89; p < 0.01).

She has a heart problem,"" but he doesn't mention that she had been shot, the Orlando Sentinel reports. Police say that was because he was asleep at the time of the shooting and didn't realize what had happened until his wife explained.

Chris Pine is Will, the arrogant young conductor who\'s got something to prove. He gets his chance one cold Pennsylvania morning, when a slacker colleague (Ethan Suplee) neglects to secure the brakes on a freight train carrying toxic materials.

While company honchos (Rosario Dawson, Kevin Dunn) debate increasingly far-fetched strategies, Frank thinks he and Will can stop the racing locomotive. Granted, his plan could kill them both. But no one\'s got a better idea. \n \n Though the movie is loosely based in truth, there\'s not much plot to work with. So writer Mark Bomback makes a half-hearted attempt at a back-story: Frank has two teenage daughters, Will is fighting a restraining order that keeps him from his family. But Scott has made enough action movies to know where to focus. (His collaborations with Washington include ""The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3,"" ""Man on Fire"" and ""Crimson Tide."") \n \n Soon enough, his camera is locked on, above, and beneath the trains, capturing the screeches and roars, the sparking brakes, the just-hugged track curves. Even the leads defer to their mechanical co-stars, though all do excellent work fleshing out barely sketched characters. \n \n With its limited scope and minimal distractions, this probably isn\'t a trip you\'ll remember in the long run. \n \n But if you\'re looking for some popcorn thrills on an otherwise dull Friday night, it\'ll definitely get you where you need to go. \n \n eweitzman@nydailynews.com']",2,"– The iPhone 4S looks exactly like its best-selling predecessor, but it has had a major internal revamp.

Real archaeologists have been a bit more skeptical. But Angela Micol says new discoveries help prove her findings, reports Discovery News. Another amateur archaeologist recently did a ground study at one of the two sites she spotted, and claims what he saw there—pottery, shells, and signs of cavities and tunnels below the the surface—support Micol's claims. ""Those mounds are definitely hiding an ancient site below them,"" he says. Additionally, an Egyptian couple who are leading collectors of old maps and rare documents say they have 34 maps and 12 documents in their collection that indicate the areas of Micol's findings are pyramid sites. The couple says their documents suggest two unknown pyramids at one of the sites, Fayum, were intentionally buried. ""They would be the greatest pyramids known to mankind,"" says the couple. ""We would not exaggerate if we said the finding can overshadow the Pyramids of Giza."" But real archaeologists remain uninterested in Micol's research, so she has set up a crowd-funding campaign to raise $50,000 to explore the site further with a ground penetrating radar and infrared satellite imagery. ""It's very obvious what the sites may contain,"" says Micol, ""but field research is needed to verify they are, in fact, pyramids.""

329,"[""Dartmoor ponies culled and their hides made into drums used in Druid style retreats \n \n Hides of culled ponies being crafted into 'wild pony' drums used in retreats that 'capture the rhythm of life' \n \n Artisan drum-maker sees scheme as 'regeneration project' \n \n However PETA describes process as 'the final indignity' for the unwanted animals \n \n F irst there was uproar over news that unwanted Dartmoor ponies were being slaughtered and fed to lions and tigers in zoos. \n \n Now, The Mail on Sunday can reveal the hides of culled ponies are being crafted into ‘wild pony’ pagan drums – used in Druid-style retreats and musical performances to capture the rhythms of ‘life and the moon’. \n \n Dartmoor ponies are a distinctive, hardy breed, essential to the maintenance of unique moorland landscapes and the rare insects they support. \n \n Charlotte Faulkner, founder of Friends of the Dartmoor Hill Ponies, said the culling scheme was 'a bitter pill to swallow' \n \n But they have been in trouble for years. While they continue to reproduce, the prices they fetch at market have slumped – four ponies recently sold for £1 – and farmers can no longer afford to keep them. \n \n Now, the autumn ‘drifts’ where the ponies are herded down from the hills to market have resulted in culls, with hundreds of unwanted animals – mainly the very young and the old – being slaughtered. Where once 30,000 ponies roamed the moors, there are now believed to be fewer than 1,000 breeding mares. \n \n Conservationists argue it would be more effective to reduce the number of stallions to stifle reproduction, rather than to slaughter so many animals. \n \n But the controversial zoo programme, set up by Friends of the Dartmoor Hill Ponies, claims that selling the meat is a way to raise funds to conserve future herds. \n \n Now, in addition to the zoo programme, the hides of culled ponies are being used to create hand-crafted drums. \n \n The drums are made by Carolyn Hillyer, a musician and Dartmoor resident, who runs alternative workshops and has been making traditional artisan hand-drums for 15 years, using locally sourced deer skin, and horse hides from America. One of her CDs is titled: ‘Drum Songs From The Heathen Hills’. \n \n \n \n Last year, after speaking with Charlotte Faulkner, founder of Friends of the Dartmoor Hill Ponies, who has been battling to save the ponies for more than 16 years, she suggested she could use the hides of the culled ponies to make drums. \n \n ‘They are the first wild pony drums to be made in this country for a very long time,’ Ms Hillyer said. ‘And we see it as part of a wider regeneration project for the whole region. \n \n ‘It’s a sensitive project and it’s taken a year to get to this stage, as I have been working with other people in the community. But the ethos behind it is that nothing is wasted. \n \n \n \n As far as we know, this is the first time this has been done in this country.’ \n \n Controversial drum-maker Carolyn Hillyer runs alternative workshops and has been making artisan hand- drums for 15 years \n \n Charlotte Faulkner said the culling scheme at first ‘seemed like swallowing a bitter pill’. \n \n ‘We had reached the desperate situation where there was nowhere for these unwanted ponies to go. It was breaking my heart,’ she said. ‘It was difficult. \n \n \n \n First using the ponies for zoo meat, then using their hides. We don’t want to be shooting ponies and feeding them to lions. But the ponies face such a dire situation. \n \n \n \n And with this, we are protecting the herds, and the moors. And nothing is being wasted. Carolyn has made three of the pony drums so far and has given me one. \n \n \n \n It has the most amazing deep fur hide, is a sort of a stone colour, and has a very resonant sound. \n \n \n \n ‘I see the drums as a symbol of the ponies’ voices … calling you to listen to their cry for support to help them continue looking after Dartmoor.’ \n \n Journalist Sybil Ruscoe visited Dartmoor and followed the journey of the ponies from their slaughter, with bolt guns, to the zoo feeding, and the drum making process, for BBC Radio 4’s On The Farm. She describes the resulting 25-minute programme as ‘a hard listen’ – a far cry from the 1930s, when there were said to be 30,000 ponies on the moors. \n \n But the demand for the ponies at market has been falling – particularly since the recession. \n \n The animal welfare lobby has argued the problem could be remedied by removing stallions. But local conservationists say stallions are essential for holding a herd together. \n \n ‘What we are doing sits within the conservation of our heritage,’ Ms Hillyer said. ‘We want to encourage people to support the care of these ponies and the drums are a way of doing this.’ \n \n But a spokesman for PETA, People for Ethical Treatment of Animals, said culling was ‘a cruel and ineffective way to manage pony numbers when chemical sterilisers are available’."", 'The French do it, Princess Anne is an advocate and now charities are backing the idea of eating ponies. \n \n It maybe be controversial but an animal group is the latest to endorse the Princess Royal\'s suggestion of eating ponies in a bid to save their species.. \n \n The Dartmoor Hill Pony Association (DHPA) says the best way to save herds on the ancient moorland is by creating a ""market"" for them by eating them. \n \n It follows comments by Princess Anne endorsing eating horses to improve their welfare. \n \n In a speech to the World Horse Welfare charity last year, of which she is president, the Princess Royal claimed owners might take better care of their horses if they believed they could sell them for meat. \n \n Founder of the DHPA, Charlotte Faulkner believes herders will only continue to keep the animals if there is a ""sustainable market"" for them. \n \n In a letter proposing the idea sent to South West Equine Protection (SWEP), she said: ""I am writing to ask whether SWEP would consider giving measured support to this understandably upsetting subject, which as pony lovers we find so hard to accept. \n \n ""It has taken years of considering reports and listening to the outcome of meetings to recognise and reluctantly accept that Dartmoor pony herders will only carry on keeping their herds if they have a sustainable market for them. We are in real danger of ponies disappearing from Dartmoor altogether."" \n \n She added that a meat trade would encourage pony herders to keep the herd\'s young for at least three years - the entry level set for animals going for meat. \n \n It would mean that animals not selected for slaughter could be broken and trained for riding and driving, which she claims is best done from the age of three. \n \n ""Strangely, having a meat trade should improve a pony\'s chances of finding a new home at sales,"" she wrote. \n \n The SWEP reacted with fury at the letter, saying it would never support the breeding of animals for profit. \n \n The charity\'s welfare officer Becky Treeby said: ""It would be very upsetting to look at foals which in six months time could be in someone\'s burger."" \n \n Dartmoor ponies are an essential part of the ecology of the 368 square mile national park in Devon by keeping the gorse on the moorland under control. \n \n Their numbers have declined from over 25,000 in the 1930s to fewer than 800 today. \n \n But with ponies selling for as little as £10 at auction, they have been left to breed unchecked and there are now fears of overpopulation. \n \n SWEP favours birth control methods to keep the number of foals down. \n \n The RSPCA says its primary concern is the animals\' welfare. \n \n A spokesman said: ""The killing of horses for meat is an emotive subject as many see them as companion animals rather than a food source, a sentiment the RSPCA has great sympathy with. \n \n ""However, the Society’s primary concern for all animals killed for meat is that they are cared for, handled, transported and slaughtered in a way which safeguards their welfare at all times. We believe all animals for meat should be slaughtered as near to the place they have lived as possible. \n \n ""Transportation and slaughter of horses for meat are issues of particular concern for the RSPCA. Many horses are transported live to the continent where their ultimate fate is unknown, but many may well be slaughtered. Once there, it’s difficult to monitor whether EU transportation legislation is met and if the animals are slaughtered humanely."" \n \n A report by the Exmoor Pony Society, the Exmoor National Park Authority and other conservation groups has also backed the initiative after seeing a growing number of unwanted ponies being abandoned on the moor endangering the native pure-bred wild ponies. \n \n In the report, expert Peter Green concluded that the unwanted animals should be killed and sold for horsemeat. \n \n “As there is so limited a market for ridden ponies, show ponies and conservation grazers, why not promote the free-living Exmoor ponies as a food animal as much as an amenity or aesthetic resource?,"" he wrote. \n \n Under Mr Green’s plan the ‘excess’ ponies would be slaughtered, processed and inspected at EU-approved abattoirs in line with red meat regulations before entering the food chain. \n \n Last year it was revealed that unwanted Dartmoor ponies were being slaughtered and fed to lions and tigers in zoos and their hides were being crafted into \'wild pony\' drums. \n \n Raw horse meat is known for its purity — horses are fussy eaters of only grass, hay and grain — and it was traditionally fed to invalids. In Liguria, north-western Italy, a raw horse meat sausage is eaten with the local fruity olive oil and pepper. \n \n Serve raw with fine chips and shallots \n \n Horse Steak Tartare.

For example, if you'd like to save the ponies that roam the moors of southwestern England, perhaps you should ... eat one. This is the suggestion being bandied about by the Dartmoor Hill Pony Association to rescue the pony population there: Their numbers have fallen from 25,000 in the 1930s to fewer than 800 currently, the Telegraph reports. The reason some think the scarf-down strategy will work: It would create a ""sustainable market"" for the ponies. Herders would have an incentive to take good care of their animals if they could eventually sell them as meat, and those not sold as food could be trained for riding and driving. ""Strangely, having a meat trade should improve a pony's chances of finding a new home at sales,"" argues Charlotte Faulkner, head of the DHPA. Princess Anne is also an eat-the-pony/save-the-pony advocate for animal-welfare purposes: In a speech to a horse charity last year, she said herd owners would actually treat the animals better if they knew they had to maintain the herds until they were old enough to kill for meat (the ponies have to be at least 3 years old to qualify, notes Faulkner). Other conservation groups are backing the initiative, claiming there are too many abandoned ponies wandering around—unwanted ponies that were being fed to zoo lions and tigers and stripped of their hides to make ""wild pony"" drums, reported the Daily Mail last year. ""Why not promote the free-living Exmoor ponies as a food animal as much as an amenity or aesthetic resource?"" says a horse expert in a report by local advocacy groups, notes the Telegraph. (Horse meat is apparently already in 5% of the beef in Europe.)"
330,"['Jamie Grill/Getty \n \n Pregnant women who eat large amounts of sugar may be more likely to have children with allergies. \n \n A study of 9,000 women found that those who ate high levels of sugar during pregnancy were around twice as likely to have a child that went on to develop allergic asthma than woman who ate relatively little sugar. Allergic asthma is the most common form of asthma, and involves allergens provoking the immune system into causing breathing problems. \n \n “We cannot say on the basis of these observations that high intake of sugar by mothers in pregnancy is definitely causing allergy and allergic asthma in their offspring,” says Seif Shaheen, at Queen Mary, University of London, who led the study. “However, given the extremely high consumption of sugar in the West, we will certainly be investigating this hypothesis further with some urgency.” \n \n Advertisement \n \n One theory for how sugar could cause asthma is that large amounts of fructose might trigger an immune response in the body, leading to inflammation in the lungs. Fructose is a sugar found in fruit and corn syrup, and is used widely in processed food. \n \n Many factors influence a baby’s allergy risk, including exposure to microbes and pollutants, and the type of milk they are fed, says Sheena Cruickshank, at the University of Manchester, UK. “Future studies should take these variables into account so we can understand the full relationship between maternal diet during pregnancy and allergic disease in offspring.” \n \n Journal reference: European Respiratory Journal \n \n Read more: Fat vs carbs: What’s really worse for your health?', 'Justin Bieber impersonator charged with over 900 child sex offences \n \n Updated \n \n A Brisbane law professor posing as pop singer Justin Bieber online to solicit explicit images from young children has been charged with multiple serious offences. \n \n The 42-year-old man, understood to be in prison, was charged in November 2016 with a number of child sex offences including possessing child exploitation material and using a carriage service to groom persons under 16. \n \n After a thorough examination of the man\'s computer, he has this week been further charged with another 931 child sex offences, including, rape, indecent treatment of children, making child exploitation material, using a carriage service to procure person under 16, and using a carriage service for child pornography material. \n \n It will be alleged that the man used multiple online platforms including Facebook and Skype to communicate with his victims. \n \n A large amount of child exploitation material was seized from his computer. \n \n It is alleged his offending dates back to at least 2007. \n \n Detective Inspector Jon Rouse said Task Force Argos, which investigates child sex crimes, would continue to target those using the internet to harm children. \n \n ""This investigation demonstrates both the vulnerability of children that are utilising social media and communication applications and the global reach and skill that child sex offenders have to groom and seduce victims,"" Detective Inspector Rouse said. \n \n ""The fact that so many children could believe that they were communicating with this particular celebrity highlights the need for a serious rethink about the way that we as a society educate our children about online safety. \n \n ""The breadth of offences committed in this instance are frankly horrendous and I want to recognise the efforts and commitment of the investigative team at Taskforce Argos to keeping children safe."" \n \n The man will appear in Brisbane Magistrates Court on April 6. \n \n Topics: crime, law-crime-and-justice, brisbane-4000, qld \n \n First posted']",2,"– Pregnant women already have an exhaustive list of foods they’re told to limit or avoid. But a new longitudinal study might make that list longer. Time reports that research published in the European Respiratory Journal found a link between higher added sugar intake during pregnancy and a child's risk of allergies and allergic asthma. In the study, 9,000 pregnant women completed a food questionnaire that asked about 43 food groups and items. When their children turned seven, the kids were tested for common allergies like cats and grass and the mothers were asked about their kids' history with asthma. The researchers found that moms ranked in the highest 20% of added sugar intake had children twice as likely to have allergic asthma than moms in the bottom 20%. According to New Scientist, allergic asthma is the most common form of the respiratory condition and is caused by allergens that bring on breathing problems. The moms eating the most sugar also had kids 38% more likely to test positive for one allergen and 73% more likely for two or more. While the study didn't prove causation, one theory on how added sugar could up the risk of allergies and asthma is that immune reactions to fructose may bring on inflammation in a developing fetus' lungs. “Given the extremely high consumption of sugar in the West, we will certainly be investigating this hypothesis further with some urgency,” the lead researcher says.

The Miss America Organization is... (Associated Press) \n \n ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) — The other heel has dropped at the Miss America Organization, which had endured a revolt by dozens of states this summer against the national leadership of the pageant headed by former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson. \n \n The crowning of the latest Miss America took place last month with the pageant\'s national leadership largely silent on the calls for their resignation from many states. \n \n But now the national organization is undertaking a purge of rebellious state officials, terminating the licenses of four states, threatening about 15 with probation — and thanking others whose officials stood by the national leadership in the first Miss America pageant without a swimsuit competition. \n \n States whose licenses are terminated must replace current leaders. They can request an appeal hearing from Miss America\'s executive committee. \n \n The Miss America Organization would not say how it decided which states to terminate and which to threaten with probation, issuing a statement to The Associated Press that read, in its entirety, ""The process regarding Miss America state licensees is confidential."" \n \n State officials say their dissatisfaction stemmed not from the elimination of swimsuits, but by the way Carlson and CEO Regina Hopper ran the organization since taking over in January. \n \n Georgia and West Virginia are among states that were notified in recent days that their state licenses are being terminated, Paul Perkins, a lawyer representing both states, told The Associated Press. And a Pennsylvania state pageant official, Chet Welch, confirmed his state has gotten a termination notice as well. \n \n One other state also has been terminated, according to state officials and a former national board member, but its officials did not respond to messages seeking comment Monday. \n \n Other states have been asked to explain — in writing — why they acted as they did in the run-up to the pageant. \n \n ""They are upset, but now they are scared, too,"" said Jennifer Vaden Barth, a former national board member and a former Miss North Carolina. ""This just validates why people are upset and why they felt the need to speak out in the first place."" \n \n A state organization that has its license terminated can no longer claim to be affiliated with the Miss America Organization and must, among other things, turn over bank accounts with scholarship money to the national organization. \n \n Vaden Barth formed a GoFundMe account called the Miss America Organization Leadership Change Fund that has raised over $22,000 to help states defend themselves and advocate for new leadership at the top. \n \n When this year\'s pageant was held last month, 46 of the 51 state pageant organizations (the District of Columbia is included) had called on the two to resign, along with 23 former Miss Americas. \n \n It followed the release of a remarkable letter from the outgoing Miss America, Cara Mund, in which she said she had been marginalized and bullied by top pageant leaders. An investigation commissioned by the Miss America Organization found no evidence to back up that claim, but investigators did not interview Mund for the report, which was issued the day after the most recent pageant was held. \n \n Carlson, who was Miss America 1989, and Hopper depict the opposition as a ""noisy minority"" resistant to change, particularly one as large as the elimination of the pageant\'s swimsuit competition. \n \n But many state officials say their opposition is rooted in a lack of transparency and communication from national leaders, and does not involve the swimsuit decision. \n \n ___ \n \n Follow Wayne Parry at http://twitter.com/WayneParryAC']",2,"– Alex Rodriguez is in a heated battle with the cousin who once allegedly helped him take steroids, and that cousin's wife says A-Rod is an ""evil"" person who peed on a wall of their Miami house to mark his territory.

REUTERS/Bryan Woolston/File Photo \n \n The regulator said it was aware of 36 deaths associated with kratom, which can have similar effects to narcotics like opioids. \n \n Kratom, a natural plant grown in parts of Asia, is available in the United States as a dietary supplement and the FDA has said kratom products have been crossing into the U.S. in increasing amounts. \n \n “At a time when we have hit a critical point in the opioid epidemic, the increasing use of kratom as an alternative or adjunct to opioid use is extremely concerning,” FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said. \n \n In 2012 and 2014 the FDA placed import alerts on kratom, allowing FDA agents to detain the products at the border. U.S. Marshals have since seized thousands of pounds of raw kratom and dietary supplements. \n \n In August 2016, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) announced it would temporarily reclassify kratom as a Schedule 1 drug, a class that includes heroin and marijuana. Schedule 1 drugs are considered to have a high potential for abuse. \n \n However, the DEA’s proposal generated public demonstrations and opposition, prompting the DEA to reverse course. \n \n The FDA declined to say over what period the 36 deaths occurred, directing reporters to file a Freedom of Information Act request to access the data. \n \n However, the DEA said last year that roughly 30 deaths have been reported since 2009, with most occurring since 2014. \n \n Advocates noted that the number of deaths associated with kratom pale when compared to deaths associated with opioids, which in 2015 claimed more than 33,000 lives. President Donald Trump recently declared the opioid epidemic a public health emergency. \n \n Kratom is already a controlled substance in 16 countries, including two of its countries of origin, Thailand and Malaysia, as well as Australia, Sweden and Germany. \n \n It is also banned in a number of U.S. states, including Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Tennessee and Wisconsin.', 'I discovered Roxy swimwear a number of years ago when I was looking for fun, really cute swimsuits that you could actually, you know, swim in. I\'m a real swimmer, and while I had worn those old Speedos for a number of years, but honestly, I found them boring. When I went looking for suits, I found plenty of cute prints and even great, green manufacturing, but few suits stood up to the \'romping in the serious ocean waves without coming off\' test that I hold all my swimwear to. Until Roxy. Seriously, this brand makes some amazingly well-designed bikinis and one-pieces that are great-looking, feel secure and don\'t come off without a fight. \n \n When I was shopping for my new bathing suits, I remember trying them out for the first time, figuring that they probably had to wear well, since the company made gear for women surfers, and I\'m guessing that connection to surfing as a sport has made their swimwear awesome. \n \n Unfortunately, though, some recent advertising by Roxy flies in the face of what I thought they were about. It\'s all about being hot in a bikini and not about what amazing things you get to DO in said bikinis. In a Change.org petition that has already garnered more than 20,000 signatures, pro-surfer Cori Schumacher writes: \n \n Roxy’s recent advertisement for a surf competition features a 5-time World Champion surfer suggestively undressing without showing us her face, and never actually shows her surfing! This tells young girls it’s more important to be sexy than to be strong or a good surfer. \n \n In the past, Roxy has portrayed itself as a fun, youthful brand and are at the core of women’s surfing culture. Roxy should make young girls feel empowered to surf -- not self-conscious about their bodies. \n \n It\'s true. The surfer, Stephanie Gilmore, is a serious champion at one of the world\'s toughest sports, but you wouldn\'t know that from the way the camera lingers on her butt. I get it, the whole point of the vid is to get watchers to guess who the surfer is — so I\'m OK with the fact that they don\'t show her face — but why don\'t we get to see her, you know, surfing? \n \n It\'s a simple test, Roxy. If the same video you made of a woman, would seem really, really weird if you made it with a male surfer (just try that thought experiment) — it\'s probably stupid and sexist. This one is a perfect example of that. \n \n Why does this matter? I think one of the female surfer commenters on the petition page put it best: ""Last week I paddled out into an all male lineup. I was cat called and one guy had the nerve to say. \'You know, I\'d probably yield and give you more waves if you surfed in a bikini.\' Women have to ""fight"" for our fair share of space in the waves, and in the world. Roxy should help empower us, not degrade us. I\'m totally disgusted by this trailer ... and my experience in the line up shows that the guys eat this sh*t up, and feel legitimized when they degrade female surfers."" \n \n At 3 p.m. today, Cori will be delivering the change.org signatures to Roxy\'s offices and having a chat with them.

As the root source of many strong narcotics such as morphine, heroin, codeine and more, it\'s no wonder why the opium poppy is granted a spot in a garden specifically devoted to lethal plants. \n \n Photo: Randi Hausken/Flickr \n \n Pasque Flower (Pulsatilla vulgaris) \n \n These hairy plants can be fatal if eaten in large amount, but it rarely comes to that.

When taken recreationally, they cause intense visual, tactile and auditory hallucinations, as well as a host of uncomfortable side effects including dry mouth, fever, vomiting, dilated pupils, rapid heart rate and delirium. Severe overdoses are characterized by convulsions, hypertension, falling into a coma or even death. \n \n Photo: _seb/Flickr \n \n Dark Columbine (Aquilegia atrata) \n \n There are actually no recorded cases of these drooping purple flowers harming anyone, but folklore suggests the plant was used as an abortifacient for women hoping to produce a miscarriage. \n \n Photo: liz west/Flickr \n \n Common Foxglove (Digitalis purpurea) \n \n These flowers may look lovely and benign, but they can actually cause a major heart attack if eaten in large amounts. Luckily, this is rare because the plant also happens to be an emetic, which is a substance that naturally triggers vomiting.

Almost half of the residents will be evacuated, the largest such operation in the city\'s history. \n \n Unexploded ordnance from World War II frequently turns up in German communities, and sometimes authorities are forced to evacuate small areas to dispose of the dangerous explosives. But a large bomb that recently surfaced in the Rhine River has sparked security measures of historic proportions in the central German city of Koblenz. \n \n Three meters (10 feet) long and weighing 1.8 tons, the aerial bomb was recently spotted after a particularly dry November lowered water levels along the busy river. Now preparations are underway for a massive evacuation set for Sunday. \n \n Some 45,000 residents -- nearly half of the city\'s total population of 106,000 -- will be forced to leave the area. That includes two hospitals, seven retirement homes and the jail. To aid in the operation, the city has organized some 900 people and 350 vehicles to ferry residents to safety. \n \n More Discoveries Expected \n \n Authorities are building a temporary dam of some 350 sandbags around the bomb, currently covered by about 40 centimeters (16 inches) of water. A crane commissioned to build the dam was put in place on Tuesday, fire department spokesman Manfred Morschhäuser told the German news agency DAPD. The area will then be pumped free of water so the bomb can be defused. \n \n In the meantime, the fire department has established a telephone hotline. ""Several hundred callers are getting in touch each day with their questions and problems,"" Morschhäuser said. \n \n Each household included in the evacuation will be notified via flier, he said. ""And on Sunday we\'ll go ringing from house to house,"" he added. Emergency workers need a 1.8-kilometer (1.1-mile) radius buffer zone to ensure safety. \n \n Further bomb discoveries along the riverbed are expected to continue due to the low water levels, authorities said.', 'WIESBADEN, Germany — About 45,000 residents of the German city of Koblenz, nearly half of the city’s population, are under evacuation orders Sunday following the discovery of what local officials said was one of the largest unexploded bombs ever found, believed to have been dropped by the British Royal Air Force during World War II. \n \n The nearly 4,000-pound bomb, packed with more than 3,000 pounds of explosives, as well as other unexploded ordnance, were discovered in the Rhine River, where the water levels have dropped significantly due to a lack of rain over the past few weeks, according to local authorities. \n \n Explosive ordnance disposal troops with the 21st Theater Sustainment Command in Grafenwoehr and Mannheim are ready to provide support if needed, said a 21st TSC spokeswoman. \n \n “Our EOD guys have not been asked to support, but they are tracking it and stand by to assist if asked,” said Lt. Col. Anna Friederich. \n \n The city’s press office said German explosive experts and the German army are expected to take the lead in defusing the bomb, which they are calling an air mine. Officials estimated that a bomb this size could cause a crater more than 20 yards wide and six yards deep with a destruction radius of more than 70 yards if it were detonated. It could blow out windows in a half-mile radius. \n \n From discussions with the British, “it has been known for some time that this type (of bomb) was dropped over Koblenz,” wrote the city’s press office in an email. \n \n Authorities with the city’s fire brigade say plans are under way to evacuate 45,000 city residents in a radius of about a mile, as well as a prison and local hospitals before experts attempt to defuse the bomb on Sunday. Emergency centers are being set up for those who have nowhere else to go. \n \n According to German news outlets, the bomb lies in about 16 inches of water, partly buried in mud, making it difficult to access the detonation fuse. \n \n City officials said Wednesday afternoon that they are still in the planning phases of how to defuse the bomb, which they say is one of the largest found in German history. \n \n A 275-pound American bomb and a German smoke grenade were also found nearby. \n \n Stars and Stripes reporter Marcus Kloeckner contributed to this report \n \n pattonm@estripes.osd.mil']",2,"– Half of the German city of Koblenz is being evacuated so experts can defuse a 1.8 ton World War II bomb. The aerial explosive, believed dropped by the RAF, was spotted in the Rhine River as dry conditions lowered water levels. Some 45,000 residents are leaving the area as experts prepare to defuse and remove the 10-foot bomb on Sunday, reports Der Spiegel. Two hospitals, a jail, and seven retirement homes will have to be emptied. It's believed to be the largest evacuation in Germany since the war ended. Workers are building a temporary dam and the area will be pumped free of water. The bomb, packed with some 3,000 pounds of explosives, is partially buried in mud, making access to the detonation fuse difficult, reports Stars and Stripes. US bomb experts stationed in Germany are standing by to help if necessary."
337,"['Twitter\'s forever tweaking its service with new features and visual touch-ups, and today its revealed a fresh redesign for web profiles that makes imagery ever more prominent. We actually saw much of what\'s new teased on Twitter\'s test channels a couple of months ago, including the larger, G+-like header photo and bigger, Facebook-esque profile pictures. There are several changes to how tweets appear on your user page, too. You can pin a tweet, forum-style, to the top of your ramblings as a sort of extension to your bio, which is less visible under the left-aligned profile pic setup. Furthermore, your ""best tweets,"" defined by how much other users have interacted with it, will be enlarged to draw attention to them. Also, when you\'re scanning the profile pages of others, you can now filter out tweets that don\'t contain any visual media, or those that don\'t have replies. New accounts get the redesign straight away, and all others will see their profile pages change in ""the coming weeks."" There are various celeb profiles that\'ve received preferential treatment you can peek at right now, if you\'d like to see what your profile\'s in for. What\'s the big deal with Channing Tatum, anyway?', 'Twitter’s blog post announcing its new profile designs begins, “Moment by moment, your Twitter profile shows the world who you are.” My brain interrupted “shows the world who you are” and blurted out “looks more and more like Facebook” before belly-laughing at its own joke like a drunken idiot. But enough about my neurological problems. \n \n The two sites are shockingly similar now — at least the top third of each of them are. Both have a giant, wide background photo and then a little headshot box overlapping the lower left corner of the background photo. \n \n Twitter is still Twitter, though, with a steady stream of tweets comprising the middle column. And with the new design come a few added features: best tweets, pinned tweets and filtered tweets. \n \n Tweets that have caused more of a ruckus – called engagement just in case you’re at a dinner party full of social media experts (they’re everywhere!) – will now show up with a “slightly larger” font in order to denote their importance. \n \n You’ll also be able to pin what you think is your best tweet to the top of your page. Twitter says this is “so it’s easy for your followers to see what you’re all about” but you and I both know it’s so you can find a suitable mate. \n \n And finally, you’ll be able to filter which tweets you see on other people’s timelines, showing or hiding tweets that contain photos or videos and tweets along with their accompanying replies. \n \n The new design will be rolling out gradually to existing Twitter users; if you’re new to Twitter, you’ll get to use it right away. At the bottom of its blog post, Twitter has a list of sneak-peek accounts that already sport the new design, including First Lady Michelle Obama’s account. \n \n Coming soon: a whole new you, in your Twitter profile [Twitter]', 'Twitter is gradually rolling out a major redesign of user profiles, starting on Tuesday. The new look, which Twitter was testing in February, adds a lot more user information and several new features — and it looks quite similar to Facebook\'s user profiles. \n \n The new profile features a larger user photo and customizable header image. Twitter highlights your tweets that have the most engagement by displaying them slightly larger than the rest. You can also pin one of your tweets to the top of the page. \n \n Furthermore, you can now choose which timeline to view when checking out a profile page. You can see all tweets, tweets with photos and videos only, or just tweets and replies. \n \n As for the similarities of Twitter\'s new user profiles to Facebook\'s profile page, well, they\'re inescapable. There\'s a square profile photo in the top left, and a large ""cover"" photo on top dominates both pages, for example. Below the profile photo you\'ll find the basic info about the user, and under that is photos and friends. The only real difference there is that on Twitter\'s user profiles, photos are placed below your followers, and Facebook has it the other way around. It\'ll be interesting to see what the users think of the new look — especially those that are not overly fond of Facebook. \n \n The new profile design is already live for a handful of celebrities, including Zac Efron, Channing Tatum, Floyd Mayweather and John Legend, and it will also show up for new users. The rest of us will have to wait as the new look rolls out over the ""coming weeks.""', 'Twitter today launched a complete profile redesign on the Web, featuring a photo-focused layout reminiscent of Facebook and Google+. \n \n This redesign will roll out to all users over the next few weeks, but new users will get the look immediately. The social network announced the news on the Today Show this morning. You can see the new design live on Twitter.com here. \n \n Detailed in Twitter’s official announcement, designer David Bellona shares that the new Web profiles will feature a larger profile photo, a header (cover) photo, and the ability to pin your favorite tweets to the top of your profile. \n \n That pinning feature, according to Bellona, lets your followers see “what you’re all about.” It also creates a significantly better profile experience for brands, allowing them to promote themselves more effectively on the network. \n \n As for the new design’s similarities with Facebook and Google+, all three social networks now feature cover photos, overlapping profile photos, and a three-column layout. \n \n Twitter’s decision to roll the design out to new users immediately makes it seem as if the Today Show launch was also a recruiting effort. A familiar-looking profile design should help new users feel more at home.', 'Abstract \n \n One way in which secondary sexual traits can influence differential reproductive success is by playing a key role in the outcome of direct physical contests for mates. Here we describe an undocumented trait in a species of hummingbird with a lek mating system, the Long-billed hermit (LBH, Phaethornis longirostris). The trait under consideration is a dagger-like structure at the bill tip, which we hypothesize is a secondary sexual trait that functions as a sexually dimorphic weapon. We tested our hypothesis by examining 5 leks during 4 consecutive years, and by employing morphological analyses, performance experiments, and behavioral observations. We found that 1) adult male bill tips were longer and pointier than their counterparts in females and juvenile males, 2) juvenile males acquired dagger-like tips during their transition to adulthood, 3) variation in bill tip morphology reflected puncture capability, and 4) males with larger and pointier bill tips were more successful in achieving lek territory tenure. Our study provides the first evidence of sexually dimorphic weapons in bird bills and stands as one of the few examples of male weaponry in birds. Our results suggest a role of sexual selection on the evolution of overall bill morphology, an alternative hypothesis to the prevailing “ecological causation” explanation for bill sexual dimorphism in hummingbirds.']",5,"– Starting today, Twitter is rolling out a redesigned profile that will eventually hit all users—and basically every report on the redesign is noting the similarity between the new profile pages and Facebook's profile pages. Among the changes: There's now a full header photo (think Facebook's cover photos) and a larger profile photo that appears (and overlaps) at the lower lefthand corner of the header (just like on Facebook). Users will also be able to ""pin"" certain tweets so they always appear at the top of their feed, Venture Beat reports. The idea, as the designer puts it, is followers will be able to see ""what you're all about"" right away. And tweets will be adjusted in size relative to how much others have engaged with them—the more popular ones will appear larger, The Verge reports. When viewing someone else's profile, you can use a filter at the top of the profile to see just tweets, tweets and replies, or tweets that include photos or videos. All new users will get the new profile when signing up, and everyone else will have it within a few weeks. Engadget notes that a few VIPs, including Channing Tatum, already have the new design if you want to check it out."

Asked about the new information, a Twitter spokesperson simply pointed to the company's initial statement (which blamed a ""customer support employee"" on his or her last day at work) and said a full internal investigation is underway. The Times notes that the issue highlights a potential problem for Twitter and other social media companies, which often outsource ""sensitive work"" to third-party contract workers; Twitter employees have expressed concerns that these workers can do things like disable accounts, though the employees say contractors cannot tweet from a user's account or access a person's direct messages. In fact, employees tell the Verge this isn't the first time a departing worker has pulled a stunt like this.

It also raised the broader question of whether there is a broad right under the Second Amendment to bear arms in public. \n \n The second NRA case was a challenge to several federal laws and regulations, dating back to 1968, that make it illegal for firearms dealers to sell guns or ammunition to anyone under 21. \n \n The third case was on the narrow question of whether consumers have the legal right to challenge laws that regulate the sale of firearms.

340,"[""Though late-stage rumors seemed to confirm exactly what happened Tuesday, that Apple released a revamped version of its last handset called the iPhone 4S, many expected a totally new version of the phone or, barring that, a second, cheaper version of Apple’s phone. \n \n Instead, Apple revealed essentially the same phone from its last announcement, with some upgrades. \n \n Investors in Apple were also disappointed and began selling off stock in the minutes after the iPhone 4S was unveiled. by midafternoon, Apple stock was down more than five percent, to 335.39 at around 3:15 p.m. It had been trading over 400 per share earlier in the week. \n \n The iPhone 4S has a faster processor, is a “world phone” that runs on both GSM and CDMA networks, and sports a quicker 8 MP camera. Apple also added Sprint to its list of carriers for the phone. \n \n What’s not clear from the event is whether Apple has fixed the antenna problems that annoyed its iPhone 4 customers when the phone was held a certain way. \n \n The new iPhone 4S will have the same pricing structure as the iPhone 4, though it adds a 64 GB model for $399. The 16GB phone will cost $199; the 32GB phone will be $299. Pre-orders for the phone will start Friday, and it will be released on Oct. 14. \n \n The company also announced the official launch of its next-generation operating system, iOS 5. Users got a peek of the system at Apple’s Worldwide Developers’ Conference in June. \n \n Still, Apple threw in a few more announcements, such as Siri, which acts as a personal assistant that can recognize voice commands. \n \n The company’s iCloud suite of programs, which will launch along with iOS 5 on Oct. 12 will likely send the average Apple consumer even further into the cloud by providing free (and paid) storage space for photos, movies, music, apps — all hooked into Apple’s massive content and entertainment ecosystem. \n \n Apple also released updates to two of its iPod lines — the Nano and the Touch — but it wasn’t immediately clear if the company will continue to make the iPod Classic, which did not appear on the event’s slide showing the iPod family. The new iPod Nano will start at $129 for an 8GB model. The iPod Touch also has some upgrades. It will now come in white and start at $199 for 8GB, $299 for 32GB and $399 for 64GB. \n \n The company built a great deal of momentum going into this event, somehow managing to continually break its own handset sales records while simultaneously driving up hype for its next model. The question now is whether users will be happy enough with the upgraded handset and Apple’s new operating system to keep the company in that enviable position. \n \n Apple’s new chief executive, Tim Cook, hosted the event, but he passed many of the speaking opportunities on to other top executives, as expected. \n \n Related stories: \n \n More technology coverage from The Washington Post \n \n iOS 5 to go out of beta this week \n \n Photos: iPhone 4S unveiled \n \n Apple Siri: 'All-new, voice-control AI stuff' \n \n Faster Forward: Twitter users give their takes \n \n User poll: Does it live up to the hype?"", 'Let me start off by saying this: Your phone is not suddenly going to gain sentience and become Skynet. However, your phone is about to become a whole lot smarter, thanks to Apple and its new artificial intelligence Assistant. \n \n The hype surrounding Tuesday\'s Apple iPhone event is at an all-time high. But most of the hype is focused on the hardware that Apple will announce. What will the iPhone 5 look like? Will there be an iPhone 4S? Will it have 4G capabilities or a bigger screen? \n \n The real star of Tuesday\'s show will not be the hardware, though. This event will focus on software, specifically one piece of software that Apple: the iPhone Assistant. \n \n Assistant is the successor to Siri, the iPhone app that helped users with their daily tasks with natural language voice commands. Ask Siri to find a restaurant for you, and it could not only complete your requests, but it could also help you book a reservation. It could grab movie ratings, find you a taxi, perform Google searches and much more. Most of all, it learned from your actions and refined its recommendations accordingly. \n \n The technology that powered Siri was born from SRI\'s CALO project, the largest artificial intelligence project in U.S. history. It\'s complex technology that linked machine learning to natural language. In other words, it\'s technology that made artificial intelligence accessible and useful to the regular person. \n \n Two months after its launch, Apple acquired Siri for more than $200 million. \n \n What Assistant Will Do \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n On Tuesday, Siri will be reborn as Assistant. And while we have not had a chance to play with Assistant ourselves, we\'ve heard amazing things from the people who have used it. \n \n Say you\'re in a new city and you\'re really craving Chinese. In the past, you might have pulled up the Yelp app, performed a search on Yelp and combed through results. With Assistant, you can say to your iPhone, ""Please find me a Chinese restaurant within a mile of my location."" \n \n Instead of searching for the taxi company\'s number, Assistant will find it for you. Instead of searching through your apps, Assistant will open up your app and tell the app what you want it to do (we eventually expect APIs that will allow users to directly access their apps via Assistant). \n \n And yes, Assistant will be able to transcribe your texts and perform web searches, much like Google\'s Android OS. Assistant will utilize Nuance\'s advance voice-recognition technology to accomplish these tasks. \n \n The key though is that Assistant will learn. It will figure out what results you don\'t like, what restaurants you frequent, and what people you want to talk to the most. It will adapt to your needs and become more than just a module for voice commands. \n \n What Artificial Intelligence Does to the iPhone \n \n In a great interview on Monday, Siri co-founder Norman Winarsky wasn\'t shy to share his thoughts on how Assistant will not only change personal computing but the entire world. \n \n ""Make no mistake: Apple’s ‘mainstreaming’ Artificial Intelligence in the form of a Virtual Personal Assistant is a groundbreaking event,"" Winarsky told 9to5mac. ""I’d go so far as to say it is a world-changing event."" \n \n But why is Assistant a ""world-changing"" event? Winarsky explains further: \n \n ""This is real AI with real market use. If the rumors are true, Apple will enable millions upon millions of people to interact with machines with natural language,"" he said. ""The PAL (personal assistant software) will get things done, and this is only the tip of the iceberg. We’re talking another technology revolution. A new computing paradigm shift."" \n \n Apple plans to change the very way we interact with our phones yet again. Apple already sparked one revolution with touchscreens and another with the App Store. After Tuesday though, it will have introduced a whole new method of interacting with computers: through an artificial intelligence. That is something that will change our fundamental relationship with the devices that sit on our desks and travel with us in our pockets. \n \n Starting Tuesday, we\'ll be talking about a new computing revolution. \n \n Lead image courtesy of DreamWorks \n \n What Apple\'s iPhone 5 May Look Like', '1 of 23. Apple CEO Tim Cook speaks in front of an image of an iPhone 4S at Apple headquarters in Cupertino, California October 4, 2011. \n \n CUPERTINO, California (Reuters) - Apple Inc\'s newest iPhone left Wall Street and fans wishing for more than a souped-up version of last year\'s device, igniting a rare storm of criticism and disappointment on the Internet. \n \n Newly minted CEO Tim Cook ably helmed his first major product launch without former boss Steve Jobs, but failed to ignite the sort of excitement and buzz that the charismatic Apple co-founder once did. \n \n Expectations were high at this critical juncture, when Android phones by Samsung Electronics and other rivals are closing in on Apple\'s lead and the important holiday shopping season gets started. \n \n Investors and fans, looking to be blown away by some amazing surprise, sent the shares down as much as 5 percent before they recovered with the market to close down 0.6 percent. \n \n Cook, who took over from Jobs in August, and his executive team showed off a device that comes with voice recognition and a better camera, but looks identical to the last phone and does little to lift the bar for smartphones. \n \n While the gadget wasn\'t as tricked out as some had hoped, analysts liked its voice-enabling technology that helps users vocalize everything from stock price searches to sending messages -- more easily than on Android phones or Research in Motion Blackberries. \n \n ""It\'s been 16 months and all you\'ve got is an A5 processor in the existing iPhone 4,"" said BGC Partners\' analyst Colin Gillis. ""It\'s a mild disappointment, but they\'re still going to be selling millions of units."" \n \n Some shareholders and analysts hoped for a cameo appearance by Jobs, now chairman. The pancreatic cancer survivor, who took his third medical leave in August, did not appear. \n \n In some ways, Apple may have been a victim of its past success. Its launches are some of the hottest events on the tech calendar. Tuesday\'s ""Let\'s talk iPhone"" show marked Cook\'s unofficial debut since taking over from Jobs in August. \n \n Analysts say it is more crucial than ever to sustain the popularity of its aging iPhone 4. Apple sold more than 20 million units in the third quarter ended June 25. \n \n ""It\'s kind of funny -- if they have gone and called it the 5, the stock would have been fine, but they\'re calling it the 4S, which is a disappointment to some,"" said WP Stewart portfolio manager Michael Walker. \n \n The iPhone, which accounts for more than 40 percent of Apple\'s sales, has been a success since it came out in 2007, making Apple into one of the world\'s leading consumer electronics companies. \n \n INTENSIFYING COMPETITION \n \n On a brighter note, the company would seem to be making inroads into potentially pivotal new markets. \n \n It said more than 90 percent of Fortune 500 companies are testing or using its iPhones and iPads, expanding its presence in a corporate market dominated by RIM. RIM shares trading on the Nasdaq stock market slid nearly 3 percent before ending 2.4 percent higher. Google shares finished 1.3 percent up. \n \n The two-generation-old iPhone 3GS will be offered free, as long as users sign a contract. Analysts said that would help to expand its market in lower-end Asian and developing markets. \n \n ""Apple is hitting Nokia when it\'s vulnerable. How many billions of people in emerging markets would love to have an iPhone? These are a growing demographic,"" said YCMNet Advisors CEO Michael Yoshikami. \n \n Tuesday\'s iPhone event took place at Apple Central -- the same venue where the iPod first was introduced years ago -- versus the larger, splashier venues of more recent choice such as downtown San Francisco\'s Moscone center. \n \n Heading in to the event, many on Wall Street had questioned Cook\'s ability lead the company as Jobs did. In terms of stage presence, Jobs was a tough act to follow, but analysts say Cook acquitted himself well. \n \n Twitter users were not impressed with the phone, though. \n \n ""Please note I will be selling some \'S\' stickers for $0.99 so iPhone 4 owners have a cheaper upgrade option,"" wrote HAL9000 on Twitter. \n \n Tomlinsonr tweeted, ""I\'ll have a double helping of \'meh\' with a side of \'whatever\'."" \n \n The latest version of the iPhone comes as the economy slows and competition intensifies. People activate more than 550,000 Android-based devices -- including tablets -- each day. \n \n Nielsen data shows the iPhone was No. 2 in the United States with a 28 percent market share, with Android at 43 percent. \n \n Globally, iPhone shipments rose 9.1 percent in the second quarter while Nokia\'s plummeted more than 30 percent, handing the top spot to Apple with a market share of 18.4 percent, according to IHS iSuppli. Samsung, whose shipments grew faster, is coming on strong with a market share of 17.8 percent. \n \n Despite disappointment online, analysts said the phone is superior to many rival offerings. \n \n ""Voice recognition has been on Google and Blackberry devices for years, but Apple will make it much more usable,"" said Morgan Keegan analyst Tavis McCourt. \n \n (Additional reporting by Noel Randewich, Alistair Barr and Sarah McBride in San Francisco, and Sinead Carew and Liana B.

Reuters adds that the new iPhone is expected to be loaded with the updated software. It will be cheaper: Reuters notes that some expect a cheaper model that would appeal to the Asian market, in order to boost Apple's growth there, but the Wall Street Journal reports that the price is expected to remain around $199 to $299. TechCrunch, however, believes we will definitely see a cheaper phone—perhaps even less than $100. It will mark Tim Cook's debut: Cook, the new CEO, will have his first chance to prove himself as the main speaker today. Still unknown is whether Steve Jobs will make an appearance. Other questions that remain: Will Apple announce two phones (say, an iPhone 5 and an iPhone 4S) or just one? What about a partnership with Facebook? Any news about the iPod?

It is without democratic oversight or transparency. \n \n ""The US government itself found that there were no lawful grounds to add WikiLeaks to a US financial blockade. But the blockade of WikiLeaks by politicised US finance companies continues regardless."" \n \n Assange said donations to WikiLeaks were running at €100,000 a month in 2010, but had dropped to a monthly figure of €6,000 to €7,000 this year. \n \n This had cost the organisation a cumulative €40m to €50m, he claimed, assuming donations had stayed at their 2010 level without the financial blockade. \n \n Assange said WikiLeaks was facing legal cases in Denmark, Iceland, the UK and Australia, as well as an existing action in the EU. \n \n He is also fighting extradition from the UK to Sweden to answer allegations of sexual misconduct. \n \n The Guardian, New York Times, El País, Der Spiegel and Le Monde worked with WikiLeaks in publishing carefully selected and redacted US embassy cables in December, but have since criticised the website\'s decision to publish its full archive of 251,000 unredacted documents in early September. \n \n • To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediaguardian.co.uk or phone 020 3353 3857.

This has triggered aggressive retaliation from powerful groups. \n \n “Since 7th December 2010 an arbitrary and unlawful financial blockade has been imposed by Bank of America, VISA, MasterCard, PayPal and Western Union. \n \n “The blockade came into force within ten days of the launch of Cablegate as part of a concerted US-based, political attack that included vitriol by senior right wing politicians, including assassination calls against WikiLeaks staff. \n \n “The blockade is outside of any accountable, public process. It is without democratic oversight or transparency.” \n \n WikiLeaks continued in its statement: “As a result, WikiLeaks has been running on cash reserves for the past eleven months. \n \n “The blockade has cost the organization tens of millions of pounds in ost donations at a time of unprecedented operational costs resulting from publishing alliances in over 50 countries, and their inevitable counter-attacks. \n \n “Our scarce resources now must focus on fighting the unlawful banking blockade.” \n \n WikiLeaks said that it had “commenced pre- litigation action against the blockade in Iceland, Denmark, the UK, Brussels, the United States and Australia. \n \n “We have lodged an anti-trust complaint at the European Commission and expect a decision by mid-November as to whether the European Competition Authority will open a full investigation into the wrongdoing of VISA and MasterCard.” \n \n WikiLeaks is today setting out a number of ways that people can donate to the website.']",2,"– WikiLeaks won’t be releasing any more secrets in the near future, Julian Assange announced today; the credit card companies have brought it down. In a statement, WikiLeaks said it was making the move in response to the “blockade” against donations established by banks and credit card companies. “We are forced to temporarily suspend publishing whilst we secure our economic survival,” its website reads today. At a press conference in London today, Assange said the blockade had shrunk its donations from more than $100,000 a month to around $8,000-$9,000, and that if the ban wasn’t lifted the organization would be “simply not able to continue,” according to the Guardian. What money the organization does have will now be devoted to legal action against the banks—it’s already taken “pre-litigation action” in six countries, including the US, the Telegraph reports."

Marco Rubio decided to run for re-election. \n \n Jolly then decided to run for re-election in his district, which had become much more Democratic in redistricting. The reconfigured district now includes most of Pinellas County in the Tampa Bay area, including several parts of St. Petersburg. \n \n Making a pledge not to directly solicit campaign contributions, Jolly struggled with fundraising. He's no friend of the National Republican Congressional Committee and couldn't count on outside GOP support to help him. \n \n [Florida’s David Jolly Running for Re-Election to the House] \n \n Over the course of the fall, though, Jolly appeared less vulnerable after deciding to run for re-election, which forced Democrats to keep spending in the district. Coming into Election Day, the race was rated Leans Democratic by The Rothenberg & Gonzalez Political Report/Roll Call. \n \n Under the old district lines, Jolly won a special election in 2014, after former GOP Rep. C.W. Bill Young passed away. He narrowly defeated former Florida Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink by 2 points. \n \n [House GOP to David Jolly: We’re Not Sure We Want You Back] \n \n Crist has emerged as a centrist Democratic voice and an advocate for pragmatic deals like those he embraced in Florida as a Republican governor, attorney general and state legislator over two decades. \n \n He brushes aside Republican charges of opportunism, saying that he wants to avert gridlock and encourage “more civility to tackle issues like the rising cost of health care, gun violence, failing schools, and protecting our environment.” \n \n As governor, Crist embraced President Barack Obama in February 2009 in support of economic stimulus funding. The gesture sparked a backlash, culminating in Crist’s exit from the GOP during an unsuccessful 2010 Senate campaign, in which he ended up running as an independent and finished second to Rubio. \n \n With a background in criminal justice, Crist has eyes on a seat on the House Judiciary Committee. He has also voiced an interest in panels dealing with environmental, transportation and veterans issues. \n \n Crist became a Democrat in 2012 and endorsed Obama for re-election. He was defeated in 2014 by GOP Gov. Rick Scott in a bid for his old job. \n \n Contact Bowman at bridgetbowman@rollcall.com and follow her on Twitter @bridgetbhc."", ""Republicans will hold on to control of the House, NBC News projects, overcoming a top-of-the-ticket drag from Donald Trump that had Democrats expressing cautious optimism at their chances of taking back the chamber. \n \n Republicans are still expected to lose anywhere from five to 20 seats on Tuesday due in large part to the controversial GOP nominee, who has created unexpected headaches for some typically safe members. \n \n In particular, the release of the controversial 2005 video in which Trump bragged about groping women in lewd terms, which caused Republicans to abandon their nominee in droves, fueled Democratic optimism. \n \n But with a 247-188 majority, 30 or more House Republicans would have to lose to deliver control to Democrats. \n \n Indeed, as the race tightened at the top of the ticket over the past few weeks, in part due to the new revelations in the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton’s email use, Democratic hopes for taking back the House waned. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi told reporters Tuesday she felt FBI Director James Comey’s initial letter announcing potential new evidence in the investigation — which the FBI announced this weekend was ultimately inconsequential — took the House off the map. \n \n “I would say that when the director of the FBI, Mr. Comey, released that letter two Fridays ago, he became the leading Republican political operative in the country,” she said. \n \n “But we can see very clearly that, and I think most people would've agreed, the success, the opportunity to win the House was predicated on a big victory for Mrs. Clinton.

Tuesday. \n \n TAMPA, Fla. — New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie may quickly win over many in the national television audience with his gruff, everyman persona and sharp critiques of a staggering economy when he delivers the keynote speech at the Republican National Convention on Tuesday night. \n \n But it is Christie’s other profile — his substantial physical one — that undoubtedly will make the first major impression on millions of television viewers. \n \n Christie is bigger than any other major national political figure in recent memory. He is heavier than any president — an office many Republicans dearly hope he will one day hold — in 100 years. Though he hasn’t disclosed his exact weight, it seems apparent that only William Howard Taft (the Republican president from 1909 to 1913) can come close to matching his girth. \n \n PHOTOS: Scenes from the GOP convention \n \n Does it matter? It didn’t hurt Christie, who will turn 50 on Sept. 6, as he pushed past Democrat Jon Corzine in 2009 to become governor in a heavily Democratic state that is the 11th most populous in America. He has overhauled teacher tenure and helped rein in state employee pensions, but has not been able to do much to alleviate persistent unemployment. \n \n Those getting their first impression of Christie will be comparing him to a battalion of toned and tanned politicians. The ascendance of one with (in Christie’s own words) a “big, fat rear end” may come as a relief. This leader must have his eye on something more important than his scale and his Q score. \n \n Christie does not shrink from his substantial mass. He once joked to Don Imus that he weighed 550. Introduced to the Michigan delegation at the convention Tuesday morning by a woman from a restaurant trade group, Christie could not resist. “Did she just ask if I’m aware of the restaurant industry? Seriously?” Christie deadpanned. “Yes, I am mildly aware of the restaurant industry, in New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Connecticut. Yeah, the entire region!” \n \n The Michiganders roared. \n \n Christie supporters conceded that in recent months the already sizable governor has layered even more bulk on his 5-foot-11-inch frame. His weighty challenge turned serious in July 2011 when the governor had to visit the emergency room for chronic asthma, a condition he conceded had been exacerbated by his weight. \n \n He acknowledged to Oprah Winfrey , “I don't like being overweight.” \n \n Others have been less sensitive. When Christie shouted down a profanity-spewing heckler this year, David Letterman put the confrontation to music. The late-night comedian said inciting Christie amounted to “crossing a rhino.” \n \n But fat jokes may not have political traction. Corzine aired an ad that used super-slow-motion video of Christie stepping from a car as a voice-over taunted that he “threw his weight around” to avoid traffic tickets. The Democrat lost by 4 percentage points. \n \n PHOTOS: The protests of the GOP convention \n \n With mountain-biking George W. Bush and basketball-playing Barack Obama the most recent models, the presidency has become the home of determined mesomorphs. Mitt Romney works out daily on an elliptical machine and vice presidential candidate Paul D. Ryan has led exhausting P90X fitness regimes for fellow members of the House of Representatives. \n \n Speaking on ABC’s “Good Morning America” about his aspirations for the keynote speech, Christie set a relatively modest goal. “I think if the American people watch tonight, leave the speech by saying, ‘Yep, that's him, that's who I heard about, seems genuine to me,’ then I think I will have done my job for me,” he said. \n \n The governor will be putting considerable weight behind those words.

Both ABC News and NBC News have projected the GOP will keep control of the House of Representatives, effectively ""extinguishing Democrats' hopes of a new progressive era in Washington,"" per Vox. Although there are some races still up in the air, it isn't expected those will have any significant effect in terms of handing control over to the Democrats, who needed to gain 30 seats to flip the current 247-188 majority. That’s not to say the GOP won't suffer losses: Per NBC, the party will lose between five and 20 seats ""due in large part"" to Donald Trump as its nominee. What may now be slipping out of Dems' grasp, thanks to this development: the chance to push through a climate change cap-and-trade bill, immigration reform, or a hike in the minimum wage, Vox reports.

350,"['Mount Fuji, or Fujisan as it is known in Japanese, is the highest point on the archipelago (rising to 3,776 metres) and the national emblem, immortalised in countless etchings. In June last year Unesco added it to the World Heritage list as a ""sacred place and source of artistic inspiration"". But it is still an active volcano, standing at the junction between the Pacific, Eurasian and Philippine tectonic plates. Though it has rarely stirred in recorded history, it is still potentially explosive. \n \n The Tohoku – or Great East Japan – earthquake on 11 March 2011 triggered a devastating tsunami, which in turn caused the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. According to a Franco-Japanese study published by Science (PDF), the magnitude-9 tremor also increased the pressure on Mount Fuji. ""Our work does not say that the volcano will start erupting, but it does show that it\'s in a critical state,"" says Florent Brenguier, a researcher at the Institute of Earth Sciences (IST) in Grenoble, France, and lead author of the publication, to which the Institute of Global Physics (IPG) in Paris also contributed. \n \n Adopting a novel approach, the scientists carried out a sort of giant echo-scan of the bowels of the Earth, based on the huge mass of data recorded after the mega-quake by Japan\'s Hi-net system, the densest network in the world, with 800 seismic sensors. They focused on signals commonly known as seismic noise, the result of constant interaction between ocean swell and ""solid"" earth. In the past such data has generally been dismissed as background interference. \n \n By recording fluctuations in this barely perceptible subterranean noise they were able to map geological disturbances in the bedrock of Japan caused by the seismic waves following the violent quake in March 2011. ""Seismic waves travel a very long way, going round the world several times,"" Brenguier explains. ""Their movement makes the Earth\'s crust vibrate, and rather like a shock wave this produces breaks or cracks in the rock."" \n \n A snow-capped Mount Fuji. A Franco-Japanese study of seismic data suggests pressure is building for a new eruption. Photograph: The Asahi Shimbun/Getty \n \n One might well imagine that such disturbance is greatest close to the epicentre of a quake, but this is not the case. The Franco-Japanese study shows that the area where the Earth\'s crust suffered the greatest damage was not around Tohoku, in the north-east of Honshu island, but in the volcanic regions, in particular under Mount Fuji, some 400km away. ""The volcanic regions are the ones where the fluids trapped in the rock – boiling water, gas, liquid magma, which cause an eruption when they rise to the surface – exert the greatest pressure. The seismic waves add to this pressure, causing even more disturbance,"" Brenguier says. \n \n The magnitude 6.4 quake that occurred four days after the tsunami, followed by many smaller aftershocks, was a further indication that Mount Fuji is under high pressure. \n \n So should Japan be on red alert? ""We cannot establish a direct relation of cause and effect between quakes and volcanic eruptions, even if statistically the former lead to an increase in the latter,"" Brenguier says. ""All we can say is that Mount Fuji is now in a state of pressure, which means it displays a high potential for eruption. The risk is clearly higher."" \n \n Science, however, has no way of predicting when this might happen. But there is a precedent. The last eruption of Mount Fuji occurred in 1707. It projected almost a billion cubic metres of ash and debris into the atmosphere, some of which reached Tokyo (then called Edo) 100km away. It was preceded, 49 days earlier, by a magnitude 8.7 quake to the south of Japan that, in conjunction with the tidal wave it raised, claimed more than 5,000 lives. This time, more than three years have already passed since the Tohoku quake. But that does not mean that Mount Fuji, under the constant supervision of Japanese geologists, is slumbering. \n \n Come what may, the method developed by the Franco-Japanese team for investigating volcanic areas should improve the accuracy of efforts all over the world to assess the risk of major volcanic eruptions. \n \n This story appeared in Guardian Weekly, which incorporates material from Le Monde', 'TOKYO (AP) — A Japanese nuclear plant won preliminary approval Wednesday for meeting stringent post-Fukushima safety requirements, clearing a major hurdle toward becoming the first to restart under the tighter rules. \n \n Protesters shout slogans against a Japanese nuclear plant which won preliminary approval for meeting stringent post-Fukushima safety requirements, near the Diet building in Tokyo, Wednesday, July 16,...

All of Japan\'s 48 remaining reactors are offline for safety checks and repairs since the 2011 earthquake and tsunami hit Fukushima Dai-ichi, causing multiple meltdowns. \n \n Five regulatory commissioners unanimously agreed to move to a next step, allowing the authority to hold a 30-day technical public comment period beginning Thursday until Aug. 15 before a final approval. \n \n Authority\'s chairman Shunichi Tanaka called it ""a major step"" and that the inspection for the Sendai plant incorporated lessons from Fukushima, particularly focusing on ways to build layers of protection in case of serious incidents in a country prone to natural disasters, including volcanic activity, eathquakes, tsunami and typhoon. \n \n ""Previously, safety inspections were merely design-based, but this time we focused on how to prevent severe accidents,"" he told a weekly commissioners\' meeting, which was repeatedly disrupted with anti-nuclear protesters heckling from the floor. \n \n Tanaka said multi-layer steps are in place to protect the reactor core and its containment chamber from damage, while reducing radiation leaks by adding filtered vents. The operator also upgraded the equipment\'s seismic resistance and tripled the tsunami seawall to 15 meters (50 feet). Other risks such as terrorist attacks, airplane strikes and violent volcanic explosions also have been taken into consideration. \n \n The Sendai plant is surrounded by at least five active volcanos. Commissioner Kunihiko Shimazaki, a seismologist, said it\'s impossible to accurately predict eruptions, although the current assessment suggests a catastrophic eruption is extremely unlikely. \n \n Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is pushing to bring at least some of Japan\'s 48 reactors back online, saying a prolonged shutdown hurts Japan\'s economy. Two reactors in western Japan had been briefly reactivated to avoid summertime power crunch, but have been since switched off pending safety checks. \n \n ""I take this as a step forward,"" Abe told reporters. ""When there is a final decision that the plant is safe, we will proceed with a plan to restart the reactors, while trying to gain understanding from local communities and the residents."" \n \n It will still take a few more months to get the No. 1 and No. 2 reactors at Sendai Nuclear Power Station online, officials said. The operator has to clear final steps such as on-site checks, followed by obtaining local government consent. \n \n Though public opposition over restarts exceeds support, Abe\'s government has been calling for restarts, reversing a nuclear phase-out policy adopted by the previous government. The safety approval for the Sendai plant and its expected restart marks a big boost for the nuclear industry. \n \n The Sendai plant is 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) southwest of Tokyo and on the southern tip of Japan\'s Kyushu island. Regulators in March placed the plant, which operates two of 19 reactors nationwide that are undergoing safety checks, on a fast-track for safety approval, largely because the operator was quick to raise the bar on tsunami and earthquake safety. \n \n Regulators will now shift work to the screening of the remaining 17 reactors that applied for inspection.']",2,"– As if Japan's 2011 earthquake and tsunami didn't wreak enough havoc, the country could be facing an additional threat from it: The threat from Mount Fuji, an active volcano, has grown, a study says. The earthquake boosted the pressure under the newly listed World Heritage site, researchers find, per the Guardian. ""Our work does not say that the volcano will start erupting, but it does show that it's in a critical state,"" the scientists note. They reached their conclusions by using Japan's vast trove of geological data following the quake, investigating it for disturbances. The earthquake hurt the Earth's crust most in the area around the volcano. ""We cannot establish a direct relation of cause and effect between quakes and volcanic eruptions, even if statistically the former lead to an increase in the latter,"" a researcher says. What's more, the data can't say ""when an eruption will occur or what size it will be,"" he tells the Daily Mail. ""All we can say is that Mount Fuji is now in a state of pressure, which means it displays a high potential for eruption."" Fuji last erupted in 1707, sending ash as far as Tokyo, more than 60 miles away. That eruption occurred 49 days after an earthquake. (Meanwhile, the Sendai Nuclear Power Station today became Japan's first nuclear plant to pass post-Fukushima safety regulations, reports the AP.)"
351,"['PHILADELPHIA — Hillary Clinton and her team aren’t thrilled that the head of the Democratic National Committee was forced out on the eve of the nominee’s coronation — but they aren’t exactly distraught to see Debbie Wasserman Schultz booted from the tent. \n \n Several senior Democratic officials with ties to Hillary and Bill Clinton told POLITICO that campaign higher-ups have been trying to replace the oft-off-message Florida congresswoman from the start of Clinton’s campaign late last year. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n John Podesta, Clinton’s campaign chairman — and a former top adviser to Barack Obama — broached the idea of replacing Wasserman Schultz as early as last fall, only to be rebuffed by the president’s team, according to two people with direct knowledge of the conversation. \n \n “It came down to the fact that the president didn’t want the hassle of getting rid of Debbie,” said a former top Obama adviser. “It’s been a huge problem for the Clintons, but the president just didn’t want the headache of Debbie bad-mouthing him. ... It was a huge pain in the ass.” \n \n The Obama team — especially 2012 campaign manager Jim Messina — long viewed Wasserman Schultz as a major campaign liability, questioning her fundraising prowess and her tendency to appoint personal aides to positions of authority, prioritizing loyalty over competence and effectiveness as a spokesperson for Democrats. At the time, senior campaign officials leaked details of an internal survey, conducted by pollster David Binder, showing Wasserman Schultz was the least-liked Obama surrogate; she later dismissed the report as “National Enquirer” dross. \n \n After Obama’s 2012 victory, Messina and longtime political adviser Patrick Gaspard, who worked under Wasserman Schultz at the DNC, pressed the president to push her out, advising that he tap former Minneapolis Mayor R.T. Rybak as her replacement. Obama — who cared little for the party machinations — figured the move would be more trouble than it was worth and told his aides that he was OK having Wasserman Schultz serve as chairwoman until he left office. “It’s embarrassing that Obama left the problem for Hillary,” one former West Wing adviser told POLITICO. \n \n Yet the aggregated animosity toward her led to a swift and brutal conclusion to her five-plus year tenure at the helm of the president’s party. Wasserman Schultz resigned less than 24 hours after WikiLeaks posted dozens of emails showing her staff working to undermine the insurgent campaign of Bernie Sanders in order to aid a Clinton organization they often derided as inept and timid. \n \n “I know that electing Hillary Clinton as our next president is critical for America’s future,” Wasserman Schultz said in a statement issued after a day of back-and-forth with top Democratic officials urging her to step down for the sake of party unity ahead of Clinton\'s big week. “I look forward to serving as a surrogate for her campaign in Florida and across the country to ensure her victory. ... Going forward, the best way for me to accomplish those goals is to step down as party chair at the end of this convention.” \n \n The move had to happen on Sunday, said a senior Democrat: Sanders-supporting delegates — without the buy-in of his campaign — had been organizing an effort over the preceding day to have state delegations vote to demand her resignation at the Monday morning caucus breakfasts. Given the number of delegations in which Sanders supporters are the majority, the movement would likely have spread, overtaking any other news on the convention’s opening day. \n \n Clinton campaign officials declined numerous attempts by phone, email and text to respond to this story. \n \n But the Clinton campaign was very much involved in the DNC chair’s defenestration. Earlier in the day Sunday, Sanders had again suggested that Wasserman Schultz should resign — and DNC officials announced she would be replaced as convention chair by Ohio Rep. Marcia Fudge, an influential member of the Congressional Black Caucus. By sundown — after intense negotiations with senior Clinton campaign officials — the committee tapped longtime Clinton aide, TV surrogate and party vice-chair Donna Brazile as interim chairwoman. \n \n It was an embarrassing episode — and a sign of discord that Republicans, fresh off their own fractious convention pounced on. “I know firsthand how hard it is being the chair of a national party, but when you rig a system and spread emails around with each other and senior staff in that matter, this outcome is inevitable,” said Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, during a news conference here on Sunday, barely suppressing his glee. “Obviously, the end has come and I don’t think there was any other outcome that was foreseeable. These events show what an uphill climb the Democrats were facing in unifying their party.” \n \n Wasserman Schultz booed during speech to Florida delegates An excerpt of Debbie Wasserman Schultz address to Florida delegates in Philadelphia. poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201607/270/1155968404_5049042510001_5049021957001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404"" true \n \n But, to senior Democrats, it also represented a clean-up operation that brought Clinton and Sanders — who has demanded her ouster for months — into closer alignment a day before the Vermont senator was due to deliver his opening-night endorsement of an opponent he long accused of rigging the election with the help of the D.C.-based party establishment. \n \n “Debbie Wasserman Schultz has made the right decision for the future of the Democratic Party,"" Sanders said in a don’t-let-the-door-hit-you-on-the-way-out statement Sunday afternoon. “While she deserves thanks for her years of service, the party now needs new leadership that will open the doors of the party and welcome in working people and young people. The party leadership must also always remain impartial in the presidential nominating process, something which did not occur in the 2016 race.” \n \n People around Wasserman Schultz didn’t know it was coming until Sunday morning in Philadelphia, when she finally had a meeting with senior Clinton campaign officials. \n \n In fact, no one saw it coming: She had introduced Clinton and Kaine at their first joint rally in Miami roughly than 24 hours earlier, and even that was just after she’d spent a week as Democrats\' most prominent surrogate at the Republican convention, popping up at event after event in Cleveland. \n \n But the writing had been on the wall ever since the WikiLeaks email dump — the source of the only disruption at Clinton and Kaine’s entire rally, when a protester carrying a #DNCLEAKS banner heckled the presumptive nominee the second she thanked Wasserman Schultz. \n \n All weekend, senior Clinton staffers and members of the Sanders brain trust were huddling in Philadelphia. Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver and strategist Mark Longabaugh were in touch with Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook, senior adviser Charlie Baker and lawyer Marc Elias on Friday night and Saturday during the rules committee proceedings. The WikiLeaks emails kept popping up as a topic of conversation, and while the Sanders aides didn’t demand Wasserman Schultz’s ouster, they made their preference — that she exit as soon as possible — known. \n \n Wasserman Schultz, meanwhile, was largely going dark except for her Clinton/Kaine appearance. Her public events kept coming off her calendar through the weekend, including a scheduled appearance on “Fox News Sunday.” And when Baker didn’t show up at a credentials committee meeting Sunday morning, staffers immediately suspected something was coming. \n \n It was a striking and telling shift to the DNC staffers monitoring her movements: They had just been laughing about how overexposed she’d been last week, showing up everywhere in Cleveland. \n \n But they knew for sure that something was up with the chairwoman — who they had, for months, been sure was going to be showered in Ted Cruz-like boos at the convention — when their 2 p.m. senior staff meeting in Philadelphia on Sunday was abruptly canceled. \n \n “This was the right move. She doesn’t deserve every attack that’s been thrown at her, but her faults have become too big a distraction and she hasn’t deftly managed the internal politics involved in managing a national committee,” said a DNC staffer. “The DNC should be playing a consequential role in the general election and that hasn\'t been possible as long as she’s been in charge.” \n \n All the while, state party chairs had been emailing each other in semi-panic, receiving no response from national committee staff as speculation about a move heated up throughout the weekend. The same held true for party fundraisers, even those at a DNC retreat in town on Sunday, who were blindsided by the party’s split-second reorganization. \n \n TTeam Sanders got no warning either, but they were immediately cheered by the installation of Brazile. Back in May — the last time speculation swirled about Wasserman Schultz\'s exit — they had been fans of Brazile\'s, even as Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid floated Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin for the job. \n \n Inside the White House, aides and lawyers have been poring through the Wikileaks dump all weekend. There’s a lot of flagging of potential problems, but also a lot of eyerolling and disbelief about what Wasserman Schultz and her staff were thinking, and that they were putting it in emails. \n \n Still, Obama didn’t get involved at all as Wasserman Schultz was at the brink. Whenever the topic of replacing her came up, despite the fact that the president had lost patience with her years ago and generally avoided having to talk to her, he’d always felt that forcing her out wasn\'t worth the trouble it would bring. \n \n As the election got underway, he felt the leadership questions should be left to Clinton. And this weekend, as conversations between her Brooklyn headquarters and Wasserman Schultz intensified, neither the president nor his staff was involved. Once the decision was made, Wasserman Schultz called White House political director David Simas to tell him, and Simas then told the president. Obama decided to call to thank her for her work. The conversation was full of platitudes, a source familiar with the discussion said. He didn\'t go out of his way to say he was sorry to see her go, and certainly didn’t twist her arm to get her to reconsider. \n \n Shortly before 4 p.m. ET, as word of the impending shakeup began leaking out, the DNC press shop put out its official announcement: Wasserman Schultz would step down. Obama’s statement, thanking her and describing her as a “dear friend,” landed around 20 minutes later, as did Clinton’s naming her the honorary chair of her campaign’s “50-state program.” \n \n “We all knew this was coming yesterday after the WikiLeaks news, it felt like it had to happen. It was just a question of the timing, to be honest,” said one state party chair. “A lot of us thought this was going to happen a month ago. That would\'ve been a more opportune time to do it. ... You won’t find a lot of fans of hers among state chairs, but this is shitty timing.” \n \n Annie Karni contributed to this report.', 'Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee said she will resign this week in the aftermath of the release of thousands of internal email exchanges among Democratic officials. (Thomas Johnson,Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post) \n \n The announcement of Debbie Wasserman Schultz\'s planned resignation as chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee was sudden, shaking up an otherwise sleepy Sunday afternoon in which most of the political world was focused on making its way to Philadelphia for the party\'s quadrennial convention. \n \n But, if her departure was abrupt — Wasserman Schultz will resign her post when the Democratic National Convention ends on Thursday night — the fall that led to the end was anything but. Wasserman Schultz\'s tenure at the head of the DNC has been rocky almost since the moment she took over the job in 2011. \n \n Interviews with a variety of pro- and anti-Wasserman Schultz Democrats — and there are plenty of both — suggest that the Florida House member\'s problems were both personal and structural, and that she retains a relatively bright future even if this chapter of her political life left much to be desired. \n \n [Here are the latest, most damaging things in the DNC’s leaked emails] \n \n Where to start when it comes to the ""why"" behind Wasserman Schultz\'s struggles depends on who you believe is to blame for them. \n \n DNC Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.) and Vice President Biden (Mark Wilson/Getty Images) \n \n Several people I talked to put the blame — or at least a large portion of it — on President Obama and his inner circle of political advisers who never cared about the DNC in any meaningful way and, as a result, left Wasserman Schultz to wither on the vine as they worked around her time and again. \n \n ""Obama and team never accepted the DNC or cared very much about it, and it showed,"" said one senior Democratic strategist granted anonymity to speak candidly. ""Obama was not into party building, or party anything. He never integrated his political operation into the DNC so she was in a very tough position always."" \n \n From the start, Obama was never a big ""party"" guy. He explicitly ran against the party infrastructure and elites in 2008 — Hillary Clinton was their candidate — and once he got into office was openly disdainful of many of the traditional apparatus of the party. \n \n Obama installed his loyal ally Tim Kaine — name ring a bell? — as the DNC chair. But, once Kaine decided to run for an open Virginia Senate seat in 2011, it was clear to anyone paying attention that the next DNC chair wouldn\'t be a member of the Obama inner circle as he began positioning himself for his reelection bid. \n \n Enter Wasserman Schultz, a Jewish woman from Florida who had a reputation as a dogged fundraiser and willing attack dog on TV. For what Obama imagined that job to be, she was a natural fit. \n \n ""She wasn\'t anyone\'s first choice for chair,"" a veteran Democratic operative said. ""But I think most people thought she\'d be fine."" \n \n [Schedule: Who will speak in Philadelphia during the 2016 Democratic National Convention] \n \n The counter to that story line is that Wasserman Schultz, from the jump, seemed dead set on using the perch to promote her own political interests rather than put what was best for Obama first. \n \n Even some of Wasserman Schultz\'s harshest critics acknowledge that part of that problem was structural: She was in elected office while also serving as the party chair. She was looking to move up the ladder in House leadership and saw the DNC job as a way to do that. Period. \n \n She was far from the only elected official who has struggled to balance the demands of the party chair job with more provincial interests. ""It wasn\'t great with [then Connecticut Sen. Chris Dodd] or [then Philadelphia Mayor Ed] Rendell, and it wasn\'t great with her,"" said one leading Democratic consultant. ""There are always concerns about whose agenda gets put first, tensions between official duties (particularly votes) and political party duties."" \n \n But, Wasserman Schultz\'s emphasis on her own political future — and the need to make sure she was front and center when it came to media attention and interviews — rubbed lots and lots of people the wrong way. \n \n ""She ignored infrastructure, instead focusing on why she wasn\'t getting more media hits,"" noted a longtime Democratic strategist familiar with the inner workings of the party committee. "" \n \n ""Fundraising was anemic."" \n \n What everyone agrees on is that Wasserman Schultz suffered a series of self-inflicted wounds as chair. There was the time she broke with the White House about deporting children detained at the border. The time she said Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker had given women ""the back of his hand."" Story after story about how she was feathering her own political nest first and then worrying about Obama and the broader party second — or not at all. How she found herself on the wrong side of Bernie Sanders and the party\'s liberal base. \n \n On and on it went. For much of the past two years, rumors of Wasserman Schultz\'s demise came across the transom with remarkable regularity. And yet, she persevered — occasionally via means that left made her detractors even more convinced that she needed to go. \n \n What her increasingly large enemies list could never find was a spark that could set all of the tinder they had gathered aflame. That long-awaited moment came late last week when a hacker group released more than 20,000 hacked DNC emails. The emails cast Wasserman Schultz and her senior staff in not only an unflattering light but also as abettors of Clinton\'s march to the Democratic presidential nomination — in effect confirming the suspicions of Sanders and his supporters. \n \n Within days, years of bad blood with Wasserman Schultz had been unleashed and she had been pushed out. \n \n What does the future hold for the Florida Democrat? She faces a primary from a Sanders-backed candidate but most political observers say she will win it. Beyond that, few people I talked to had any real sense for where she might go next although Dave Beattie, a Florida pollster and Wasserman Schultz ally, was optimistic. \n \n ""I have worked with her a long time,"" he said. ""She is loyal, works hard, is a staunch advocate for Democrats and is not afraid to raise money."" \n \n Time will tell. But, it\'s hard to see Wasserman Schultz\'s time at the head of the DNC as anything short of a major disappointment for all involved.', 'Hackers have released a trove of 20,000 emails stolen from the servers of the Democratic National Committee. \n \n Most of the emails showed routine campaign planning among senior DNC officials. The emails show some evidence of unseemly behavior by Democratic Party officials and at least one case where DNC officials discussed trying to undermine the Sanders. That has reopened a long-running debate about whether the DNC — which is supposed to be neutral during a primary campaign — was too favorable toward Hillary Clinton. \n \n Perhaps as important as the emails\' content is who may have leaked them. The leak is believed to be the fruit of a network intrusion discovered last month by the DNC. A number of security researchers who have examined the evidence believe the attack was linked to the Russian government. That raises the possibility that a foreign government is trying to manipulate the US election. \n \n The email trove contains some embarrassing revelations but no bombshells \n \n As soon as the searchable database of emails appeared on WikiLeaks, journalists began scouring them for juicy tidbits. The emails contained enough evidence to confirm Sanders supporters\' suspicions that DNC officials were biased toward Hillary Clinton, but no proof that they used the resources of the Democratic Party to aid Clinton or hurt Sanders. \n \n Probably the most significant scoop is news that the DNC’s chief financial officer, Brad Marshall, sent an email asking ""for KY and WVA can we get someone to ask his belief. Does he believe in a God. He had skated on saying he has a Jewish heritage."" \n \n The email doesn’t specify who ""he"" is, but it seems like a reasonable guess that Bernie Sanders was the target. If the DNC followed through on this plan — attempting to expose Sanders as an atheist in order to discredit him with Christian, especially Southern Baptist, voters — it would represent a big departure from the DNC’s neutral role. \n \n But Marshall denied that Sanders was the target (though he wasn’t able to explain who the target was, making this denial a bit hard to believe), and, more importantly, there’s no evidence that the plan was actually carried out. \n \n The emails seem to confirm Sanders supporters’ general impression that many DNC officials liked Clinton more than Sanders. What the emails don’t seem to prove, at least so far, is that they used DNC resources to help Clinton or hurt Sanders. \n \n Another email showed that Politico reporter Kenneth Vogel made an agreement to share a copy of a forthcoming story about Hillary Clinton’s fundraising with a DNC contact prior to publication. Many journalists consider this kind of prepublication story sharing to be unethical because it can give favored sources undue influence over the article’s contents. \n \n Another email thread showed DNC officials rounding up a list of Democratic donors to recommend for appointment to boards and commissions. It\'s hardly unusual for presidents to appoint big donors to government positions, but ordinarily they maintain a shred of deniability about the nature of the transaction. So having the process laid bare could prove awkward for Democrats. \n \n Other scooplets from the DNC emails seem even less significant. DNC officials were annoyed by accusations that they were biased in favor of Clinton. A DNC staffer jokingly asked a colleague, ""Is there a Fuck You emoji?"" after a reporter emailed for comment about Donald Trump calling Clinton an enabler of her husband’s infidelity. \n \n Probably the funniest scoop is news that the White House vetoed having Ariana Grande perform at a presidential gala because a video ""caught her licking other peoples’ donuts while saying she hates America."" The White House was worried that allowing Grande to perform for the president would invite criticism from Republicans. \n \n The hack included a lot of donors’ personal information \n \n Fundraising is a major DNC function, and the leaked emails suggest that the group was somewhat careless in handling donors’ private information. \n \n One email, for example, contained an attached image with a picture of a $150,000 check. Emailing checks like this is a bad idea because America’s awful check payment network allows anyone to withdraw money from anyone else’s account with only the routing information printed on every check. \n \n Also included in the email dump were numerous donors’ names, contact information, credit card numbers, and Social Security numbers. Many of these donors are likely wealthy, making them juicy targets for identity thieves. \n \n There\'s significant evidence linking the attacks to the Russian government \n \n The Russian government was responsible for the recent attacks on the DNC, according to security firms that spoke to the Washington Post. And Franklin Foer, a fellow at the New America Foundation, has drawn a dramatic conclusion from this evidence. \n \n I\'m sure there\'s ugly stuff on DNC severs. But a foreign freaking power is trying to install a president. Perspective please! — Franklin Foer (@FranklinFoer) July 22, 2016 \n \n Foer is suggesting here that the Russian government leaked the emails to WikiLeaks as part of a broader scheme to get Donald Trump elected president. Trump has been curiously pro-Putin throughout the presidential campaign. And his campaign manager, Paul Manafort, once advised Viktor Yanukovych, the pro-Putin former leader of Ukraine. Under Manafort’s leadership, the Trump campaign helped ensure that the Republican Party’s platform would not take a hard line against Russia’s activities in Ukraine. \n \n Still, it’s worth being clear that there’s zero evidence that Trump or Manafort has direct ties to the Russian government. \n \n On the other hand, there is significant circumstantial evidence that the attacks on the DNC were closely linked to Russian intelligence agencies. Multiple security researchers have looked at forensic evidence from the attacks and concluded that the attackers used the same kind of techniques that Russian intelligence agencies have used against other targets around the world. \n \n Shortly after news of the attacks on the DNC broke last month, an online personality named Guccifer 2.0 emerged, claimed to be a lone hacker from Romania, and claimed sole responsibility for the attacks. But many security experts are skeptical of Guccifer 2.0\'s claims. Among other problems, he doesn\'t seem to speak very good Romanian. Guccifer 2.0 may have been created by the same Russian group that hacked the DNC servers in an attempt to confuse the public about the source of the attack. \n \n National security hawks and allies of Hillary Clinton have suggested that Russian hackers released the email trove on the eve of the Democratic National Convention in an effort to derail the Clinton campaign. Not long after the documents were made public, Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigned as chair of DNC. \n \n Still, none of the emails released so far seem likely to do lasting damage to Clinton\'s candidacy. There\'s sporadic evidence that DNC officials favored Clinton over Sanders, but no evidence of a systematic campaign to help Clinton win the primaries. So if the hackers’ goal was to help Trump get elected, the leak may not accomplish that purpose.', '(CNN) A sixth suspect in the shooting death of a top Russian opposition figure blew himself up after a standoff with police in the capital of the Chechen Republic, state-run television reported Sunday. \n \n Beslan Shavanov, 30, was holed up in a building in Grozny when police arrived to arrest him Saturday afternoon, Russia 24 reported. Police surrounded the building and Shavano tried to escape, throwing a grenade at police officers before blowing himself up, the station said. \n \n The news came as Russian authorities reported making five other arrests in connection with Boris Nemtsov\'s killing. \n \n One of those arrested claims to have an alibi, according to Russia\'s Sputnik News \n \n ""At the time of the murder, I was at work as I usually am every day. There are many people, my colleagues, who will confirm this,"" the news agency quoted Tamerlan Eskerkhanov as saying in Moscow\'s Basmanny District Court. \n \n Two of the suspects have been formally charged and three ""remain under the status of suspects,"" court spokeswoman Anna Fadeyeva told Sputnik. \n \n Nemtsov, one of President Vladimir Putin\'s most outspoken critics, was shot in the back on a Moscow bridge as he walked with his girlfriend near the Kremlin in late February. \n \n Surveillance video showed someone darting from the sidewalk and into a nearby car right after Nemtsov collapsed. \n \n Putin has been informed of the arrests in connection with Nemtsov\'s death, Russian media said, citing Federal Security Service director Alexander Bortnikov. \n \n Two of the other suspects are Anzor Gubashev and Zaur Dadayev, Bortnikov said in a televised statement. The others are Ramzan Bakhayev and Shagit Gubashev, Anzor\'s younger brother, according to a Sputnik report that also said Dadayev was the only one of the five to plead guilty -- though to what crimes was not clear. \n \n Bortnikov said those detained are from the southern region of the North Caucasus, which for years has been a hotbed of unrest and rebellion against Moscow. \n \n The suspects \n \n Dadayev had previously served as an officer in a Chechen police battalion, Albert Barakhayev, secretary of the Security Council of the Caucasian republic of Ingushetia, told the official news agency TASS. \n \n Dadayev was the deputy commander of one of the Chechen Republic\'s Ministry of Internal Affairs groups, Sputnik reported, adding that Gubashev worked at a security firm in Moscow. \n \n Gubashev was arrested between the town of Malgobek and the village of Voznesenovskaya, while Dadayev was arrested in the city of Magas, Barakhayev told TASS \n \n The slain opposition leader\'s daughter, Zhanna Nemtsova, told CNN she is ""not surprised both of them (are) of Caucasus origin. It was predictable."" \n \n Nemtsova said the only things she knew about the arrests came from media reports, as authorities did not contact her immediately. \n \n Later Saturday, a southern Russian law enforcement official told state news agency RIA Novosti that two more men were arrested. \n \n The two suspects in the second arrest were not named, but one of them was driving with Dadayev, and the other man is Gubashev\'s younger brother, Barakhayev said. Like Gubashev and Dadayev, those two suspects are also ethnic Chechens, according to Barakhayev. \n \n Opposition blames Putin \n \n After Nemtsov\'s shooting Putin blamed extremists and protesters who he said were trying to stir internal strife in Russia. \n \n Photos: World reacts to Boris Nemtsov\'s killing Photos: World reacts to Boris Nemtsov\'s killing People follow the coffin of Russian opposition leader Boris Nemtsov during a farewell ceremony in Moscow on Tuesday, March 3.

Hecklers repeatedly booed and interrupted her speech, angry over the release of emails suggesting that the DNC tried to torpedo the Bernie Sanders campaign, reports the Hill. Wasserman Schultz has announced she'll quit at the end of the convention, but she made clear Monday that she intends to play a role in the campaign. ""You will see me every day between now and Nov. 8 on the campaign trail, and we will lock arms and we will not stand down,"" she said. Some related coverage: ""Interviews with a variety of pro- and anti-Wasserman Schultz Democrats—and there are plenty of both—suggest that the Florida House member's problems were both personal and structural, and that she retains a relatively bright future even if this chapter of her political life left much to be desired."" From the Washington Post. The idea of ousting Wasserman Schultz had been broached last fall, but President Obama didn't want the headache. So reports Politico in a story detailing her strained ties with the White House and Democratic establishment. A post at the Nation makes the case that she was too divisive to remain in the job, even if the email leak hadn't happened.

352,"['Well, Newt Gingrich seems to have wandered by the garbage can to pick up Barbour\'s draft playbook, and it\'s all unfolding as planned. He\'s getting hit for calling President Obama ""the food stamp president"" ; even David Gregory heard the racial imagery in the term, given the way Republicans have long loved to associate welfare programs with black people. Ronald Reagan famously railed against Cadillac-driving ""welfare queens"" and ""strapping young bucks"" buying ""T-bone steaks"" with food stamps; Barbour actually praised Head Start, because some of the kids in it ""would be better off sitting up on a piano bench at a whorehouse than where they are now."" I called Gingrich\'s remarks ""coded racism"" yesterday, and today right-wingers were up in arms, pointing out that most food stamp recipients are white. This is absolutely true of most welfare programs, which is why the GOP association of welfare with black people has always seemed, well, racist. \n \n It\'s beginning to look like when Haley Barbour shuffled off into the Mississippi sunset, saying he just couldn\'t commit to a 10-year presidential crusade, he left his draft campaign playbook sitting on a garbage can, and Newt Gingrich picked it up. Barbour, you\'ll recall, was trying out a new approach to race in the Obama era: Jim Crow wasn\'t ""that bad,"" the white-supremacist White Citizens Councils kept down the KKK, and nobody could make him denounce an effort by the Sons of Confederate Veterans to dedicate a license plate to KKK founder Nathan Bedford Forrest, either. ""I don\'t go around denouncing people,"" declared the man who denounced Democrat Ronnie Musgrove for efforts to remove the Confederate flag from Mississippi\'s state flag. I said at the time that Barbour was trying out the notion that post-Obama, people -- particularly white people leaning Republican -- are ready for an approach that says let\'s quit all this whining about racism, it wasn\'t that bad, it\'s time to get back to the business of cutting taxes for the rich and programs for the poor. \n \n But let me be clear: I might not have paid attention to Gingrich\'s ""food stamp president"" jibe had it not come along with a panorama of images designed to make clear Barack Obama is blackity black black. Praising right-wing Texas Gov. Rick Perry, Gingrich said he\'ll make the U.S. more like Texas, while Obama only ""knows how to get the whole country to resemble Detroit."" In the speech to Georgia Republicans where he tried out the ""food stamp president"" slur, Gingrich also told the bastion of the old Confederacy that 2012 would be the biggest election since 1860 -- you know, when Abraham Lincoln got elected and the South began to secede over slavery, commencing the Civil War. He also suggested the U.S. might need to bring back some kind of voting test, banned under the Voting Rights Act. Last year, of course, Gingrich denounced Obama\'s ""Kenyan anti-colonialist behavior,"" which made him ""outside our comprehension"" as Americans, spreading the lie that Obama inherited angry African anti-colonialism from his absent African father, though he was raised by his white mother and grandparents. Oh, and he headed the drive to label Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor ""racist"" when she was nominated in 2009. \n \n So let\'s review: Welfare slur? Check. Tie to a troubled, mainly black city? Check. Specious association with African anti-colonialism? Check. Dire reference to Lincoln and the start of the Civil War, while campaigning deep in the heart of Dixie? Check. Suggestion we need a voter test? Check. Oh, and for good measure, calling liberals concerned about racial injustice ""racist""? Check. Awesome: They\'ve hit pretty much every way the GOP has used to divide Americans by race in the last 200 years! \n \n Great job, Newt. You\'ve developed the perfect platform to run a spirited GOP campaign that attracts a cadre of aggrieved white people. You\'ll never be president of the United States, but you\'ll be the champion of the declining share of the country that still thrills to what we used to call dog-whistle politics: coded varieties of racism only understood by their intended audience. And all the efforts by Gingrich defenders to claim I\'m the racist are just funny. One of Andrew Breitbart\'s minions is leading the charge, and he lamented Monday morning on Twitter: ""Would prefer to hammer Newt today over throwing Ryan under the bus, but @joanwalsh, @davidgregory, & @ebertchicago had to go & do this."" (Roger Ebert was kind enough to Tweet my Sunday Gingrich story.) \n \n I\'d advise the Breitbart gang to get back to hammering Gingrich over Paul Ryan\'s politically suicidal budget plan; they should focus on the shard of people who want to debate whether Gingrich or Ryan is the leader who can lead their party off a cliff. Anyway, they\'ve mistaken me for someone who cares what they have to say. Gingrich is doubling down on racial politics, and I\'m going to continue to call it out when I see it. \n \n Oh, and this is one in an occasional series of pieces on folks who will never be president, which began when Sarah Palin unraveled over the Gabrielle Giffords shooting. I didn\'t get to Barbour or Mike Huckabee; they realized they would never be president all on their own. It seems silly to write the same piece on Donald Trump; it\'s like saying ""pigs will never fly."" But I\'m sure there will be a few more to come.', 'Excessive drinking cost the United States $250 billion in 2010, according to a 2015 study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The study estimated lost productivity and added health care costs associated with alcohol consumption. States report different drinking habits, as do metropolitan areas within each state. \n \n Binge drinking is defined by the CDC as consuming four or more drinks for women and five or more drinks for men during a single sitting. The organization defines heavy drinking as around 15 or more drinks consumed by men per week, and typically eight or more drinks for women. 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the metropolitan areas (MSA) reporting the highest levels of binge and heavy drinking in each state. Dubuque leads Iowa and the nation, with 30.8% of adults reporting binge or heavy drinking in the metropolitan area. Salt Lake City, where 12.6% of adults report such a drinking habit, is the booziest city in Utah. \n \n Consuming excessive amounts of alcohol is associated with a range of health problems. One in 10 deaths among U.S. adults is due to excessive drinking, according to the CDC. Researchers at the organization have found that, “excessive alcohol use is responsible for 2.5 million years of potential life lost annually, or an average of about 30 years of potential life lost for each death.” \n \n Click here to see the city with the highest alcohol consumption in each state. \n \n While the relationship between alcohol use and negative health outcomes is widely accepted, drinking is only one of the many factors that can affect the health of a population. For this reason, many of the cities with high rates of excessive alcohol consumption do not exhibit the negative consequences that might be expected to accompany binge and heavy drinking. \n \n For example, only slightly more than half of the cities with the highest rates of alcohol consumption in each state report an above average number of years of life lost due to premature death. Of the 50 cities, 35 have higher than average shares of adults self-reporting as being in good health. \n \n The data does support the expected relationship between alcohol use and another negative outcome, alcohol-related driving fatalities. Driving under the influence of alcohol has declined in recent years. In 2013, 10.9% of Americans reported driving after drinking alcohol at least once in the past year, down from 14.2% in 2002. While the trend is encouraging, cities with a higher incidence of excessive drinking nonetheless tend to have more alcohol-related driving fatalities. In 34 of the 50 metro areas reviewed, the share of alcohol-related driving deaths exceeded the national share of 31%. \n \n In the metro areas with the highest heavy or binge drinking rate in a majority of states, however, alcohol-related driving fatalities were more likely. In 34 of the 50 metro areas reviewed, the share of alcohol-related driving deaths exceeded the national share of 31%. \n \n To identify the drunkest city in each state, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the percentage of men and women who report binge or heavy drinking in each state’s metro areas. Metro level data was aggregated from county level data provided by County Health Rankings & Roadmaps, a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute joint program. Health outcomes, including the number of potential life lost per 100,000 people due to premature death annually and the percentage of adults who report fair or poor health was also aggregated from county-level data obtained from County Health Rankings & Roadmaps. All data are as of the most recent available year. \n \n These are the drunkest cities in each state. \n \n Correction: Due to a data processing error, El Paso, TX and San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, CA were identified as the metro areas with the highest rate of excessive drinking in each state, reported at 56.2% and 23.8%, respectively. In fact, the El Paso metro area’s excessive drinking rate is 17.9%. Corpus Christi, TX is the city in Texas with the highest excessive drinking rate, at 27.5%. Napa is the city in California with the highest excessive drinking rate, at 23.7%.']",2,"– Illinois police on Wednesday confirmed police officer Charles ""Joe"" Gliniewicz orchestrated a ""carefully staged suicide"" after stealing money from the Fox Lake Police Department's Explorer program over seven years. Lake County Major Crimes Task Force commander George Filenko says the probe points to ""criminal activity on the part of at least two other individuals,"" and a source tells NBC Chicago that Gliniewicz's wife, Mel, and son, DJ, are under investigation. Their names surface again in a Sun-Times report, which identifies them, via a source, as the ""Individual 1"" and ""Individual 2,"" respectively, who exchanged revealing texts with Gliniewicz. New Village Administrator Anne Marrin had been pressing Gliniewicz about the Explorer program up until the day before his death, and texts allegedly make reference to her. ""This situation right here would give her the means to crucify me if it were discovered,"" Gliniewicz wrote. When Individual 2 expressed hope that Marrin ""decides to get a couple of drinks in her and she gets a DUI,"" Gliniewicz replied, ""Trust me, I've thought it through. Many scenarios, from planting things, to the Volo bog""—the latter being local parkland, per the Sun-Times. Meanwhile, the 100 Club of Chicago, which offers money to the families of officers killed in the line of duty, has for the first time in its history asked for its $15,000 back. ""In this case it was not a line-of-duty death. That is clear,"" the charity's CEO says, per the Chicago Tribune. However, four girls who raised at least $5,000 for Gliniewicz's children say the money will still go to the intended recipients. ""None of this is the children's fault,"" a parent says."

Photograph: Fabrizio Marcuzzo \n \n Scientists in Italy say they have discovered a new species of jellyfish in the Gulf of Venice. \n \n Sightings of yellow jellyfish in the North Adriatic Sea were reported to a citizen science project last year, said Ferdinando Boero, a zoologist. \n \n ""People were saying, this jellyfish is not in your poster [of the region\'s known jellyfish], we don\'t know what it is,"" said Boero, from the University of Salento. ""They were in their thousands. Fishermen had them in their nets. They couldn\'t fish easily because there were so many jellyfish."" \n \n Scientists including Boero set about trawling records of known jellyfish species to try to identify it, but found no match. ""It\'s a new species,"" said Boero. The team decided on the name Pelagia benovici, after a late colleague, Adam Benovic. \n \n They found that it bore similarities to Pelagia noctiluca, a mauve jellyfish known for its venomous stings, which wiped out a 100,000-strong salmon farm in Northern Ireland in 2007. \n \n Could this new species pose the same kind of threat? ""We really don\'t know because there have not been so many investigations besides what it is. What it does is a completely different story,"" said Boero. ""There have to be more investigations about it."" \n \n Quite how Pelagia benovici got to the North Adriatic and within the Venice lagoon remains a mystery. Scientists think it was probably introduced to the area in the ballast water of ships. In the 1980s, Mnemiopsis leidyi, a kind of comb jellyfish known as the sea walnut, was suspected to have been introduced into the Black Sea via the ballast water of merchant ships. Its arrival caused a dramatic decline in the local fish populations. \n \n The jellyfish-spotting project is no longer receiving reports of Pelagia benovici, whose sudden appearance appears to have lasted until March. ""But jellyfish have this erratic distribution. They are present in their millions, then they disappear and then they come back,"" said Boero.']",2,"– Conjoined twins Jesus and Emanuel, born in Brazil on Monday, have two heads with two functioning brains, but just one heart. The condition, dicephalic parapagus, is extremely rare, thought to affect just one in 100,000 pregnancies—and half don’t reach full-term, the BBC reports. Doctors say Jesus and Emanuel, who also have two spinal cords, cannot be separated because they share just one set of organs. Their 25-year-old mother was expecting twins, but didn't have any ultrasounds while pregnant and learned of the condition just minutes before the boys were born, notes the Daily Mail. ""What we know statistically is that the children who undergo surgery and survive are the children who have less organs in common,"" says their doctor, adding that while one head could be removed, both brains are functioning, making such a choice a crushing one. ""What we've got to think about at this moment is to maintain the children in good condition and see how they will develop,” she says.

Study 2 replicates the effect utilizing custom-produced song excerpts holding everything constant except the lyrics. Utilizing data from Billboard’s Hot 100 singles chart from 1958–2012, Study 3 documents how more repetitive songs stand a greater chance of reaching #1 as opposed to lingering at the bottom of the chart.

Several pugs grew ill after eating it on New Year\'s Eve; one of the dogs died. \n \n As the company says in its FDA recall notice, ""Pentobarbital can affect animals that ingest it, and possibly cause side effects such as drowsiness, dizziness, excitement, loss of balance, or nausea, or in extreme cases, possibly death."" \n \n The Hunk of Beef cans in question were manufactured in June 2016; they bear lot numbers that start with 1816E03HB, 1816E04HB, 1816E06HB, 1816E07HB, and 1816E13HB and have an expiration date of June 2020. And although the cans that prompted concerns were all sold in Washington state, the company says the voluntary recall covers all Hunk of Beef cans that were produced in the same week. \n \n Based in Wheeling, Ill., Evanger\'s says this is the company\'s first recall in its 82 years of operation. And while its meat suppliers are all approved by the USDA, the company says, it has cut ties to the supplier of meat used in the recalled products. \n \n ""We feel that we have been let down by our supplier, and in reference to the possible presence of pentobarbital, we have let down our customers,"" Evanger\'s says. ""Despite having a relationship for forty years with the supplier of this specific beef, who also services many other pet food companies, we have terminated our relationship with them and will no longer purchase their beef for use in our Hunk of Beef product."" \n \n Evanger\'s first learned of the incident in Washington state when the pet\'s grieving owner posted an image to Instagram. The company then offered to pay the veterinary bills incurred by the family whose dogs were ill — but it wasn\'t until weeks later, Evanger\'s says, that it learned of the possible pentobarbital contamination. \n \n ""This beef supplier provides us with beef chunks from cows that are slaughtered in a USDA facility. We continue to investigate how this substance entered our raw material supply,"" the pet food maker says. \n \n The incident also brought out the worst in some online commenters, forcing the family-owned company to ask for more civility, even as it extended its sympathies to Nikki Mael and her family over their pet\'s death: \n \n ""Our hearts go out to the Mael family for this difficult time, as well as because unkind things have been posted on social media that have needlessly been [directed] at both of our families as a result of these claims. We ask that the public discontinue any and all threats and harsh words to either party, as this has been a hard time for everyone involved."" \n \n When the FDA studied the possible presence of pentobarbital in dog food, it was primarily investigating whether the presence of trace amounts might make the anesthetizing agent less effective in animals that are undergoing veterinary procedures. \n \n As part of that study, the FDA\'s scientists also checked pet food for signs of dog or cat DNA — looking at the possibility that a euthanized animal might have been included among the rendered meat supply for dry dog food. After the study found no trace of dog or cat DNA, the agency concluded, ""Presently, it is assumed that the pentobarbital residues are entering pet foods from euthanized, rendered cattle or even horses.""']",2,"– It's got a good beat and you can dance to it, but how is its ""processing fluency?"" The term, the Washington Post explains, is at the heart of social scientists' latest quest to explain why some songs catch on as the ""song of the summer""—or the song of any season, really—while others fade away. The concept, laid out by USC researchers in the Journal of Consumer Psychology in April, isn't complicated. In fact, just the opposite: ""Processing fluency"" is explained by the Post thusly: ""Human brains get really jazzed about things that are easy to grasp."" And in the case of hit songs, that translates into repeating simple words over and over and over. “Tempo does not appear to matter,” say the researchers, who pored over Billboard hits going back to 1958. ""While every artist strives to create a catchy hook, they may also consider striving to write a coherent song in which the chorus is repeated frequently while utilizing a limited vocabulary.” Witness current summer hit ""Shut Up and Dance""—the Post counts 12 repetitions of the title. Researcher Joseph Nunes elaborates on the simple but powerful market force: ""If it's easier, it feels better. If it feels better, it tells me I like it more. If I have a positive feeling about something because it’s familiar, then I think I like it more."" They did not, however, come up with a magic number of repetitions. More is basically more, says Nunes. (Spotify, meanwhile, ranks the most popular songs for couples in a certain mood.)"

Several suspects remained in custody from Belgium to Italy and the Netherlands, picked up as part of a spree of searches carried out over the weekend. Three were charged with terror offenses though it was not explicitly clear if they were linked to any particular attack. \n \n ""The international coordination is very intense,"" Belgium\'s Foreign Office spokesman Didier Van Der Haefelt told NBC News. ""You have only to look at the recent arrests."" \n \n A man who identifies himself as Faycal Cheffou speaks in a video posted on YouTube in 2014 in which he calls himself an independent journalist. YouTube via AFP - Getty Images \n \n Only one person — Faycal Cheffou — had been charged specifically in relation to the Brussels bombings, on counts of ""terrorist murder,"" involvement in a terror group and attempted terrorist murder. \n \n However, in a surprise turnabout Belgium\'s federal prosecutor said Monday that the ""Faycal C"" had been released due to a lack of evidence. Further details were not immediately available. \n \n Cheffou was arrested Thursday night outside of the federal prosecutor’s office. \n \n Video posted in 2014 by a man who identified himself as Cheffou focused on the plight of Muslim refugees, “forgotten” by the rest of the world. \n \n A former colleague described Cheffou as an independent journalist who ""fell into"" conspiracy theories. \n \n ""He really started being paranoid,"" the former colleague, Vinz Kante, told Europe 1. \n \n Belgian media had cited police sources in saying Cheffou was the ""man in the hat"" seen in airport surveillance footage from just before the attacks. However, a new appeal issued by police Monday seeking help identifying that suspect appeared to cast doubt on the reports saying Cheffou was the man in question. \n \n Early Monday, Belgium\'s federal prosecutor announced that three people had been charged with participation in a terror group. It did not say whether the suspects — identified only as Yassine A., Mohamed B. and Aboubaker O. — had ties to any particular plot. \n \n Related: Belgian Police Issue New Appeal for \'Man in White\' \n \n That followed charges against two other people over the weekend, which prosecutors similarly did not explicitly link to any plot or the Brussels bombings. \n \n Last week’s attacks put an uncomfortable spotlight on intelligence sharing between European countries, given that at least one of the bombers had ties to the Paris terror attacks. \n \n Amidst questions over whether opportunities were missed to foil the Brussels attacks, European nations have made a show of counter-terrorism cooperation in wake of the blasts. \n \n Italian police said Sunday they had arrested an Algerian man in Salerno over his alleged involvement in producing fake documents used by terrorists in the Paris and Brussels attacks. \n \n A spokesman for the Brussels prosecutor identified the suspect as Djamal Eddine Ouali and said Belgium will request his extradition. \n \n Raids were carried out in the Netherlands overnight after a 32-year-old Frenchman was arrested in Rotterdam. \n \n French authorities requested the arrest and will be seeking the suspect’s extradition on suspicion of involvement in preparation of a terror attack. \n \n France’s Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve praised the cooperation of European partners that led to arrests in France, Brussels and the Netherlands over the past several days. \n \n One official who was less congratulatory, however, was the mayor of Brussels. He lashed out at Belgium\'s interior minister after right-wing protesters clashed with police and mourners in violent scenes at a memorial to the attack victims in Brussels. \n \n On Monday evening, Brussels paused to honor the lives lost in the attacks with an interfaith memorial. The pews of the Saints-Michel-et-Gudule Cathedral were packed for the service, during which members of the emergency services carried candles to the altar. \n \n Belgium\'s health minister said Monday that 96 people were still hospitalized and that the official death toll had risen to 35 after four victims died in the hospital. \n \n That number came after Belgian officials revised the official death toll yet again late Sunday to 31. Officials initially had said the number 31 included the dead attackers but on Sunday said 31 did not in fact include the suicide bombers. \n \n There were Belgians, Americans, Dutch, Swedes, Germans, French, Italians, Chinese and Brits among the heavy toll and three families still awaiting formal identification of their loved ones, the crisis center added. \n \n Two more Americans were confirmed dead by the State Department late Sunday, bringing the total number of U.S. citizens slain to four.

Experts say the calf was being closely monitored by marine mammal veterinarians and showed signs of stress, leading to its release. \n \n ""The successful rescue made conservation history and demonstrates that the goal of VaquitaCPR is feasible,"" said Secretary Pacchiano. ""No one has ever captured and cared for a vaquita porpoise, even for a brief period of time. This is an exciting moment and as a result, I am confident we can indeed save the vaquita marina from extinction. \n \n Experts had planned extensively for the scenario that unfolded on Wednesday and every precaution was taken to safeguard the health of the vaquita calf, which was estimated to be about six months old. \n \n ""While we were disappointed we could not keep the vaquita in human care, we have demonstrated that we are able to locate and capture a vaquita,"" said Dr. Lorenzo Rojas-Bracho, a senior scientist with SEMARNAT, CIRVA and VaquitaCPR Program Director. ""We also succeeded in transporting one and conducting health evaluations that are part of our protocols safeguarding the animals\' health."" \n \n Scientists returned the vaquita calf to the same spot in the Gulf of California where it was originally located and where other vaquitas were observed. Before releasing the vaquita, various tissue samples were taken which scientists will analyze and share with colleagues at other research institutions like the Frozen Zoo in San Diego, California which will conduct genetic sequencing. \n \n The precedent-setting rescue comes as the bold conservation plan led by the Mexican government (SEMARNAT) to save the endangered vaquita porpoise from extinction enters its second week of field operations. During the first three days, scientists spotted several vaquitas using visual search methods and acoustic monitoring. Vaquitas were repeatedly located by the VaquitaCPR \'find\' team. \n \n advertisement \n \n The vaquita porpoise, also known as the \'panda of the sea,\' is the most endangered marine mammal in the world. Latest estimates by scientists who have been monitoring the vaquita for decades show there are fewer than 30 vaquitas left in the wild. The vaquita only lives in the upper Gulf of California. \n \n Secretary Pacchiano has visited the VaquitaCPR facilities in San Felipe several times and accompanied scientists during a day of field operations on the Sea of Cortez. ""The individuals involved in this unprecedented conservation project are the best in their respective fields,"" said Secretary Pacchiano. ""I\'ve personally witnessed their dedication and incredible expertise. We\'re all committed to saving the vaquita porpoise and this is the team who can do it."" \n \n The project, which has been recommended by the International Committee for the Recovery of the Vaquita (CIRVA), involves locating, rescuing and then temporarily relocating the vaquitas to an ocean sanctuary off the coast of San Felipe. The explicit goal of CPR is to return the vaquitas to their natural habitat once the primary threat to their survival has been eliminated. Experts from all over the globe, including Mexico, the United States, Denmark, the Netherlands, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom are all working together on VaquitaCPR. \n \n advertisement \n \n VaquitaCPR field operations, including efforts to locate and bring vaquitas into temporary sea pens, began on October 12 and are expected to continue for several weeks. Windy conditions prevented VaquitaCPR field operations from taking place at sea for three days. When there are sustained winds of more than about eight knots, conditions on the water are too choppy for scientists to visually locate vaquitas. It also could risk the safety of vaquitas during the capture operation. \n \n ""We\'ve unfortunately been at the mercy of the weather and were in the position of \'waiting on the wind\' for several days,"" said Dr. Cynthia Smith, VaquitaCRP Program Manager. ""However, the time hasn\'t been wasted, as there has been a tremendous amount of productive discussion at all hours of the day as we continue to refine the process of rescuing the animals. Now that we\'re back on the water and conditions are better, the entire team is optimistic and working together seamlessly to support the mission."" \n \n In an unprecedented move in April of 2015 that demonstrated Mexico\'s commitment to conservation, President Peña Nieto announced a two-year gillnet ban throughout the vaquitas\' range, compensated fishermen and related industries for their loss of income, and enhanced multi-agency enforcement of the ban led by the Mexican Navy. \n \n In June of 2017, the ban on gillnet fishing was made permanent. The government also launched an extensive survey of the vaquita population using an approach that included both visual monitoring and advanced techniques that use sound to locate the animals. All told, the Mexican government has committed more than $100 million in an effort to protect the vaquita and support the local fishing community. \n \n A crucial part of CPR is the acoustic monitoring system that will help to locate the remaining vaquitas. This monitoring has been supported since 2012 by WWF and operated by the National Institute of Ecology and Climate Change of Mexico (INECC) to help estimate the vaquita\'s population, and will continue during the CPR operations. WWF will also continue supporting the retrieval of lost or abandoned ""ghost"" nets, many of them illegal, which drift aimlessly and continue to entangle and kill vaquitas and other marine species.

The New York Times is using phrases such as ""enormous blunder"" and ""stunning setback"" to describe the development. Police had charged Faycal Cheffou with terrorism after a cabdriver identified him from a photo as the third man he drove to the airport the morning of the attacks, along with two suicide bombers. ""The evidence that had led to the arrest of the man named Faycal C. was not confirmed by the evolution of the ongoing investigation,"" says a spokesman for the Belgian federal prosecutor.

356,"['No Ant Left Behind: Warrior Ants Carry Injured Comrades Home \n \n Enlarge this image toggle caption Frank et al./Science Advances Frank et al./Science Advances \n \n Leave no man behind. That\'s an old idea in warfare — it\'s even part of the Soldier\'s Creed that Army recruits learn in basic training. \n \n And never leaving a fallen comrade is also the rule for some warriors who are ants, according to a report published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances. \n \n These ants, Megaponera analis, hunt and eat termites. Scouts will go out, find a group of termites, and then return to the ant nest to muster the troops. \n \n Biologist Erik Frank explains that 200 to 500 ants will march out in formation. ""Like three ants next to each other, in a 2-meter-long column,"" he says. ""It\'s very peculiar and it looks like a long snake walking on the ground."" \n \n When the termites spot this invading army, they try to escape, but the fighting is fierce. \n \n ""And after roughly 20 minutes the battle is over,"" says Frank, a doctoral student with the University of Würzburg in Germany who is researching animal behavior and evolution. ""You have a lot of termites lying dead on the ground,"" he says, ""and the ants start collecting the termites to return."" \n \n A few years ago, Frank was working at a field station in the Ivory Coast when he noticed that some of the ants marching home after battle weren\'t carrying termites. Instead, they were carrying other ants. \n \n ""And I was wondering, \'What exactly was going on there? Why were they carrying some of the ants?\'"" he recalls. \n \n It turns out, those transported ants weren\'t dead — they were injured. \n \n Ants sometimes lose a leg or two, which makes it hard for them to walk. Or, they can be weighed down by a dead termite whose jaws had clamped onto them. Either way, they\'re slower than uninjured, unburdened ants. \n \n By marking these injured ants with paint, Frank learned that in nearly all cases, they made a full recovery after being carried home to recuperate. They learn to walk with fewer legs, and their ant buddies apparently will pull off stuck termites. It doesn\'t take long for an ant that\'s been hurt to once again be ready for action. \n \n Ant Rescue An injured ant (circled in red) that\'s missing two legs is carried back by nestmates during the return journey from a termite raid. \n \n ""We saw them again, participating in hunts the next day,"" says Frank. \n \n He and his colleagues did some experiments to see what would happen to injured ants that weren\'t carried home. It turns out that these poor ants couldn\'t march fast enough. So they fell behind — and frequently got eaten by spiders and other predators, the researchers report. \n \n It\'s not so far-fetched, says Frank, to compare these ant rescue missions to those performed by human soldiers. \n \n ""One big difference I would say, though, is that these ants are not doing it out of the goodness of their heart,"" says Frank. \n \n He says they\'re just responding to a chemical signal from the injured ants, rather than being motivated by empathy. \n \n Peggy Mason, a neurobiologist at the University of Chicago who has studied how rats will rescue other rats from traps, says this is a great study that confirms that ants will rescue each other in certain situations. \n \n ""Does it remind me of mammalian helping? Well, not really,"" she says, noting that the ants don\'t seem to be intentionally helping each other. \n \n ""One reason why one might think that they\'re not is that if they encounter that same injured ant on the way to the hunt, they ignore it,"" Mason says. Wounded ants only get carried home if they\'re encountered after the battle. \n \n Rats, in contrast, seem to have some sort of emotional response that triggers helping. Mason and her colleagues have found that giving rats an anti-anxiety drug seemed to take away their urge to release a distressed rat from a trap. \n \n ""None of them helped,"" she says. ""They didn\'t help. They didn\'t see a problem."" \n \n It\'s clear that bringing injured warriors home has huge benefits for the ant colony. \n \n ""The number of ants that are saved by this behavior is about equivalent to the number of ants that are born each day in that colony."" Mason says. ""So they\'re making this substantial contribution to the ant colony through this rescue behavior. That\'s probably what drove this behavior to be selected for, and to evolve into a stable behavior."" \n \n After all, she notes, ""this is an army. They\'re going off to attack the termites. It\'s a battle. And the more numerous you are, the more successful you are.""', 'Play Facebook \n \n Twitter \n \n Embed Harrison Ford Involved in Incident With Passenger Plane at Calif.

His plane passed over the top of an American Airlines 737 carrying 110 passengers and a six-person crew. \n \n Harrison Ford at the European Premiere of \'Star Wars, The Force Awakens,\' in London in 2014.

The observation came about when biologist Erik Frank was watching army ants march out to battle termites in highly patterned formation—""like three ants next to each other, in a 2-meter-long column,"" he tells NPR—and he noticed some of the ants returned carrying other ants. Those ants, it turns out, weren't dead but injured, missing a leg or two or weighed down by a dead termite whose jaws were clamped onto them. ""This [is] behavior you don’t expect to see in ants; you always imagine an individual ant as having no value for the colony and that they sacrifice themselves for the good of the colony,"" says Frank. What's more, 95% survived, and many returned to battle the very next day. So Frank and colleagues at the University of Würzburg in Germany began to study this behavior more closely, and learned that one difference between soldiers on a battlefield and ants is ""these ants are not doing it out of the goodness of their heart,"" he says, but rather in response to the chemical signals sent off by their injured comrades. Reporting in the journal Science Advances, they note that the behavior does not occur on the way to battle, and not when injured ants are from outside colonies. There's another matter of practicality: They calculate that a colony size is 29% larger when ants carry back their injured than when they don't. Outside researchers agree this is a form of natural selection. ""This is an army,"" one says. ""They're going off to attack the termites. It's a battle. And the more numerous you are, the more successful you are."" (Ants were farmers well before humans.)"

If that’s the case, Malala Yousafzai is arguably one of the best weapons against Islamist fundamentalism. \n \n Two years ago, in October 2012, a Taliban gunman shot the then-15-year-old Pakistani girl in the face as a show of the fundamentalists’ opposition to her efforts to promote schooling for girls.

(Associated Press) \n \n In this image released by the White House, President Barack Obama meets with his national security team to discuss Afghanistan in Situation Room of the White House in Washington, Tuesday, Nov. 11, 2009.... (Associated Press) \n \n President Barack Obama won\'t accept any of the Afghanistan war options before him without changes, a senior administration official said, as concerns soar over the ability of the Afghan government to secure its own country one day. \n \n Obama\'s stance comes as his own ambassador in Afghanistan, Karl Eikenberry, is voicing strong dissent about a U.S. troop increase, according to a second administration official. \n \n Eikenberry\'s misgivings center on a concern that bolstering the American presence in Afghanistan could make the country more reliant on the U.S., not less. He expressed them in forcefully worded cables to Washington just ahead of Obama\'s latest war meeting Wednesday. \n \n The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss administration deliberations. \n \n The developments underscore U.S. skepticism about the leadership of Afghan President Hamid Karzai, whose government has been dogged by corruption. The emerging administration message is that Obama will not do anything to lock in an open-ended U.S. commitment. \n \n U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said Thursday that she is concerned about Afghanistan\'s ""corruption, lack of transparency, poor governance (and) absence of the rule of law."" \n \n ""We\'re looking to President Karzai as he forms a new government to take action that will demonstrate _ not just to the international community but first and foremost to his own people _ that his second term will respond the needs that are so manifest,"" Clinton said during a news conference in Manila with Philippine Foreign Secretary Alberto Romulo. \n \n Obama is still expected to send in more troops to bolster a deteriorating war effort. \n \n He remains close to announcing his revamped war strategy _ troops are just one component _ and probably will do so shortly after he returns from a trip to Asia that ends Nov. 19. \n \n Yet in Wednesday\'s pivotal war council meeting, Obama wasn\'t satisfied with any of the Afghanistan war options presented by his national security team, one official said. \n \n The president instead pushed for revisions to clarify how and when U.S. troops would turn over responsibility to the Afghan government. In turn, that could change the dynamic of both how many additional troops are sent to Afghanistan and what the timeline would be for their presence in the war zone, according to the official. \n \n Military officials said Obama has asked for a rewrite before and resisted what one official called a one-way highway toward war commander Gen. Stanley McChrystal\'s recommendations for more troops. The sense that he was being rushed and railroaded has stiffened Obama\'s resolve to seek information and options beyond military planning, officials said, though a substantial troop increase is still likely. \n \n The president is considering options that include adding 30,000 or more U.S. forces to take on the Taliban in key areas of Afghanistan and to buy time for the Afghan government\'s small and ill-equipped fighting forces to take over. The other three options on the table are ranges of troop increases, from a relatively small addition of forces to the roughly 40,000 that McChrystal prefers, according to military and other officials. \n \n The war is now in its ninth year and is claiming U.S. lives at a record pace as military leaders say the Taliban has the upper hand in many parts of the country. \n \n Eikenberry, the top U.S. envoy to Kabul and a former commander of U.S. troops in Afghanistan, is a prominent voice among those advising Obama, and his sharp dissent is sure to affect the equation. \n \n The options given to Obama will now be altered, although not overhauled. \n \n Military officials say one approach is a compromise battle plan that would add 30,000 or more U.S. forces atop a record 68,000 in the country now. They described it as ""half and half,"" meaning half fighting and half training and holding ground so the Afghans can regroup. \n \n ""The government of Afghanistan has to accept greater responsibility for its own defense,"" Clinton said Thursday. She had no comment on the Eikenberry memos. \n \n The White House says Obama has not made a final choice, though military and other officials have said he appears near to approving a slightly smaller increase than McChrystal wants at the outset. \n \n Among the options for Obama would be ways to phase in additional troops, perhaps eventually equaling McChrystal\'s full request, based on security or other conditions in Afghanistan and troop levels by U.S. allies there. \n \n The White House has chafed under criticism from Republicans and some outside critics that Obama is dragging his feet to make a decision. \n \n Obama\'s top military advisers have said they are comfortable with the pace of the process, and senior military officials have pointed out that the president still has time since no additional forces could begin flowing into Afghanistan until early next year. \n \n Under the scenario featuring about 30,000 more troops, that number most likely would be assembled from three Army brigades and a Marine Corps contingent, plus a new headquarters operation that would be staffed by 7,000 or more troops, a senior military official said. There would be a heavy emphasis on the training of Afghan forces, and the reinforcements Obama sends could include thousands of U.S. military trainers. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writers Matthew Lee in Manila, Philippines, and Pamela Hess in Washington contributed to this report.', 'President Barack Obama expressed fresh doubts about the credibility of Afghanistan\'s government in high-level discussions Wednesday over what troops to send there, after his ambassador to Kabul warned against any reinforcements until the Afghan regime cracks down on corruption. \n \n U.S. Ambassador Karl Eikenberry sent two classified cables to Washington in recent days raising serious concerns about the military\'s recommendation to increase troop levels, according to three U.S. officials. Mr. Eikenberry criticized Afghan President Hamid Karzai\'s recent behavior as well as corruption in the top ranks of his administration, according to an official who saw the memos. Mr. Karzai has in recent interviews lashed out at the U.S. and blamed corruption on international organizations working in his country. \n \n View Full Image Getty Images President Barack Obama speaks while flanked by Afghan President Hamid Karzai at the White House in May. \n \n In Wednesday\'s meeting, which Mr. Eikenberry attended via videoconference, Mr. Obama discussed options for adding troops for nearly 2½ hours. Two of the options were previously proposed by his top commander in Afghanistan, Gen. Stanley McChrystal. A new ""hybrid"" option has recently gained momentum at the Pentagon, combining significant numbers of troops with trainers to improve Afghan forces\' capability to secure the country themselves. \n \n A White House official said Mr. Obama made requests that could lead to significantly altering any or all of the choices, changing the number of troops involved and the length of their deployment. The official said Mr. Obama asked for specific timelines in each scenario for when U.S. troops would turn over security to Afghan forces. In the past, senior military officials have resisted such timelines. \n \n The key points of contention, the official added, were the timelines and questions about the credibility of the Karzai government -- both issues raised by Mr. Eikenberry in his cables and elsewhere. The ambassador has warned that an increased U.S. presence could take pressure off the Afghan government to take over security. The cables were first reported by the Washington Post on its Web site. \n \n Mr. Eikenberry is a retired three-star general who commanded U.S. forces in Afghanistan from 2005 to 2007, so his views on troop levels are likely to carry weight. But Mr. Eikenberry is known to have a prickly relationship with Mr. Karzai dating back to that period, and earlier this year that forced Sen. John Kerry to become the U.S. go-between with the Afghan president. \n \n Wednesday\'s meeting was the last of several of Mr. Obama\'s war council before he leaves for a trip through Asia; some officials have said he aims to make a decision soon after he gets back Nov. 19, though deliberations could continue into next month. Other administration officials have begun to fan out to get feedback from allies: According to officials familiar with the effort, James Jones, the White House national security adviser, is expected to visit Pakistan this week to discuss U.S. deliberations over troop levels. Mr. Eikenberry\'s concerns come late in the process, and it is unclear how they will ultimately affect Mr. Obama\'s decision making. \n \n Defense Secretary Robert Gates recently has supported the ""hybrid"" plan -- sending 30,000 to 35,000 troops including up to 10,000 trainers -- and has emerged as the key adviser within the administration. \n \n According to a military official, senior officers at the Pentagon, including Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, continue to back a recommendation by Gen. McChrystal, the U.S. commander in Afghanistan, to send more than 40,000 troops. But they are increasingly throwing their weight behind the compromise plan as a way to get Gen. McChrystal most of what he needs. \n \n Many of Mr. Eikenberry\'s concerns about Mr. Karzai have been raised by others involved in the White House deliberations, including by Mr. Obama. \n \n Administration officials have pushed hard to get Mr. Karzai to come up with a checklist of ""deliverables"" that would illustrate he is cracking down on corruption after his Nov. 19 inauguration. \n \n According to a senior administration official familiar with the efforts, they have included a push for the Afghan president to fill top cabinet positions with competent technocrats -- rather than rewarding warlords who backed Mr. Karzai\'s re-election, such as Uzbek strongman Abdul Rashid Dostum. \n \n ""The president believes that we need to make clear to the Afghan government that our commitment is not open-ended,"" said a White House official briefed on Wednesday\'s meeting. ""Governance in Afghanistan must improve in a reasonable period of time to ensure a successful transition to our Afghan partner."" \n \n —Jay Solomon, Alan Cullison and Siobhan Gorman contributed to this article. \n \n Write to Peter Spiegel at peter.spiegel@wsj.com \n \n Printed in The Wall Street Journal, page A4']",2,"– President Obama refused to accept any of the Afghanistan war options presented to him in yesterday's 2 1/2 hour strategy meeting, the AP reports, as concerns soar over the leadership of Afghan President Hamid Karzai and the ability of a corrupt Afghan government to eventually secure its own country. Obama asked for modified choices, including different troop counts and length of deployments, and for specific timelines in each scenario for turning over control to Afghan forces, the Wall Street Journal reports. Obama's call for more options comes as his own ambassador in Afghanistan, Karl Eikenberry, voiced strong misgivings about a US troop increase, centered on a concern that bolstering the American presence in Afghanistan could make the country more reliant on the US, not less. While Obama is expected to send in more troops, the message yesterday seemed to be that won't accept an open-ended US commitment."

He also noted at the very beginning of his presentation—presumably to warm up the audience—that we pretty much have two options as a society. \n \n “I don’t have an immediate doomsday prophecy,” he said at the beginning of the talk.

363,"['News Release \n \n April is Alcohol Awareness Month — a time to raise awareness about the health and social problems caused by excessive drinking. Alcohol Awareness Month also offers people the opportunity to evaluate their own drinking and determine if they need to change their habits. \n \n Most people have a general sense of the negative impact of high-risk drinking, but may not realize how widespread and extensive the consequences are. Each year, nearly 80,000 people die from alcohol-related causes, making it the third leading preventable cause of death in the United States. Alcohol problems cost the U.S. $225 billion each year, primarily from lost productivity, but also from health care and property damage costs. These issues affect every American, regardless of whether they drink or not. \n \n Most adults who drink do so responsibly with no harm to their health. In fact, for some people, drinking moderately is associated with a variety of potential health benefits including a decreased risk of coronary artery disease, heart attacks, and certain types of strokes. \n \n Nevertheless, more than 30 percent of U.S. adults will meet the criteria for an alcohol use disorder at some point during their lives. The term “alcohol use disorder” includes both alcoholism and harmful drinking that has not reached the level of dependence. \n \n Alcohol-related problems — which result from drinking too much, too fast, or too often — are among the most significant public health issues in the United States. \n \n An estimated 18 million Americans have an alcohol use disorder. \n \n One in four children grows up in a home with an adult who has a problem with alcohol, and \n \n Only one in four people with alcoholism ever receives treatment, which increases the likelihood of long-term recovery. \n \n Globally, alcohol is the third leading risk factor for premature death and disability. \n \n The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) is dedicated to understanding why some people develop alcohol use disorders and how we can improve prevention, treatment, and recovery programs for these individuals. \n \n NIAAA recommends that Americans use Alcohol Awareness Month, which the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence, Inc. (NCADD) has sponsored since 1987, as an opportunity to evaluate their own drinking. The NIAAA website offers the public: \n \n Information on recommended drinking limits \n \n An interactive tool so individuals can self-assess their drinking patterns and determine whether they could benefit from a change \n \n If you find that you’re drinking outside the recommended limits, cutting back or quitting can have significant health benefits. By reducing high-risk drinking, you decrease your risk of injuries, liver and heart disease, sleep disorders, depression, stroke, sexually transmitted diseases, and several types of cancers. \n \n More Resources: \n \n www.niaaa.nih.gov \n \n www.rethinkingdrinking.niaaa.nih.gov \n \n SAMHSA Treatment Locator: http://findtreatment.samhsa.gov', ""If Bernanke wants us to invest in structures, business equipment, and autombiles, what he needs is what they call a Tigger strategy—just say we're climbing out of a steep hole so rates will stay low for the next 18 months come what may.

Chicago Federal Reserve Chairman Charles Evans and some of his colleagues offered a more formal treatment of this idea and a somewhat more restrained version of the Tigger strategy (complete with a more digified Greek name) last week, and I hope Bernanke and the main Fed staff in D.C. are thinking that over carefully.""]",2,"– Trying to beat addiction through a faith-based 12-step program—Alcoholics Anonymous being the best known of the bunch—typically means you can never take a sip of alcohol again. But Gabrielle Glaser writes for the Atlantic that AA was founded 80 years ago, ""when knowledge of the brain was in its infancy."" It and programs like it present an antiquated model of dealing with addiction, she writes, going on to argue that most addiction counselors today aren't qualified to help those most in need, and that there are alternatives. ""Nowhere in the field of medicine is treatment less grounded in modern science,"" she writes, pointing out that despite the 75% success rate claimed for AA members who ""really tried"" in the group's 12-step bible, the ""Big Book,"" there's ""no conclusive data"" the program actually works. (A retired Harvard professor who's studied AA retention rates puts that number closer to 5% to 8%, she notes.) One of the top methods she thinks we should consider for the estimated 18 million people with alcohol-use disorder, especially now that treating it is mandated for insurers under ObamaCare: medication, especially naltrexone, one of the three FDA-approved drugs that's currently available. A couple other nuggets of note: The AA 12-step model is so ingrained that abstinence—not moderation—is recommended for all, and only after a drinker has ""hit bottom."" ""Researchers I've talked with say that's akin to offering antidepressants only to those who have attempted suicide, or prescribing insulin only after a patient has lapsed into a diabetic coma,"" she writes. Regarding the use of drugs to treat alcoholism, Glaser notes a widespread resistance that's still strong. A psychologist she interviewed who used to speak about using naltrexone to curb cravings at medical conferences said ""the reaction was always 'How can you be giving alcoholics drugs?' They'd look at me like I was promoting Valley of the Dolls 2.0."" Read Glaser's complete take, which includes her own experiment with naltrexone, at the Atlantic."

(Irfan Khan, Los Angeles Times / ) \n \n The homeless woman was a familiar presence at the corner of Van Nuys Boulevard and Sherman Way. Employees at the nearby businesses knew her routine, if not her name. \n \n Mornings, she bought a pack of Grand Prix cigarettes — always with exact change — at the United Oil gas station. Nights, she curled up on a bus bench outside the 24-hour Walgreens and tried to fall asleep. \n \n The stop on line 761 has three seats, some graffiti and a gold-and-turquoise advertisement for a maker of eyeglasses. It could not have made for a comfortable bed. \n \n That\'s where police found the woman about 1 a.m. Thursday, doused in a flammable liquid and set ablaze. She was whisked to a hospital, where she remains in critical condition. The seemingly random attack shocked even LAPD veterans, who said they were trying to make sense of it. \n \n LAPD Deputy Chief Kirk Albanese said it was unclear whether the suspect, Dennis Petillo, 24, even talked to the woman before he allegedly set her ablaze. \n \n ""There was no incident or dispute or clear motivation for this horrific attack. He did not know his victim. It defies explanation,"" Albanese said. ""He is not of sound mind.... The motive is mental illness."" \n \n Police have not released the victim\'s name, but area residents said she is Flo Parker. She was also known as Violet: a 5-foot-tall woman in her 60s with dirty blond hair and a time-worn face. \n \n But for much of Thursday, her identity was secondary. Violet had become a symbol to some residents of both the dangers that face the homeless and the depths of human cruelty. \n \n ""This is a hate crime as far as I\'m concerned. All this woman did was try to sit out here and get warm,"" said Barbara Weiss, 57, who works for a company that provides transportation to the handicapped. \n \n Had she seen Violet before? \n \n ""I probably have,"" she said. ""I just don\'t know."" \n \n Witness Erickson Ipina told reporters that he watched in horror as the attack unfolded in Thursday\'s wee hours. A man walked out of the Walgreens with what appeared to be rubbing alcohol, he said. \n \n ""He just poured it all over the old lady,"" Ipina said. ""Then he threw the match on her and started running."" \n \n Ipina said he gave chase. ""Hey, stop right there!"" he yelled. ""Stop right there!"" But the man kept running. \n \n ""I pulled out my cellphone and called 911, and then he just turned back on me and pulled out a knife,"" said Ipina, whose account was confirmed by the LAPD. \n \n Police arrested Petillo on suspicion of attempted murder. Since 2008, he has pleaded guilty twice to charges related to vehicle theft. The second time, he was sentenced to two years in prison. \n \n The homeless face a number of perils, which is why many use a sort of buddy system, said Marcus Butler, associate director of security at the Midnight Mission, which provides services on skid row. But most of the crimes they face are predatory, such as one man trying to swipe another\'s disability check. \n \n Violent crimes, particularly between strangers, are rare, Butler said.

366,"['Minister says company’s practices to be examined after livestock exported from Perth die from heat \n \n The Australian agriculture minister, David Littleproud, has launched an urgent investigation in the department of agriculture over livestock deaths on a live export ship, saying conditions on the ship were “bullshit.” \n \n About 2,400 sheep died on an Emanuel Exports ship from Fremantle to the Middle East in August 2017, mostly from heat stress. A whistleblower filmed conditions on the ship and provided the footage to Animals Australia, which showed it to Littleproud on Wednesday. \n \n He said the footage showed dead and decaying sheep. \n \n “I saw footage provided to me by Animals Australia, which is very disturbing,” Littleproud said. “I am shocked and gutted. \n \n “This is the livelihood of Australian farmers that are on that ship ... This is their pride and joy and this is total bullshit that what I saw has taken place.” \n \n The ship left Fremantle on 1 August carrying 63,804 sheep bound for Qatar, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates. It was subject to the standard investigation by the federal environment department because the number of sheep killed by heat stress pushed the mortality rate to 3.76%. \n \n All live export shipments with mortality rates of more than 2% are subject to review. \n \n Littleproud said he had already demanded an explanation from the department after receiving the report into this incident on 29 March, before being made aware of the Animals Australia footage. \n \n “There was an unacceptable fatality rate because of a heat event,” he said. “I asked for further information. I also wrote to the live export industry.” \n \n In a statement on Thursday, Littleproud said he had an urgent meeting with the department since viewing the footage and thanked Animals Australia – an organisation that has previously been in conflict with federal agriculture ministers – for sharing the footage. \n \n “I’m shocked and deeply disturbed by the vision,” the statement said. “I thank Animals Australia for bringing this to my attention. \n \n “We need to create an environment where groups, whistleblowers and individuals are comfortable and confident coming forward so we can nail those who do the wrong thing.” \n \n It is not the first time Emanuel has suffered a mass mortality event due to heat stress on one of its live export ship, which is a converted car carrier. \n \n While the shipment detailed in this incident was on route last year, the Perth-based exporters were warned of possible prosecution over a shipment in July 2016 on which 3,027 of the 69,322 sheep onboard died, leaving a mortality rate of 4.36%. \n \n WA seeks powers to prosecute live exporters after 3,000 sheep die on ship Read more \n \n A report on that shipment said there were so many dead sheep that it was difficult to manage the bodies. \n \n According to the department’s mortality investigation into the August 2017 shipment, temperatures in the gulf reached 36C with 95% humidity overnight, noting that under those conditions “large number of animals will start to die.” \n \n It said that Emanuel rostered on extra crew to “undertake additional housekeeping” and keep water troughs full. They also opened “excessively boggy pens and those in hotter areas” to allow sheep to spread into the alleyways. \n \n “These actions however, were insufficient to prevent the reportable mortality incident,” it said. \n \n The department said it required Emanuel to follow a heat stress management plan for their next shipment, which took place in September and had a mortality rate of 0.52%. \n \n The department said in 2017 that it would review its heat stress policies in time for the 2018 Middle Eastern summer. \n \n Littleproud said he had demanded an update of that review. \n \n “I will not be afraid to call out and take strong action against those who have not fulfilled their responsibilities, whether they be the exporter, the regulator or staff on ships,” he said. “I support the farmers who rely on live export and the exporters who do the right thing … Farmers care for their animals and they’ll be angry and hurt when they see this footage.” \n \n Animals Australia said they had contacted Littleproud on behalf of the whistleblower, who had provided the footage to 60 Minutes. \n \n “This announcement by the minister speaks to the seriousness of this situation and the strength of the evidence provided to the Government,” a spokeswoman for Animals Australia said.', 'Live exports: Maritime officials block shipment of 65,000 sheep to the Middle East \n \n Updated \n \n A scandal-plagued live export ship slated to take 65,000 sheep to the Middle East has failed to satisfy an inspection and must provide evidence of improvements before maritime officials will allow it to set sail with livestock on board. \n \n Key points: Sheep were to be sent to Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Oman and Qatar in the coming days \n \n The inspected ship was linked to 2,400 sheep deaths during a voyage last August \n \n Industry says it will take steps to strengthen accountability and reduce risks \n \n The concerns relate to airflow in pens where sheep will travel. \n \n Inspectors from the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) spent hours inspecting the Awassi Express after it docked in Fremantle, Western Australia, on Sunday. \n \n ""AMSA has advised the master and ship operator that they will have to arrange a third party air flow verification report to prove compliance with air flow standards before an Australian Certificate for the Carriage of Livestock can be issued,"" an AMSA statement reads. \n \n To carry livestock, a ship must have a certificate for the carriage of livestock. \n \n The inspected ship, used by Emanuel Exports, is the same vessel linked to 2,400 sheep deaths during a voyage to the Middle East last August. \n \n The Department of Agriculture investigated that incident but scandal erupted after footage of the sheep surfaced, reportedly showing livestock being mistreated. \n \n The vision, broadcast on Channel Nine on Sunday night, showed hundreds of sheep crowded into a small space, workers throwing dead sheep overboard, and faeces-covered pens where animals stood panting or collapsed on the ground. \n \n It remains unclear what will happen to the sheep and 250 cattle Emanuel Exports plans to send to Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Oman and Qatar in the coming days. \n \n Emanuel Exports was also responsible for a July 2016 consignment, in which an estimated 3,000 sheep died from heat stress during a voyage to the Middle East. \n \n Animal welfare checks needed before ship can set sail \n \n Emanuel Exports director Nicholas Daws apologised to farmers after the footage was broadcast. \n \n ""Animal welfare failures resulting in high mortalities, like the footage we\'ve seen from the August 2017 Awassi Express shipment, in which 2,400 sheep died, are heartbreaking for our company and the producers whose livestock we export,"" he said in a statement. \n \n Mr Daws said his company had made changes since that shipment and would implement the additional welfare requirements the Department of Agriculture has requested for the shipment due to leave this week. \n \n ""These conditions include a 17.5 per cent reduction in loading volumes compared to regulatory standards and the presence of a Federal Government observer on the voyage [in addition to an Australian Government Accredited Veterinarian] as required for all voyages to the Arabian Gulf,"" he said. \n \n ""We have also agreed to employ extra accredited stockpersons for the shipment and to adjust the voyage schedule so that Kuwait will now be the first port of discharge, ahead of Qatar. \n \n ""The ship is due to unload approximately 24,000 sheep in Kuwait approximately 14 days after its departure from Fremantle, and will then discharge the remaining 33,000 sheep in Qatar approximately three days later."" \n \n Separate to the AMSA inspection on Sunday, the Department of Agriculture also imposed special conditions Emanuel Exports needed to meet in order for the next shipment to proceed. \n \n Those conditions include the company guaranteeing the sheep would have access to feed, water and appropriate ventilation and are loaded at a stocking density below industry standards. \n \n Emanuel Exports would also need to prove to officials that there will be sufficient number of vets on board, trained animal handling staff and regular cleaning of decks. \n \n The Department of Agriculture is also insisting that an independent observer will travel with the sheep and provide daily reports, including photos, so officials can monitor the shipment from Australia. \n \n Along with AMSA approval, the shipment needs approval from the head of the Department of Agriculture for it to set sail. \n \n After the August 2017 incident was revealed last week, Emanuel Exports\' Graham Daws said the incident had prompted the company to change its protocols. \n \n Agriculture Minister David Littleproud, who viewed the footage last week, said he would be meeting with animal advocates and members of the live export industry on Monday. \n \n ""There\'s no point complaining about the footage. The footage wouldn\'t exist if the conditions on the boat were good for those sheep,"" he said in a statement. \n \n ALEC determined not to let farmers down \n \n Mr Littleproud said those who do the wrong thing should be ""nailed, not slapped on the wrist"" and ruled out a ban on the industry. \n \n ""The live export trade is important for our farmers,"" he said. \n \n ""I will support live exporters who do the right thing."" \n \n The Australian Livestock Exporters\' Council (ALEC) said they would take steps to strengthen accountability and reduce risks to animals during exporting. \n \n Our best stories in your inbox?

The New York Times reports the country's 60 Minutes on Sunday broadcast footage shot by a whistleblower in August 2017 on a ship laden with sheep that was sailing from Western Australia to Doha, Qatar. The voyage is common: Roughly 1.4 million sheep are sent around the globe via boat from Western Australia annually. But in this case, more than 2,400 of the 65,000 animals aboard didn't make it, having succumbed to heat stress. The Times' report describes ""rotting corpses"" being thrown into the sea and ""images of sheep dying in their own feces."" The Guardian reports Australia's Department of Agriculture investigated at the time and noted the temperatures in the Persian Gulf had hit about 96 degrees with 95% humidity overnight—perilous conditions for animals. The department found that Emanuel Exports switched to heavier staffing to help with water distribution and opened ""excessively boggy pens and those in hotter areas,"" but the steps taken were ""insufficient."" It was the publication of the footage months later that spurred outrage. The government has vowed to investigate, and the ship the animals sailed on was on Sunday barred from leaving with another 65,000 sheep due to airflow concerns, reports Australia's ABC. Critics, including one lawmaker who referred to the vessels as ""death ships,"" want real change—a ban on live exports during summer months, perhaps, or a shift to more onshore butchering. One farmer tells the Times that doesn't work for him, citing a lack of slaughterhouse facilities and his own need to export. ""I would go broke."""

To wit: A Saudi scholar has issued a ruling warning against the pilfering of WiFi, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. ""Taking advantage of the WiFi service illegally or without the knowledge of other beneficiaries or providers is not allowed,"" was the stern mandate of Ali Al Hakami, a member of the Islamic religious council that advises the Saudi king. He clarified that public WiFi, such as that found in parks, hotels, and shopping malls, is A-OK to access. Gulf News points out that this most recent ruling aligns with one issued in April by Dubai's Department of Islamic Affairs and Charitable Activities after a reader on its website asked if it was OK to tap into a neighbor's WiFi. ""There is nothing wrong in using the line if your neighbors allow you to do so, but if [they] don't allow you, you may not use it,"" the department advised. Not that this is the first odd fatwa to be proclaimed: RT.com notes rulings have also come down from on high prohibiting emoji, women sitting in chairs, and travel to Mars.

(AP) - A ""hellstorm"" of flames apparently enveloped a vehicle that crashed while carrying firefighters battling a blaze in Washington state, killing three of them during an explosive fire season in the arid West. \n \n \n \n Four other firefighters were hurt, including one critically, on Wednesday as crews fought raging wildfires advancing on towns in the north-central part of the state, some of the many blazes burning uncontrolled throughout the West. \n \n \n \n Drought and heat have combined to make this fire season one of the most active in recent years. Nearly 29,000 firefighters are battling some 100 large blazes in states including Idaho, Oregon, Montana, Washington and California. \n \n \n \n This season, 13 people have died battling wildfires, including the three in Washington, said Jessica Gardetto of the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho. She said it was a high number but could not immediately compare it to other years. \n \n \n \n ""Our firefighting personnel have been particularly hard hit this year,"" said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, calling it an ""extraordinarily challenging wildfire season."" \n \n \n \n The deaths happened in the scenic Methow River valley about 115 miles northeast of Seattle, but few details were released as officials notified family members. \n \n \n \n ""The firefighters were engaged in initial attack operations and were involved in a vehicle accident when it is believed that the fire overtook the vehicle,"" said a statement from Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest, relaying information from Okanogan County Sheriff Frank Rogers. \n \n \n \n It wasn\'t immediately clear if the four injured also were involved in the crash. \n \n \n \n ""It was a hellstorm up here,"" Rogers told Spokane news station KXLY-TV. ""The fire was racing and the winds were blowing in every direction and then it would shift. ... It was tough on \'em up here."" \n \n \n \n The U.S. Forest Service statement identified the dead as agency firefighters. Of the injured, two are with the state Department of Natural Resources, one is a DNR contractor and one is a U.S. Forest Service employee. \n \n \n \n One firefighter, a 25-year-old man from Puyallup, Washington, remained in critical condition Thursday with burns over 60 percent of his body, said Susan Gregg, spokeswoman for Harborview Medical Center in Seattle. \n \n \n \n ""He\'s got a lot of family by the bedside, and I think that obviously helps and we\'re hopeful,"" she said. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The news of the deaths came after officials ordered about 1,300 people in the popular outdoor-recreation communities of Twisp and Wintrop to evacuate. \n \n \n \n A stream of cars poured south out of Twisp as dark clouds of smoke loomed. Some people put sprinklers on their roofs to protect their homes, and others joined lines for gasoline that were several cars deep. \n \n \n \n Steve Morse, who lives near the Twisp fire, said he watched flames ""kind of hopscotching these ridges, working toward our house."" \n \n \n \n Rick McCauley, a manager at Sun Mountain Lodge, which sits at the end of an 18-mile road winding through forests from the town of Winthrop, said he had about 70 rooms filled when he decided to evacuate hotel. \n \n \n \n ""We looked at the fire coming over the hill and made the decision to clear everyone out,"" McCauley said Thursday. ""There\'s only one road in and out, so we don\'t want to take any chances."" \n \n \n \n A larger group of fires burning to the east covered about 50 square miles and prompted the evacuation of the town of Conconully, home to about 200 people 20 miles northwest of Omak. \n \n \n \n To the south, more than 1,100 firefighters tackled a fire that topped 108 square miles and threatened the resort town of Chelan. Angela Seydel, a spokeswoman for Okanogan Emergency Management, said 4,000 homes in the region had been evacuated. \n \n \n \n ""The fires have just exploded,"" she said Wednesday evening. \n \n \n \n Authorities warned that more high winds Thursday could make conditions very challenging. \n \n \n \n The National Weather Service warned about weather conditions that could fuel fires in eastern Washington through Friday. Temperatures were expected to climb above 90 degrees and relative humidity may drop as low as 14 percent. \n \n \n \n ___ \n \n \n \n Johnson reported from Seattle.

Now the lawyer for Susan Powell's parents, Chuck and Judy Cox, responds to the news with what sounds almost like resignation: ""It’s just one thing after another in terms of bad breaks and bad news and bad action by the authorities. It keeps getting worse,"" she tells NBC News. ""There are so many reasons Josh shouldn’t have had those kids."" The FBI uncovered the child pornography at least 17 months before Josh Powell's murder-suicide, according to documents obtained by the Tribune; the documents don't detail what images were found. As such, the FBI had two open investigations into Powell—one related to his wife's disappearance, the other related to the suspected possession of child porn—yet Powell still had visitation rights with Braden, 5, and Charlie, 7, whom he bludgeoned with an ax before blowing up his home on Feb. 5, 2012. The Coxes' lawyer says the couple was never informed about the child porn investigation, nor was sufficient information about that investigation shared with Washington state's social services department; otherwise the agency ""never would have let him have those kids."" During the custody case, the state revealed Powell was being investigated over cartoon images of mother-child incest allegedly found on his computer between 2009 and 2010, but the then-assistant Washington attorney general says the FBI never told him ""if there was something more serious"" than cartoon images found. Those cartoon images caused a judge to order a psychological evaluation of Powell, at which point he killed himself and the boys."

The newsweekly, which has struggled in recent years, was launched in 1933 and purchased by The Washington Post Co. in 1961. \n \n Washington Post Co. Chairman Donald E. Graham came to New York to tell the magazine staff at a 10:30 a.m. ET meeting on Wednesday. ""We have reported losses in the tens of millions for the last two years,"" he said. ""Outstanding work by NEWSWEEK\'s people has significantly narrowed the losses in the last year and particularly in the last few months. But we do not see a path to continuing profitability under our management."" \n \n Graham said the company decided to go public with the news to invite as many potential buyers as possible, and said the sale could be completed within a few months. ""Our aim will be--if we can do it--a rapid sale to a qualified buyer,"" he said. ""We\'re a public company and we have to consider the price offered. But we\'ll have a second and third criteria: the future of NEWSWEEK and the future of those who work here."" \n \n In a later meeting, NEWSWEEK Editor Jon Meacham told the editorial staff that he continues to believe in the mission of the company. Meacham said he would do everything he could to ensure the continuation of the magazine, including personally pitching potential buyers. He also reminded the staff that NEWSWEEK wasn\'t closed today, but was put on the market. \n \n Graham added, ""If anyone should take the blame for this ending, it is me—for not seeing early enough and reacting in the right way to the changes that have come to our industry. But as a former member of this staff, I will always be proud to have been part of NEWSWEEK. And, I will be doing what I can to assist its future and yours."" \n \n To that end, NEWSWEEK Inc. Managing Director Ann McDaniel told the staff: ""Because we don\'t have a secret buyer waiting in the wings, because no deal is imminent, some things are unknown. I do hope that you get to stay together as the great team that you are. In case that doesn\'t happen though, let me make one thing perfectly clear: Any employee, business or editorial, in good standing at the time of the sale, who does not get an offer from the new owner, will get the severance, notice, dismissal and RIF pay described in the contract and in NEWSWEEK\'s severance policy on the intranet. If you are new to NEWSWEEK, and remain in good standing through the sale, you will get four months of pay."" \n \n McDaniel told the staff she was saddened by the news, but that the company has made significant strides in the last year. ""Our industry is changing,"" she said. ""NEWSWEEK has changed along with it, and today\'s announcement reminds us that we must continue to grow, to adapt, to find new ways of serving readers, users and advertisers. I am incredibly proud of what we --really what you--have done in the past year. We are a better magazine, both domestically and internationally. We\'re a better Web site, and we\'ll be even stronger after the upcoming launch of our redesigned site. Advertisers like what we are doing and are paying a higher premium for it. Our business processes are better than they have ever been."" \n \n NEWSWEEK is an internationally known and respected publication, providing unique news, commentary, and insight into political and social developments in the United States and around the world. The magazine has 1.5 million subscribers in the United States and Canada, publishing 11 editions in more than 190 countries. Newsweek.com attracts 5.1 million unique users. Both the print and digital editions continue to win numerous awards for their journalism. \n \n In a statement, Graham said, ""The losses at NEWSWEEK in 2007-2009 are a matter of record. Despite heroic efforts on the part of NEWSWEEK\'s management and staff, we expect it to still lose money in 2010. We are exploring all options to fix that problem. NEWSWEEK is a lively, important magazine and website, and in the current climate, it might be a better fit elsewhere."" \n \n © 2010', 'In the cesspool story of the Ashley Madison meltdown, you won\'t find too many characters worth rooting for. That\'s pretty much the reason people are going ape over it, right? But when hackers made good this week on the threat they made in July to expose the infidelity-based dating site\'s subscriber information, eager dirt diggers promptly hit the jackpot with the discovery of not one but two accounts apparently belonging to one Mr. Josh Duggar. So! Much! Schadenfreude! But as gross and loathsome as this whole thing is, what if we didn\'t add to the grossness and loathsomeness of it? What if we didn\'t operate on a moral flatline, in which private morals and genuine crimes are all up for the same degree of lip-smacking glee? \n \n Let\'s take a moment to deconstruct the information. On the spectrum of individuals whose glass houses seem ripe for some good old-fashioned stone throwing, Josh Duggar\'s got to be near the top of the list. He\'s the eldest child of the famously Jesus-loving, transphobic Duggar clan, and until recently the executive director of FRC Action, the political arm of the notoriously anti gay Family Research Council. This is a guy who has professionally worked against gay and lesbian people, against reproductive choice, all from the cushy perch of reality TV recognition. He\'s also a man who earlier this year was revealed to have admitting to have ""forcibly touched at least five girls"" — including his sisters — when he was a teenager. For it to turn out that such a man also allegedly paid nearly a thousand bucks over the course of over two years for an account on a site for cheaters is pretty damn rich. His credibility as a judge of other people\'s morality is forever destroyed, and that\'s fine. \n \n Advertisement: \n \n To be clear, the current gloating over Josh Duggar\'s apparent penchant for a little something on the side is not equivalent to Gawker\'s notorious outing last month of a married Conde Nast executive whose attempt to procure a gay escort became fodder for a humiliating — and then controversially retracted -- story. At the time, now-departed Gawker editor Max Read boasted that ""Given the chance gawker will always report on married c-suite executives of major media companies fucking around on their wives"" — a publishing standard that seems questionable at best. The executive, unlike Duggar, was not a public figure. He certainly never, like Duggar, had the impressive record of both sexual abuse and hypocritical political lobbying. \n \n But you know, this also isn\'t a case of an embarrassingly misdirected sexual invitation being inadvertently released, a la Anthony Weiner. It\'s not a sex partner coming forward. It\'s still private information, including the street where Duggar and his family own a home, that was obtained by a group of vigilantes. Yet now ostensibly legitimate news organizations are poring over the trove of information from the hack, analyzing, for instance, how many Ashley Madison accounts came from military and government addresses. On Thursday, an Australian radio show told a curious caller live on the air that her husband was a member. And the New York Post has dutifully reported that ""Locally, 27 people used email addresses registered to the Department of Education, and three each from the Fire Department and Parks Department."" \n \n This is where the fallout becomes repulsive. Because I don\'t care if my local urban park ranger is cheating on his wife. It\'s none of my business. I do care that a group of hackers has now done their dirty work for a bunch of tabloids, who are using the detailed personal information they obtained to wreak havoc in an yet untold number of lives. I do care that in just the span of the post 9/11 era, we\'ve come to take it for granted that any number of forces — the government, or a shadowy group calling itself Impact Team that has an ax to grind against Ashley Madison — can just rummage through our most intimate data. I care that we\'re somehow encouraged to participate in the shaming of those who morally transgress, to delight in their exposure, however that exposure was obtained. And I care that based on prior history, when we declare open season, that\'s when everything is up for grabs. As other recent hacks have revealed, it\'s all fodder. Private photographs. The contents of an Amazon order. Let\'s just point and judge it all! \n \n Josh Duggar won\'t get a whole lot of sympathy from me. But when I saw Thursday a headline describing the latest news as ""yet another sex scandal,"" I did consider that there\'s actually a difference between molesting your sisters and cheating on your wife. I believe that the people the Impact Team describe as ""cheating dirtbags"" — whose personal circumstances and arrangements with their partners are not in fact ours to know or judge — don\'t merit this prurient promenade around the headlines. And far more than Josh Duggar\'s list of qualities he\'s looking for in a bang-buddy, I\'m disgusted by the lie that if you\'re good, you don\'t need to worry about your privacy, and that as long as you don\'t have any secrets, you don\'t have anything to be afraid of.']",2,"– The Washington Post Company is looking for someone to take Newsweek off its hands, the company announced in a press release today (to the apparent surprise of Newsweek's Tumblr). “The losses at Newsweek in 2007-2009 are a matter of record,” said Donald Graham, chairman of the Post Company. “We expect it to still lose money in 2010. ..

379,"['Inspectors with Ontario’s Ministry of Labour, forensics, and the coroner\'s office are combing through the wreckage of the stage that collapsed Saturday during setup for a Radiohead concert in Toronto. \n \n They’re trying to find out what caused the stage to come crashing down on a handful of workers. \n \n The collapse at Downsview Park crushed one of Radiohead\'s technicians to death and injured three others with the band. A spokesperson for Radiohead identified the man who died as Scott Johnson from South Yorkshire, England, a 33-year-old drum technician for the band. \n \n An unidentified 45-year-old crew member was still in hospital Sunday with non-life-threatening injuries. Two other crew members were treated for minor injuries on the scene and released. All of the victims were crew members setting up the stage, police said. \n \n Ministry spokesman Matt Blajer says the massive structure is “still fairly unstable” and work is underway to make it safe. \n \n He says investigators are looking to see whether safety regulations and standards were followed and staff were properly trained. \n \n He says the investigation is “fairly complex” and it could take some time to figure out exactly what happened. \n \n There was a popping crack, like the sound of fireworks, then an eerie silence as Erin Peacock watched the towering stage crumple in on itself, hardware-laden canopy tipping over towards the front end of the stage, taking reams of scaffolding down with it and leaving long sticks of twisted metal behind. \n \n The immediate aftermath of the collapse was quiet enough for Ms. Peacock to hear everyone with her in the beer tent collectively gasp as they watched - close enough to see stagehands sent scrambling, too far away to hear them shout as the stage fell. \n \n Ambulance sirens broke the silence and snapped Ms. Peacock and her sister back to reality. The two were supposed to be bartenders at Radiohead\'s Saturday night concert - a first for Ms. Peacock\'s younger sister, who just got her SmartServe certification. Instead, they watched an outdoor stage become a death trap. \n \n ""We didn’t see any ambulances speeding off immediately, which led us to believe either everyone\'s okay or people are pinned,"" Ms. Peacock said. \n \n It turned out to be the latter: As the top portion of the stage fell, it trapped one man beneath the debris. While a team of paramedics was already on the scene in preparation for the concert and tended quickly to the other hurt crew members, they couldn’t reach the last victim until police and firefighters managed to extricate him. \n \n That man, Scott Johnson, was pronounced dead at the scene - a ""crushing injury,"" paramedics said. \n \n Ms. Peacock said there were about 10 crew members on the stage when it collapsed. It seemed they were about to do a sound check - electronic twangs piping through the speakers were what made her look up just before the structure fell. \n \n Lindsey Bradbury, an employee at Handpicked management, was preparing to work in one of the beer tents when she noticed the commotion. She said people were hanging screens on the stage just prior to the collapse. \n \n Once the stage fell, she could hear people yelling ""First aid!"" \n \n The concert facility at Downsview Park was newly renovated. Radiohead and their opener, Caribou, were to be the first performers there. \n \n Jim Brett, president of International Alliance Theatrical Stage Employees Local 58, said crew members working on the Downsview stage weren\'t members of his union. \n \n ""The only thing I can confirm is that IATSE Local 58 was not involved with the building of the stage or supplying any labour for the concert,"" he wrote in an e-mail. ""Regardless of who was involved, the stage collapse is a tragic event and we offer our most sincere condolences to the family of the deceased and our thoughts are with those who were injured."" \n \n Police said subsequent events at Downsview Park - including a Sunday run for girls in Grade 3 though Grade 8 - would continue as planned. \n \n Live Nation, the company organizing the concert, declined to comment, referring questions to a spokeswoman for Radiohead who did not return calls or text messages Saturday. Radiohead tweeted that ""Due to unforeseen circumstances tonight\'s [concert] at downsview park has been cancelled. Fans are advised not to make their way to the venue."" \n \n This isn\'t the first time an outdoor stage at a Canadian concert has collapsed, sometimes with fatal consequences. Several people were hurt last July when the stage at Ottawa\'s Bluesfest collapsed as Cheap Trick playing. In 2009, the main stage collapsed at Alberta\'s Big Valley Jamboree, near Camrose, killing one woman and injured several others. Panhandle Productions, Global Production Co. and a numbered Alberta company all faced dozens of charges coming out of the Big Valley Jamboree stage collapse, but Crown prosecutors stayed the charges in January, citing low likelihood of conviction. \n \n A key difference, however, is the weather: Both the Bluesfest and the Big Valley collapses happened during stormy windstorms that some have said could have played a role in the accidents. \n \n ""How does something like this happen?"" Ms. Peacock asked. ""I\'ve seen reports of stages collapsing before, but it\'s always been due to weather conditions and whatnot. There was no weather condition today. It was a beautiful, warm sunny day."" \n \n With files from Paige Ellis, Josh O\'Kane, Robert Everett Green, and The Canadian Press', 'Brian Kelley, left, and Tyler Hubbard, of Florida Georgia Line, accept the award for favorite country duo/group at the American Music Awards at the Microsoft Theater on Sunday, Nov. 20, 2016, in Los Angeles....

But Green Day got political during their performance of ""Bang Bang"" as band leader Billie Joe Armstrong sang ""No KKK, no fascist USA, no Trump"" during the show. \n \n The show\'s hosts — former ""Saturday Night Live"" comic Jay Pharaoh and model Gigi Hadid — also mentioned the Trump family when telling jokes: After Pharaoh impersonated Jay Z, Hadid acted like Melania Trump. \n \n ""I love my husband, President Barack Obama, and our children, Sasha and Malia,"" she said, scrunching up her face. \n \n Strumming guitars while singing was one of the night\'s themes: One Direction\'s Niall Horan slowed things down for his acoustic-folk solo single, ""This Town"": James Bay sang his smoky single, ""Let It Go""; and Shawn Mendes performed his hit ""Treat You Better"" and switched to piano for the aching ""Mercy."" \n \n But the best singer-guitarist was Gaga, who beautifully belted the lyrics to her latest single, ""Million Reasons."" She earned a rousing applause from the audience. \n \n Sting also impressed, who performed ""Message In a Bottle,"" \'\'Every Breathe You Take"" and his new single, ""I Can\'t Stop Thinking About You.""

Not long after that story appeared, Mr. Dawkins received the court summons, demanding partial “reimbursement to the state for Defendant’s cost of care while incarcerated.” \n \n Image Kimberly Knutsen says the deal her partner, Mr. Dawkins, landed for “The Graybar Hotel” has helped support their family. Credit Leah Nash for The New York Times \n \n Michigan is one of more than 40 states where prisoners can be forced to pay for the cost of their incarceration, according to the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law. Laws that allow the government to charge prisoners “room and board” or “cost of care” fees have proliferated in recent decades, as states charge inmates and parolees for everything from medical care, clothing and meals to police transport, public defense fees, drug testing and electronic monitoring. \n \n Since so many prisoners are impoverished to begin with, states typically don’t raise much money by charging inmates room and board fees, and in some states, the enforcement of these laws is conditional on the prisoner’s ability to pay. But as the cost of mass incarceration has soared, with more than 2.2 million adults in prisons and jails across the United States, some states have grown more aggressive in seeking money from prisoners and formerly incarcerated people. \n \n During the last fiscal year, Michigan collected some $3.7 million from 294 prisoners, who account for just a fraction of the state’s nearly 40,000 inmates. Around the country, some 10 million people owe $50 billion in fees stemming from their arrest or imprisonment, according to a 2015 Brennan Center report. \n \n States often take a percentage of the earnings inmates receive through prison work programs. But some states have also sought money from prisoners who have received larger sums, through an inheritance or legal settlements or, as in Mr. Dawkins’s case, money they acquire through their own initiative. After an Illinois inmate who was serving a 15-month sentence for a drug conviction received a $31,690 settlement for his mother’s death, he was forced to pay the state nearly $20,000 for the cost of his imprisonment, leaving him nearly destitute when he was paroled in 2015. \n \n In Florida, a convict named Jeremy Barrett who received a $150,000 settlement from the Department of Corrections for negligence, after he was attacked in 2011 by another inmate who gouged out his eye, was forced to pay the state nearly $55,000 from the settlement as reimbursement for his three years in prison. \n \n When prisoners and former inmates fight such charges, courts often rule in the state’s favor. In 2000, Connecticut’s Supreme Court ruled that Eric Ham, who was serving a 50-year sentence for murder, had to pay nearly $900,000 toward the cost of his incarceration, after he won a settlement of around $1 million from the city of New Haven for falsely arresting him for another crime that he didn’t commit.', 'It might be Kim Davis\' favorite hype-up song, but Survivor says it did not grant the embattled Kentucky county clerk the rights to use ""Eye of the Tiger"" at her get-out-of-jail rally. \n \n Davis -- who was jailed for refusing to grant marriage licenses to same-sex couples in her state -- stood alongside Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee at a rally in Grayson, Ky., on Tuesday (Sept. 8) as the Survivor anthem made famous by Rocky III played in the background. \n \n Madonna\'s Brother Defends Jailed Clerk Who Refused Marriage Licenses for Gay Couples \n \n Survivor founding member and ""Eye of the Tiger"" co-writer Jim Peterik sent a statement to Billboard making clear that the band did not authorize the song\'s use at Tuesday\'s rally. \n \n ""I was very surprised and dismayed at the misuse of the song I co-wrote with Frankie Sullivan for Rocky lll,"" he said.

The attacker who plowed into hundreds of people, killing at least 84 and injuring dozens of others over more than a mile, has been named by Nice-Matin as local man Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel. Sources tell CNN that the 31-year-old French-Tunisian was a petty criminal who was not on authorities' radar for jihadist activities. He was shot dead by police, apparently after opening fire on the crowd, and authorities found his identity papers inside the vehicle, along with more weapons, the BBC reports. A witness who saw the driver's face says he ""had a beard and appeared to be having fun."" In other developments: France has declared three days of national mourning and extended a state of emergency. ""We are facing a war that terrorism has brought to us. The goal of terrorists is to instill fear and panic,"" Prime Minister Manuel Valls says. ""And France is a great country, and a great democracy that will not allow itself to be destabilized."" Regional lawmaker Eric Ciotti says that one person jumped onto the truck to try to stop it, the AP reports. ""It's at that moment that the police were able to neutralize this terrorist,"" he says. ""I won't forget the look of this policewoman who intercepted the killer."" A spokeswoman for the Lenval Foundation children's hospital in Nice says they have treated at least 50 young victims, including two who died during or after surgery. Others are in a condition that is ""still life and death,"" she says. The attack was condemned by world leaders, including Pope Francis, President Obama, and Angela Merkel, who says, ""I am convinced that, despite all the difficulties, we shall win this fight,"" reports Reuters. European Council chief Donald Tusk says the world stands with France. ""It is a tragic paradox that the victims of the attack [were] people celebrating liberty, equality, and fraternity,"" he says. Near the scene on the seafront Promenade des Anglais, police have cordoned off the road, and traumatized survivors are still wandering around, the Guardian reports. Residents say that after last night's horror, people had to step around bodies to flee the scene. ""I saw a mother covering her child's eyes, telling him to keep them tightly shut,"" one man says. ""The dad had a toddler in his arms and had buried his face in his T-shirt for him not to see anything."""
381,"['Posthumous Nobel Prizes \n \n From 1974, the Statutes of the Nobel Foundation stipulate that a Prize cannot be awarded posthumously, unless death has occurred after the announcement of the Nobel Prize. Before 1974, the Nobel Prize has only been awarded posthumously twice: to Dag Hammarskjöld (Nobel Peace Prize 1961) and Erik Axel Karlfeldt (Nobel Prize in Literature 1931). \n \n Following the 2011 announcement of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, it was discovered that one of the Medicine Laureates, Ralph Steinman, had passed away three days earlier. The Board of the Nobel Foundation examined the statutes, and an interpretation of the purpose of the rule above led to the conclusion that Ralph Steinman should continue to remain a Nobel Laureate, as the Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institutet had announced the 2011 Nobel Laureates in Physiology or Medicine without knowing of his death.', '(CNN) The murder conviction of the sole suspect in the brutal killings of three family members and their housekeeper closes a chapter on a case that shocked the Washington metro area more than three years ago. \n \n Darron Wint, 37, also known as Daron Wint, was found guilty by a jury on all 20 counts in the May 2015 slayings.

Scientific American compiled a dozen surprising facts about the history of the prizes, established by the wealthy Swedish industrialist who happened to invent dynamite. Here are six standouts from its list: 860 laureates and 25 organizations have won the Nobel Prize between 1901 and 2014, and four laureates won twice. Linus Pauling, however, stands alone as the only person to win an unshared Nobel twice—first in 1954 in chemistry, and second in 1962 in peace, per the Nobel Foundation. Three winners were in prison when they won. German journalist Carl von Ossietzky, Burmese politician Aung San Suu Kyi, and Chinese human rights activist Liu Xiaobo all won the peace prize. Only two prizes have been sold during a laureate's life, and both in the past year. One was 1988 physics winner, Leon Lederman, who auctioned his prize for $765,000 to cover medical expenses. The average age of Nobel laureates is 59, with the oldest winner being Leonid Hurwicz, who won in economics in 2007 at the age of 90. The youngest winner, Malala Yousafzai, won the Peace Prize in 2014 at 17. It can take decades to be recognized—two to three on average. But in 1966, Peyton Rous won the medicine prize for work he did 50 years earlier on viruses that can cause tumors. After awarding the prize to two dead people, the Nobel Foundation decided in the 1970s to no longer hand out prizes posthumously. But in 2011, Ralph Steinman won the prize in medicine three days after he died—the judges hadn't known, and decided to let it stand. For the full list, head over to Scientific American."

(Associated Press) \n \n Meanwhile, the father of a Chechen immigrant killed in Florida while being interrogated by the FBI about his ties to the slain brother maintained that the U.S. agents killed his son ""execution-style."" \n \n Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, walked without a wheelchair to speak to his mother last week for the first and only phone conversation they have had since he has been in custody, Zubeidat Tsarnaeva told the AP. \n \n In a rare glimpse at Dzhokhar Tsarnaev\'s state of mind, he told her he was getting better and that he had a very good doctor, but was struggling to understand what happened, she said. \n \n ""He didn\'t hold back his emotions either, as if he were screaming to the whole world: What is this? What\'s happening?,"" she said. \n \n The April 15 bombings killed three people and wounded more than 260. Elder brother, 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev, was killed in a shootout with police, and Dzhokhar remains in a prison hospital after being badly wounded. \n \n ""I could just feel that he was being driven crazy by the unfairness that happened to us, that they killed our innocent Tamerlan,"" their mother said, standing by the family\'s insistence that their children are innocent. \n \n The Tsarnaevs met the AP in their new apartment in a 14-story building in a well-to-do area of Makhachkala, the capital of the restive Caucasus province of Dagestan. The apartment had no furniture apart from a TV, a few rugs, and wallpaper materials lying on the floor. \n \n Anzor Tsarnaev, the suspects\' father, said they bought it for Tamerlan, his wife, and their young daughter in the expectation that they would move to Makhachkala later this year. He added that they planned to turn their old home in a dingy district on the outskirts of town into a dentist\'s office, so that Dzhokhar, a dental hygiene student, could work out of it after completing his studies. \n \n ""All I can do is pray to God and hope that one day fairness will win out, our children will be cleared, and we will at least get Dzhokhar back, crippled, but at least alive,"" Tsarnaev said. \n \n Separately, at a news conference in Moscow, the father of a 27-year-old mixed martial arts fighter who was killed during FBI questioning accused agents of being ""bandits"" who executed his son. \n \n Abdul-Baki Todashev showed journalists 16 photographs that he said were of his son, Ibragim, in a Florida morgue. He said his son had six gunshot wounds to his torso and one to the back of his head and the pictures were taken by his son\'s friend, Khusen Taramov. \n \n It was not immediately possible to authenticate the photographs. \n \n The FBI says Todashev was being questioned by an FBI agent and two Massachusetts state troopers about his ties to Tamerlan Tsarnaev, as well as about a 2011 triple slaying in Massachusetts. \n \n Three law enforcement officials said initially that Ibragim Todashev had lunged at the FBI agent with a knife, although two of them later said it was no longer clear what had happened. \n \n The father said his son was ""100 percent unarmed."" \n \n Taramov confirmed Thursday that he had taken some pictures of Ibragim Todashev\'s body at an Orlando funeral home and sent them to the father. He said Ibragim Todashev had a decorative sword with a broken handle, but that it was not a weapon. \n \n ""The sword wouldn\'t cut nothing,"" Tamarov said. ""I played with it many times. It wasn\'t sharp from any angle. It would do the same harm as a piece of wood."" \n \n The father said Taramov told him that U.S. agents interrogated him on the street while five officials interrogated Todashev in his Florida house for eight hours on May 22, the night he was shot. \n \n Todashev\'s father said that his son moved to the U.S. in 2008 on a study exchange program and met Tsarnaev at a boxing gym in Boston in 2011, about a year before he moved to Orlando. He said the two were ""not particularly close friends."" \n \n Prior to last month\'s bombings, Todashev underwent an operation for a sports injury and was on crutches, making it physically impossible for him to have been involved in the bombings, his father said. He added that Todashev had recently received a green card and was planning to return to Chechnya for the summer last Friday, two days after he was killed. \n \n The father said he and his brother were interviewed at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow on Thursday as they sought a visa to take his son\'s body back to Chechnya. \n \n FBI agents interrogated the younger Todashev twice before the night he was shot, his father said. He said his son told him that he thought Tsarnaev had been set up to take the blame for the bombings. \n \n ""I\'d only seen and heard things like that in the movies _ they shoot somebody and then a shot in the head to make sure,"" Todashev said. \n \n ""These just aren\'t FBI agents, they\'re bandits,"" he added. \n \n The FBI wouldn\'t comment on the claims made by Todashev\'s father. \n \n The Tsarnaevs\' parents have held fast to their belief that their sons were framed. Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, dressed all in black and still visibly distressed, showed AP several YouTube videos on an iPad she claimed cleared her sons. They could not be authenticated by the AP. \n \n ""I remember when our cat was sick, Tamerlan was sick himself for two days afterward, because he was so worried about her,"" Tsarnaeva said. \n \n She said Tamerlan told her about Todashev, and that she and her husband had invited him to visit them in Russia, though he never came. Tamerlan later told them that he and Todashev were unlikely to continue training together since they practiced different sports, and he appeared to have lost track of him after Todashev moved to Florida, Tsarnaeva added. \n \n _____ \n \n Seddon reported from Moscow.

That afternoon, when Todashev did not answer his phone, the FBI agent, the two troopers and an Orlando police officer went to his condo, the government official said. \n \n Todashev invited them in and began talking, the official said. As the conversation continued, Todashev indicated he was ready to confess to his involvement in the homicides, so the FBI agent pulled up a table so Todashev could write down his confession, the government official said. Meanwhile, one of the troopers left the room to make a phone call and the Orlando officer accompanied him, the official said. \n \n Todashev became agitated, the government official said. He suddenly stood and flipped the wooden table up, hitting the FBI agent, who was slammed ""forcefully"" into the wall, the government official said. \n \n Todashev reached down and picked up a metal pole about the size of a broom handle and swung it at the FBI agent, the official said. \n \n The agent fired two or three shots, hitting Todashev, but Todashev came at him again with the metal pole, the official said. The FBI agent then shot him ""until he eliminated the threat,"" the official said. The incident happened in a few seconds, the official said. \n \n The FBI agent was treated at the hospital for injuries, including lacerations that required stitches, the government official said. \n \n An advocacy group is demanding a civil rights investigation into the death of a Chechen immigrant who was shot to death by authorities in central Florida while being questioned about his ties to one of the Boston Marathon bombing suspects. (May 30) AP \n \n At the news conference in Moscow on Thursday, Todashev\'s father, flanked by Maxim Shevchenko, a member of the Presidential Council of Human Rights, said his son was never a close friend of Boston bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev and knew nothing about the attacks in advance. \n \n He called ""absurd"" the claims by some U.S. officials that Todashev had attacked an FBI agent. \n \n ""Maybe my son knew something, some information the police did not want to be made public. Maybe they wanted to silence my son,"" Todashev\'s father said. \n \n He said his son was grilled for many hours about the Boston bombings. \n \n ""They tortured a man for eight hours with no attorney, no witnesses, nobody. We can only guess what was going on there, until there is an official investigation,"" Todashev said. \n \n Shevchenko told reporters at the news conference that Todashev\'s killing looked like ""cold-blooded murder."" \n \n The Florida branch of the Council on American-Islamic Relations has called for a federal civil rights investigation. \n \n ""We have confirmed through senior sources within the FBI that Ibragim was indeed unarmed when he was shot seven times in the head, what appear to be even in the back of the head,"" said Hassan Shibly, executive director of the CAIR Florida. ""That\'s very disturbing."" \n \n Later, according to the Orlando Sentinel, Shibly told reporters that CAIR has an ""intermediary"" who said the FBI told him Todashev was unarmed. Shibly did not identify the intermediary. \n \n Shibly, speaking to reporters in Orlando on Wednesday, said the group was calling for the independent investigation ""to make sure excessive force was not used against this unarmed individual."" \n \n Todashev has not been directly implicated in the April 15 Boston Marathon bombings that killed three people and injured more than 260. The FBI has said only that Todashev, a martial arts enthusiast like Tamerlan Tsarnaev, knew the suspect when he lived in Boston. \n \n Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 27, and his brother, Dzhokhar, 19, were named as suspects in the bombings. Tamerlan died three days after the bombings during a shootout with police that also left Dzhokhar injured. \n \n Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was later captured and charged in connection with the bombings.

The Times cites a senior law enforcement official, and calls his account of the incident ""the most detailed to date."" Citing a government official, USA Today reports that Todashev overturned the table, pushed the agent into a wall, and came at him with a pole. In this telling, the metal pole was ""about the size of a broom handle."" CBS Boston has basically the same story, citing multiple law enforcement officials. CBS Boston adds the interesting detail that Todashev reportedly flipped the table as the agent looked down to read a text. It was apparently a message from the state trooper who was also in the room; he thought Todashev was growing agitated, and wanted to mention that to the agent without Todashev's knowledge. All three accounts agree that Todashev ran at the agent again after the first few shots were fired, prompting the agent to shoot again, and that the agent required stitches for his injuries. Meanwhile, Todashev's father Abdulbaki publicized pictures (which have not been authenticated) of his son's dead body, said to have been taken by a friend, and accused the FBI of an ""execution-style"" killing, the AP reports. He claims Todashev had six gunshot wounds to his torso and one to the back of his head. He maintains his son was ""100% unarmed,"" and says he was ""tortured.""

Chris Daly, the 37-year-old representative of the city’s oft-tawdry Tenderloin district, warned colleagues of his intent at a meeting Thursday; needless to say, few were charmed. “I certainly hope that Supervisor Daly’s resolution fails quickly,” the board’s president, who later left a bar of soap on Daly’s desk, tells KCBS-TV. Mayor Gavin Newsom suggests a swear jar, into which Daly should pay a fine for each blast. “Will he ever be president of the United States? Uh, no,” writes Beth Spotswood. “But crazy people who can get shit done can get elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. Actually, crazy people who are just plain crazy can get elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. Gus Van Sant made a whole movie about it.”"

386,"['Joining the battle over California taxes, a group of billionaires and political insiders say they will place a $10-billion tax increase on the November 2012 ballot.The Think Long Committee, which includes Google Chairman Eric Schmidt , former governors Gray Davis and Arnold Schwarzenegger and Los Angeles philanthropist Eli Broad , says its proposal would provide $5 billion more for public schools every year and billions for public universities and local governments.Tax issues: An article in the Nov. 20 California section about a committee of influential Californians called Think Long reported that former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger is a member of the group. Although a tax proposal by Think Long listed Schwarzenegger as a member, a spokesman for the group later said the former governor has never been a member. Additionally, the article said the California Federation of Teachers would push a proposal being crafted by labor groups to ask voters to raise income tax rates on high earners and increase the state sales tax. The union says it would only propose raising taxes on top earners. —Although the group has prepared a report outlining its proposals, it has not taken the preliminary steps needed to place the ideas before voters. Members have not filed any potential initiatives with the state attorney general\'s office or created a campaign committee to finance such an effort. A spokesman for Think Long said those moves would come in the next couple of weeks.The group\'s plan is based on a reshuffling of California\'s tax system. It would lower the state\'s personal income and sales tax rates and create a new levy of more than 5% on services that are not currently taxed, such as legal work or accounting.Think Long spokesman Nathan Gardels said members want to ""maintain California\'s progressive tax system."" Under their proposal, families earning up to $45,000 a year would pay no state income tax, while those making up to $95,000 annually would pay 2%. This would lower some taxpayers\' obligations significantly.The group also wants to double the current exemption for homeowners and renters on their state income tax and eliminate most other California income tax credits.Taxpayer organizations have opposed similar ideas in the past. David Kline, a spokesman for the California Taxpayers Assn., said he could not comment without knowing the details of Think Long\'s plan, but he said that generally speaking, ""we have some major issues with a tax on services and the impact that would have on businesses and consumers.""Gardels said the panel would proceed with its initiative plan despite potential opposition. Its wealthy members — who include three billionaires in Broad, Schmidt and committee founder Nicolas Berggruen — will pay for the expensive and arduous process of collecting enough signatures to qualify a proposal for the ballot, the spokesman said.Berggruen has said publicly that he would commit $20 million of his personal wealth to getting a measure passed.""The problem with most initiatives is funding,"" said Gardels. ""That\'s not a problem this group will have.""Gov. Jerry Brown , who tried unsuccessfully to get higher sales, income and vehicle taxes on the ballot this year, has ""had some conversations"" with Think Long, said the governor\'s spokeswoman Elizabeth Ashford. But she said Brown had no immediate plans to endorse the group\'s proposal.Labor unions, meanwhile, are preparing their own ballot proposal. It would raise income tax rates on high earners and increase the state sales tax to patch the $13-billion budget deficit that the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst\'s Office has projected for the next fiscal year. A shortfall this year may trigger automatic cuts that could shave up to a week off the school year in some districts.Josh Pechthalt, president of the California Federation of Teachers, said his group would push the labor proposal because the pending budget cuts underscore ""a need for a revenue measure to be put on the budget for 2012.""All of this comes as Brown prepares his budget for the 2012-13 fiscal year. The governor must unveil the spending blueprint by Jan. 10. Democratic leaders in the Legislature say they will stand firm against any more reductions in state services.""Over the last three years, we\'ve done quite enough damage on the cut side, thank you,"" said Senate leader Darrell Steinberg (D-Sacramento). ""In the short run, I do not see making more cuts.""', 'A well-funded team of top California political, business and civic leaders will propose a ballot measure that would overhaul the state\'s tax system by simultaneously cutting income taxes across the board while raising $10 billion a year by expanding the sales tax to include services. \n \n The Think Long Committee for California also is ready to propose a ballot measure that would alter the state\'s initiative process by creating an independent, nonpartisan panel that would have the power to propose initiatives, according to a copy of the panel\'s 24-page plan that The Chronicle has obtained. \n \n Ideas to reform California\'s dysfunctional government surface frequently, and just as often are ignored. What makes Think Long different is the bipartisan star power of its 17-member panel and the $20 million or more that its chairman, billionaire businessman Nicolas Berggruen, said he will spend in support of ballot measures. \n \n Berggruen will be backed by committee members including former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt, Southern California billionaire developer Eli Broad, former San Francisco Mayor and Chronicle columnist Willie Brown and former California Supreme Court Chief Justice Ronald George. \n \n Each is expected to raise money or manpower to back the ballot measures. Think Long, which shaped its proposals during private meetings held over the past year, plans to put at least two of its proposals on the November 2012 ballot. \n \n While the panel\'s report includes a wide range of government and education reforms, one of its most provocative ideas is its tax overhaul proposal, which Think Long adviser Nathan Gardels called an ""ideological hybrid"" model that combines ideas from the political right and left. \n \n The nonpartisan Legislative Analyst\'s Office has said that the state budget relies too heavily on personal income tax revenue, which makes the state subject to the boom-and-bust cycles of the economy. To remedy that, Think Long proposes to: \n \n -- Simplify the income tax code to two rates - 2 percent for couples filing jointly who make $45,000 to $95,000$ and 7.5 percent for those earning more, while retaining the 1 percent surcharge for Californians who earn more than $1 million. Couples who earn less than $45,000 would pay no personal income tax. \n \n -- Eliminate most credits and all itemized deductions, except mortgage interest, property taxes, charitable contributions and research and development. Taxpayers would receive an expanded standard deduction equal to $45,000 for joint filers and $27,000 for single filers. \n \n -- Reduce the state\'s corporation tax from one of the nation\'s highest rates at 8.84 percent to 7 percent, lower than the national average. The move would help attract business, the report said. \n \n -- Phase in a 5 percent sales tax on services over four years, exempting health care and education. Low-income households would get a sales tax rebate. \n \n The estimated $10 billion that would be raised by the implementation of these proposals would be earmarked largely for public education and to pay down the state\'s debt. \n \n Mindful of the Occupy Wall Street demonstrations against the inequity of the current financial system, Gardels said that under this proposal, the top 5 percent of state tax filers would pay 62 percent of all income taxes. \n \n ""It retains the state\'s progressive tax structure,"" he said. \n \n In an era of partisan political gridlock from Sacramento to Washington, Berggruen said the committee he recruited has ""shown that difficult bipartisan compromise can be reached if politics is set aside and the public interest is put first."" The panel\'s recommendations were approved by consensus. \n \n Los Angeles County Federation of Labor Secretary-Treasurer Maria Elena Durazo was the only member to abstain on the final recommendations. She did not respond to an interview request. \n \n This article appeared on page C - 1 of the San Francisco Chronicle']",2,"– A group of California billionaires is joining political insiders to put a $10 billion tax hike measure on the state ballot.

Video provided by TheStreet Newslook \n \n ‘Brain hacking’ Internet monopolies menace public health, democracy, writes Roger McNamee. \n \n Facebook and Alphabet stocks (Photo: Mark Lennihan, AP) \n \n I invested in Google and Facebook years before their first revenue and profited enormously. I was an early adviser to Facebook’s team, but I am terrified by the damage being done by these Internet monopolies. \n \n Technology has transformed our lives in countless ways, mostly for the better. Thanks to the now ubiquitous smartphone, tech touches us from the moment we wake up until we go to sleep. While the convenience of smartphones has many benefits, the unintended consequences of well-intentioned product choices have become a menace to public health and to democracy. \n \n Facebook and Google get their revenue from advertising, the effectiveness of which depends on gaining and maintaining consumer attention. Borrowing techniques from the gambling industry, Facebook, Google and others exploit human nature, creating addictive behaviors that compel consumers to check for new messages, respond to notifications, and seek validation from technologies whose only goal is to generate profits for their owners. \n \n More: Legal automation spells relief for lower-income Americans, hard times for lawyers \n \n More: Please do not let your employer microchip you \n \n The people at Facebook and Google believe that giving consumers more of what they want and like is worthy of praise, not criticism. What they fail to recognize is that their products are not making consumers happier or more successful. Like gambling, nicotine, alcohol or heroin, Facebook and Google — most importantly through its YouTube subsidiary — produce short-term happiness with serious negative consequences in the long term. Users fail to recognize the warning signs of addiction until it is too late. There are only 24 hours in a day, and technology companies are making a play for all them. The CEO of Netflix recently noted that his company’s primary competitor is sleep. \n \n How does this work? A 2013 study found that average consumers check their smartphones 150 times a day. And that number has probably grown. People spend 50 minutes a day on Facebook. Other social apps such as Snapchat, Instagram and Twitter combine to take up still more time. Those companies maintain a profile on every user, which grows every time you like, share, search, shop or post a photo. Google also is analyzing credit card records of millions of people. \n \n As a result, the big Internet companies know more about you than you know about yourself, which gives them huge power to influence you, to persuade you to do things that serve their economic interests. Facebook, Google and others compete for each consumer’s attention, reinforcing biases and reducing the diversity of ideas to which each is exposed. The degree of harm grows over time. \n \n Consider a recent story from Australia, where someone at Facebook told advertisers that they had the ability to target teens who were sad or depressed, which made them more susceptible to advertising. In the United States, Facebook once demonstrated its ability to make users happier or sadder by manipulating their news feed. While it did not turn either capability into a product, the fact remains that Facebook influences the emotional state of users every moment of every day. Former Google design ethicist Tristan Harris calls this ""brain hacking."" \n \n More: We need answers in Democrats\' congressional IT drama \n \n POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media \n \n The fault here is not with search and social networking, per se. Those services have enormous value. The fault lies with advertising business models that drive companies to maximize attention at all costs, leading to ever more aggressive brain hacking. \n \n The Facebook application has 2 billion active users around the world. Google’s YouTube has 1.5 billion. These numbers are comparable to Christianity and Islam, respectively, giving Facebook and Google influence greater than most First World countries. They are too big and too global to be held accountable. Other attention-based apps — including Instagram, WhatsApp, WeChat, SnapChat and Twitter — also have user bases between 100 million and 1.3 billion. Not all their users have had their brains hacked, but all are on that path. And there are no watchdogs. \n \n Anyone who wants to pay for access to addicted users can work with Facebook and YouTube. Lots of bad people have done it. One firm was caught using Facebook tools to spy on law abiding citizens. A federal agency confronted Facebook about the use of its tools by financial firms to discriminate based on race in the housing market. America’s intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia interfered in our election and that Facebook was a key platform for spreading misinformation. For the price of a few fighter aircraft, Russia won an information war against us. \n \n Incentives being what they are, we cannot expect Internet monopolies to police themselves. There is little government regulation and no appetite to change that. If we want to stop brain hacking, consumers will have to force changes at Facebook and Google. \n \n Roger McNamee is the managing director and a co-founder of Elevation Partners, and investment partnership focused on media/entertainment content and consumer technology. \n \n You can read diverse opinions from our Board of Contributors and other writers on the Opinion front page, on Twitter @USATOpinion and in our daily Opinion newsletter.

391,"['The Voice Behind The \'Laurel\' Or \'Yanny\' Recording: Actor Jay Aubrey Jones \n \n If you\'ve spent any time on the Internet this past week, you\'ve probably heard and then argued over a certain viral sound clip. \n \n He\'s saying, ""Laurel,"" some people swear. No, he\'s saying, ""Yanny,"" others insist. But for Broadway and television actor Jay Aubrey Jones, he hears himself. \n \n Jones did some voice work for Vocabulary.com, recording more than 36,000 words for the website in 2007, including saying the word, ""Laurel."" And apparently, that is the source audio for the ""Laurel, Yanny"" viral clip that\'s been driving the Internet crazy. \n \n ""When I first heard this recording, it was on Wednesday morning on television, and I was putting myself together, and I did not recognize my voice at all,"" Jones tells Weekend Edition Sunday\'s LuLu Garcia-Navarro. \n \n After receiving several phone calls, texts and emails from a producer at Vocabulary.com and other friends, Jones says, ""They explained that it was my voice that has been creating this brouhaha for want of a better word."" \n \n Jones says he actually hears the word, ""Laurel,"" when he listens to the clip of his voice, but a friend of his ""swore up and down that all she heard was \'Yanny.\' "" \n \n ""I think it has to do first of all with what has happened with people\'s computers or listening devices, also how people process sound, which is highly individual,"" he says. \n \n Jones, whose three-decade Broadway career includes a run as an understudy in the musical Cats, also appeared on the television shows, The Michael J. Fox Show and Gotham. Now, he\'s gone viral. \n \n ""I\'m not sure"" I\'ll add this to my resume, Jones says. ""How does one put it? Under the caption, Radio: The \'Laurel\' Guy.""', 'HOUSTON (AP) — The execution of a Texas death row inmate was back on schedule Monday after a federal appeals court ruled that the state doesn\'t have to reveal where it gets its lethal injection drug. \n \n The ruling from the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals means Ramiro Hernandez-Llanas, 44, is set for execution Wednesday. \n \n Attorneys for Hernandez-Llanas and another inmate, Tommy Lynn Sells, had filed a lawsuit last week saying they needed the name of the drug supplier in order to verify the drug\'s potency. They said they feared the prisoners could suffer unconstitutional pain and suffering if the drug weren\'t tested. \n \n The state argued it was protecting the company from threats of violence. \n \n A lower court initially sided with the inmates, but the 5th Circuit reversed that ruling last week for Sells, who was executed Thursday after the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the appeals court decision. The appeals court had said it would rule later on Hernandez-Llanas\' case. \n \n The state attorney general\'s office had urged the 5th Circuit to lift the lower court order, arguing that the new supply of pentobarbital came from a licensed compounding pharmacy. The state also noted that the drug had been used ""painlessly and successfully"" on Sells, and that there was ""no pharmacy, no drug and no assurance of quality that Hernandez would find satisfactory."" \n \n Attorneys have decided not to appeal Monday\'s ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court because the high court turned down the same request from Sells last week, according to Maurie Levin, among the lawyers who filed the drug secrecy lawsuit. \n \n Instead, his lawyers have turned to the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles, arguing that his sentence should be commuted to life in prison or his execution at least delayed because of what they say was faulty testimony from psychologists at his trial. The psychologists told jurors that Hernandez-Llanas was not mentally impaired and would remain a future danger, which his lawyers dispute.']",2,"– If you got a little tired of hearing the recording of ""laurel vs. yanny"" being played last week, just think how Jay Aubrey Jones felt. He happens to be the Broadway and TV actor who recorded the clip for Vocabulary.com back in 2007, reports NPR. And, as has been well established by now, he is, in fact, saying ""laurel,"" though lots of people hear ""yanny."" So what does Jones himself hear? ""Laurel,"" he tells NPR's LuLu Garcia-Navarro, and he adds that he initially didn't recognize his own voice when the clip started making the rounds. ""I think it has to do first of all with what has happened with people's computers or listening devices, also how people process sound, which is highly individual,"" he says of why people are hearing different things. (Wired has a more technical explanation involving the frequency of sounds in the recording.) Jones has been on TV's The Michael J. Fox Show and Gotham, and he has been an understudy in Cats. His acting bio on IMDb now cements his new claim to fame. ""He's the 'Laurel' guy,"" it reads. ""Or is it the 'Yanni' guy."""

394,"['The Obama administration on Tuesday asked Congress for $3.7 billion in emergency funding to address the wave of child immigrants crossing the southwest border. \n \n The figure is much bigger than the $2 billion that administration officials initially floated, and the total $4.3 billion package also includes a request for $615 million for the Department of Agriculture to fight wildfires in the West. \n \n THE WHITE HOUSE \n \n Office of the Press Secretary \n \n FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE \n \n July 8, 2014 \n \n FACT SHEET: Emergency Supplemental Request to Address the Increase in Child and Adult Migration from Central America in the Rio Grande Valley Areas of the Southwest Border \n \n While overall rates of apprehensions across our Southwest border remain at near historic lows, apprehensions and processing of children and individuals from Central America crossing the border in the Rio Grande Valley have continued at high rates. The Administration continues to address this urgent humanitarian situation with a whole-of government response which includes efforts by the Departments of Homeland Security (DHS) and Justice (DOJ) to deploy additional enforcement resources -- including immigration judges, Immigration and Customs Enforcement attorneys, and asylum officers -- to focus on individuals and adults traveling with children from Central America and entering without authorization across the Southwest border. Part of this surge includes detention of adults traveling with children, as well as expanded use of the Alternatives to Detention program, to avoid a more significant humanitarian situation. DHS is working to secure additional space that satisfies applicable legal and humanitarian standards for detention of adults with children. This surge of resources means that cases are processed fairly and as quickly as possible, ensuring the protection of asylum seekers and refugees while enabling the prompt removal of individuals who do not qualify for asylum or other forms of relief from removal. Finally, to attack the criminal organizations and smuggling rings that are exploiting these individuals, agencies are surging law enforcement task forces in cooperation with our international partners, with a focus on stepped-up interdiction and prosecution. \n \n Under the President’s direction, the Administration also continues to work closely with our Mexican and Central American partners to address the root causes of this problem, stem the flow of adults and unaccompanied children into the United States, and expand capacity to receive and reintegrate repatriated migrants. Following the Vice President’s June 20 meeting with leaders from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Mexico, to discuss our shared responsibility for promoting security, these countries committed to working together and with the United States to address the immediate humanitarian situation as well as the long-term challenges. Secretary Kerry met with leaders from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras on July 1st in Panama, and in his remarks highlighted some of the challenges driving migration, the importance of applying the law and combating misinformation, and working together with Central American partners to address these challenges. We are working with our Central American partners, nongovernmental organizations, and other influential voices to send a clear message to potential migrants so that they understand the significant dangers of this journey and to make clear that they are not eligible for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals process or earned citizenship provisions that are part of comprehensive immigration reform pending in the Congress. As part of this effort, we have also committed foreign assistance resources to improve capacity of these countries to receive and reintegrate returned individuals and address the underlying security and economic issues that cause migration. \n \n While the Administration is working across all of these channels, we are eager to work with the Congress to ensure that sufficient resources and authorities exist to continue our efforts. That is why today the President is requesting a $3.7 billion supplemental appropriation focused on: \n \n · Deterrence, including increased detainment and removal of adults with children and increased immigration court capacity to speed cases \n \n · Enforcement, including enhanced interdiction and prosecution of criminal networks, increased surveillance, and expanded collaborative law enforcement task force efforts \n \n · Foreign Cooperation, including improved repatriation and reintegration, stepped-up public information campaigns, and efforts to address the root causes of migration \n \n · Capacity, including increased detainment, care, and transportation of unaccompanied children \n \n The supplemental appropriation broken down below would fund activities at the Departments of, Homeland Security (DHS), Justice (DOJ), State and other International Programs, and Health and Human Services (HHS). \n \n The Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement - $1.1 billion \n \n This proposal would provide the Department of Homeland Security a total of $1.1 billion for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Of this total: \n \n · $116 million would pay for transportation costs associated with the significant rise in apprehensions of unaccompanied children; \n \n · $109 million would provide for immigration and customs enforcement efforts, including expanding the Border Enforcement Security Task Force program, doubling the size of vetted units in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, and expanding investigatory activities by ICE Homeland Security Investigations; and \n \n · $879 million would pay for detention and removal of apprehended undocumented adults traveling with children, expansion of alternatives to detention programs for these individuals, and additional prosecution capacity for adults with children who cross the border unlawfully. \n \n The Department of Homeland Security, Customs and Border Protection - $433 million \n \n This proposal would provide the Department of Homeland Security a total of $433 million for Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Of this total: \n \n · $364 million would pay for operational costs of responding to the significant rise in apprehensions of unaccompanied children and families, including overtime and temporary duty costs for Border Patrol agents, contract services and facility costs to care for children while in CBP custody, and medical and transportation service arrangements; \n \n · $29 million for CBP to expand its role in Border Enforcement Security Task Force programs, increasing information-sharing and collaboration among the participating law enforcement agencies combatting transnational crime; and \n \n · $39.4 million to increase air surveillance capabilities that would support 16,526 additional flight hours for border surveillance and 16 additional crews for unmanned aerial systems to improve detection and interdiction of illegal activity. \n \n The Department of Justice - $64 million \n \n This proposal would provide the Department of Justice a total of $64 million. Of the total: \n \n · $45.4 million would be to hire approximately 40 additional immigration judge teams, including those anticipated to be hired on a temporary basis. This funding would also expand courtroom capacity including additional video conferencing and other equipment in support of the additional immigration judge teams. These additional resources, when combined with the FY 2015 Budget request for 35 additional teams, would provide sufficient capacity to process an additional 55,000 to 75,000 cases annually. \n \n · $2.5 million would be used to expand the legal orientation program that provides assistance to adults and custodians of children in the immigration court system. \n \n · $15 million to provide direct legal representation services to children in immigration proceedings. \n \n · $1.1 million to hire additional immigration litigation attorneys to support Federal agencies involved in detainee admission, regulation, and removal actions. \n \n Department of State and Other International Programs - $300 million \n \n This proposal would provide $300 million to the Department of State. Of the total: \n \n · $295 million would support efforts to repatriate and reintegrate migrants to Central America, to help the governments in the region better control their borders, and to address the underlying root causes driving migration, i.e. creating the economic, social, governance, and citizen security conditions to address factors that are contributing to significant increases in migration to the United States. Beyond initial assistance, continued funding for repatriation and reintegration activities will be contingent on sustained progress and cooperation by the Central American countries. \n \n · $5 million would support State Department media campaigns in Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras, targeting potential migrants and their families. The campaigns will emphasize the dangers of the journey, deliver the message that unaccompanied children are not given a permit to stay in the U.S., and highlight a shared community responsibility for the welfare of unaccompanied children. Funds would also support youth programs to develop skills and leadership among potential migrants. \n \n The Department of Health and Human Services - $1.8 billion \n \n This proposal would provide an additional $1.8 billion for HHS to provide the appropriate care for unaccompanied children, consistent with Federal law, while maintaining services for refugees. With these funds, HHS will have the resources to be able to care for the children currently projected to come into the custody of the Department of Homeland Security while putting in place more stable, cost-effective arrangements for these children going forward. The proposal would also support the ongoing HHS medical response activities for unaccompanied children to address the surge at Border Patrol facilities. \n \n Without supplemental funding, absent undertaking extraordinary measures, agencies will not have sufficient resources to adequately address this situation. HHS will be unable to address the influx of children by securing sufficient shelter capacity with the number of children held at Border Patrol stations continuing to increase, for longer periods of time. Going forward, HHS will be unable to set-up more stable, cost-effective arrangements for these children, Border Patrol agents will have to be re-assigned to child care duties from their border security work, and ICE will lack the resources needed to sufficiently expand detention and removal capacity for adults with children who cross the border illegally. In addition, without additional funds, DOJ will be unable to keep pace with its growing caseload, leading to longer wait times for those cases already on the docket. And absent dedicated resources in Central American countries, we will not make progress on the larger drivers of this humanitarian crisis. For these reasons, supplemental resources are urgently needed to continue forward with the aggressive response that the Administration has deployed to date. \n \n # \n \n Read more from The Hill: \n \n Obama wants $3.7B for border \n \n Read letter from the president', 'AUGUSTA, Ga. -- Tiger Woods got a bad break, took a bad drop, but lived to play the weekend at the Masters -- with two strokes added to his score -- due to a revision to the Rules of Golf made two years ago. \n \n Woods was deemed to have taken an improper drop on the 15th hole during the second round of the Masters at Augusta National on Friday when his approach shot hit the pin and bounced back into the water. \n \n He made a bogey-6 on the hole, which on Saturday morning was revised to a triple-bogey 8. \n \n Instead of a 1-under-par 71 he was given a 73. Woods shot a 70 in the third round Saturday and is at 3 under for the tournament. \n \n Woods explained the situation on Twitter on Saturday morning. \n \n ""At hole #15, I took a drop that I thought was correct and in accordance with the rules,"" Woods wrote. ""I was unaware at that time I had violated any rules. I didn\'t know I had taken an incorrect drop prior to signing my scorecard. Subsequently, I met with the Masters Committee Saturday morning... and was advised they had reviewed the incident prior to the completion of my round. Their initial determination... \n \n was that there was no violation, but they had additional concerns based on my post-round interview. After discussing the situation... \n \n with them this morning, I was assessed a two-shot penalty. I understand and accept the penalty and respect the Committees\' decision."" \n \n Before 2012, Woods would have been disqualified for signing an incorrect scorecard. \n \n Under new rules enacted by the United States Golf Association and R&A; in 2011, a player can have penalty strokes added afterward when facts were not reasonably presented at the time of scorecard signing. \n \n ""This is a logical and important step in our re-evalution of the impact of high-definition video on the game,\'\' said USGA executive director Mike Davis at the time the new rule was announced in August 2011. ""We collectively believe that this revised decision addressed many video-related issues never contemplated by the Rules of Golf.\'\' \n \n Fred Ridley, former president of the USGA and the chairman of the Masters competition committees, detailed the timeline of events surrounding the penalty in a statement released Saturday morning. \n \n ""After being prompted by a television viewer, the Rules Committee reviewed a video of the shot while he was playing the 18th hole,"" Ridley said in the statement. ""At that moment, based on the evidence, the committee determined he had complied with the rules. \n \n ""After he signed his scorecard, and in a television interview subsequent to the round, the player stated that he played further from the point than where he had played his third shot. Such action would constitute playing from the wrong place. \n \n ""The subsequent information provided by the player\'s interview after he had completed play warranted further review and discussion with him this morning. After meeting with the player, it was determined that he had violated Rule 26, and he was assessed a two-stroke penalty. The penalty of disqualification was waived by the committee under Rule 33 as the committee had previously reviewed the information and made it\'s intitial determination prior to the finish of the player\'s round.\'\' \n \n Ridley later said they had consulted with the USGA, which agreed on the decision not to disqualify Woods. \n \n Woods learned of the brewing controversy when his agent notified him by phone early Saturday morning. \n \n Mark Steinberg said he called Woods to discuss the situation, at which point the golfer quickly made arrangements to get to Augusta National and discuss the violation. \n \n ""He came in, didn\'t do it by phone, came in here and explained what happened yesterday,\'\' Steinberg said. ""He was not doing any negotiating. He was coming in to explain himself. Whatever decision was going to be rendered, he was going to respectfully accept it. He abided by the rules of golf.\'\' \n \n Reaction was swift and all over the golf map as the story unfolded overnight and into Saturday morning. \n \n Three-time Masters champion Nick Faldo said on the Golf Channel: ""Tiger should really sit down and think about this and what it will leave on his legacy. Personally, I think this is dreadful. ... That was no intention to drop close to the divot.\'\' \n \n But current players were positive in their reaction, though defending champion Bubba Watson bristled at the idea a TV viewer can change the course of a tournament by calling in with their observations. \n \n Watson, after shooting a third-round 70 to climb to 2 over, said unlike the TV viewer who raised the issue Friday with Masters officials, he wouldn\'t even know who to call if he saw someone breaking a rule. \n \n ""So I don\'t even know how these people get a number to call,"" Watson said. ""And obviously they got more time on their hands than I do, because I don\'t know the number and I\'m playing in the golf tournament."" \n \n Watson said he was glad Rule 33 was adjusted. \n \n ""It should protect us,"" Watson said. ""The sad thing is the high-profile player gets the camera on him at all times. A guy could break a rule and not know he broke the rule. Like me today, there\'s no cameras on me today, everybody could care less what I was doing."" \n \n But Watson said TV viewers shouldn\'t be able to affect how players make rule decisions. \n \n ""So when somebody calls in like that, yeah, it shouldn\'t be that way, it shouldn\'t be allowed,"" Watson said. ""Nobody calls in during a basketball game or a football game."" \n \n Fred Couples called the rule adjustment ""a blessing for every golf pro in the world."" \n \n ""We all know that we\'ll get the same ruling if it happens to one of us,"" said Couples, 1 shot back entering Saturday\'s round. \n \n Graeme McDowell, who at 5 over missed the cut by 1 shot, tweeted Saturday morning that he agreed with the penalty. \n \n ""Take the fact that it was Tiger out of the equation and it is a fair ruling,"" McDowell posted to Twitter. \n \n Hunter Mahan, who shot a second-round 82 and missed the cut at 14 over, also weighed in via Twitter. \n \n ""I like this ruling because he took an illegal drop but no official brought it to his attn,"" Mahan wrote. \n \n Woods was 5-under par and tied for the lead when he played his third shot to the par-5 15th. He had 87 yards to the hole and saw his ball hit the flagstick and then roll back off the green and into the water. \n \n Under Rule 26-1, Woods had three options at the yellow-staked (not lateral) hazard, which is a pond that fronts the green: \n \n • He could have played from a designated drop area, which he chose not to do because he did not like the lie. \n \n • He could drop the ball, keeping the point where it last crossed the margin of the water between the hole and the spot on which the ball would be dropped. Since the ball entered the water well left of Woods\' position from the fairway, Woods did not choose this option – which would have allowed him to drop on a straight line as far back as he wanted. \n \n • Or, he could return to the original spot from which he played, and drop ""as nearly as possible,\'\' from where he played the third shot. \n \n The question appeared to be whether Woods droped the ball as near as possible to his original spot. The ruling said no. \n \n After the round, Woods said: ""I went back to where I played it from, but I went 2yards further back and I took, tried to take two yards off the shot of what I felt I hit.\'\' \n \n Two yards was not close enough. \n \n ""Still not convinced he will play,\'\' said Woods\' former coach, Hank Haney, on Twitter, suggesting that Woods might withdraw. \n \n Woods also had an issue with an improper drop earlier this year at the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship, where a two-stroke penalty caused him to miss the cut. \n \n Woods mistakenly thought he could take relief from an imbedded lie on the fifth hole, and had even sought fellow player Martin Kaymer to ask his opinion. Kaymer agreed, so Woods took a drop. \n \n But later a rules official determined that it was a sandy area, meaning Woods was not entitled to a drop; he should have played it or taken an unplayable lie, a one-stroke penalty. \n \n Woods did not challenge the ruling afterward and the two-shot penalty was added to his score, meaning he went from one stroke inside the cut to missing by one stroke.']",2,"– The UK's National Health Service says desk jockeys should get up and move every 30 minutes to avoid an increased risk of diabetes, cardiovascular problems, and premature death attributed to too much sitting. A new study, however, suggests that may not be necessary. Why? The risk of early death from sitting for long periods is essentially erased with regular exercise, researchers say, per Mashable. The study ""indicates that the problem lies in the absence of movement rather than the time spent sitting itself,"" a researcher says in a release. ""Any stationary posture where energy expenditure is low may be detrimental to health, be it sitting or standing."" One thing to note: The NHS based its recommendation on a study of almost 800,000 people, whereas this latest study surveyed data from about 5,000 UK civil servants. As the participants used London's public transportation, they spent twice as much time walking as the average Briton. They recorded how much time they spent sitting at work and elsewhere, including in front of the TV, over 16 years, making the study ""one of the longest follow-up studies in this area of research,"" per the release. Researchers found no link between sitting and mortality risk. ""Our findings suggest that reducing sitting time might not be quite as important for mortality risk as previously publicized and that encouraging people to be more active should still be a public health priority,"" the lead author says. The Telegraph notes those sit-stand workstations employers are adopting should perhaps be swapped for treadmill desks to promote regular movement. (This professor thinks he's come up with the perfect sit-stand formula.)"

(AP) — A federal judge threw out multiple aspects of Wisconsin\'s voter ID law on Friday, leaving the law itself intact but ruling unconstitutional many restrictions on voting passed by the GOP-controlled Legislature and Republican Gov. Scott Walker. \n \n Two liberal groups filed a lawsuit in May challenging the laws, including a requirement that voters show photo identification. U.S. District Judge James Peterson agreed with arguments that the laws were enacted to benefit Republicans and make it harder for Democratic supporters to vote, and ordered a range of changes. \n \n He ordered the state to quickly issue credentials valid for voting to anyone trying to obtain a free photo ID for voting. He struck down a restriction limiting municipalities to one location for in-person absentee voting, time limits on in-person absentee voting, an increase in residency requirements from 10 to 28 days, and a prohibition on using expired but otherwise qualifying student IDs to vote. \n \n Earlier Friday, a federal appeals court blocked a North Carolina law that required voters to produce photo identification and included other provisions disproportionately affecting black voters. Judges in the Virginia-based 4th Circuit Court of Appeals said the law was enacted ""with discriminatory intent."" \n \n Earlier this month, a federal appeals court ruled that Texas\' strict voter ID law discriminates against minorities and must be weakened before the November elections. And earlier this month, a federal judge in Milwaukee said people without required photo identification can still vote in the Nov. 8 presidential election. That ruling, which isn\'t in place for the Aug. 9 primary, provides a pathway for people having trouble getting photo identification to still vote. \n \n In the Wisconsin lawsuit decided Friday, liberal groups challenged the laws saying they were unconstitutional and discriminate against the poor, racial minorities and younger voters who are more inclined to vote Democratic. They presented evidence at trial attempting to show that Republicans were motivated to pass the laws to suppress Democratic turnout. \n \n The state Department of Justice, which defended the restrictions, countered that they have not suppressed turnout and that the state works hard to ensure everyone who needs a free ID to vote gets one. A spokesman for the agency didn\'t immediately return an email message seeking comment on Friday\'s ruling. \n \n Bobbie Wilson, the lead attorney for the groups that brought the lawsuit, One Wisconsin Institute and Citizen Action of Wisconsin Education Fund Inc., didn\'t immediately respond to a voicemail left at his San Francisco office. \n \n ""We argued Gov.

They\'ve since appeared on the runways of Bottega Veneta ($290 to $360), Michael Kors ($995, but they\'re cashmere), and rag & bone ($255), and made a strong showing for both the spring and fall 2010 seasons. The Wall Street Journal, which has just gotten wind of this trend, is dubious, asking, ""Sweatpants with stilettos?"" Yes, sweatpants with stilettos. \n \n It\'s not a perfect trend, but so few are in their incarnation. One trend analyst pointed to leggings. When they came out, everyone thought only fashion riffraff would wear those, and then they became absolutely huge, and prices easily soared to four figures for the best buttery-leather pairs. In the past five years, the paper might have asked: ""Leggings with mesh panels?"" ""Booties with open toes?"" ""Florals for fall?"" Now we can definitively say yes, yes, and yes. \n \n However, the problem with sweatpants is that not everyone gets them. Leggings, open-toed booties, and florals in the snow may look odd at first, but not necessarily inappropriate and ill-mannered. \n \n ""You should be aware people perceive sweatpants as workout gear,"" cautions Daniel Post Senning, moderator of the question-and-answer blog of etiquette experts Emily Post Institute.

Just wait till next spring when everyone\'s wearing them! \n \n Intrigued after seeing a model wearing the Rag & Bone version, Loren Ridinger, a senior vice president for an Internet marketing company in Miami, purchased a few pairs of Alexander Wang sweatpants in December. ""It\'s all about the heels,"" she says, saying she paired her black sweats with a form-fitting white sweater and black high-heeled ankle booties. ""It takes it to a whole new level."" Her husband, James, initially wasn\'t as sure. ""Where are you going with this? You\'re going to change, right?"" he asked when he spied his wife donning her new $265 army-green sweatpants to meet friends at a restaurant. (Mr. Ridinger says he likes the look now.) Ms. Ridinger, who has since taken her new look to other dinners, parties and work, confesses that people sometimes ask her if she\'s really wearing sweatpants. While some friends and strangers have offered compliments, ""I wonder if [others] think it looks weird,"" she says. \n \n They do, but that\'s the beauty of the sweatpant: Those who ""get it"" know they strut on the forefront of style, while those who don\'t are so behind.

Unlike that presidential debate, no clear winner is being anointed. Some highlights: Testy early: Ryan goes after Obama's response to the Libya attack in particular and foreign policy in general. Biden breaks in: ""With all due respect, that’s a bunch of malarkey, because not a single thing he said was accurate."" One of the things Ryan said: Obama's Mideast policy is ""making the world more chaotic and us less safe."" Unemployment: Ryan points out that unemployment in Biden's hometown of Scranton is 10%, up from 8.5% since Obama took office. “That’s how things are going all across America,” Ryan said. ""That's not how things are going,"" Biden chimed in. Ryan's line ""might have been one of the most powerful punches he threw all night,"" writes Rosalind S. Helderman at the Washington Post. 47 percent: Obama didn't address the matter at his debate, but Biden did. “These people are my mom and dad,” he said. “They pay more effective tax than Gov. Romney pays with his federal income tax.” The Hill Laugh line: Referring to Romney's 47% remarks, Ryan said that as Biden well knows,""sometimes the words don't come out of your mouth the right way."" (But ""I always say what I mean,"" retorted Biden, who added that Romney's ""soliloquy"" on the 47% was no mere mistake.) Taxes: “There aren’t enough rich people and small businesses to tax to pay for all their spending,” Ryan said of his opponents. Addressing the camera, he said, “Watch out middle class, the tax bill is coming to you.” Biden, on the other hand, said the Ryan-Romney plan is the one that would hit ordinary Americans. “The middle class got knocked on their heels. The great recession crushed them. They need some help now.” Ryan zings: ""I know you're under a lot of duress to make up for lost ground, but I think people would be better served if we don't interrupt each other,"" he said in a clear reference to Obama's debate performance.

You may think you know everything about Thin Mints and Caramel deLites. Well, here are a few facts that may enlighten you: \n \n 1. The first Girl Scout cookies were sold in Muskogee, Oklahoma, in 1917, when troops baked cookies and sold them in high schools as a service project. These pioneers had no idea what they had just unleashed on the United States. \n \n 2. The ingredients for a Girl Scout cookie were very simple in 1922: Butter, sugar, eggs, milk, vanilla, flour, salt, and baking powder. That\'s a far cry from today\'s exotic Mango Crèmes with Nutrifusion, which feature a food concentrate made with shitake mushrooms. (Anyone want to bet these won\'t make a return appearance in 2014?) \n \n 3. In 1933, you could get a box of 44 cookies for just 23 cents. \n \n 4. Life was rough in the early 1940s; not only was there a world war raging, but there were also no Girl Scout cookies to be found. Due to shortages of sugar, butter, and flour, the Scouts sold calendars instead. \n \n 5. Today, one-quarter of all Girl Scout cookie sales are Thin Mints. There\'s just something about the chocolate and mint combination that is unbeatable (that, and the fact that Thin Mints have the most cookies in a box). \n \n 6. Two licensed bakeries are in charge of Girl Scout cookies: ABC Bakers and Little Brownie Bakers. That number has decreased dramatically over the years; in the 1940s there were 29 bakers, and in the 1960s, 14. \n \n 7. Depending on your local Girl Scout council (and which baker they purchased from), your cookies are either creatively named or literal: Tagalongs are also known as Peanut Butter Patties; Do-si-dos are Peanut Butter Sandwiches; and Trefoils are Shortbreads. Ever so slightly bucking the trend are Samoas/Caramel deLites. \n \n 8.

Lutfi's attorney told the jury that his client was trying to keep an amphetamine-loving Spears from using drugs, but lost control as she spiraled downward and was turned into a ""scapegoat"" and falsely accused, in Spears' mother's book, of drugging the pop star. Some of the crazier details from yesterday's Lutfi camp opening remarks, from the AP and TMZ: When Lutfi was first hired, his lawyer said, he brought in drug-sniffing dogs to Spears' home and they found a substance Spears admitted was likely crystal meth. The reason for that head-shaving incident? Lutfi claims Britney was so paranoid her hair would hold traces of the drugs she was using, she shaved it all off in an effort not to test positive and lose custody of her sons. Lutfi also says Brit OD'ed on amphetamines in 2008, the night she was placed on a psychiatric hold. The trial—which is not expected to include testimony from Brit herself—comes after years of legal wrangling between Lutfi and the Spears clan; the family got a restraining order against him at one point and another legal battle involving legal fees is also pending.

404,"['On a steamy hot September day in 1955, in a racially segregated courtroom in Sumner, Mississippi, two white men, J.W. Milam and his half-brother Roy Bryant—a country-store owner—were acquitted of the murder of a 14-year-old black Chicago boy. His name was Emmett Till. And in August of that year, while visiting a Deep South that he didn’t understand, Till had entered a store to buy two cents worth of bubble gum. Shortly after exiting, he likely whistled at Bryant’s 21-year-old wife, Carolyn. Enraged, Bryant and Milam took matters into their own hands. They would later admit to local authorities that they’d abducted Till three nights later. And when they finished with him, his body was so hideously disfigured from having been bludgeoned and shot that its horrifying depiction—in a photo in Jet magazine—would help to propel the American civil rights movement. Milam and Bryant were arrested, and, with the aid of NAACP Mississippi field secretary Medgar Evers and other black activists in seeking out witnesses, the prosecution produced compelling evidence. Even so, it wasn’t a surprise when the all-white, all-male jury voted “not guilty,” in little over an hour. Mississippi, after all, had had very few convictions for white-on-black murders. And the state led the nation in lynchings. (Four months after their irreversible acquittal, Milam and Bryant admitted their guilt to Look magazine, receiving a fee of some $3,000 for their story.) But the most explosive testimony, which certainly influenced the local white public’s perception of the motive for the murder, were the incendiary words of Carolyn Bryant, who was working in the store that night. On the stand, she had asserted that Till had grabbed her and verbally threatened her. She said that while she was unable to utter the “unprintable” word he had used (as one of the defense lawyers put it), “he said [he had]’”—done something – “with white women before.’” Then she added, “I was just scared to death.” A version of her damning allegation was also made by the defendant’s lawyers to reporters. (The jury did not hear Carolyn’s words because the judge had dismissed them from the courtroom while she spoke, ruling that her testimony was not relevant to the actual murder. But the court spectators heard her, and her testimony was put on the record because the defense wanted her words as evidence in a possible appeal in the event that the defendants were convicted.) Courtesy of Simon & Schuster. \n \n Down through the decades, Carolyn Bryant Donham (she would divorce, then marry twice more) was a mystery woman. An attractive mother of two young boys, she had spent approximately one minute alone with Till before, in view of others, the alleged whistling had occurred. (He may not have whistled; he was said to have a lisp.) Carolyn then dropped out of sight, never speaking to the media about the incident. But she is hidden no more. In a new book, The Blood of Emmett Till (Simon & Schuster), Timothy Tyson, a Duke University senior research scholar, reveals that Carolyn—in 2007, at age 72—confessed that she had fabricated the most sensational part of her testimony. “That part’s not true,” she told Tyson, about her claim that Till had made verbal and physical advances on her. As for the rest of what happened that evening in the country store, she said she couldn’t remember. (Carolyn is now 82, and her current whereabouts have been kept secret by her family.) Tyson’s book, to be published next week, was preceded by the definitive study of the case, Devery S. Anderson’s masterful Emmett Till: The Murder That Shocked the World and Propelled the Civil Rights Movement, which was published in 2015 by the University Press of Mississippi. (Last week, John Edgar Wideman’s meditation on Till, Writing to Save a Life, was named a finalist for a National Book Critics Circle Award.) Still, no author save Tyson has ever interviewed Carolyn Bryant Donham. (Her ex-husband and brother-in-law are both dead.) “That case went a long way toward ruining her life,” Tyson contends, explaining that she could never escape its notoriety. His compelling book is suffused with information that Donham, over coffee and pound cake, shared with him in what he calls a “confessional” spirit. Carolyn, in fact, had approached Tyson because she was writing her memoirs. (Her manuscript is in the Southern Historical Collection at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill library archives and will not be available for public view until 2036, according to Tyson.) Her daughter had admired Tyson’s earlier book, Blood Does Sign My Name, about another racism-inspired murder committed by someone known to Tyson’s family. And Tyson himself, a Southern preacher’s son, says that when he sat down with Carolyn, she “could have fit in at a Tyson family reunion”—even at its local church. Clearly, he observed, she had been altered by the social and legal advances that had overtaken the South in the intervening half century. “She was glad things had changed [and she] thought the old system of white supremacy was wrong, though she had more or less taken it as normal at the time.” She didn’t officially repent; she was not the type to join any racial reconciliation groups or to make an appearance at the new Emmett Till Interpretive Center, which attempts to promote understanding of the past and point a way forward. But as Carolyn became reflective in Timothy Tyson’s presence, wistfully volunteering, “Nothing that boy did could ever justify what happened to him.” She also admitted she “felt tender sorrow,” Tyson would note, “for Mamie Till-Mobley”—Emmett Till’s mother, who died in 2003 after a lifetime spent crusading for civil rights. (She had bravely insisted that her son’s casket remain open at his funeral in order to show America what had been done to him.) “When Carolyn herself [later] lost one of her sons, she thought about the grief that Mamie must have felt and grieved all the more.” Tyson does not say whether Carolyn was expressing guilt. Indeed, he asserts that for days after the murders, and until the trial, she was kept in seclusion by her husband’s family. But that “tender sorrow” does sound, in its way, like late-blooming regret. However meaningful an appearance Carolyn Bryant Donham makes in Tyson’s book, she has receded into her private life. This is unfortunate. Her changed attitude, if genuine, might have real meaning today, what with a polarized electorate, renewed racial tensions, and organizations and Web sites promoting white supremacy.', 'Carolyn Bryant Donham has finally ended her silence about the Emmett Till murder in 1955, and that’s reason enough for “The Blood of Emmett Till,” the new book about the case from Duke University professor Timothy B. Tyson. \n \n But there’s a problem: The former Money, Miss., grocery store keeper who was dubbed a crossroads Marilyn Monroe hasn’t completely come clean, if Tyson’s book is any indication. \n \n It also turns out that she has written a memoir, “More Than a Wolf Whistle: The Story of Carolyn Bryant Donham,” but it will not be available to scholars until 2038, at her request. It’s being housed, along with Tyson’s notes about his interview with her for the new book, at the Southern Historical Collection at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. \n \n As many people know, Donham was known in 1955 as Carolyn Bryant, the wife of Roy Bryant, who grew up in a clan of bootleggers and grocery store owners whose main shoppers were the poor black sharecroppers of the Delta. One summer afternoon, when Roy and his half-brother J.W. Milam were on a trip, the 14-year-old Till entered the store and reportedly made ugly remarks and grabbed Carolyn Bryant by the waist, saying he’d been with white women before. Till, who lived in Chicago, was visiting relatives near Money that summer. \n \n The affront was deemed serious enough that Roy Bryant and Milam kidnapped Till from his relatives’ home, then beat him up and took him to a barn on property managed by one of Milam’s brothers. There, they and others apparently tortured Till, then shot him in the head, tied a gin fan around his neck and threw his body in the Tallahatchie River. \n \n When the body was found by a fisherman and returned to his mother in Chicago, she was horrified at what she saw – and decided to hold an open-casket funeral and allow photographs of her son. Those photos — and the brutality that they exposed — caused an international uproar. \n \n But Mississippi was outraged by the uproar, and even more irritated that the state was being criticized for its way of life. An all-white, all-male jury acquitted Bryant and Milam. Then the two agreed to talk to journalist William Bradford Huie, who paid the men for their story. They described Till’s killing in detail. But they left out the part about others being involved in the torture. \n \n Ever since the trial, Donham has refused to give interviews or talk about her lurid testimony. In the new book, she tells Tyson that she made some of it up — in particular the grabbing of the waist. \n \n “I want to tell you” what happened that day at the store, Donham tells Tyson in the opening chapter. “Honestly, I just don’t remember. It was 50 years ago. You tell these stories for so long that they seem true, but that part (the grabbing of the waist) is not true.” \n \n She goes on to say, however: “Nothing that boy did could ever justify what happened to him.” \n \n Donham also tells Tyson that neither her former husband nor Milam fired the fatal shot into Till’s head. Instead, she says that Roy Bryant’s brother, Raymond, told her that the shot was fired by Melvin Campbell, who was J.W. Milam’s brother-in-law and apparently at the barn that night. All of those mentioned by Donham are dead. \n \n Tyson does an admirable job of condensing and updating information about the case, using a 2006 FBI report on Till’s murder to weave together a historical tapestry. But Tyson doesn’t press Donham on her role in the events surrounding the death. Interestingly, Tyson also does not discuss the doubts that FBI agents had about Donham’s truthfulness when they interviewed her about Till back in the early 2000s. \n \n The definitive book about the case is “Emmett Till: The Murder That Shocked the World and Propelled the Civil Rights Movement,” by Devery S. Anderson. And Anderson believes that Milam fired the fatal shot, despite Donham’s account. \n \n But Anderson says we’ll never know for sure. And the shooter isn’t the only one who was guilty. Everyone who was in the barn that night participated in the killing in one way or another. And the jury that freed Bryant and Milam has to share some of the blame. So does America. \n \n Sadly, the events of 1955 still seem to be haunting the nation today.']",2,"– When 14-year-old Emmett Till walked into a Mississippi store in August 1955, the black teen had no clue that his entrance would lead to his untimely death. And little did anyone in 2017 anticipate that, decades later, the white woman whose words sealed his fate would partly recant her explosive accusations. Sheila Weller revisits for Vanity Fair the story of the boy who helped launch the civil rights movement, as well as the story of Carolyn Bryant Donham, the shopkeeper's wife who back then alleged Emmett had whistled at her, grabbed her by the waist, and said, ""You needn't be afraid of me, baby. I've [slept] with white women before."" His supposed actions led her then-husband, Roy Bryant, and his half-brother, JW Milam, to seek Emmett out to torture and murder him—charges for which they were acquitted, but which they admitted to for a paid magazine article a few months later. But Weller talks to Timothy Tyson, whose book The Blood of Emmett Till comes out next week, and Tyson says when he interviewed Donham in 2007, the then-72-year-old admitted she'd made up the worst bits of her story. ""That part's not true,"" she told Tyson of the waist-grabbing and sexual talk Emmett had purportedly engaged in. Donham, who was writing her own memoirs—which won't be released until 2036, per Tyson—had since come out against white supremacy and told Tyson, ""Nothing that boy did could ever justify what happened to him."" Weller says Donham, now 82 and living in seclusion, didn't go so far as to mention to Tyson that she felt guilty. Weller notes her words, and Tyson's book, have given us ""reason to revisit a period in our history when bigotry, blood, and sacrifice became a call to action."" Read the full story at Vanity Fair.

Over here, it’s all about the red snapper. \n \n That tempting seafood delight glistening on the ice at the market, or sizzling at the restaurant table in its aromatic jacket of garlic and ginger? It may not be at all what you think, or indeed even close, according to a big new study of fish bought and genetically tested in 12 parts of the country — in restaurants, markets and sushi bars — by a nonprofit ocean protection group, Oceana. \n \n In the 120 samples labeled red snapper and bought for testing nationwide, for example, 28 different species of fish were found, including 17 that were not even in the snapper family, according to the study, which was released Thursday. \n \n The study also contained surprises about where consumers were most likely to be misled — sushi bars topped the list in every city studied — while grocery stores were most likely to be selling fish honestly. Restaurants ranked in the middle. \n \n Part of the problem, said the study’s chief author, Kimberly Warner, is that there are quite simply a lot of fish in the sea, and many of them look alike. Over all, the study found that about one-third of the 1,215 fish samples bought, from 2010 to 2012, were mislabeled. \n \n “Even a relatively educated consumer couldn’t look at a whole fish and say, ‘I’m sure that’s a red snapper and not lane snapper,’ ” she said. \n \n Geographically, the study had bad news for residents of Southern California, land of the midnight sushi. They were more likely than residents in any of the other sampled regions to be eating something other than what they had been told. About 52 percent of the samples bought and sent for testing turned out to be something else. \n \n Salmon-crazed Seattle, by contrast, was tied with cod-country Boston as having the lowest deception rates. Still, almost one in five fish samples were wrongly labeled. \n \n Some types of fish fared worse in different places. In New York, for example, fish that was not really tuna was being passed off as tuna in 94 percent of the samples taken, the study said. \n \n What is in a name, anyway, when it comes to fish? Shakespeare might not have pondered the question exactly, but the seafood industry certainly has. \n \n In the real world of perception and marketing, a fish called “slimehead” — a real name, by the way — is probably not going to fly off the menu. Far better to call it “orange roughy,” a distinction allowed by the Federal Food and Drug Administration. The government also allows Patagonian toothfish, real name, to be called Chilean sea bass, invented marketing name. \n \n The Oceana study did not declare a fish mislabeled if the seller was following the federal guidelines. \n \n But what the study found pervasive was mislabeling — beyond what is allowed by federal food regulators — by retail outlets using a name that consumers are more likely to want to buy. Almost two-thirds of the “wild” salmon samples, for example, were found actually to be farmed Atlantic salmon, which is considered less healthy and environmentally sustainable. \n \n The National Fisheries Institute, a trade group, said in a statement that reputable members of the seafood community are fighting fraud, and that the federal government should “fulfill its mandate,” to enforce food fraud laws already on the books. \n \n Dr. Warner said that the study did raise some red flags about health. Fish known to accumulate mercury in their flesh, in particular, should be avoided, especially by pregnant women. But in what the study called “one of the most egregious swaps,” in New York, tilefish — known for its mercury content and on federal advisory lists for sensitive populations to avoid — was sold as red snapper. Tilefish was also found substituted for halibut. \n \n She also cautioned that the study did not aim to produce a real scientific, top-to-bottom sampling of the seafood system. In Boston, for example, only grocery store fish were tested, leaving out sushi bars that might have lowered the city’s honesty rate (although, in a separate effort in 2011 and 2012, The Boston Globe found widespread mislabeling in stores and restaurants). \n \n And the Oceana study’s authors also could not determine where in the food chain the mislabeling arose — the wholesaler, the retailer or at the fishing dock itself — or whether it came about through misunderstanding or deliberate concealment. \n \n A common pattern, though, Dr. Warner said, was economic gain at the consumer’s expense, with understudy fish — tilapia, in particular — often substituting for a menu’s star, without a word to the audience."", 'One tenant told FBI investigators that “it was obvious that she had not been discriminated against since she, in fact, a Negro female, had been rented an apartment” at one of the buildings owned by Trump Management Co., documents say. \n \n Many of the interviewees said that they had never seen any discrimination against African-Americans or Puerto Ricans. \n \n The FBI released the documents on an area of its website called ""The Vault,"" a section dedicated to topics on which the bureau has received a large volume of Freedom of Information Act requests. \n \n However, one employee told investigators that he or she had been specifically directed by the elder Trump to screen applicants and not “rent to blacks” and to steer them to other buildings. \n \n “I asked Fred Trump what his policy was regarding minorities and he said it was absolutely against the law to discriminate. At a later time during my two weeks at [one Trump building], Fred Trump told me not to rent to blacks,” said the unnamed employee, who was eventually fired. \n \n “[Trump] also wanted me to get rid of the blacks that were in the building by telling them cheap housing was available for them at only $500 down payment, which Trump would offer to pay himself. Trump didn’t tell me where this housing was located,” he said. \n \n The employee also noted that he or she thought that the rental office often wrote codes on the top of rental applications to distinguish between black and white applicants. \n \n Other documents in the case against Trump, reviewed by the Post last year, corroborate the employee’s account. \n \n The court documents detail the experience of a husband and wife who rented properties, who said they had been told the Trump Management Co. “wanted to rent only to Jews and Executives’ and ‘discouraged rental to blacks,’” according to the Post. “The couple told the government’s lawyers that they were advised that ‘a racial code was in effect, blacks being referred to as ‘No. 9.’” \n \n The FBI noted that several building managers did not have fair housing law posters in their offices, as required by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and told agents they were not aware they had to have them. \n \n Many employees stated they had not been instructed to discriminate against applicants based on race and maintained that income became the primary reason that individuals were denied apartments. One employee remarked that some income requirements seemed too high. \n \n As noted by a Politico report, a man who had previously been a doorman at one property said that a supervisor had instructed him to tell potential African-American tenants that the rent was ""twice as much as it really was, in order that he could not afford the apartment.” \n \n Other employees and tenants offered up observations of “Negros, Puerto Ricans and Orientals” living in the buildings. \n \n In June 1973, FBI agents were ordered “to give this case preferred attention on a daily basis.” \n \n The bureau created a new set of criteria that it needed answered for the case. If anyone previously interviewed had not been asked those questions, they needed to be re-interviewed, a memo said. \n \n For example, they began to ask employees about “phony leases” arrangements used to discriminate against minorities. A large portion of employees of Trump’s company interviewed by the FBI denied having any knowledge of these tools. \n \n One former building superintendent, interviewed in 1974, told investigators that the “phony lease” technique had been used by other superintendents employed by Trump during his tenure with the company, but refused to name names. \n \n “He would only state he had heard this from more than two superintendents and was of the opinion it was a common practice.” However, he denied that racial discrimination was encouraged by the company and said that he did not know of any person rejected on the basis of race. \n \n Many of the pages released by the FBI contain redactions, primarily for privacy and law enforcement reasons. Because the documents are dated — and some notes are hand-written — some are illegible. \n \n Eventually, the government and Trump Management entered into a consent decree in June 1975. \n \n The Trumps admitted no wrongdoing and were prohibited from “discriminating against any person in the terms, conditions, or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling.” They were also required to take out advertisements notifying minority individuals that they had an equal opportunity to seek housing at Trump properties. \n \n Both the federal government and Trump hailed the settlement as a victory. \n \n Updated at 9:50 a.m.']",2,"– A widow is suing two Buffalo-area hospitals and doctors in each after her 46-year-old husband was erroneously declared dead last year—and no one believed her when she insisted he was alive, the Democrat and Chronicle reports.

406,"['A fleck of iridescent zircon that is embedded in a piece of trachyte. The zircon is up to 3 billion years old, while the trachyte is about 6 million years old. The traces of zircon reveal that a lost continent is lurking beneath Mauritius. \n \n It\'s official: A 3-billion-year-old ""lost continent"" lurks beneath the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius, new research confirms. \n \n Sparkly, iridescent flecks of rocks known as zircons from Mauritius date back billions of years, to one of the earliest periods in Earth\'s history, the researchers found. Other rocks on the island, by contrast, are no more than 9 million years old. \n \n ""The fact that we have found zircons of this age proves that there are much older crustal materials under Mauritius that could only have originated from a continent,"" Lewis Ashwal, lead author of the new study and a geologist at the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg in South Africa, said in a statement. \n \n Earth\'s crust is made up of two parts: the planet\'s continents, which rise high above the oceans because they are composed of lighter rocks such as granite; and the ocean basins, which sink lower because they are made up of denser rocks such as basalt, according to a video about the new study. Whereas the continental crust may be 4 billion years old, oceanic crust is much younger, and is continually being formed as molten rock spews through fissures in the ocean floor, called midocean ridges. [See Photos of the World\'s Weirdest Geologic Formations] \n \n The traditional thinking is that the island of Mauritius was formed by volcanic activity stemming from one of these midocean ridges, meaning older crust shouldn\'t be there. \n \n But the new study suggests that a tiny sliver of a primeval continent might have been left behind when the supercontinent Gondwana split up into Africa, India, Australia and Antarctica more than 200 million years ago. Then, the fiery birth of the island blanketed the primeval rock in layer after layer of cooling lava, building up the bulk of the island that is visible today, the researchers said. \n \n ""According to the new results, this breakup did not involve a simple splitting of the ancient supercontinent of Gondwana, but rather a complex splintering took place, with fragments of continental crust of variable sizes left adrift within the evolving Indian Ocean basin,"" Ashwal said. \n \n The new findings buttress results from a 2013 study that also found traces of ancient zircons in beach sand on the relatively young island. However, critics contended that this zircon could have traveled there in trade winds or been carried along on someone\'s shoes. In the new study, however, the zircons were found embedded in 6-million-year-old rock known as trachyte, ruling out the notion of wind-blown transfer, Ashwal said. \n \n The findings were published Tuesday Jan. 31 in the journal Nature Communications. \n \n Originally published on Live Science.', '""Lost continent"" found under Mauritius \n \n Lava-covered piece of continent is an ancient remnant, left over from the break-up of the supercontinent, Gondwana, which started about 200 million years ago. \n \n Scientists have confirmed the existence of a “lost continent” under the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius that was left-over by the break-up of the supercontinent, Gondwana, which started about 200 million years ago. \n \n The piece of crust, which was subsequently covered by young lava during volcanic eruptions on the island, seems to be a tiny piece of ancient continent, which broke off from the island of Madagascar, when Africa, India, Australia and Antarctica split up and formed the Indian Ocean. \n \n “We are studying the break-up process of the continents, in order to understand the geological history of the planet,” says Wits geologist, Professor Lewis Ashwal, lead author on the paper “Archaean zircons in Miocene oceanic hotspot rocks establish ancient continental crust beneath Mauritius”, published in the prestigious journal Nature Communications. \n \n By studying the mineral, zircon, found in rocks spewed up by lava during volcanic eruptions, Ashwal and his colleagues Michael Wiedenbeck from the German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ) and Trond Torsvik from the University of Oslo, guest scientist at GFZ, have found that remnants of this mineral were far too old to belong on the island of Mauritius. \n \n “Earth is made up of two parts – continents, which are old, and oceans, which are “young”. On the continents you find rocks that are over four billion years old, but you find nothing like that in the oceans, as this is where new rocks are formed,” explains Ashwal. “Mauritius is an island, and there is no rock older than 9 million years old on the island. However, by studying the rocks on the island, we have found zircons that are as old as 3 billion years.” \n \n Zircons are minerals that occur mainly in granites from the continents. They contain trace amounts of uranium, thorium and lead, and due to the fact that they survive geological process very well, they contain a rich record of geological processes and can be dated extremely accurately. \n \n “The fact that we have found zircons of this age proves that there are much older crustal materials under Mauritius that could only have originated from a continent,” says Ashwal. \n \n This is not the first time that zircons that are billions of years old have been found on the island. A study done in 2013 has found traces of the mineral in beach sand. However, this study received some criticism, including that the mineral could have been either blown in by the wind, or carried in on vehicle tyres or scientists’ shoes. \n \n “The fact that we found the ancient zircons in rock (6-million-year-old trachyte), corroborates the previous study and refutes any suggestion of wind-blown, wave-transported or pumice-rafted zircons for explaining the earlier results,” says Ashwal. \n \n Ashwal suggests that there are many pieces of various sizes of “undiscovered continent”, collectively called “Mauritia”, spread over the Indian Ocean, left over by the breakup of Gondwanaland. \n \n “According to the new results, this break-up did not involve a simple splitting of the ancient super-continent of Gondwana, but rather, a complex splintering took place with fragments of continental crust of variable sizes left adrift within the evolving Indian Ocean basin.” \n \n Gondwanaland \n \n Gondwanaland is a super-continent that existed more than 200 million years ago and contained rocks as old as 3.6 billion years old, before it split up into what are now the continents of Africa, South America, Antarctica, India and Australia. The split-up occurred because of the geological process of plate tectonics. This is the process where the ocean basin is in continuous motion, and moves between 2 cm and 11 cm per year. Continents ride on the plates that make up the ocean floor, which causes the movement of the continents. \n \n Mauritius \n \n Known as a tropical holiday destination, Mauritius is a volcanic island, formed by the eruption of volcanoes starting at about nine million years ago. The island forms part of a string of islands, formed by a stationary hotspot (volcano), presently located at Réunion Island. Originating from deep within the earth, the hotspot stays stationary while the ocean’s tectonic plates move across it, creating a string of volcanic islands.', 'These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

So, too, was a ""lost continent"" scientists say is now hiding beneath the island nation of Mauritius. In a video, Lewis Ashwal of South Africa's University of the Witwatersrand explains the oldest rock on Earth exists in continents, while younger rocks form the ocean basins. Formed with volcanic eruptions in the Indian Ocean, Mauritius is also made up of young rock less than 9 million years old, per a release. But remarkably, scientists have found that rock contains minerals that date back 3 billion years to ""one of the earliest periods in Earth's history,"" per Live Science. These minerals known as zircons prove ""there are much older crustal materials under Mauritius that could only have originated from a continent,"" says Ashwal, whose research is published in Nature. He believes Zircons found on a tiny fragment of Gondwana that separated from Madagascar were covered by lava during the volcanic eruptions that created Mauritius before the lava solidified into the Mauritius we see today, hiding the older materials beneath. This suggests ""a complex splintering [of Gondwana] took place, with fragments of continental crust of variable sizes left adrift within the evolving Indian Ocean basin.""

407,"['Attorney General Ken Paxton has suggested that he doesn\'t owe Neel Lane attorneys\' fees in a lawsuit Lane won to lift Texas\'s ban on gay marriage in 2014. thinkstock.com \n \n Attorney Neel Lane isn\'t asking the state for much but compliance with the law—and $741,000 in attorney\'s fees and costs, which Attorney General Ken Paxton has suggested he doesn\'t owe. \n \n Lane represented a lesbian couple in their fight against Texas\'s ban on same-sex marriage in February 2014. U.S. District Judge Orlando Garcia ruled in the couple\'s favor, calling the state\'s same-sex marriage ban unconstitutional. His decision was put on hold while the state appealed But that appeal never got past opening arguments. When the Supreme Court legalized gay marriage in all 50 states this past June, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals lifted Garcia\'s stay and affirmed his decision. Lane and his clients took that as an official W. And so last week, Lane filed a motion to declare his entitlement to attorneys\' fees as the prevailing party. \n \n But in a meeting with Lane and his team, Paxton apparently said that the state lifted its ban on gay marriage because of Obergefell v. Hodges—not the February 2014 case, DeLeon v. Perry. And so no awards for Lane. “He can continue to resist and battle if he wishes,” Lane said of Paxton, “but he\'s going to lose.” \n \n University of Houston Law Professor Peter Linzer would have to agree. Linzer said that, even if the state conceded with the plaintiffs following the Supreme Court ruling, and even if the state lifted the gay marriage ban specifically in response to the Supreme Court ruling, that doesn\'t change anything about Lane\'s victory in 2014. “The fact remains: These people brought the case before it was clear case law,” Linzer said. “They put themselves on the line. They put money on the line. And they won.” \n \n Lane and the plaintiffs filed the suit as a violation of the couple\'s Fourteenth Amendment rights—and a federal law passed in 1976 notes that the prevailing party in civil cases like that have a right to attorneys\' fees and costs. “The attorney\'s fees provision is there to protect people who go to court who try and vindicate constitutional rights and are successful,” Linzer said. “They did all those things."" \n \n Across the country, any same-sex marriage bans in effect—or any same-sex marriage cases pending appeal—were either reversed or dismissed. Attorneys who fought those battles have already been awarded such fees. In West Virginia, the state paid attorneys almost $100,000. Tulsa County in Florida paid attorneys almost $300,000. In South Carolina: $135,000 to attorneys. North Dakota: $58,000. And even in Louisiana, where a 2004 ban on gay marriage was upheld in January in U.S. district court—the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ordered the district judge to reverse his ruling following Obergefell, and attorneys told the Times-Picayune they would be getting their $330,000 from the state. Attorneys in Kentucky aimed a little higher: They\'ve asked for $2 million. \n \n This isn\'t the first time Paxton has been obstinate in complying with any gay-marriage-related requests following the Supreme Court ruling. Last month, Paxton faced contempt of court after telling John Stone-Hoskins, whom Lane represented, that he couldn\'t get his husband\'s death certificate amended to reflect their marriage, because Obergefell didn\'t apply retroactively. That argument didn\'t go very far. Now, after promising to comply with Obergefell, he\'s trying to tell an Austin woman that she can\'t claim a portion of her deceased spouse\'s estate because their marriage wasn\'t legal while she was alive. If this indicates anything, it\'s as either that Paxton is relentless or entirely unconcerned about paying winning parties their legal fees. \n \n Judge Garcia will decide whether to grant Lane and his team the fees, and can also choose to raise or lower the amount as well. In the motion Lane filed with Garcia\'s Western Texas district court, he noted that financial gain was not the purpose of filing the suit in the first place, and that even though his firm\'s hourly rates (up to $500) might seem high, their task was just as elevated. \n \n “Our task on behalf of our clients was to attack and uproot unjust laws that were tightly embraced by the entire elected state-wide leadership of Texas,a state with virtually unlimited resources to defend those unjust laws,” he wrote. “Had the State of Texas not deprived our clients of their constitutional rights, they in turn would not have had to engage attorneys, and this motion for attorneys\' fees and costs would have been unnecessary.” \n \n A spokesperson with the attorney general\'s office said they would be filing a response to Lane\'s motion soon.

Mitt Romney has avoided paying taxes, comparing it to McCarthyism. \n \n “I’m telling you authoritatively, speaking on the behalf of the governor, that those charges are untrue, they are baseless, and there is nothing to back them up,” Fehrnstrom told “America’s Newsroom” on Fox News. \n \n \n \n Reid earlier this week claimed an investor from Romney’s former private-equity firm Bain Capital called his office to tell the senator that Romney had avoided paying income taxes for a decade. Reid doubled down on the claim Wednesday, but refused to identify his source.Romney has said he has always paid what he owed in taxes, and on Thursday Fehrnstrom noted that the candidate has addressed the issue of his tax returns multiple times. \n \n “This reminds me of the McCarthy hearings back in the 1950s,” Fehrnstrom said, referring to former Sen. Joseph McCarthy (R-Wis.), who led a controversial search for communist sentiment during the Cold War. “I would ask [Reid] one simple question: ‘Have you no sense of decency, sir? Is there nothing that you won’t do to debase yourself and the office you hold in the name of dirty politics?’ ” \n \n \n \n President Obama’s campaign and Democrats have pointed to Romney\'s refusal to release more tax returns as evidence he is running a “secretive” campaign. Romney says the two years of tax returns he has released are sufficient. \n \n \n \n House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) also pushed back on Reid’s charge on Thursday, saying “it clearly is not a fact, and I would think that the Senate majority leader would be smart enough to know that."" \n \n Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) called the accusations ""beneath the dignity of [Reid\'s] office."" \n \n \n \n “I think the Majority Leader has more important things to do than use the Senate as a forum for his baseless accusations,"" he told the Daily Caller. \n \n \n \n Fehrnstrom said Romney does not immediately plan to address the accusations himself. The presumptive GOP nominee is on the campaign trail in Colorado. \n \n \n \n “Mitt Romney has gone above and beyond what the law requires in providing financial disclosure,” Fehrnstrom said. “We’ve published all of that information on our website. It includes hundreds of pages of tax return information. He put out his 2010 return. He is preparing to put out his 2011 return. That is two years\' worth of tax information. It is exactly what [Sen.] John McCain [(R-Ariz.)] did when he was a candidate four years ago and this is all part of the Obama campaign’s strategy of distraction. They want to distract people’s attention from what really matters which is the bad state of the economy.” \n \n Updated at 3:25 p.m.']",2,"– Attorneys who fought for the rights of same-sex couples around the country want taxpayers to know how much their lawmakers cost them by obstinately waging a losing battle against gay marriage, Al Jazeera America reports. In the wake of the Supreme Court ruling this summer, lawyers for the plaintiffs in multiple same-sex marriage cases—who mostly worked pro bono—are using a 1976 law that allows them to collect ""reasonable attorney's fees"" from local governments should they win their case. “Some of the tactics the state used were unnecessarily dragging out the time spent and the cost of the litigation. You have government officials who knew very well where this was headed and nonetheless defended these discriminatory laws,"" one lawyer tells Al Jazeera. “It’s the price governments pay for defending bigotry,"" says another. Seven states have already paid attorneys more than $3.5 million in total, and at least four other states could be on the hook for nearly $5 million in fees, Al Jazeera reports. Texas, which appealed after one of its own judges ruled its same-sex marriage ban was unconstitutional, is refusing to pay the requested $741,000 in legal fees, according to the Houston Press. But experts believe the state will likely be forced to pay in the end. ""The attorney's fees provision is there to protect people who go to court who try and vindicate constitutional rights and are successful,"" says one such expert. “This is exactly what Congress created this law for,” adds another. “It’s a recognition that people need lawyers to fight the government, which has lots of lawyers, when they feel their civil rights are being violated. To encourage lawyers to take these cases, you need to provide the potential to get paid in the end."""

Schon says the city didn't want the couple's wedding at the ""historic venue"" of the Palace of Fine Arts to be broadcast, and thus boosted the fees: $35,000 in rental fees, a $100,000 ""premium reservation fee,"" and a $50,000 ""park regeneration fee.""

Schon says he was also charged $25,000 for a filming permit, even though Dawn of the Planet of the Apes was only charged $1,200 to film. The lawsuit says the heightened fees are illegal, and notes that the couple was discriminated against for exercising ""their free speech rights.""

It isn\'t quite as big as our kitchen fridge and it isn\'t the flashy stainless steel. But inside, it contains wonders. \n \n There\'s plenty of milk and OJ, of course, for a family with three growing kids. There\'s extra bread, bagels, yogurt, strawberries and baby carrots. But there\'s also beer and white wine chilling, and in the freezer there\'s a bountiful stash of frozen pizzas, waffles, meatballs, ice cream sandwiches and popsicles. \n \n Today, our extra fridge has a special responsibility: it\'s holding a fat 20-pound turkey, enough to feed the 18 extended family members we\'re hosting at our house for a Thanksgiving feast. \n \n And so, this Thanksgiving, I am especially thankful for our humble second fridge, for it is a symbol of the bounty of our great land. My family is fortunate — we do not worry about where the next meal is coming from.

According to a recent report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, an estimated 14.3 percent of households were ""food insecure"" at some point in 2013. That means that 17.5 million Americans lacked access to enough food for an active, healthy life for all household members. An estimated 6.8 million American homes had ""very low food security,"" which, according to the USDA, means that limited resources reduced their food intake and disrupted their normal eating patterns. \n \n Closer to home, one of six Cook County residents have tapped into the Greater Chicago Food Depository\'s network of pantries, soup kitchens and shelters to help get enough to eat, according to a 2014 survey from Feeding America, the country\'s largest provider of charitable food assistance. \n \n The numbers are even more staggering worldwide. Roughly 1 in 8 people — some 842 million total — around the globe suffered from chronic hunger from 2011 to 2013, according to the United Nations. Malnutrition and hunger-related diseases account for 6.5 million deaths of children under 5 in developing countries each year. \n \n I don\'t mean to be a downer. But part of being thankful is being aware of the graces bestowed upon us — and perhaps, in whatever way we can, reaching out to help those who have been less fortunate. \n \n Believe me, I am looking forward to getting together with family and overindulging in turkey, mashed potatoes and stuffing doused in an unholy helping of gravy. There will be cranberry sauce and green beans. Belt buckles will be loosened. And, just when we think we can\'t possibly eat anything more, we\'ll find a little room for a slice of pumpkin pie. \n \n And when it\'s all over, there will be the leftovers, oh those wonderful Thanksgiving leftovers, downstairs in our beloved second fridge. \n \n Dr. John Biemer, a former Chicago Tribune reporter, is a resident in pathology at Loyola University Medical Center in Maywood.', 'These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

Older refrigerators are considerably less energy efficient, and even more so if they're not packed with food, or if they sit in a utility area where they have to work harder to stay cool in the summers.

In an interview shared by Texas Children's Hospital with CNN, the Texas mom, who already had three kids at home, was told during that doctor's visit that her fetus had a rare condition in which a tumor grows out of the base of the tailbone. Although the fetus can sometimes withstand the tumor until after birth, it can compete for blood to the point of killing the fetus, says Dr. Darrell Cass of Texas Children's Fetal Center. Boemer had already had complications, and she didn't want to terminate the pregnancy, as some doctors suggested—so her baby was ""born"" twice instead. Translation: Boemer opted for risky fetal surgery in which the fetus, by then almost 24 weeks, was taken out of her uterus in a five-hour procedure. The fetus was ""hanging out in the air,"" Cass explains, while doctors removed most of the tumor; People notes the fetus was outside of the womb for about 20 minutes. Doctors then returned the fetus back to its corporeal home and stitched everything back up. Per NBC Chicago, blood started flowing normally, and little Lynlee was born healthy via C-section at 36 weeks in June. Doctors removed the tumor remnants when Lynlee was eight days old, and now, at 4 months, she's recuperating at home after a few weeks in the NICU.

Republicans are focused on cutting taxes instead of deficits as they look to power a $4.1 billion budget plan through the House on Thursday. (AP... (Associated Press) \n \n WASHINGTON (AP) — The National Rifle Association announced its support Thursday for regulating ""bump stocks,"" devices that can effectively convert semi-automatic rifles into fully automated weapons and that were apparently used in the Las Vegas massacre to lethal effect. It was a surprising shift for the leading gun industry group, which in recent years has resolutely opposed any gun regulations. Immediately afterward the White House, too, said it was open to such a change. \n \n The NRA announcement followed comments from leading congressional Republicans including House Speaker Paul Ryan that Congress should take a look at the devices, which were little-known even to gun enthusiasts prior to Sunday\'s bloodbath. A gunman pumped bullets from a casino high-rise into a crowd of concertgoers below, killing 59 and wounding hundreds, apparently using legal ""bump stocks"" to increase firing speed from his semi-automatic weapons. \n \n ""The National Rifle Association is calling on the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATFE) to immediately review whether these devices comply with federal law,"" the NRA said in a statement. ""The NRA believes that devices designed to allow semi-automatic rifles to function like fully-automatic rifles should be subject to additional regulations."" \n \n White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in response, ""We welcome that and a conversation on that. ... It\'s something we\'re very open to. It\'s something we want to be part of the conversation on going forward."" \n \n President Donald Trump had discussed the issue with lawmakers on the way back from visiting Las Vegas on Wednesday, according to Rep. Mark Amodei, R-Nevada, who traveled with the president aboard Air Force One. \n \n ""Bump stocks"" originally were intended to help people with limited hand mobility fire a semi-automatic without the individual trigger pulls required. They can fit over the rear shoulder-stock assembly on a semi-automatic rifle and with applied pressure cause the weapon to fire continuously, increasing the rate from between 45 and 60 rounds per minute to between 400 and 800 rounds per minute, according to the office of Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., who introduced legislation this week to ban them. \n \n The government gave its seal of approval to selling the devices in 2010 after concluding that they did not violate federal law. \n \n The endorsement from the NRA and congressional Republicans for a change in law or policy to regulate guns, however narrow, marked a shift. Inaction has been the norm following other mass shootings, including the Sandy Hook, Connecticut, massacre of schoolchildren five years ago, last year\'s bloodbath at the Pulse nightclub in Florida, and a baseball field shooting this year in which House Majority Whip Steve Scalise came close to death.', 'The National Rifle Association is calling for a federal review of bump stocks, a weapon modifier that allows semi-automatic weapons to fire faster. \n \n Interested in Las Vegas Shooting?

Add Interest \n \n The NRA, in its first statement since the Oct. 1 shooting in Las Vegas, said that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives should ""immediately review whether these devices comply with federal law."" \n \n ""The NRA believes that devices designed to allow semi-automatic rifles to function like fully-automatic rifles should be subject to additional regulations,"" the statement reads. \n \n The full statement, issued jointly by NRA executive vice president Wayne LaPierre and the head of its legislative arm Chris Cox, opens by addressing ""the evil and senseless attack in Las Vegas."" \n \n ""Unfortunately, the first response from some politicians has been to call for more gun control,"" the statement reads. \n \n LaPierre elaborated during an appearance on Fox News\' ""Hannity"" Thursday night, saying, ""The other side has been so outright trying to politicize this tragedy that we did feel the need to speak out today on this whole bump stock issue. I, for years, have tried to correct the media on semi-automatics. When they said they were fully-automatic firearms, when Dianne Feinstein and Schumer and all the rest of them said they were machine guns, for years I set the record straight, and then the Obama administration a couple years ago approves this device called a bump stock."" \n \n He continued, ""If you take a look at it, it takes a semi-automatic firearm and makes it perform like a fully-automatic firearm.

It was a surprising shift for the leading gun industry group, which in recent years has resolutely opposed any gun regulations. Immediately afterward the White House, too, said it was open to such a change, the AP reports. The NRA announcement followed comments from leading congressional Republicans including House Speaker Paul Ryan that Congress should take a look at the devices, which were little-known even to gun enthusiasts prior to Sunday's bloodbath, in which the gunman apparently used the currently legal devices to increase firing speed from his semi-automatic weapons. ""The National Rifle Association is calling on the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATFE) to immediately review whether these devices comply with federal law,"" the NRA said in a statement—its first since the Oct. 1 shooting, per ABC News. ""The NRA believes that devices designed to allow semi-automatic rifles to function like fully-automatic rifles should be subject to additional regulations."" White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in response, ""We welcome that and a conversation on that. ... It's something we're very open to. It's something we want to be part of the conversation on going forward."" President Donald Trump had discussed the issue with lawmakers on the way back from visiting Las Vegas on Wednesday, according to Rep. Mark Amodei, R-Nevada, who traveled with the president aboard Air Force One. Sen. Dianne Feinstein introduced legislation this week to ban them."

""The presence of weapons was needed in order to intimidate them."" \n \n The federal Bureau of Land Management began a roundup of the cattle from the Bundy ranch a week ago, contending he owes more than $1 million in back fees, penalties and other costs for grazing his cattle on public land and has ignored court orders. \n \n Bundy stopped paying monthly grazing fees in 1993. The ranch is about 80 miles northeast of Las Vegas. \n \n The issue simmered for a week with verbal and physical altercations and reached a boil on Saturday after nearly 1,000 supporters, included armed militamen from several western states, rallied on foot and on horseback with the family. \n \n The four-hour standoff temporarily shut down Interstate 15 and ended when the bureau stopped rounding up cattle citing safety concerns and then agreed to return the cows. \n \n The Clark County sheriff Doug Gillespie had delivered a bureau offer to leave, but keep the cows, and then helped negotiate the eventual end to the standoff, Bundy said. \n \n ""When we went up there, they knew we were serious,"" Ammon Bundy said. ""They wanted to go. This thing was building and building and was going to continue."" \n \n Bundy said about 350 of the ranch\'s cows were recovered from bureau holding pens. Some of the animals were injured and a handful of calves, some so new their umbilical cords remained attached, were being bottle fed, he said. \n \n Bureau officials could not be reached immediately for comment on Sunday. In a statement on Saturday, Director Neil Kornze said the bureau ended the cattle gathering because of serious concerns about the safety of employees and the public and would work to resolve the matter administratively and through the courts. \n \n About 100 Bundy supporters, many wearing camouflage and carrying firearms, gathered on Sunday with the family for an informal church service at a makeshift protest command center. \n \n Speakers offered a mix of prayer and religious testimony, denounced the federal government for excessive oversight on several issues, and called for the preservation of individual constitutional rights. \n \n An Arizona state representative in attendance, David Livingston, said the battle over the Bundy cows would serve as a unifying event for lawmakers across 11 western states working on state sovereignty issues. \n \n ""This was a major tipping point,"" Livingston said. \n \n Cliven Bundy, 76, said he had been touched by the supporters who stood by his family over the past week. \n \n ""I was really quite humbled to the fact that there are so many good people,"" Cliven Bundy said. \n \n (Reporting by Jennifer Dobner; Editing by David Bailey and Michael Perry)', 'Former Arizona Sheriff Richard Mack revealed on Monday that he and other organizers who traveled to Clark County, Nev., to support Cliven Bundy during his land dispute with the feds planned to put women on the front lines in case the “rogue federal officers” started shooting. \n \n Mack made the chilling revelation on Fox News’ “The Real Story” Monday, two days after the tense standoff between Bundy and the federal government came to a peaceful end. \n \n “We were actually strategizing to put all the women up at the front,” he said. “If they are going to start shooting, it’s going to be women that are going to be televised all across the world getting shot by these rogue federal officers.” \n \n Watch the clip below: \n \n Mack apparently identifies with the Tea Party and claims to have spoken at numerous rallies. He also appeared on MSNBC’s “Hardball” with host Chris Matthews to promote the movement. \n \n Mack was elected as Graham County sheriff in 1988 and he served two terms until 1997. The former sheriff also reportedly fought against the so-called “Brady Bill,” a 1993 gun control law that instituted federal background checks on firearms purchasers in the United States. \n \n “Mack has been a consultant on numerous cases regarding police abuse, brutality, and other misconduct by public officials. He has joined with other members of the law enforcement community to speak out in favor of drug policy reform,” according to his website. \n \n The fight between Bundy and the Bureau of Land Management widened into a debate about states’ rights and federal land-use policy. Bundy does not recognize federal authority on land he insists belongs to Nevada. \n \n On Saturday, the bureau released about 400 head of cattle it had seized from Bundy back to him only hours after announcing a premature halt to the roundup due to safety concerns. The operation, expected to take up to a month, ended after only a week. \n \n The cattle were freed after hundreds of states’ rights protesters, some of them armed militia members, showed up at corrals outside Mesquite to demand the animals’ release.

Dan Zehnder told The Associated Press that Clark County Sheriff Doug Gillespie was able to negotiate a resolution after talking with Bundy. \n \n The Associated Press contributed to this report.']",3,"– Fortunately, a face-off between a rancher's supporters—some armed—and federal officials concluded peacefully in Nevada on Saturday.

419,"['Supporters are as exhausted as Velma Hart, the Tea Party has momentum, and Republicans are now more trusted. Mark McKinnon on why those issues, plus nine others, spell doom for the president’s reelection hopes. \n \n President Obama’s State of the Union was strongly bipartisan and made smart moves to the center, although it missed a chance to really tackle tough fiscal issues like meaningful entitlement reforms. His Arizona speechwas terrific, his favorable ratings are climbing over 50, the economy is showing steady signs of improvement, and the stock market is up. So, how could he possibly lose his reelection bid? Just ask George H.W. Bush, who had an approval rating of nearly 90 percent two years out from his reelection. $#&! happens when you are at the helm of the free world. What could happen? Let us count the ways... \n \n Tom Williams / Getty Images \n \n 1. Velma Hart Syndrome \n \n Many of Barack Obama’s supporters “are exhausted.” Many defected in the midterms. Independents, suburban residents, college graduates, working-class voters, and even Hispanic voters shifted right. Exit poll analysis by National Journal shows “white voters not only strongly preferred Republican House and Senate candidates but also registered deep disappointment with President Obama’s performance.” Team Obama will focus heavily on minorities, the young, and women, but voter enthusiasm may be tempered by economic exhaustion. Good news for Team O? Velma liked the speech Tuesday night. \n \n 2. The Obama Overexposure Effect \n \n With counsel that he needs to get out more among the people to sell his message, voters may be turned off by the Obama Overexposure Effect. A Pew 2008 weekly survey showed, by a margin of 76 percent to 11 percent, respondents named Obama over Sen. John McCain as the candidate they heard about the most. Close to half said they heard too much about Obama. And by a slight but statistically significant margin, they then had a less favorable view of him. Before the 2012 campaign even kicks off, will Obama fatigue return? \n \n 3. Debt Bomb \n \n The national debt reached $10 trillion under President Bush, but deficit spending is at an all-time high under President Obama, with $1.4 trillion added in 2009 and $1.3 trillion in 2010. And the CBO now projects a deficit of $1.5 trillion this year. That means the federal government will borrow 40 cents for every dollar it spends. Bankruptcies loom for many states faced with unfunded public pension liabilities; strong-arm demands for bailouts by unions will threaten Democrats’ credibility. Sixty-eight percent of likely voters already express a preference for smaller government and lower taxes. Talk of more federal spending and the potential for state bankruptcies will increase voter anxiety. As the GOP educates voters about what the exploding debt burden means for future generations, its cost-cutting measures and messaging will resonate. \n \n 4. Voters Aren’t Better Off \n \n In 1980, President Ronald Reagan famously asked: “Are you better off than you were four years ago?” The answer for many is “no,” with higher unemployment, more debt, record-high home foreclosures, and another housing dip on the way. The long road to economic recovery will continue to frustrate voters. And weekly reminders of rising prices at the gas pump and grocery store, where it hurts most, may cost Obama the election. \n \n 5. Ailing Health Care \n \n • Mark McKinnon: 12 Reasons Obama Wins in 2012If “Obamacare” was historic legislation, so too was the House vote to repeal it. Though repeal today may be moot as Senate passage and a presidential veto are unlikely, as the true bottom line becomes known, in terms of increased costs, decreased access to care, and increased government controls, health care once again will be a decisive campaign issue. Efforts to dismantle or defund Obamacare will continue for the next two years. And as the public listens more to the credible Rep. Paul Ryan, the president will be on the defensive daily.', 'Walmart (WMT) will stop selling AR-15 assault rifles as well as other modern sporting rifles because of lower consumer demand for those weapons rather than for political reasons, the company said on Wednesday. \n \n The world’s largest retailer will replace rifles, which are sold at about one third of its U.S. stores, with shotguns and other hunting weapons. Quartz reported the news earlier. \n \n “There wasn’t a whole lot of demand for those products so we replaced them with products we have seen customers coming into purchase it,” Walmart spokesman Kory Lundberg told Fortune. Within the next two weeks, MSRs (modern sporting rifles) shouldn’t be in any more Walmart stores. \n \n Walmart, the single largest seller of guns and ammunition, has often come under criticism from gun control advocates for selling these items, particularly after high profile incidents such as the 2012 massacre of school children in Newtown (where the killer used an AR-15), Connecticut. \n \n The move by Walmart comes as firearms makers struggle with declining sales: Remington Outdoor Group last week reported that its sale of firearms fell 13.3% in the first half of the year, while Smith & Wesson’s overall sales saw a 12% drop. Sales often spike when gun enthusiasts believe there will be tighter gun laws put in place, then often slip when those concerns pass.']",2,"– Right now, Barack Obama’s approval ratings are riding high in the wake of a strongly bipartisan State of the Union address and lovely Arizona speech. But there’s plenty of time for all that to change before the 2012 election, writes GOP operative Mark McKinnon in the Daily Beast: “@#&! Happens when you are at the helm of the free world.” He lists 12 reasons why Obama could lose: Obama’s supporters are “exhausted” and disappointed, much like Velma Hart. Obama is sometimes overexposed; in a 2008 Pew poll, close to half of respondents said they’d heard too much about him. The economy is still in trouble, and Obama's approval rating for his economic policies is still below 50%. The Tea Party still has all the momentum. These voters will show up to vote if the fate of ObamaCare is on the line, and “all politics is turnout.” Republicans will benefit from redistricting—five traditionally red states are gaining seats, while six of 10 states losing them are blue.

The crazy thing was, it ended up being the same type of kidney cancer that Mark had.” And after a poignant pause, \n \n “It’s scary to think about. Very scary to think about. We’ve got four kids… to find out you have kidney cancer when you’re 39 years old is not something you ever think will happen. So we’re extremely grateful.” \n \n And if that doesn’t give you chills, get this: Crystal’s bloody nose? No connection. \n \n “It happened to be a red herring that allowed us to figure this out because of other symptoms at that time,” says Albert Quan, MD, a Pediatric Nephrologist at Medical City Children’s Hospital.

""The best we can do is slow the decline. In mid- to late-adolescence you either have ... to put her on dialysis or you have to [get her a] kidney transplant."" \n \n Crystal’s parents, however, were immediately ready to jump in and donate a kidney if they were a match. The teen’s mother, Cristy, was first to get tested and seemed on board to be donor until the final screening, according to KTVT. A spot was detected on her kidney, negating her ability to be a donor and leading to more tests for kidney disease and cancer. \n \n Crystal’s father was next to be tested, but his results were even more alarming.

In April of this year, Crystal successfully underwent kidney transplant surgery and is now getting ready to head to school next month according to her doctor. Her parents say they hope their story encourages others to consider being organ donors. \n \n ""If anyone is considering organ donation, but they have fears about if it is safe to do so ... take courage,"" wrote Cristy Enns.

He was stunned. \n \n ""The idea is that we\'re going to go in and do something that can be life-saving for our daughter, only to be told \'this may have saved your life,\' because I would never have been tested otherwise."" \n \n Actually, both of their lives may have been saved -- along with their daughter\'s. \n \n ""They went back and did another MRI on me,"" says Cristy, ""and it had grown. The crazy thing was, it ended up being the same type of kidney cancer that Mark had."" \n \n After a pause, she adds, ""It\'s scary to think about. Very scary to think about. We\'ve got four kids... to find out you have kidney cancer when you\'re 39 years old is not something you ever think will happen. So we\'re extremely grateful."" \n \n Fortunately for Crystal, her aunt, Cristy\'s sister, was a perfect match and was able to donate a kidney in April. And the impact was instant. \n \n ""The morning after the transplant she woke up and she said \'I\'m not nauseous!\'"" recalls Cristy with a huge smile. ""She could eat, she was hungry... it was such an answer to prayer."" \n \n Oddly, doctors say it turns out that Crystal\'s bloody nose, which started the entire chain of events, had no connection to the condition that led to her transplant. \n \n ""It happened to be a red herring that allowed us to figure this out because of other symptoms at that time,"" says Albert Quan, MD, a Pediatric Nephrologist at Medical City Children\'s Hospital. Dr. Quan is also quick to reassure parents that a typical nosebleed should not be a cause for alarm, noting that Crystal\'s particular type of kidney disease is ""very, very rare. I\'ve only seen about two or three in the last 20 years."" \n \n Now, the talented teen musician, who for much of the past two years had been too weak to stand and sing with her choir, can get back to doing the things she loves, knowing that her parents are healthy because of her. ""That\'s amazing,"" she told CBS 11 reporter Robbie Owens. \n \n The Enns family says the entire experience has helped reinforce their faith. \n \n ""You try to think, \'Where\'s the good in this, as people of faith? What am I supposed to learn?\'"" asks Mark. ""We got to see the good side.""']",3,"– It had to be the luckiest, and most lifesaving, nosebleed in the world. As KTVT reports, it befell 14-year-old Crystal Enns of Wylie, Texas, in 2013. Her parents took her to the doctor when the bleeding wouldn't stop, which led to the diagnosis of a serious kidney disease called juvenile nephronophthisis. ""This kidney disease doesn't get better,"" one of Crystal's doctors tells ABC News. ""In mid- to late adolescence you either have ... to put her on dialysis or you have to [get her a] kidney transplant."" The family opted for the transplant, and Mom Cristy stepped up first—but screening turned up a spot on her kidney that turned out to be cancer. Then dad Mark volunteered, but, incredibly, his screening turned up kidney cancer as well. Both were caught early enough for effective treatment, something that never would have happened if not for their daughter's illness. ""The idea is that we're going to go in and do something that can be lifesaving for our daughter, only to be told, 'This may have saved your life,' because I would never have been tested otherwise,"" says Mark. And there's good news about Crystal, too: Her aunt turned out to be a perfect match, and after successful surgery in April of this year, the now 17-year-old is headed back to high school with a healthy prognosis. The kicker to all this: It turns out that the original nosebleed had nothing to do with Crystal's kidney disease, reports CBS News. ""It happened to be a red herring that allowed us to figure this out because of other symptoms at that time,"" says her doctor. (A mom spotted a symptom of a rare form of cancer after seeing a photo of her 2-year-old.)"

Pittsenbarger, on Feb. 19, 1998, the Kansas City Star reports. \n \n Pittsenbarger, who is identified as Tannery’s son in court documents, survived the attack at a home in Kearney and went on to live with his adoptive father in Smithville, but died in April. He was 20. \n \n A jury in Clay County indicted Tannery on Tuesday on second-degree murder charges, alleging that the assault led to Pittsenbarger’s death some two decades later. Prosecutors said at the time of the initial assault that Tannery attacked the boy because he would not stop crying, prompting him to pick up Pittsenbarger and throw him to the ground. \n \n The infant was rushed to a hospital, where doctors didn’t expect him to survive his injuries, including multiple rib fractures, a fractured vertebra, subdural bleeding and head wounds consistent with shaken baby syndrome. \n \n But the boy did survive, although he suffered severe brain damage that lasted his entire life. He was later adopted by Wendell H. Pittsenbarger and took the man’s last name, the Star reported. \n \n “I love that boy and still miss him dearly,” Pittsenbarger told the newspaper. “I think about him all of the time.” \n \n Dominick Pittsenbarger used a wheelchair throughout his childhood and high school years.

Her keepers said she understood some spoken English, too. \n \n While some scientists questioned the sign language claim, the “talking” lowland gorilla nevertheless became an ambassador for her species, which is threatened by logging and poaching in their native habitats in central Africa. \n \n The Gorilla Foundation said Koko touched the lives of millions as an icon for interspecies communication and empathy. \n \n “She was beloved and will be deeply missed,” it said. \n \n Koko was born Hanabi-ko (Japanese for “Fireworks Child”) on July 4, 1971 at the San Francisco Zoo. Dr. Francine “Penny” Patterson began working with Koko the following year and taught her sign language, the foundation said. \n \n The gorilla was featured in many documentaries and appeared on the cover of National Geographic magazine twice, once - in October 1978 - in a photograph Koko had taken of herself in a mirror. \n \n In 1998, Koko took to the Internet in what was billed as the first “interspecies” chat, relaying comments such as “I like drinks” via a human interpreter to tens of thousands of online participants. \n \n “Legit bawling like a baby right now,” one mourner, Jess Cameron, wrote on the foundation’s Facebook page. “This news just breaks my heart.

Julie Judge."", 'By some estimates, nearly a half a million people with Facebook accounts passed away last year, leaving family and friends to navigate what to do with those pages. Leave the account open? Shut it down entirely? Convert it to an official Facebook memorial page? What would you want for your own Facebook profile? And forget Facebook, what do you want to become of your email account? \n \n If you want any say in such matters, you might want to consider creating a social-media will, as the US government is now recommending as part of its advice on estate planning. As per their blog: \n \n If you have social media profiles set up online, you should create a statement of how you would like your online identity to be handled. Just like a traditional will helps your survivors handle your physical belongings, a social media will spells out how you want your online identity to be handled. Like with a traditional will, you\'ll need to appoint someone you trust as an online executor. This person will be responsible for closing your email addresses, social media profiles, and blogs after you are deceased. \n \n Sounds good, but legally it\'s tricky territory. As Naomi Cahn, a professor of law at George Washington University, explained to me, ""Formal wills become public. So you need to be careful what you put in a will, because anyone in the world could have access to it."" Instead, you might want to consider establishing a trust or just an informal agreement with information about your passwords and how you would like your accounts to be handled. \n \n A further complication is that people\'s social-media and other online accounts are not static, nor are their passwords. Cahn says that the average person has 25 password-protected accounts and types about eight passwords a day. Most people will likely not be able to keep their ""social-media wills"" up to date on that many accounts. \n \n Planning for the care of your online trail post-mortem presents different issues than planning for money and physical objects. In part this is because our legal regimes and social norms are less solidified in these areas, and, in part because they are actually different animals: A Facebook account can become a participatory memorial that many friends and family can return to over the years, in a way that\'s not true of your physical belongings.

423,"['I’ve never been a big believer in the, “Because I’m the Daddy,” school of parenting. My view has always been that, if I, a thinking adult, could not impose a rule or condition on my child through logic and persuasion, perhaps the rule or condition wasn’t such a good idea. \n \n On the flip side, if my kids can convince me – again, through logic and persuasion – of a particular cause or request, I’d consider acquiescing to it. \n \n After all, my goal as a parent isn’t to always be right. It’s to get my kids to think. \n \n I’m taken back to those core values as I read about the tragic sinking of the Sewol, the South Korean ferry in which 86 people are confirmed dead and another 220 are still missing — and increasingly presumed dead. Most of the victims are from a single high school. \n \n The tragic tale was made even more heartbreaking amid reports that the high number of victims may have been linked to the captain instructing passengers to stay in their rooms. It’s believed that the youngsters complied, and may have been entombed in those rooms by the cold, rising water. \n \n Here in the United States, it’s hard to imagine that, first of all, a bunch of high school kids would even listen, much less totally and faithfully comply with an adult’s instructions – even as a ship sinks. \n \n That’s because we Americans – and certainly Texans – value the individual over the group. If that was a boatload of American students, you know they would have been finding any and every way to get off that ferry. But in Asian cultures, which place the needs of the group over the needs of the individual, compliance is de rigueur. \n \n So, you end up with this horrendous death by obedience. \n \n But there’s a second part to the group-first formula. If compliance and obedience are expected, then much responsibility is required of the people giving orders. Which is why South Korean President Park Geun-hye said Monday that the actions of the captain and some crew amounted to “unforgivable, murderous behavior.” \n \n Yep.

Flowing in every day, these data are added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period.', 'Some deals just don’t make sense. Some have underlying motivations that are not immediately apparent. Intel’s announced intention to acquire McAfee for $7.68 billion is a deal that does make sense no matter what perspective you take. \n \n Technology acquisition. One argument put forth by analysts so far is that by acquiring a market leading anti-virus software company Intel will be able to add security features to their core business, chips. Seven billion dollars is a lot to pay for technology when there are 27 such technology companies that would cost less to acquire (Symantec, of course being more expensive). \n \n Intel could acquire one of many anti-malware companies that have arguably better technology, better research, and much less baggage. \n \n Brand enhancement. While there is a good argument to be made for technology vendors to acquire security companies to enhance their brands (EMC + RSA a notable example) Intel is not going to accomplish that by acquiring McAfee. Intel already has one of the most recognized brands in all of technology and they have no negative perceptions because of a lack of security association. Intel is highly respected across the board and is rarely faulted for lack of security. This acquisition does not bolster their brand at all. If anything it dilutes Intel’s brand. \n \n Government play. With a tremendous increase in government spending on cyber security projected one could argue that acquiring McAfee gives Intel a piece of the action. McAfee’s EPO desktop security suite is already short listed within most of the US Defense Department and the firewall business McAfee acquired with their Secure Computing acquisition has a large federal component. But Intel is already entrenched in all aspects of state, local and federal government in almost every country in the world with their ubiquitous CPUs. Intel needs no help getting government business. \n \n Network play. McAfee has invested considerable time and effort in revamping the Secure Computing line into a credible network security play. They also have one of the largest install bases of Intrusion Prevention (IPS) solutions. Will Intel work to enhance those network security products by supporting multi-core architectures in them? What does that mean to every other networking company that could have been big consumers of Intel CPUs? How will they feel about using chips from a direct competitor? And if the acquisition is a networking play why would Intel put McAfee in their Software and Services division? \n \n Investment. In the tradition of conglomerates and holding companies this acquisition could be viewed as an investment in the relatively stable security industry. The plan would be to streamline operations and increase profitability. Is Intel really trying to become the next GE or ITT? Is that its core strength? Did it look at other investment opportunities? I understand beach front property on the Gulf coast is looking pretty good right now. \n \n At $7.68 billion this is the biggest acquisition of a pure play security company ever. It is also the worst. There is no synergy, no channel benefits, marginal revenue enhancement (considering the price), no new markets, and no meaningful strategy.', 'Intel and McAfee shocked the tech world this morning with the announcement that Intel is acquiring McAfee for 7.7 billion dollars. The initial reaction from analysts and industry experts is confusion--or maybe cautious skepticism--as the tech world tries to understand how a company synonymous with processors and computer chip technology will make use of a major security software and services organization. \n \n I spoke with IT-Harvest analyst Richard Stiennon for some insight on the blockbuster news. With details still somewhat sketchy, Stiennon postulated that it isn\'t about antivirus software. ""You\'re paying $7 billion for an AV company which is crazy because there are 80 of them and they all do the same thing and you could buy one for $50 million."" \n \n Stiennon also offered some speculation that the McAfee acquisition might enable Intel to gain better access to lucrative government contracts. McAfee has a solid foothold in government desktop security that could open some doors. \n \n Forrester analyst Jon Kindervag\'s early reaction is less than optimistic. In 2000 Intel bought a solid VPN company--Shiva--and within a few years it basically crumbled into oblivion because VPN technology is not Intel\'s core competency. \n \n The purchase of McAfee, and the move into enterprise and consumer security is similarly outside of Intel\'s traditional comfort zone. Kindervag said ""I would love to be wrong, but I think we may all look back five years from now and say \'Wow. That was a big mistake.\'"" \n \n McAfee\'s CEO Dave DeWalt discussed why the merging of McAfee and Intel makes sense. ""The number of connected devices is expected to grow from 1 billion to 50 billion by 2020, according to industry estimates. This explosive growth of Internet and IP-enabled devices is reshaping communication, collaboration and commerce opportunities for individuals and organizations around the world."" \n \n DeWalt elaborates ""We are joining forces to tackle this next generation cybersecurity issue, which impacts everyone and anything connecting to the Internet. Security will be a third pillar in Intel\'s strategy, next to power efficient performance and Internet connectivity. By bringing McAfee\'s security DNA to Intel, we can offer better solutions and products to the market. By next year, we will introduce new security offerings as a result of our collaboration."" \n \n George Kurtz, Global CTO of McAfee, explains in a blog post ""While you may ask ""Why?"" - It makes perfect sense to me. Given the current challenges in dealing with the proliferation of virulent malware, bringing software closer to silicon will provide a real advantage for consumers and businesses. Beating back the tide of malware proliferation by changing the game on the bad guys is an exciting proposition."" \n \n At face value, it seems like an ""oil and water"" sort of purchase--like the ill-fated acquisition of Skype by eBay, but perhaps there is some grand plan or spark of genius that we will understand more fully as the dust settles and the operations of McAfee and Intel become integrated. It could be a brilliant move, or a huge mistake, and only time will tell.']",3,"– Intel agreed to buy McAfee for $7.68 billion today, leaving analysts slack-jawed with disbelief. “I would love to be wrong, but I think we may all look back five years from now and say, 'Wow.

Conway gives the president a bit of a pass for his June 4 tweet complaining that the Mueller appointment ""is totally UNCONSTITUTIONAL!”"" Yes, it's a ""meritless legal position,"" writes Conway, but Trump is not a lawyer and thus ""wouldn’t know the difference between a good one and a bad one."" He's less forgiving of attorneys who make that case. ""The ‘constitutional’ arguments made against the special counsel … have little more rigor than the tweet that promoted them,” Conway writes. “Such a lack of rigor, sadly, has been a disturbing trend in much of the politically charged public discourse about the law lately, and one that lawyers—regardless of their politics—owe a duty to abjure.""

426,"['If the Charlottesville rally came as a shock, with hundreds of white Americans marching in support of ideologies many have long considered too vile, dangerous or stupid to enter the political mainstream, it obscured the fact that some in the small, loosely defined alt-right movement are hoping to make those ideas seem less than shocking for the “normies,” or normal people, that its sympathizers have tended to mock online. \n \n And to go from mocking to wooing, the movement will be looking to make use of people like the Hovaters and their trappings of normie life — their fondness for National Public Radio, their four cats, their bridal registry. \n \n “We need to have more families. We need to be able to just be normal,” said Matthew Heimbach, the leader of the Traditionalist Worker Party, in a podcast conversation with Mr. Hovater. Why, he asked self-mockingly, were so many followers “abnormal”? \n \n Mr. Hovater replied: “I mean honestly, it takes people with, like, sort of an odd view of life, at first, to come this way. Because most people are pacified really easy, you know. Like, here’s some money, here’s a nice TV, go watch your sports, you know?” \n \n He added: “The fact that we’re seeing more and more normal people come is because things have gotten so bad. And if they keep getting worse, we’ll keep getting more, just, normal people.” \n \n Flattening the Edges \n \n Mr. Hovater’s face is narrow and punctuated with sharply peaked eyebrows, like a pair of air quotes, and he tends to deliver his favorite adjective, “edgy,” with a flat affect and maximum sarcastic intent. It is a sort of implicit running assertion that the edges of acceptable American political discourse — edges set by previous generations, like the one that fought the Nazis — are laughable. \n \n “I don’t want you to think I’m some ‘edgy’ Republican,” he says, while flatly denouncing the concept of democracy.', 'A Nazi sympathizer who was profiled recently in The New York Times and his wife and brother-in-law have lost their jobs, after the article prompted an outpouring of hostility to the restaurant that employed them, both he and the restaurant said. \n \n The Times article depicted Tony Hovater, 29, as an otherwise unremarkable person who voices “casually approving remarks about Hitler, disdain for democracy and belief that the races are better off separate.” He is active in a group called the Traditionalist Workers Party; organizations that track extremist groups have called it a hate group, allied with neo-Nazis, and call its views white supremacist, a label it rejects. \n \n Mr. Hovater, his wife, Maria, and her brother had worked at 571 Grill and Draft House, near their home in New Carlisle, Ohio, a suburb of Dayton. Mr. Hovater worked at the restaurant as a part-time cook for a little over a year, according to a manager there. \n \n Though the Times article did not mention the restaurant — Mr. Hovater had identified himself as a welder by trade — people appalled by his views learned that he worked there and began calling and leaving online messages.', 'This is a public statement being made by the owners of 571 Grill & Draft House regarding a recent New York Times article that featured the controversial political views of one of their employees. \n \n While the 571 Grill and Draft House is happy to be recognized by national news outlets for our 571 Haystack burger, it’s with a sad heart that we must reflect on a divisive political topic that has unfortunately darkened the doorstep of our small business. \n \n A November 25th New York Times article featured one of our employees.

432,"['US crash investigators looking into the Asiana accident have provided an unusual amount of information to the public. Is that heading off conspiracy theories or creating confusion? \n \n From Twitter pictures of the burned cabin to a second-by-second account of the aircraft’s flight speed, investigators are being unusually forthcoming with details about the Asiana Airlines crash at the San Francisco airport, leading some to champion a new era of transparency while others warn it does more harm than good. \n \n In the days since the July 6 crash, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has released detailed information about its investigation including timelines, pictures, and information about the pilot’s background that some transportation analysts say is unprecedented. \n \n “The NTSB has always been available to answer journalists’ questions after aviation accidents, but it often took a degree in aeronautics or long years on the airline beat to understand what was being said. This crash, however, is being explained in real time and in much simpler terms than in the past,” former transportation journalist Micheline Maynard wrote in a Forbes column this week. \n \n In the past five days the agency has tweeted and posted multiple pictures of the aircraft on its website, uploaded videos of its daily briefings, and provided thorough accounts of the plane speed, hours of experience of the pilots, and cockpit conversations. \n \n In comparison, information about the last fatal accident in the United States involving a commercial flight was slower and more traditional. When a Continental Express flight crashed while approaching the Buffalo airport in February 2009, there was no social media stream with photo and video footage. \n \n The new transparency is particularly worrisome to the Air Line Pilots Association, which released a statement this week saying that it is “stunned by the amount of detailed operational data from on-board recorders released by the [NTSB] this soon into the investigation.” \n \n The union, which represents only American pilots, has particular reason to be concerned with much of the preliminary media reports focusing on what role pilot error played in the crash. But it contends that the level of information released could adversely affect the investigation: \n \n “It is imperative that safety investigators refrain from prematurely releasing the information from on-board recording devices,” the organization wrote. “We have seen in the past that publicizing this data before all of it can be collected and analyzed leads to erroneous conclusions that can actually interfere with the investigative process.” \n \n Deborah Hersman, chairman of the NTSB, responded to the criticism by telling the press her organization is responsible to the public. \n \n “We are the advocate for the traveling public,” Ms. Hersman said Tuesday. \n \n Hersman, who at age 39 became the youngest chairman of the NTSB when she was appointed by President George W. Bush in 2009, has become the face of the new transparency push as she holds daily press conferences in San Francisco and multiple interviews with cable news outlets. \n \n “Since she\'s taken over, it seems like information has been much more accessible to the public,"" Frank Pitre, a lawyer who closely follows the agency and is representing two passengers who were on the Asiana flight, told the San Francisco Chronicle. \n \n Hersman also faces a public with more tools at its disposal for doing its own investigative work. Websites like Flight Aware provide radar data for the Asiana Flight, and anonymous users quickly posted what they claim as the tape of the conversation between air-traffic controllers and the Asiana pilots \n \n “What we know is that if you don’t put the facts out there, in a vacuum other people will create them,” Hersman said in an interview with CBS News. Her organization’s use of social media channels is “about having a conversation with the people who care about the work you do.” \n \n According to Bloomberg, which pulled user comments from the forums at Flyertalk.com, Hersman\'s approach is earning mixed reviews. Among the postings: \n \n astroflyer: “In the age of twitter, I don’t think it makes sense to withhold any findings at all until 9 months down the road. A large plane crashed at a major American airport. People want to know why and whether the cause might be relevant to their own future flying.” \n \n Milepost: “I expect tomorrow D. Hersman will be detailing the pilots meals and calorie counts, their favorite colors, and answering the eternal question: boxers or briefs. I still think too much raw data is being disclosed in isolated bits and pieces that allow for too much amateur conjecturing, without having gone through the critical review and piece-it-all together analysis.”', 'The wreckage of Asiana Airlines Flight 214 lies near the San Francisco runway July 7. (Photo: NTSB via Getty Images) Story Highlights Light may have been sunlight reflecting off the bay \n \n Investigators found the plane was too low and too slow in its approach \n \n The worst of the fire came around the right engine \n \n Federal crash investigators say the Asiana Airlines pilot who saw a bright light before the crash said it didn\'t affect the plane\'s approach into San Francisco International Airport. \n \n Deborah Hersman, chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board, had said Wednesday that the pilot complained of a bright light that temporarily blinded him. She clarified Thursday that the pilot saw the light while about 500 feet in the air and that it might have been sun reflecting off the bay, but that the pilot wasn\'t sure. \n \n Hersman said the pilot described turning his head and then looking back and finding that his vision wasn\'t impaired because he could still see the plane\'s controls. She said neither of the pilots mentioned the light during interviews and there is no discussion about it on the cockpit-voice recorder. \n \n ""The light source was straight in front of the airplane but not on the runway,"" Hersman said. ""He stated that he did not think the light affected his vision."" \n \n Two passengers died in the crash when Flight 214 slammed into a seawall Saturday at the end of the runway. The impact ripped off the back of the plane and tossed three flight attendants and their seats onto the runway. \n \n Investigators found the plane was too low and too slow in its approach, but the investigation into whether pilots or equipment are to blame is expected to take 12 to 18 months. \n \n Hersman added details in her final on-scene briefing about the plane\'s approach from 500 feet above ground, when the plane was going 134 knots. The crew\'s target was to land at 137 knots, but the plane slowed to 103 knots just before impact. \n \n Hersman said there was no mention of the plane\'s speed until nine seconds before impact, when it was about 100 feet in the air. \n \n ""Almost immediately after that is the first comment about speed,"" Hersman said. \n \n Then at three seconds before impact and again at 1.5 seconds before, crewmembers call to abort the landing, Hersman said. \n \n The worst of the fire came around the right engine, which leaked oil after the crash, Hersman said. But she said firefighters entering the cabin at the left door just in front of the wings found nearly pristine seats before the fire spread inside and destroyed them. The floor was damaged a bit between the third and fourth doors, and worst behind the fourth door. \n \n After gathering perishable information at the scene, she said, investigators will spend months sifting through data and interviews to determine what happened. \n \n ""This is just the tip of the iceberg,"" Hersman said. \n \n Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/12pQxV2', 'A molar from an early human species called Denisova is shown in this image released to Reuters in December 2010. Scientists think skull remains recently found in China could belong to a Denisovan, or another previously unknown hominid. \n \n —In 2007, researchers from the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology in Beijing were finishing up an archaeological dig in Lingjing, China, when a team member spotted some quartz tools poking out of the mud. After extending the dig, the tools were extracted, revealing an even more significant discovery: a small, ancient skull fragment approximately 100,000 to 130,000 years old. \n \n Over the next few years, the researchers returned to the site multiple times, finding more cranium pieces until they were able to reconstruct two partial skulls from more than 40 separate fragments. \n \n But when the team analyzed the skull fragments, they realized that the skulls neither fit the bill for Homo sapiens nor Neanderthals but that they shared characteristics of both human species. Ultimately, the researchers were unable to positively determine exactly what kind of human the skulls belong to, opening the door to a wide range of intriguing possibilities. \n \n In an article published Friday in the journal Science, the researchers note that the skull fragments date to the Late Pleistocene epoch, a time marked by the expansion of H. sapiens and the extinction of other species in the genus Homo. During the early part of that epoch, Neanderthals roamed Europe and western Asia while humans began to journey out of Africa. But fossil records of human species in Eastern Asia from that time period are thin, muddying the picture of that era for a substantial region of the planet. \n \n The skulls found in China were found to bear very close resemblances to those of Neanderthals, including a very similar inner ear bone and a prominent brow ridge. But the brow ridge was much less pronounced than one would expect from Neanderthals, with a considerably less dense cranium, as one might expect in an early H. sapiens. Researchers also found that the skulls were large by both modern and Neanderthal standards, with a whopping 1800 cubic centimeters of brain capacity. \n \n ""They are not Neanderthals in the full sense,"" study co-author Erik Trinkaus, a paleoanthropologist at Washington Univer\xadsity in St. Louis, told Science Magazine. \n \n So what are they? It\'s hard to say, since the skulls contain features associated with modern humans, Neanderthals, and other Eastern Asian humans from the epoch. \n \n ""The overall cranial shape, especially the wide cranial base, and low neurocranial vault, indicate a pattern of continuity with the earlier, Middle Pleistocene eastern Eurasian humans. Yet the presence of two distinctive Neanderthal features ... argue for populational interactions across Eurasia during the late Middle and early Late Pleistocene,"" said Dr. Trinkaus in a statement. \n \n Essentially, the skulls seem to belong to an unknown species that is none of the above – or, to be more accurate, a mix of all of the above. \n \n ""I don\'t like to think of these fossils as those of hybrids,"" study co-author and anthropologist Trinkaus told News.com.au. ""Hybridization implies that all of these groups were separate and discrete, only occasionally interacting. What these fossils show is that these groups were basically not separate. The idea that there were separate lineages in different parts of the world is increasingly contradicted by the evidence we are unearthing."" \n \n While this specific group of early humans the skulls belong to might never have been discovered before, it is possible that the remains may belong to a little-known hominid species known as Denisovans, which existed around the same time and mixed with modern humans and Neanderthals. But there\'s one catch: scientists don\'t have any Denisovan skulls to compare the China samples with. Only a few Denisovan remains have been previously uncovered, including a single finger bone and a large tooth, which scientists determined was distinct from Neanderthals and modern humans through DNA tests. \n \n ""It is not possible to infer skull morphology from ancient DNA directly,"" Phillipp Gunz, an evolutionary anthropologist at the Max Planck Institute in Leipzig who was not involved in the study, told The Washington Post. ""I therefore hope that future studies will be able to extract ancient DNA from these or similar specimens,"" though he added that many of the features in the skulls did match up with what many experts imagine Denisovan skulls to be like. \n \n Follow Stories Like This Get the Monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox. Sign Up × \n \n Until a definitive DNA test is conducted on the skull samples, their true origins will remain a mystery. But there\'s still a lot that can be learned from them in the meantime. \n \n ""The biological nature of the immediate predecessors of modern humans in eastern Eurasia has been poorly known from the human fossil record,"" said Trinkaus, in a Washington University, St. Louis statement. ""The discovery of these skulls of late archaic humans from Xuchang substantially increases our knowledge of these people.""', 'Amazon changed its customer privacy policies on Monday, closing security gaps that were exploited in the identity hacking of Wired reporter Mat Honan on Friday. \n \n Previously, Amazon allowed people to call in and change the email address associated with an Amazon account or add a credit card number to an Amazon account as long as the caller could identify him or herself by name, email address and mailing address — three bits of personal information that are easily found online. \n \n On Tuesday, Amazon handed down to its customer service department a policy change that no longer allows people to call in and change account settings, such as credit cards or email addresses associated with its user accounts. \n \n Amazon officials weren’t available for comment on the security changes, but during phone calls to Amazon customer service on Tuesday, representatives told us that the changes were sent out this morning and put in place for “your security.” \n \n The security gap was used by hackers, one of whom identified himself as a 19-year-old going by the name “Phobia,” to gain access to Honan’s Amazon account on Friday. Once Phobia and another hacker gained access to Honan’s Amazon account, they were able to view the last four digits of a credit card linked to the account. \n \n The hackers then used those four digits to trick Apple customer service into thinking it was dealing with Honan. Apple customer service then gave the hackers a temporary password into Honan’s Apple ID, which the hackers used to wipe his iPhone, iPad and MacBook, and gain access to a number of email accounts as well as his Twitter account. \n \n We discovered Amazon’s policy change on Tuesday after we failed to replicate the exploits used on Honan this weekend. Amazon declined comment on the security hole on Monday, and has since failed to return repeated phone calls from Wired about the vulnerability. \n \n Wired Reporter Roberto Baldwin contributed to this report.']",4,"– The continuing investigation into the crash of an Asiana Airlines plane still hasn't spotted any mechanical trouble—meaning it's likely that pilot mistakes were to blame for the disaster, Sky News reports. National Transportation Safety Board chair Deborah Hersman offered new information about investigators' findings, with concern centered on how pilots could have failed to notice their slow speed during landing, the AP reports. Pilots said they believed the plane's ""autothrottle"" was controlling its speed, but while the device was ""armed,"" it appears to have been set to idle. When the plane's altitude was 500 feet, its airspeed was 134 knots—below the target of 137. A warning sounded; pilots recognized that they weren't aligned with the runway and tried to fix the problem. By the time they'd reached 200 feet, their speed was just 118 knots; pilots are supposed to abort a landing if they're more than 5 knots below target. But they didn't mention speed at all between 500 and 100 feet, Hersman says. ""The first thing that's taught to a pilot is to look at the airspeed indicator. It is the most important instrument in the cockpit,"" says a longtime pilot. ""There are a lot of very experienced airline pilots who are scratching their heads right now."" As for reports of blinding light, the issue doesn't appear to have affected the flight, USA Today reports. Eleven minutes worth of of 911 calls have also been released, revealing the chaos in the immediate aftermath of the crash, Reuters reports. Some of the calls indicate that people near the end of the runway were left unattended as emergency responders initially stuck near the main crash area. Other callers reported not seeing emergency vehicles, but responders say that's because vehicles are not brought too close to the scene in an effort to avoid collisions—or the vehicles being caught in an explosion. Surprised at how much information the NTSB is releasing? It is unusual, the Christian Science Monitor reports, and while some are praising the transparency, others fear it will lead to incorrect conclusions before the investigation is complete."

The mother told the Las Vegas Review-Journal they were under an exclusive contract with another media outlet and could not do other interviews Tuesday. \n \n Mahan urged Sandford to continue getting treatment. Sandford also apologized for taking up so much of the court’s time. \n \n “That’s why I get the big bucks,” the judge responded. \n \n At the time of the incident, Sandford was in the U.S. illegally on a tourist visa that had expired Aug. 30, 2015. He originally visited the U.S. for about a month in January 2015 and returned later in 2015 when his grandmother rented an apartment for him in New Jersey. Sandford’s mother lost contact with him and reported him as a missing person in May 2016. They reconnected after she learned of his arrest. \n \n During questioning, Sandford told police that he believed Trump was a “racist” and “needs to die,” according to a Secret Service report. \n \n When a Secret Service agent questioned him about his intent in trying to grab the officer’s sidearm, Sandford responded: “To shoot and kill Trump,” it said. \n \n Sandford had told law enforcement that he drove from California to kill Trump and was living out of his car while working odd jobs. The day before the Trump rally, Sandford went to a gun range in Las Vegas and took shooting lessons with a rented 9 mm Glock pistol. \n \n Contact Ben Botkin at bbotkin@reviewjournal.com or 702-384-8710.

The Senate today voted 56-43 to confirm Loretta Lynch for the post, reports the Wall Street Journal. The move comes five months after President Obama nominated her to replace Eric Holder, a nomination that got held up in an unrelated legislative mess that didn't get resolved until this week. Lynch, currently the US attorney for the Eastern District of New York, will be the first black woman to hold the post, notes AP. She is expected to be sworn in on Monday. It was one of the closest votes for an attorney general recently, reports the Hill, which says the reason was Republican concerns that Lynch wouldn't keep what they see as presidential overreach in check on matters such as immigration. ""No one disputes that she has an impressive legal background,” said Chuck Grassley. The ""question for me from the start has been whether Ms. Lynch will make a clean break from his policies and take the department in a new direction.” Democrat Pat Leahy, however, called her approval ""a great historic moment,"" adding, “I only hope that Senate Republicans will only show her more respect as attorney general [of] the United States than she has received as nominee.”"

Now, that cheese has tested positive for the botulinum toxin, the California Department of Public Health says. \n \n In a statement issued Monday, the department said it ""believes there is no continuing risk to the public."" \n \n The man who died, Martin Galindo, had been in the hospital for several weeks before his death, according to a GoFundMe page created by his family. He had been on a ventilator and eventually fell into a coma. \n \n Botulism is caused by a toxin secreted by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. The toxin attacks the nervous system, causing blurry vision, slurred speech, paralysis and difficulty breathing. In about 3 to 5 percent of cases, botulism is fatal, even when it\'s treated with antitoxin. \n \n Botulism is rare these days. Each year, there only about 20 cases in adults, linked to food poisoning, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \n \n The source is often home-canned food, although sometimes the toxin does show up in retail products, like chopped garlic in oil, carrot juice and chili pepper sauce. \n \n ""As we head into the summer barbecue season, both indoor and outdoor chefs need to be on guard against all foodborne illnesses,"" said Dr. Karen Smith of the California Department of Public Health in a statement Monday. \n \n The U.S. Department of Agriculture gives detailed instructions for how to can foods safely, and the CDC has a list of recommendations to help prevent botulism in your canned food. For example: \n \n Store the food at 50 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit before opening. \n \n Use the food within one year after canning. \n \n Don\'t use cans that are swollen, cracked or squirt liquid or foam when you open them. \n \n Boil foods low in acid for 10 minutes before eating. These foods include asparagus, beets, green beans, potatoes, some tomatoes, seafood and meat. High temperature will inactivate the toxin. \n \n For retail products, store oils infused with garlic, chili sauces and canned cheeses in the refrigerator.

For permanent parasites and other symbionts, the most intriguing question is whether these organisms can return to a free-living lifestyle and, thus, escape an evolutionary “dead end.” This question is directly related to Dollo's law, which stipulates that a complex trait (such as being free living vs. parasitic) cannot re-evolve again in the same form. Here, we present conclusive evidence that house dust mites, a group of medically important free-living organisms, evolved from permanent parasites of warm-blooded vertebrates. A robust, multigene topology (315 taxa, 8942 nt), ancestral character state reconstruction, and a test for irreversible evolution (Dollo's law) demonstrate that house dust mites have abandoned a parasitic lifestyle, secondarily becoming free living, and then speciated in several habitats. Hence, as exemplified by this model system, highly specialized permanent parasites may drastically de-specialize to the extent of becoming free living and, thus escape from dead-end evolution. Our phylogenetic and historical ecological framework explains the limited cross-reactivity between allergens from the house dust mites and “storage” mites and the ability of the dust mites to inhibit host immune responses. It also provides insights into how ancestral features related to parasitism (frequent ancestral shifts to unrelated hosts, tolerance to lower humidity, and pre-existing enzymes targeting skin and keratinous materials) played a major role in reversal to the free-living state. We propose that parasitic ancestors of pyroglyphids shifted to nests of vertebrates. Later the nest-inhabiting pyroglyphids expanded into human dwellings to become a major source of allergens.

Health officials in California say one of 10 people hospitalized after eating nacho cheese containing the botulinum toxin at Valley Oak Food and Fuel in Walnut Grove has died, per NPR. Family members identify the victim as 37-year-old Martin Galindo from Antioch, per CBS San Francisco. They say the father of two had been hospitalized for weeks and was in a coma when he died of botulism Thursday. Several other victims of the outbreak, including 33-year-old Lavinia Kelly and two teenagers, remain hospitalized, reports the Sacramento Bee, though the California Department of Public Health doesn't think there's any continuing public risk. Six victims are now pursuing legal action after a Sacramento County health inspector reported removing four bags of cheese sauce made by the Wisconsin-based Gehl Foods from the gas station on May 8, reports Food Safety News. Gehl Foods, however, denies any involvement in the outbreak. The company says it ""retested samples from the relevant lot of cheese, and it remains clear of any contamination,"" per the Bee. An independent lab ""confirmed our findings,"" the company adds. Gehl Foods' website notes its bags of cheese sauce, with a shelf life of one year, can be safely consumed from a dispenser for five days if kept at a continuous temperature of 140 degrees.

442,"['CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — A larger-than-life Australian mining magnate turned lawmaker, Clive Palmer, was widely accused Tuesday of threatening Australia\'s relationship with its biggest trading partner through an extraordinary tirade against China. \n \n The 60-year-old multi-millionaire called the Chinese ""bastards"" and ""mongrels"" and accused Beijing of trying to take over Australia during a nationally televised forum on Australian Broadcasting Corp. on Monday night. \n \n The tirade began when Palmer, who was elected to Parliament in October last year, was questioned about a legal dispute between his mining company Mineralogy and its Chinese state-owned partner, CITIC Pacific Mining. CITIC said in court that Palmer syphoned 12 million Australian dollars ($11 million) to fund his Palmer United Party\'s election campaign. \n \n Palmer, whose party forms a powerful voting bloc in the Senate with the support of four senators, said his companies were owed ""about AU$500 million by the communist Chinese government that doesn\'t want to pay."" He said he was countersuing. \n \n ""But it won\'t stop the fact that the Chinese government wants to bring workers here to destroy our wage system; it won\'t stop the fact that they want to take over our ports and get our resources for free,"" Palmer said. \n \n Palmer said CITIC had shipped AU$200 million in iron ore from Australia without paying royalties to Western Australian state, a claim the state premier denied. \n \n ""I don\'t mind standing up against the Chinese bastards and stopping them from doing it,"" Palmer said. \n \n Palmer said his companies already had three federal and supreme court judgments ""against these Chinese mongrels."" \n \n ""I\'m saying this because they\'re communist, they shoot their own people, they haven\'t got a justice system and they want to take over this country, and we\'re not going to let them do it,"" Palmer said. \n \n Palmer said on his Twitter account on Tuesday his comments were ""not intended to refer to Chinese people but to (a) Chinese company which is taking Australian resources & not paying."" \n \n Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said Tuesday that she would personally tell the Chinese Embassy that ""these views are not representative of the Australian Parliament and I don\'t believe representative of the Australian people."" \n \n ""Mr. Palmer\'s comments are offensive, they are unnecessary and it is unacceptable for a member of Parliament to make such comments, particularly on a national television program,"" Bishop told Melbourne Radio 3AW. ""I think he\'s using his position to demean the Chinese people because he\'s in a legal dispute with a Chinese company."" \n \n Treasurer Joe Hockey described Palmer\'s tirade as ""hugely damaging."" \n \n ""He is in a very obvious legal dispute with his Chinese partners, but I\'d say to Mr. Palmer, please don\'t bring down the rest of Australia because of your biases,"" Hockey told reporters. \n \n Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce described Palmer\'s comments as Australia finalizes a free trade deal with China as ""not helpful."" \n \n Western Australia Premier Colin Barnett described Palmer\'s comments as ""offensive, abhorrent and damaging"" to his iron ore-rich state and Australia\'s long-standing relationship with China. \n \n ""CITIC Pacific has paid all royalties owed to the West Australian government on time and in full,"" he said. \n \n ""The royalties Mr. Palmer is referring to are payments owed to him and his private companies, not royalties owed to the state government ..."" he added. \n \n CITIC spokesman John Gardner declined to comment. \n \n Palmer was a major donor to Australian conservative politics before he decided to bankroll his own political party. \n \n His headline-grabbing business projects have included building a replica of the Titanic and adding a Jurassic Park-style collection of mechanical dinosaurs to the grounds of his five-star resort.']",1,"– It may sound like peanuts compared to last week's Mega Millions drawing, but the 4th-largest jackpot in US history has a winner—or winners.

He signed the notorious Indian Removal Act of 1830, which relocated several tribes to territory that now comprises Oklahoma, where Mankiller was born and lived until her death in 2010. More than 4,000 Cherokees died during the tribe\'s forced march by the U.S. Army in what became known as ""The Trail of Tears."" \n \n ""There are so few reminders in our everyday lives of great women who\'ve contributed to the shaping of our nation,"" Susan Ades Stone, the group\'s executive director, said in a news release Monday.

Scientists have discovered that two highly common herpes viruses tend to be present in an ""increased"" way in the brains of people who suffered from Alzheimer's, according to a study published Thursday in Neuron of nearly 1,000 postmortem brains. NPR reports the study also found HHV-6 and HHV-7 may ""put gas on the flame,"" as study author Joel Dudley puts it, meaning the viruses' presence could be speeding up the progress of the disease. Now, the word of caution, from National Institute on Aging director Dr. Richard Hodes: ""The data are very provocative, but fall short of showing a direct causal role. If viral infections are playing a part, they are not the sole actor."" Dudley elaborates on that point, saying the presence of the viruses in the brain doesn't trigger Alzheimer's, but something—which isn't yet known—may be waking up the viruses and causing them to start replicating. The finding does suggest at least one course of action, which Hodes says the institute will be testing: dosing people who have high herpes levels in the brain with antiviral drugs. Live Science notes that ""it may sound startling to learn that there are strains of herpes in the brain,"" but it really isn't. Lead study author Dr. Benjamin Readhead says nearly one of every two brain tissues analyzed had the viruses; it's just that the Alzheimer's brains had up to twice as much.

445,"['President Trump’s new attorney Rudy Giuliani said Thursday that Attorney General Jeff Sessions should “close” Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe – a call that comes amid GOP pressure on Capitol Hill to find out whether the investigation has gone beyond its original mandate. \n \n Giuliani, the former New York City mayor, criticized Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in several interviews this week. \n \n “The basis of the case is dead,” Giuliani said on “Fox & Friends” Thursday, claiming the push to uncover collusion with the Russians has turned up no evidence. “Sessions should step in and close it.” \n \n Such a move would seem unlikely. Sessions recused himself from overseeing the Russia investigation due to campaign involvement. Rosenstein stepped in, and appointed Mueller to lead his own probe. \n \n But Giuliani stressed, in a separate interview with Fox News\' ""Hannity"" on Wednesday, that Sessions and Rosenstein should end Mueller’s investigation “in the interest of justice.” \n \n “There’s been too much government misconduct,” Giuliani said on “Hannity.” “The crimes now have all been committed by the government and their agents.” \n \n Giuliani’s comments come amid pressure from Republicans on Capitol Hill urging the Justice Department to release the full “scope memo,” which outlines the original scope of the investigation when Mueller was named. \n \n The Justice Department made public through a court filing a redacted version of the memo, while explaining to Reps. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, and Mark Meadows, R-N.C., that the full, unredacted version could not be shared because it pertains to an ongoing criminal investigation. \n \n Still, members are pushing to find out whether his team is probing matters outside that original scope laid out by Rosenstein. \n \n “On May 17, 2017, I issued an order entitled ‘Appointment of Special Counsel to Investigate Russian Interference with the 2016 Presidential Election and Related Matters,’ appointing you to serve as Special Counsel for the United States Department of Justice,” Rosenstein wrote to Mueller in the scope memo. \n \n The order states that Mueller is authorized to conduct an investigation “confirmed by then-FBI Director James B. Comey in testimony” before the House Intelligence Committee on March 20, 2017, including “any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump” and “any matters that arose or may arise directly from that investigation.” \n \n Rosenstein then includes a more extensive list with a “more specific description” of Mueller’s “authority,” but that portion has been heavily redacted. \n \n The unredacted details only outline allegations against former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, for allegedly committing “a crime or crimes by colluding with Russian government officials” or “arising out of payments he received from the Ukrainian government.” \n \n The rest of the scope memo is blacked out. \n \n Rosenstein, meanwhile, warned earlier this week that the Justice Department is ""not going to be extorted"" after members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus drafted articles of impeachment against him. The articles apparently were drafted as a ""last resort"" in lawmakers\' fight for documents. \n \n ""I can tell you there are people who have been making threats privately and publicly against me for quite some time and I think they should understand by now: The Department of Justice is not going to be extorted,"" Rosenstein said. ""We’re going to do what is required by the rule of law and any kind of threats that anybody makes are not going to affect the way we do our job."" \n \n Giuliani made his latest comments as he discussed in depth the $130,000 payment Trump attorney Michael Cohen made to porn star Stormy Daniels in 2016 to stay silent about accusations of an affair with Trump. Giuliani now says Trump reimbursed that money, but did not know at the time what it was for. Trump disputes the Daniels allegations. \n \n Last month, following the FBI’s raid of Cohen’s personal properties, and the revelation that it was referred by Mueller’s office, a spokesman for the special counsel referred Fox News to the U.S. Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) Title 28, Section 600.4 regarding “additional jurisdiction.” \n \n That section indicates Mueller could expand the scope with DOJ consent. \n \n “If in the course of his or her investigation the Special Counsel concludes that additional jurisdiction beyond that specific in his or her original jurisdiction is necessary in order to fully investigate and resolve the matters assigned, or to investigate new matters that come to light in the court of his or her investigation, he or she shall consult with the Attorney General, who will determine whether to include the additional matters within the Special Counsel’s jurisdiction, or assign them elsewhere,” the code reads. \n \n Fox News\' Jake Gibson contributed to this report.', 'CLOSE The former New York Mayor, who recently joined Trump\'s legal team, directly contradicted the president\'s claim that he had no knowledge of Michael Cohen\'s decision to pay Stormy Daniels $130,000.

Trump later said it had something to do with the Russia investigation. \n \n On Fox, Giuliani said Trump also fired Comey because he refused to say publicly that Trump was not a target in the Russia investigation. \n \n The attorney also called for an interview to last only two to three hours, saying that was the limit President Bill Clinton had when he testified in the Ken Starr/Monica Lewinsky case. \n \n ""I would like to get, one, not under oath,"" Giuliani told Hannity.

Giuliani’s statement follows four months of negotiations between the Mueller and Trump teams that have included talk of a subpoena if Trump refuses to testify in the special counsel probe into Russian interference with the 2016 US election. Giuliani also said that any interview with Trump should be limited in time. “They should be able to do this, if they have a case, in two or three hours,” Giuliani said during a series of media interviews Thursday, as reported in the Washington Post. But Giuliani also said, per Fox, that Attorney General Jeff Sessions should shut the probe down entirely as it has uncovered no evidence of collusion with the Russians. Trump has said in the past that he would be willing to be interviewed by Mueller, but he lately appears to be walking back some of those statements. Per the Post, some of Trump’s advisers worry that open-ended questions from Mueller could result in ""meandering"" answers from Trump that lead to accusations of perjury.

On Thursday, General Motors said there\'s another safety problem plaguing the same vehicles.The company is recalling 2.19 million of the same Chevrolet Cobalt Saturn Ion, Sky Pontiac G5 and Solstice models to fix a problem that allows keys to be removed from ignitions that are not in the ""off"" position.In at least one case, a vehicle rolled away in a parking lot and resulted in a crash and injury, according to GM , which said it is aware of ""several hundred"" complaints about keys coming out of ignitions. The company will fix the ignition lock cylinders to prevent the problem.This is a separate problem than the one allowing ignition switches in the same models to inadvertently move from the ""run"" to ""accessory"" positions, which can turn off both the engine and airbag systems. That defect has led to 13 deaths, and subsequently, Congressional inquiries into why the company didn\'t recall affected vehicles sooner.Earlier Thursday, GM announced it has suspended two senior engineers – with pay – who oversaw changes in ignition-switch designs. Although the company did not name the two, Bloomberg News reported they were Ray DeGiorgio and Gary Altman During Congressional hearings last week, Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-MO) alleged that DeGiorgio had perjured himself while testifying in a lawsuit related to a crash caused by the faulty ignition switch, and expressed disbelief that he had not yet been fired.""This is an interim step as we seek the truth about what happened,"" GM CEO Mary Barra said about the suspensions Thursday. ""It was a difficult decision, but I believe it is best for GM.""Before removing the key from the ignition, GM says motorists should ensure their cars are in the ""park"" position or, in manual cars, have the emergency brake on until the cars are repaired . In the case of the ignition-switch recall, GM says drivers must remove all keys from their key rings until the cars are fixed.While GM has maintained the cars are safe to operate in that instance, it has also said there\'s a heightened risk driving on rough roads and other potentially jarring conditions. A US District Court judge in Texas is weighing a request to ground the entire fleet of affected cars until repairs are made. Last Friday, she said she did not yet have enough information to make a decision.GM announced the ignition-switch recall in February and has twice expanded it to include more vehicles. Overall, the company has issued six recalls in the past four weeks that affect 4,258,687 cars, including Thursday\'s recall.The company revised financial figures and said it expects to spend $1.3 billion on recalls in the first quarter of 2013. That\'s up from previous estimates of $750 million.""The extent, and cost of GM\'s ignition-switch recall has grown dramatically in the past few weeks,"" said Karl Brauer, a senior analyst with Kelley Blue Book.

Warnings of widespread starvation are growing as pro-government forces besiege an opposition-held town in Syria. (Reuters) \n \n Aid agencies expressed alarm Thursday about dire conditions in a besieged town west of Damascus where people have been eating cats and grass to stay alive and as many as 23 people are reported to have died of hunger. \n \n No food has arrived in the rural town of Madaya since October, and desperate residents have posted photographs on the Internet showing frail, skeletal corpses and emaciated people, including children. \n \n The medical charity Doctors Without Borders said 23 people have died of starvation since Dec. 1 at a clinic the group supports in Madaya, six of them infants less than 1 year old. \n \n The town has become “an open-air prison,” Brice de le Vingne, director of operations for Doctors Without Borders, said in a statement. Desperate people who try to flee have been injured or killed by bullets or by land mines planted around the town, he added. \n \n According to Hassan Abu Shadi, a rescue worker in Madaya, one or two people have been dying daily of hunger over the past week, since snow fell on the mountain town and blanketed the last remaining vegetation. \n \n This undated photo posted by the Local Revolutionary Council in Madaya, which has been verified and is consistent with other Associated Press reporting, shows a starving boy in Madaya, Syria. (AP) \n \n “We were eating leaves and grass, but these days there are no more leaves because of the snow,” he said, speaking by telephone. “There is nothing left but salt and water.” \n \n The United Nations said in a statement that it has received “credible” reports of people dying of starvation and being killed while trying to leave the town. It welcomed what it said was a commitment from the Syrian government to allow aid to be delivered soon. \n \n Madaya is an opposition stronghold that has been besieged by pro-government forces since July. The United Nations put the number of people trapped in the town at 42,000, but Doctors Without Borders said there were 20,000. \n \n [Russian airstrikes force a halt to aid in Syria, triggering a new crisis] \n \n Fighting over Madaya, which fell into rebel hands in 2012, was supposed to have ended last summer under a cease-fire deal that also encompassed two rebel-surrounded towns in northern Syria. According to the terms of the cease-fire, rebel fighters from Madaya and nearby Zabadani were escorted by the United Nations to Turkey, and government loyalists from the towns of Foua and Kefraya were permitted to leave for government-held areas of Syria. \n \n The deal stipulated that food aid and other supplies be allowed to reach civilians inside the towns. But only one delivery was made to Madaya, on Oct. 18, and residents since then have almost entirely run out of food. \n \n The United Nations pointed out that it requires Syrian government permission to send food aid to the estimated 400,000 needy people living in various areas around Syria that are besieged by government forces. But in the past year, only 10 percent of requests have been granted, the United Nations said. \n \n People are going hungry in many of those locations, but \xadMadaya appears to be the worst-afflicted by far. \n \n [Is it too late to solve the mess in the Middle East?] \n \n The Syrian government has long used siege tactics to compel the surrender of towns that \n \n fell under rebel control during \n \n the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad. At the entrance to Madaya, Abu Shadi said, pro-Assad fighters have hung a sign proclaiming “Kneel or starve,” a slogan intended to capture the stark choice confronting rebels in the besieged communities. \n \n He said most of the fighters surrounding the town belong to the Lebanese Shiite movement Hezbollah, which supports Assad and has been leading the battle to recapture Syrian towns in the vicinity of the nearby Lebanese border. \n \n Hezbollah denied the allegations, saying that rebels were preventing residents from leaving. “Terrorist groups are exclusively responsible for starving out the civilians in the town,” said a report carried on the website of Hezbollah’s al-Manar television station. The towns of Foua and Kefraya also have not received aid, the report said. \n \n Although the reports of starvation deaths cannot be independently confirmed, videos and photographs posted on social \xadmedia showing emaciated people suggest that conditions are dire. In one, a mother is shown feeding her gaunt 16-month-old daughter sips of jam diluted with water, because, she says, there is no \n \n milk. A photo circulated Tuesday showed the skeletal frame of a man who had died of hunger that day. \n \n The United Nations said the Syrian government promised Thursday to allow aid to be delivered “in the coming days” to Madaya as well as the two northern towns surrounded by rebels. \n \n Read more: \n \n Videos appear to show starvation used as a weapon in Syrian town of Madaya \n \n Haunting images from Aleppo: ‘Syrian children are at the heart of this catastrophe’ \n \n U.N. Security Council approves plan for Syrian peace process""]",2,"– How did GM mess up so badly in addressing its deadly ignition switch glitch? In part it's due to a snafu over a part number and coworker obstruction, documents released by the House committee investigating the recall reveal. The documents sketch the two-year plight of low-level engineer Brian Stouffer as he tried to get to the bottom of the matter, encountering what he saw as resistance from the electrical engineering division headed by Ray DeGiorgio—who was suspended last week, Bloomberg reports. ""Early in the discussion, we got push back from Electrical regarding their need to be involved,"" Stouffer wrote in a December email. DeGiorgio's unit had quietly fixed the ignition switch in some 2007-model cars, but never changed the part number, leaving Stouffer baffled as to why complaints stopped coming in. In 2012, the company gave Stouffer a list of Cobalt changes that didn't mention it. Management churn hurt, too—Stouffer went through three bosses in one year. GM on Friday recalled yet another 2.19 million vehicles of the same models in response to yet another ignition concern—this time one allowing the key to slip out while the car is on, Autoblog reports. The company said it had ""several hundred"" complaints."

450,"['Scientists create new robotic Terminator-style muscle 1,000 times stronger than humans \n \n By Travis Gettys \n \n Thursday, December 26, 2013 11:25 EDT \n \n Researchers have developed a tiny robotic muscle that’s 1,000 time stronger than a human muscle. \n \n The team of researchers at the University of California-Berkeley found that vanadium dioxide changes from an insulator to a conductive metal at about 152 degrees, which produced a huge amount of strength during the transition. \n \n The scientists used the material to demonstrate a microchip-sized, twisting robotic motor that could catapult objects 50 times heavier than itself over a distance five times longer than itself faster than the blink of an eye – within 60 milliseconds. \n \n The team fabricated the micro-muscle from a long V-shaped ribbon made of chromium and vanadium dioxide, which is already prized for its ability to change size, shape and physical identity, and heated it with a tiny pad or by electrical current. \n \n When the dual coil formed by the ribbon is heated, said physicist Junqiao Wu, who led the team, it turns into either a tiny catapult or a proximity sensor, which causes a rapid change in the muscle’s resistance and shape that pushes away nearby objects. \n \n “Multiple micro-muscles can be assembled into a micro-robotic system that simulates an active neuromuscular system,” Wu said. “The naturally combined functions of proximity sensing and torsional motion allow the device to remotely detect a target and respond by reconfiguring itself to a different shape. This simulates living bodies where neurons sense and deliver stimuli to the muscles and the muscles provide motion.” \n \n The team found the micro-muscles could twist and turn more than 1 million times without degradation, and they showed far greater movement abilities than current robotic motors. \n \n Vanadium dioxide can also absorb light and convert it to heat, which will allow the micro-muscle to be triggered optothermally. \n \n The technology could eventually be used to build a complex organism that simulates an active neuromuscular system, perhaps in prosthetic limbs or surgical procedures. \n \n “With its combination of power and multi-functionality, our micro-muscle shows great potential for applications that require a high level of functionality integration in a small space,” Wu said.', 'TAMPA, Fla. — Even as Mitt Romney sought to quash the furor surrounding Todd Akin’s “legitimate” rape comments, the Republican platform committee here approved an abortion plank that includes no exemptions for rape, incest or even to save the life of the mother. \n \n The platform committee instead approved draft language Tuesday, calling for a “Human Life Amendment” that gives legal protection to the unborn. Democrats quickly labeled the GOP language the “Akin Plank,” referring to the Missouri Senate candidate’s statements that victims of “legitimate rape” rarely get pregnant. \n \n Text Size - \n \n + \n \n reset \n \n On Tuesday, not one of the 100-plus members on the GOP platform committee introduced amendments. They kept the identical language from 2004 and 2008. \n \n “I appreciate the good work that that committee did — in past platforms that has been hours of discussion — and I applaud the committee’s work in affirming our respect for human life,” said Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell, the chairman of the platform committee. “Well done.” \n \n The full committee later passed a measure opposing the FDA approval of drugs like RU-486, which North Carolina representative Mary Summa called “an abortion pill.” The platform would now effectively prevent the sale of “any drug that terminates life after conception.” \n \n Not everyone liked the idea. \n \n “In light of the recent comments by Congressman Todd Akin,” said Alabama platform representative Jacqueline Curtiss, “and in an attempt to reaffirm to the American people the party’s sensitivity on the subject of rape, I believe that we should not support an amendment which opposes approval of a method that has been proven effective in preventing the pregnancy of rape victims.” \n \n She wound up on the losing end of the vote. It was the only time Akin was mentioned by name during two days of platform committee meetings. \n \n The full platform committee also voted to reinstate support for abstinence-only education, after a subcommittee had removed it Monday. \n \n The abortion language approved Tuesday endorses legislation that would say the 14th Amendment applies after conception and that would oppose using public funds to pay for abortions. It urges Congress to strengthen the Born Alive Infant Protection Act of 2002 by adding civil and criminal penalties for doctors who don’t adequately care for newborn babies. It supports a ban on sex-selective abortions. It also calls for mandatory waiting periods and parental consent requirements.']",2,"– A team of government scientists has created a microchip-sized robotic muscle capable of throwing objects 50 times heavier than itself a distance five times longer than its length in less than 60 milliseconds.

The decision was a major statement on the meaning of a fundamental principle of the American political system, that of “one person one vote.” \n \n “We hold, based on constitutional history, this court’s decisions and longstanding practice, that a state may draw its legislative districts based on total population,” Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote for the court. \n \n As a practical matter, the ruling mostly helped Democrats and upheld the status quo. \n \n But until this decision, the court had never resolved whether voting districts should contain roughly the same number of people or the same number of eligible voters.

Presenting their findings at the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology annual meeting in Helsinki, Finland, this month, researchers in Greece said they were able to reverse menopause in roughly 30 women, including one who entered menopause at 40 but five years later menstruated again, reports New Scientist. The team has collected three eggs from her and, using her husband's sperm, fertilized two into embryos that they plan to implant into her uterus. Still, an outside researcher says, the development ""opens up ethical questions over what the upper age limit of mothers should be."" The team reports that roughly 1% of women become infertile before they turn 40 thanks to certain medical conditions and cancer treatments. ""It offers a window of hope that menopausal women will be able to get pregnant using their own genetic material,"" says gynecologist Konstantinos Sfakianoudis. The team injected a woman's ovaries with a platelet-rich plasma—or PRP, which is made with a person's own blood to trigger tissue and blood vessel growth and has been used by the likes of Tiger Woods to speed healing from soft-tssue injuries, notes Forbes—to effectively rejuvenate them and trigger menstrual cycles. They're not yet sure exactly how it works, but they've managed to fertilize eggs from nearly all of the 30 women they studied, who are between 45 and 49 and want to have children. In related news, a meta analysis published in JAMA found that some ""natural"" remedies, though not Chinese ""medicinal"" herbs, may slightly improve certain symptoms of menopause.

He urged the Taliban and al-Qaida to perform the ""sacred duty"" of helping locate and kill the filmmaker. \n \n The film Innocence of Muslims has sparked violent protests throughout the Muslim world that resulted in the deaths of dozens. \n \n In Bangladesh, police fired teargas and used batons to disperse the stone-throwing protesters who burnt several vehicles. \n \n Dozens of protesters were arrested at the demonstration and inside the nearby National Press Club, where participants took refuge, a Dhaka metropolitan police official said on condition of anonymity in line with police policy. Police and witnesses said scores of people were injured. \n \n The clash erupted when authorities attempted to halt the demonstration, police said. Authorities have banned all protests near the city\'s main Baitul Mokarram mosque since Friday, when more than 2,000 people marched and burned an effigy of the US president, Barack Obama. \n \n The protesters announced a nationwide general strike on Sunday to protest against the police action. \n \n In Pakistan, protests continued on Saturday, with more than 1,500 people, including women and children, rallying in the capital, Islamabad. The crowd was peaceful but angry over the film, which portrays the prophet Muhammad as a fraud, a womaniser and a child molester. \n \n The protesters from the Minhaj-ul-Quran religious group marched through the streets then gathered near parliament, chanting slogans against the filmmaker and demanding stern punishment for him. \n \n Thousands of people also protested on Saturday in Nigeria\'s largest city, Kano.

Mohammed El Kish, whose cousin was killed by a stray bullet more than a mile from the clashes, said: ""He was not even involved in the actions, it is terrible."" \n \n City hospitals were braced for more violence after the Rafallah al-Sahati militia reoccupied its looted base.

Such designations are lost on many ordinary Libyans, who say many militias from last year\'s revolution have simply cut deals with ministries, enabling them to form what are in essence private armies. \n \n Washington is likely to draw quiet comfort from the sight of ordinary Libyan civilians confronting jihadists, after a week in which embassies across the Muslim world were firebombed and protests claimed 15 lives in Pakistan. US diplomats in Libya had been at pains not to inflame public opinion, with no criticism of the failure of the Libyan police to launch a full investigation into the killing of Stevens. \n \n Nearly two weeks after his death, an FBI team sent to Tripoli has yet to be given permission to travel to Benghazi. The city\'s chief prosecutor Saleh Adem Mohammed refused to discuss the case, nor confirm reports of four men arrested on suspicion of the killing. ""We are not responsible for what the politicians say."" \n \n Rumours are sweeping Benghazi that one of the two US compounds in the city that came under attack housed a small ""black ops"" unit that had moved to Libya after the rocket attack on the British ambassador in the city in June. The US has yet to explain why some 30 diplomats needed to be evacuated from a consulate that might be expected to have less than half that staff. \n \n But as more eyewitness evidence accumulates, it is clear that the attack on the consulate was unprovoked, and that statements from Washington that it grew out of an anti-American protest appear to be false.']",2,"– Hundreds of protesters clashed with police in Bangladesh today as rage over an anti-Islamic film continued to inflame the Muslim world, the Guardian reports.

In other words, the memories might remain—however deeply hidden—in the brain, and thus accessing them is just a matter of stimulating the right neurons. ""It has the potential to lead to novel drug development to help with regaining memories,"" a researcher tells the Washington Post. To study this, researchers used a laser technology called optogenetics to watch neuron activity in the brains of mice. All mice in this study were given an electric shock after sniffing a lemon scent, but a week later, only half those with dementia froze when they smelled lemon in anticipation of being shocked, compared to all the healthy mice freezing. The researchers were able to watch the healthy mice retrieve memories from the same place where they'd been stored, while mice with dementia called up other memories stored elsewhere. But by stimulating the neurons with a blue laser, scientists were able to reactivate memories in the mice with dementia. The downside? Optogenetics isn't ready for humans, notes the Post, ""because it isn’t yet safe or practical to tinker with our neurons or stick lasers into our brains."" Next up, scientists hope to see whether memories are stored and retrieved similarly in humans. The Independent points out that in some Alzheimer's cases, music has been known to rouse old memories, ""suggesting they may not disappear completely.""

464,"['(Adds IAC comment, paragraphs 12-13) \n \n Feb 11 The millions of people using dating apps on company smartphones could be exposing themselves and their employers to hacking, spying and theft, according to a study by International Business Machines Corp. \n \n IBM security researchers said 26 of 41 dating apps they analyzed on Google Inc\'s Android mobile platform had medium or high severity vulnerabilities, in a report published on Wednesday. \n \n IBM did not name the vulnerable apps but said it had alerted the app publishers to problems. \n \n Dating apps have become hugely popular in the past few years due to their instant messaging, photo and geolocation services. About 31 million Americans have used a dating site or app, according to a 2013 Pew Research Center study. \n \n IBM found employees used vulnerable dating apps in nearly 50 percent of the companies sampled for its research. Using the same phone for work and play, a phenomenon known as ""bring your own device,"" or BYOD, means users and their employers are both open to potential cyberattacks. \n \n ""The trouble with BYOD is that, if not managed properly, the organizations might be leaking sensitive corporate data via employee-owned devices,"" said the IBM report. \n \n IBM said the problem is that people on dating apps let their guard down and are not as sensitive to potential security problems as they might be on email or websites. \n \n If an app is compromised, hackers can take advantage of users waiting eagerly to hear back from a potential love interest by sending bogus ""phishing"" messages to glean sensitive information or install malware, IBM said. \n \n A phone\'s camera or microphone could be turned on remotely through a vulnerable app, which IBM warned could be used to eavesdrop on personal conversations or confidential business meetings. Vulnerable GPS data could also lead to stalking, and a user\'s billing information could be hacked to purchase things on other apps or websites. \n \n IBM said it had not so far seen a rash of security breaches due to dating apps as opposed to any other kind of social media. \n \n Meanwhile, it recommends that dating app users limit the personal information they divulge, use unique passwords on every online account, apply the latest software patches and keep track of what permissions each app has. \n \n IAC/InterActiveCorp, which owns some of the most popular dating apps, said its services were not at risk. \n \n ""IBM tested IAC\'s dating apps - including Match, OkCupid, and Tinder - and they were not among the apps found to exhibit the cited vulnerabilities,"" the company said in a statement emailed to Reuters. (Reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing by Cynthia Osterman and Tom Brown)', 'February 11, 2015 11:25 PM \n \n NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) — Are you looking for love this Valentine’s Day? \n \n As CBS2’s Tracee Carrasco reported, there is a new warning that could leave dating app users heartbroken. \n \n “I went on just one Tinder date,” said Kelly Geiling. “I met a guy for drinks and that was it.” \n \n Many people are looking for love, and like Geiling, many turn to dating apps on their smartphones hoping to find it. \n \n “I went through to try and find, like, a normal person,” Geiling said. \n \n But now, daters need to worry about more than just finding a normal person. Hackers could be getting a hold of their personal information. \n \n “I’m concerned that I never thought about that,” Geiling said. \n \n According to new research from IBM Security, 60 percent of dating apps on mobile devices have security flaws that could allow a hacker to break in, install a virus on your phone — even steal a credit card or personal information. \n \n “Your contacts list; it could be your stored images, or your pictures. They can actually also potentially access features on the device – so your camera, your microphone, even your GPS location,” said Michael Monticello, security intelligence director of IBM Security Services. \n \n IBM Security found that 26 out of 41 dating apps that were tested put users at risk to hackers. \n \n The first step in protecting yourself is not to share too much information, and also, Monitcello said, “understanding if there is a configuration or how your app actually works is pretty important.” \n \n Also, you are advised always to make sure you use a trusted wi-fi connection. \n \n IBM Security doesn’t want to discourage people from using dating apps to find love, but just wants to make sure people are aware of these security risks.', '(Reuters) - The Trump administration has ordered a review of sweeping federal land-use restrictions adopted in 2015 to safeguard the greater sage grouse, a once-ubiquitous prairie bird whose fate is tied to the health of America’s vast but vanishing Western grasslands. \n \n FILE PHOTO - U.S. Bureau of Land Management photo shows a sage grouse in this undated photo. Bob Wick/Courtesy BLM/Handout via REUTERS \n \n Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke announced the 60-day review of sage grouse conservation rules in a Wednesday conference call with reporters, saying Western governors have complained that federal implementation of the plan has been alternately “heavy-handed” and inconsistent. \n \n Environmental groups immediately protested the move, saying it might lead to unraveling a complex and delicately balanced strategy that took federal agencies years to negotiate with state and local governments, scientists, ranchers and other private interests. \n \n The Obama administration launched the plan in September 2015 as an alternative to listing the ground-dwelling bird under the Endangered Species Act, a move that would potentially have entailed even tougher habitat protections. \n \n Zinke insisted he was seeking to perfect, not dismantle, sage grouse conservation measures, while allowing greater innovation and “flexibility” by individual states on “such things as jobs and energy development.” \n \n He said greater focus might be placed on factors other than strict habitat protection, such as predator, disease and wildfire control. Zinke also said some states have suggested the overall strategy place more emphasis on grouse population numbers than on habitat size. \n \n Two Western governors, Democrat John Hickenlooper of Colorado and Republican Matthew Mead of Wyoming, who co-chair a federal-state sage grouse task force, contradicted such a shift in a letter to Zinke last month. \n \n “We understand that you are considering ... moving from a habitat management model to one that sets population objectives for the states. We are concerned that this is not the right decision,” they wrote in the May 26 letter. \n \n The plight of the grouse, a key indicator species for America’s dwindling sagebrush ecosystem, has pitted conservation groups against oil and gas drilling, wind farms and cattle grazing in one of the biggest industry-versus-nature conflicts in decades. \n \n The landmark measures implemented 21 months ago were aimed at saving the grouse while allowing activities such as energy development, mining and ranching to co-exist with the chicken-sized prairie fowl. \n \n The greater sage grouse, known for its elaborate mating rituals, once ranged by the millions across a broad expanse of the western United States and Canada. They are now believed to number between 200,000 and 500,000 birds across 11 Western states and southern Alberta. \n \n Besides a patchwork of conservation programs for state and private lands representing 45 percent of sage grouse habitat, the new strategy includes a set of tiered limits on commercial development inside 67 million acres (27 million hectares) of designated habitat on federal land. \n \n Unlike many Western land-use battles of the past, sage grouse conservation drew wide support from commercial interests. Many ranchers, in particular, found common cause with efforts to protect the rangelands on which their livestock depend, citing the axiom: “What’s good for the bird is good for the herd.”']",3,"– As if online dating weren't fraught with enough pitfalls, an IBM study published yesterday found that 26 of 41 popular Android dating apps, or 63%, had ""medium to severe"" security vulnerabilities that could leave users open to hacks, Reuters reports. And almost half of the companies reviewed for the report had workers who tapped into such apps—and then used the same phone at work, opening up their employers to cyberissues as well. ""Your contacts list … your stored images. [Hackers] can actually also potentially access features on the device—so your camera, your microphone, even your GPS location,"" says the security intelligence director of IBM Security, per CBS New York. How likely (and incredibly creepy) is that? The report reveals 73% of top dating apps can tell your past and present GPS locations, while 34% can get into your camera. Which means, on a not-so-romantic front, that hackers can possibly stalk your daily activity, scroll through images, and even take over your dating profile, IBM's Security Intelligence notes. And if the electronic intruders can hijack your camera and mic, they can potentially spy on business meetings and access sensitive company data on your phone. IBM says it doesn't want to discourage people from using the apps, but it preaches some common-sense tips: Don't give out too much personal info on dating sites, don't ignore the security updates and patches your phone occasionally asks you to make, and mix up your passwords for all online accounts and email addresses. (Maybe this informational STD app will keep hackers away.)"

Palestinians, however, accused Israel of breaking it less than an hour after it began with a bomb attack on a refugee camp, reports Reuters. A spokesperson for the Israeli military was checking into the report. Israel had exempted the area around Rafah, but this strike occurred elsewhere, killing an 8-year-old girl and wounding about 20, say Palestinians. Other developments: Bus attack: Israeli police say an attacker drove a construction excavator into a bus in Jerusalem today and overturned the vehicle, reports the AP. Several people were reportedly injured, at least one seriously, and the attacker was shot and killed by police. Israel called it a terrorist attack. School strike under scrutiny: A New York Times investigation of an Israeli strike at a UN school in Jabaliya on Wednesday suggests that Israel used heavy artillery ""inappropriate for urban areas."" The strike killed 21 people who were sheltering at the school, and the Times says Israel has offered no evidence that Hamas militants were operating in the vicinity as a justification for the attack. No end in sight: Israel has announced a scaling back of ground operations, leading to speculation that the entire military operation might be winding down. ""But it is by no means clear that an end to the fighting is in sight,"" writes Bethany Bell at the BBC.

Retailers like Walgreens Boots Alliance, CVS Health and Rite Aid have seen their so-called front of store sales threatened as shoppers increasingly buy household staples online or from convenience stores. \n \n Shares of all three tanked Thursday on the news, along with drug distributors Cardinal Health, AmerisourceBergen and McKesson.

472,"['A sharply divided federal appeals court, acting with uncommon speed, cleared the way Tuesday for a teenage immigrant to have an abortion while in federal custody in Texas. \n \n The 6-3 decision by the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, made without hearing oral arguments and only two days after an appeal by lawyers for the 17-year-old immigrant, reversed a ruling from Friday that would have delayed an abortion until at least next week. \n \n The decision returned the case to U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan, who issued an order directing federal officials to “promptly and without delay” allow the teenager to have the abortion she has been seeking for about a month. \n \n Abortion opponents quickly pressed the Trump administration to appeal the ruling in hopes of protecting a policy that denies access to abortion for minors in federal custody after illegally crossing the southern border without a parent. \n \n Lawyers for the Central American teen, identified only as Jane Doe or JD, praised the ruling but criticized the need to rely on the courts to protect her right to an abortion. \n \n “Every step of the way, the Trump administration has shown their true colors in this case,” said Doe’s lead lawyer, Brigitte Amiri with the American Civil Liberties Union. “It’s clear that their anti-woman, anti-abortion, anti-immigration agenda is unchecked by basic decency or even the bounds of the law.” \n \n Tuesday’s decision by the full appeals court overturned Friday’s ruling by a three-judge panel of the court. That ruling had given Trump administration officials until Oct. 31 to find an adult sponsor to take custody of the teen, a move that presumably would have allowed her to have an abortion without violating a Trump administration rule requiring childbirth to be promoted over abortion for minors in federal custody. \n \n Doe’s lawyers had argued that the delay unnecessarily put her physical and mental health at risk for no viable reason because it was highly unlikely that an appropriate sponsor could be identified, investigated and approved before the Oct. 31 deadline. \n \n Tuesday’s ruling was split along partisan lines. All six of the judges who favored Doe had been appointed by Democratic presidents, while the three dissenting judges were named by Republicans. \n \n All three judges on the original panel issued statements accompanying the ruling. \n \n Writing in dissent, Justice Karen LeCraft Henderson said the court majority “plows new and potentially dangerous ground” by mistakenly concluding that Doe, as a minor in the country illegally, had a constitutional right to an abortion. \n \n “Under my colleagues’ decision, it is difficult to imagine an alien minor anywhere in the world who will not have a constitutional right to an abortion in this country,” Henderson wrote. \n \n Justice Brett Kavanaugh, in a dissent joined by Henderson and Thomas Griffith, said the majority erroneously found “a new right for unlawful immigrant minors in U.S. government detention to obtain immediate abortion on demand.” \n \n “The majority’s decision represents a radical extension of the Supreme Court’s abortion jurisprudence,” Kavanaugh wrote, arguing that the delay to find a sponsor to take custody of Doe represented the best way to resolve the controversy. \n \n Justice Patricia Millett, who had opposed the delay to find a sponsor scoffed at the arguments. \n \n “It is unclear why undocumented status should change everything,” she wrote. “Surely the mere act of entry into the United States without documentation does not mean that an immigrant’s body is no longer her or his own. Nor can the sanction for unlawful entry be forcing a child to have a baby.” \n \n Doe’s case was closely watched for its potential effect on two contentious issues — access to abortion and immigration policy — and much of the legal fight focused on who is to blame for the situation. \n \n Lawyers for Doe blamed Trump administration officials for keeping her in a state of forced pregnancy by refusing to let her travel to clinic appointments — in essence, holding the 17-year-old hostage to their belief that abortion is wrong. \n \n By advancing a policy that forbids any action that helps in-custody minors get an abortion, administration officials are placing an improper obstacle to a constitutionally protected procedure, the ACLU lawyers argued. \n \n U.S. Department of Justice lawyers say Doe is to blame for any obstacles in her path. \n \n The teen, they argued, is in federal custody because she entered the United States illegally — a situation that she is free to end by voluntarily returning to her home country, ending her custody and any restrictions or obstacles it brings. By choosing to remain in custody, Doe also remains subject to Trump administration policies that promote childbirth over abortion, the lawyers said. \n \n “Any alleged ‘obstacle’ to Ms. Doe’s ability to obtain an abortion is by her own choice,” government lawyers told the appeals court.', 'Activists with Planned Parenthood demonstrate in support of a pregnant 17-year-old being held in a Texas facility for unaccompanied immigrant children to obtain an abortion. | J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo Federal appeals court clears way for undocumented teen to get abortion It’s not clear how soon the girl could have an abortion. \n \n A federal appeals court has ruled that an undocumented pregnant minor being held in a federally-funded shelter in Texas can receive an abortion. \n \n The full bench of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned an earlier ruling last Friday from a three-judge panel of that court that gave the Trump administration until Oct. 31 to try to defuse the controversy by finding an adult sponsor who could take in the 17-year old pregnant girl. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n On Sunday the girl’s lawyers had asked the full court to set aside the decision, saying that they’ve exhausted their options to find a sponsor. They said the delay brings the girl, now close to 16 weeks pregnant, dangerously close to the states’ 20-week limit on abortion. \n \n The court’s full bench split along party lines with six Democrat appointed judges ruling in favor, three Republican appointees bitterly denouncing the decision and one Democratic appointee recusing herself. \n \n A Justice Department spokesman said the administration is reviewing the order. He had no immediate comment on whether federal officials will try to seek relief from the Supreme Court. \n \n The most reliable politics newsletter.

The girl’s lawyers have asked a district court judge to amend a previous order to allow the girl to have an abortion within days. \n \n The girl, who is being held in the Rio Grande Valley in a facility funded by the Department of Health and Human Services, already had a counseling appointment that Texas requires 24 hours before an abortion could be performed. However, her lawyers said she would have to repeat that appointment because the doctor who performed the previous exam last week won’t be available in the next few days. \n \n If the case is further delayed, the girl will have to travel about 200 miles to obtain the procedure in an ambulatory surgical center or hospital, which Texas law requires for abortions at least 16 weeks into a pregnancy. \n \n For the last seven months, HHS has intervened to prevent abortions sought by girls at federally funded shelters. The Jane Doe case has opened a new legal front over abortion rights and has raised thorny issues about immigration and the rights of foreigners on U.S. soil. \n \n Anti-abortion groups such as Americans United for Life and Susan B. Anthony List condemned Tuesday’s ruling. The decision will turn the country into “a sanctuary nation for abortion,” wrote SBA List President Marjorie Dannenfelser in a statement. “This shameful ruling must not stand.” \n \n The attorneys general of 14 states filed a brief arguing the administration’s policy of blocking abortions for undocumented minors undermines the rights of states to establish consent requirements. Texas attorney general Ken Paxton, along with eight other state attorneys general, have meanwhile argued undocumented immigrants “do not have a right to abortion on demand.” \n \n In Tuesday’s decision, Judge Patricia Millett wrote the girl is constitutionally entitled to an abortion even though she is undocumented, and that the administration should release her from the shelter for the procedure. \n \n She pointed out that the girl, known as Jane Doe in court filings, has obtained private funding for the procedure and the proper approval needed under Texas law to have the procedure without parental sign-off. Millett agreed with new information from the girl’s lawyers the search for a sponsor would slow down the process. \n \n “The court today correctly recognizes that J.D.’s unchallenged right under the Due Process Clause affords this 17-year-old a modicum of the dignity, sense of self-worth, and control over her own destiny that life seems to have so far denied her,” wrote Millett, an Obama appointee. \n \n In previous hearings, Trump administration lawyers wouldn’t address whether undocumented minors have constitutional rights such as abortion. Instead, they asserted that federal authorities were under no obligation to facilitate abortions for minors in their care. \n \n Judge Brett Kavanaugh, a George W. Bush appointee who had apparently devised the previous compromise of allowing the administration extra time to help the girl find a sponsor, dissented with the court’s Tuesday decision. He said that the federal government’s stated desire to encourage child-rearing is valid and is entitled to be recognized in the process. \n \n “The Government has permissible interests in favoring fetal life, protecting the best interests of a minor, and refraining from facilitating abortion,” he wrote. \n \n Judge Karen Henderson, a George H.W. Bush appointee, in a separate dissenting opinion argued that the undocumented teen lacks constitutional rights, including the right to an abortion. And she criticized the Trump administration for refusing to address that issue. \n \n “The government has inexplicably and wrongheadedly failed to take a position on that antecedent question. I say wrongheadedly because at least to me the answer is plainly— and easily—no,” she said. “To conclude otherwise rewards lawlessness and erases the fundamental difference between citizenship and illegal presence in our country.” \n \n If the teen had been in the United States for a long time or had come in legally, her right to an abortion would be harder to dispute, lawyers said. But she crossed the border from Mexico early last month and was immediately apprehended. \n \n “That’s what [Henderson’s] beef is. This person was caught at the border and never formally made an entry,” said Cornell law professor Stephen Yale-Loehr. “People who just made it into the country and don’t have any ties here, do they have any constitutional rights? Do they have the full panoply? This is really the gray area. Nobody has a clear answer.” \n \n The case appears to have strained relations on the court. Kavanaugh, joined by his Republican-appointed colleagues, expressed regret over ”many aspects” of how the court’s full bench handled what he called “a novel and highly fraught case.” The D.C. Circuit rarely grants full court, or en banc, review of cases, and it even more rarely takes en banc action on a preliminary matter. \n \n “The Court never should have reheard this case en banc in the first place,"" Kavanaugh wrote. ""The panel was faced with an emergency motion involving an under-developed factual record that is still unclear and hotly contested."" \n \n This article tagged under: Immigration \n \n Abortion \n \n Texas']",2,"– In a new twist in the ongoing saga of a 17-year-old's attempts to get an abortion while being held in a federal immigration shelter, the DC Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Tuesday the Trump administration must stop blocking her from the procedure, Politico reports. A three-judge panel of the court on Friday gave the government until Oct. 31 to find a sponsor to take custody of the undocumented teen, known only as Jane Doe. Lawyers for the teen, who is being represented by the ACLU, said they'd tried everything to find her a sponsor to no avail. On Sunday, they asked the full court to reverse the panel's decision. Lawyers argued the delay to Oct. 31 is putting the teen dangerously close to the abortion cutoff for Texas, which bans the procedure after 20 weeks. Tuesday's 6-3 ruling was split between Democrat- and Republican-appointed judges. It sends the case back to a lower court, where a judge ordered the Trump administration to allow Jane Doe to have an abortion, the Austin-American Statesman reports. According to the AP, the teen came to the US in September from an unnamed Central American country and found out she was pregnant while in federal custody. The Department of Health and Human Services says it has a police of ""refusing to facilitate"" abortions and had refused to transport or temporarily release the teen to have the procedure. “It’s clear that their anti-woman, anti-abortion, anti-immigration agenda is unchecked by basic decency or even the bounds of the law,” an ACLU lawyer says.

But the educators said she was among those pressuring them to inflate students\' scores to show gains in achievement — which were needed to meet federal benchmarks tied to extra funding. \n \n Defense attorneys argued those convicted should remain free until sentencing because they don\'t have prior records, have community ties and showed up to trial every day. However, only one was allowed to remain free on bond — teacher Shani Robinson — because she is expecting to give birth soon. \n \n ""They are convicted felons as far as I\'m concerned,"" said Fulton County Superior Court Judge Jerry Baxter. \n \n ""They have made their bed and they\'re going to have to lie in it."" \n \n Bob Rubin, the defense attorney for former elementary school principal Dana Evans, said he was angry the judge decided to take the convicted former educators into custody immediately. \n \n ""I am shocked that he felt it necessary to do that,"" Rubin said. ""I felt it to be unnecessary and vindictive."" \n \n Prosecutors said the 12 former educators on trial were looking out for themselves, seeking bonuses for higher test scores rather than worrying about the education of the children they were charged with teaching. Defense attorneys said their clients were caught up in an overly broad prosecution that overreached in charging them with violating racketeering laws most often used for organized crime. \n \n The entire process was lengthy: The months-long trial began in August with more than six weeks of jury selection, and testimony concluded in late February. The criminal investigation by the Fulton County district attorney\'s office lasted nearly two years. \n \n The investigation involved at least 50 schools as well as hundreds of interviews with school administrators, staff, parents and students. Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard said it was the biggest and most complex case his office had ever handled. \n \n ""Our entire effort in this case was simply to get our community to stop and take a look at the education system,"" Howard said. \n \n The cheating came to light after The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that some scores were statistically improbable. \n \n Hall served as superintendent for more than a decade, which is rare for an urban schools chief. She was named Superintendent of the Year by the American Association of School Administrators in 2009 and credited with raising student test scores and graduation rates, particularly among the district\'s poor and minority students. But the award quickly lost its luster as her district became mired in the scandal. \n \n In a video message to schools staff before she retired, Hall warned that the state investigation launched by former Gov. Sonny Perdue would likely reveal ""alarming"" behavior. \n \n ""It\'s become increasingly clear that a segment of our staff chose to violate the trust that was placed in them,"" Hall said. ""There is simply no excuse for unethical behavior and no room in this district for unethical conduct. I am confident that aggressive, swift action will be taken against anyone who believed so little in our students and in our system of support that they turned to dishonesty as the only option.""', 'Guilty verdicts were reached for 11 of the 12 defendants in the Atlanta Public Schools CRCT cheating trial. Dessa Curb was the only defendant found not guilty on all charges. \n \n Listed below are the 12 educators that went to trial and what charges they were found guilty, or not guilty of: \n \n Racketeering - Guilty \n \n Influencing witnesses - Guilty \n \n Racketeering - Guilty \n \n Racketeering - Guilty \n \n False statements (2 counts) - Not Guilty \n \n False swearing - Not Guilty \n \n Racketeering - Guilty \n \n False statements & writings (3 counts) Not Guilty , Guilty, Guilty \n \n False swearing - Guilty \n \n Racketeering - Guilty \n \n Theft by taking - Not Guilty \n \n False statements & writing (2 counts) Guilty, Guilty \n \n Racketeering - Guilty \n \n False statements and writings - Not Guilty \n \n Theft by taking - Not Guilty \n \n Racketeering - Guilty \n \n False statements & writings (4 counts) - Not Guilty, Not Guilty, Not Guilty , Guilty \n \n Racketeering - Guilty \n \n False statements & writings (2 counts) - Guilty, Guilty \n \n False swearing (2 counts) - Guilty, Guilty \n \n Racketeering - Not Guilty \n \n False statements & writings (2 counts) - Not Guilty, Not Guilty \n \n Racketeering - Guilty \n \n False statements & writings - Guilty \n \n Racketeering - Guilty \n \n False statements and writings (2 counts) - Guilty, Guilty \n \n Racketeering - Guilty \n \n False statements & writings (2 counts) - Guilty, Guilty \n \n All of these educators have been accused of racketeering, in addition to charges ranging from theft by taking to making false statements. \n \n Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed issued the following statement after the verdict Wednesday afternoon: \n \n “The APS cheating scandal marked one of the darkest periods in the life of our city. I am hopeful that with the jury\'s verdict today, we can finally close this chapter and move forward with the education and development of our young people. I want to thank Judge Baxter and the Court for their service.” \n \n Unlike 21 others, the 12 educators on trial Wednesday did not take plea deals. Now their fates are sealed. \n \n ""They have made their bed, and they\'re going to have to lie in it,"" Judge Jerry Baxter said as he sent most of the educators directly to jail. Ten of the 11 educators found guilty were booked into the Fulton County jail. The men were taken to the jail in northwest Atlanta, while the women were taken to the South Jail Annex for women in Union City. \n \n Robinson was the only educator found guilty who was not immediately taken to jail due to her pregnancy. \n \n According to a spokesperson with Fulton County police, the 10 educators who were taken to jail Wednesday were all processed as any other inmate would be, including being searched, fingerprinted, given a medical screening, having their booking photograph taken and given inmate uniforms. \n \n \n \n A total of 35 educators were indicted in March of 2013. Prosecutors said they conspired to cheat or concealed cheating to boost test scores for financial gain. \n \n \n \n The case, which grabbed national headlines, stemmed from a 2009 investigation that revealed system wide cheating on the Criterion Referenced Competency Test. The test, which was issued to students in the APS system, measured student aptitude statewide. \n \n District Attorney Paul L. Howard, Jr. called the verdicts a victory for children. \n \n “When we indicted this case our goal was not to make a spectacle of the Atlanta Public School system. It was our attempt to encourage the people in our community to stop and take an honest look at what was happening in our schools and how changing test scores was ultimately harming our children,” says Howard. “We stand here today proud of our efforts, proud that we embarked upon a journey of truth, regardless of how long or arduous the task. We are certain today that our work has not been in vain.” \n \n Fulton County prosecutors said the cheating began under the leadership of former superintendent Doctor Beverly Hall.Hall became superintendent in 1999 and submitted her resignation letter in 2010 after cheating allegations surfaced. She officially stepped down in June of 2011. \n \n Hall had Stage 4 cancer and never made it to trial. She died on March 2. \n \n Atlanta Board of Education Statement \n \n This has been a sad and tragic chapter for Atlanta Public Schools that has now come to a close. It has been a painful time for our students, families, employees and the City. \n \n However, since Day One 2015, APS has remained focused on the students under the new student-centered Superintendent, Dr. Meria J. Carstarphen, and the new leadership in the Atlanta Board of Education. Reforms began almost three years ago and additional ones have been created under this new leadership to make sure something like this never happens again. Challenges remain, for sure, but we are making progress every day and there is great reason to be optimistic. \n \n Dr. Carstarphen and the school board continue to work together to create a new culture at APS, that is a caring one of trust and collaboration where every student graduates ready for college and career. Last fall, the district established a new vision of a high-performing school district where students love to learn, educators inspire, families engage and the community trusts the system. The district remains dedicated to always putting the needs of our students first. \n \n Copyright 2015 WGCL-TV (Meredith Corporation).

All face serious jail time of 20 years or more, thanks to their convictions on racketeering charges.

""And under that premise, would President Hillary Clinton never be able to talk law enforcement or corruption investigations again? Would she just abolish the DOJ and FBI?"" \n \n It was Melania Trump\'s first speech since her appearance at the Republican National Convention, where her remarks triggered controversy because one section plagiarized Michelle Obama\'s 2008 Democratic National Committee speech. A speechwriter later apologized. \n \n She cast her husband as someone who\'s in touch with America\'s working class. \n \n ""Every time my husband learned of a factory closing in Ohio or North Carolina or Pennsylvania, I could see him get very upset,"" she said as she made the case that the Republican nominee can fix the nation\'s economic woes. \n \n Trump opened the speech by discussing her youth in Slovenia before immigrating to the United States, saying that ""America meant if you could dream it, you could become it."" \n \n She said she went through a 10-year process of becoming a United States citizen, which she called ""the greatest privilege in the world."" \n \n ""I\'m an immigrant, and no one values the freedoms and opportunities of America more than me,"" she said. \n \n Melania Trump hasn\'t had a very public role on the campaign trail and has made it clear, publicly and privately, that her first priority is raising their 10-year-old son, Barron. \n \n But her speech Thursday was the first of what Donald Trump said in an interview with ABC would be two or three major speeches before the November 8 election. \n \n The speech took place in Berwyn, Pennsylvania -- in the suburbs of Philadelphia -- and was designed to help Trump win over the middle-class women in the region who could tip the balance of Pennsylvania\'s 20 electoral votes for Trump or Clinton. \n \n Conway worked with Melania Trump on the speech and was in attendance Thursday. Conway, Trump advisers said, has built a positive relationship with Melania over the course of the campaign. And Melania has privately been very supportive of Conway\'s role as the head of her husband\'s campaign. \n \n Melania Trump was introduced by Karen Pence, the wife of the Republican nominee\'s running mate Mike Pence. \n \n ""I know that America will fall in love with her just as much as she loves the American people,"" Karen Pence said.']",1,"– When elderly people seem slow or forgetful, it's not because their brains are weaker, but because they have so much knowledge stored up, according to new research.

Dow addresses the lawyers during a hearing on missing funds in the Johnny Bobbitt case in the Olde Historic Courthouse in Mt. Holly, NJ Wednesday, Sept. 5, 2018. McClure and D\'Amico are accused of mismanaging the money raised for Bobbitt. (David Maialetti/The Philadelphia Inquirer via... (Associated Press) \n \n FLORENCE, N.J. (AP) — Police raided the home Thursday of a couple who raised $400,000 online for a homeless good Samaritan who has alleged they treated the money like a ""personal piggy bank"" — hauling away a new BMW on a flatbed truck. \n \n Citing ""enormous public interest"" in the case, county prosecutor Scott Coffina confirmed in a Facebook post that Mark D\'Amico and Katelyn McClure are under investigation, though no charges have been filed. \n \n It was the latest twist in at onetime feel-good story about Johnny Bobbitt, who spent his last $20 to buy gas for McClure when she became stranded on a highway in Philadelphia last year, and the couple who found 14,000 people online who were so touched by his kindness that they donated to a fund to help him start a new life. \n \n Police armed with a search warrant left the couple\'s home in Florence, New Jersey, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) northeast of Philadelphia, with bags and boxes of material and the BMW, according to news outlets at the scene when the raid occurred. Bobbitt has questioned where they got the money for the new car. They have said they used their own money for it. \n \n The couple\'s attorney, Ernest Badway, did not return calls seeking comment on the police investigation. They have previously denied any wrongdoing. \n \n The couple are also being sued by Bobbitt, the homeless man who was to receive the donations, which were made through a GoFundMe page. In the suit, he says they used the account to ""fund a lifestyle they could not otherwise afford."" \n \n In court Wednesday, the couple\'s lawyer said Bobbitt has gotten about $200,000. But Bobbitt\'s lawyer said he had received only about $75,000, which includes the value of a camper and a 1999 Ford Ranger. \n \n A judge presiding over Bobbitt\'s lawsuit ordered the couple to give sworn statements Monday on the status of all the money raised, as well as to turn over documents. Bobbitt, whose attorney says he is entering a drug addiction program, will also be deposed. \n \n Their attorney has indicated the couple will claim their constitutional right not to have to testify. \n \n Outside their home Thursday, a handwritten ""No Trespassing"" sign was posted. \n \n Chris Fallon, Bobbitt\'s attorney, didn\'t return a call seeking comment on the latest development. \n \n The story initially led to appearances for Bobbitt and McClure on national TV programs as well as an interview by the BBC. But a dispute over the money soured the relationship. \n \n D\'Amico has said Bobbitt spent $25,000 in less than two weeks last year on drugs as well as paying for overdue legal bills and sending money to family. \n \n The couple also bought Bobbitt a camper with some of the cash and parked it on land McClure\'s family owns in New Jersey. But Bobbitt became homeless again after D\'Amico told him in June that he had to leave the property. \n \n During a recent appearance on NBC\'s ""Megyn Kelly Today"" show, D\'Amico said there was well over $150,000 left of the donations. \n \n But Bobbitt\'s attorney said earlier this week that he was told all the money is gone. \n \n GoFundMe said it is working with law enforcement to ensure Bobbitt gets all the money he is due. The company said it also gave $20,000 to an account set up by his attorney to help him during the investigation.']",2,"– Al-Qaeda may still view itself as America's No. 1 enemy, but the Pentagon has a different, ego-deflating assessment. The way things are going, the terror group soon won't qualify as an official adversary of the military, the Pentagon's top lawyer said in a speech at London's Oxford University last night, reports the Guardian. Two key points by Jeh Johnson, who, incidentally, is thought to be a top contender for attorney general when Eric Holder steps down in about a year: ""I do believe that on the present course there will come a tipping point, a tipping point at which so many of the leaders and operatives of al-Qaeda and its affiliates have been killed or captured, and the group is no longer able to attempt or launch a strategic attack against the United States, such that al-Qaeda as we know it, the organization that our Congress authorized the military to pursue in 2001, has been effectively destroyed."" ""At that point we must be able to say to ourselves that our efforts should no longer be considered an armed conflict against al-Qaeda and its associated forces, rather a counter-terrorism effort against individuals who are the scattered remains of al-Qaeda … for which the law enforcement and intelligence resources of our government are principally responsible."" The military would play a more limited role, stepping in when necessary. The speech is part of the administration's long-range efforts to clarify its counterterror rules, explains the Wall Street Journal, which susses out a tangible possibility: Remaining detainees at Gitmo are held under the 2001 Authority for the Use of Military Force against al-Qaeda. If that decree is no longer in effect a few years down the road, it presents an avenue for the release of prisoners and closure of the detention facility."
476,"['Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear issued an executive order today that will make it possible for more than 170,000 Kentucky citizens with past criminal convictions to get back their right to vote — an estimated 140,000 are immediately eligible to have their rights restored and another 30,000 will be over time. The announcement is an incredible breakthrough in the movement to end criminal disenfranchisement policies nationwide. \n \n Kentucky was one of only three states — along with Florida and Iowa — to permanently bar citizens with past convictions from voting. But its constitution does grant the governor broad authority to restore voting rights. Today’s action moves the state closer to the mainstream than any Kentucky governor has before. \n \n Beshear’s order makes rights restoration available for citizens who fully complete their sentences and were disenfranchised because of non-violent convictions. Citizens currently serving sentences will get a certificate of rights restoration and a voter registration application in the mail when they complete their sentence and get their discharge papers. Those who already have completed sentences will be able to contact the state to initiate that same process. Before today, all citizens with felony convictions had no hope for rights restoration unless they could personally persuade the governor to restore rights to them individually. And under a previous governor, Kentucky citizens once had to submit an essay with three character references when applying to receive their right to vote back. \n \n The figures used to assess the order’s impact were estimated using data from several sources, including the 2010 U.S. Census, the Sentencing Project’s estimates of disenfranchised populations, and federal Bureau of Justice Statistics data of the proportion of individuals on parole and probation with felony convictions classified as non-violent or otherwise. \n \n A broad coalition — which has worked for years to end lifetime disenfranchisement in Kentucky — praised the governor’s actions as a breakthrough. That effort has included the Brennan Center for Justice and other supporters, including Kentuckians for the Commonwealth, the Catholic Conference of Kentucky, the ACLU of Kentucky, the Kentucky Council of Churches, and the Kentucky State Conference of the NAACP. In 2014, both houses of the state legislature passed legislation that would allow the public to vote on ending lifetime disenfranchisement in Kentucky’s constitution, but they could not agree on a final bill. The legislature has considered similar measures for the past decade. \n \n “Today’s order will offer a second chance to thousands and thousands of Kentucky citizens, some of whom have waited decades for the chance to get their right to vote back,” said Myrna Pérez, director of the Voting Rights & Elections Project at the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law. “Americans from all walks of life know that our criminal justice system is broken. Governor Beshear’s leadership is a move in the right direction.” \n \n “We’re seeing growing national momentum for rights restoration, and Kentucky is the latest place to join in on that trend,” said Brennan Center Counsel Tomas Lopez. “Restoring the right to vote will improve Kentucky’s democracy, strengthen its communities, and increase public safety. We hope the state will build on today’s reforms and make the right to vote accessible to all Kentucky citizens living and working in their communities.” \n \n Kentucky’s policy change builds on recent bipartisan support for rights restoration around the country. Last year, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder called on states to restore voting rights. Supporters from across the political spectrum have introduced bills in Congress, including the Civil Rights Voting Restoration Act of 2015 from U.S. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and the Democracy Restoration Act from U.S. Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.) and U.S. Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.). \n \n Over the past two decades, more than 20 states have improved their criminal disenfranchisement laws to allow more people with past convictions to vote, to vote sooner, or to access that right more easily. Like similar laws elsewhere in the United States, Kentucky’s policy disproportionately impacts racial minorities. It is estimated that 1 in 5 African Americans in Kentucky are disenfranchised, compared to 1 in 13 nationally. After today’s action, only Florida and Iowa permanently disenfranchise all citizens with felony convictions. \n \n Individuals who have already completed their sentences and believe they may be eligible for voting rights restoration under the new policy should visit the Brennan Center’s Kentucky information page, which will be updated with a link to the state government’s rights restoration website. The state website will include details on eligibility and how to initiate the rights restoration process.', 'UPDATED: He was nominated for an Emmy in 1978 for his portrayal of the middle-American paterfamilias. \n \n Ralph Waite, who was beloved to TV viewers as the ultimate father figure, John Walton, on The Waltons, has died. He passed away at midday on Thursday at his home in South Palm Desert, Steve Gordon, the accountant for the Waite family, told The Hollywood Reporter. \n \n He was nominated for an Emmy in 1978 for his portrayal of the middle-American paterfamilias. He starred on The Waltons for nine years and directed 15 episodes. ""Ralph was a good honest actor and a good honest man,"" said actress Michael Learned, who portrayed Waite\'s wife Olivia on The Waltons. ""He was my spiritual husband. We loved each other for over forty years. He died a working actor at the top of his game. He was a loving mentor to many and a role model to an entire generation. I\'m devastated."" \n \n Prior to landing his role on The Waltons, Waite had been in only one other TV show, a Nichols episode. Waite also performed in the vaunted miniseries Roots, for which he received a 1977 Emmy nomination. \n \n PHOTOS: Ralph Waite\'s Career in Pictures \n \n \n \n More recently, he appeared in Days of Our Lives and had a recurring role as Rev. Norman Balthus on HBO\'s Carnivale, a part befitting a man who once served as an ordained minister on Long Island. He also appeared as Jackson Gibbs in NCIS over the course of several seasons and as Hank Booth in Bones. \n \n \n \n Waite was the founder and director of the Los Angeles Actors Theatre, which he established in 1975. To get the company off the ground, Waite allocated $50,000 of his own money to produce and direct revivals of The Hairy Ape and The Kitchen, in which he also performed. \n \n \n \n LAAT won many critical awards, including the Margaret Harford Award given by the Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle for ""its consistently high standards, its commitment to adventurous theater and to community involvement."" \n \n \n \n A former social worker and a recovering alcoholic, Waite channeled that background into a film on the lives of people on L.A.\'s skid row, On the Nickel, which he produced, directed, wrote and starred in. Under his own production banner, Ralph Waite Productions, he starred as a criminal lawyer in the 1983 TV series The Mississippi. TV movies credits include the titular role in The Secret Life of John Chapman, OHMS, Angel City and The Gentleman Bandit. \n \n \n \n Politically active, he twice ran unsuccessfully for a congressional seat, including a run for the seat left vacant by the late Sonny Bono in 1998. \n \n \n \n Ralph Waite was born June 22, 1928, in White Plains, N.Y., and graduated from Bucknell University. He later studied for three years at Yale and earned a Bachelor of Divinity degree. At that juncture, he went on to have stints as a social worker for the Westchester County Department of Welfare, as well as publicity director and associate editor at Harper & Row. He was a minister at the United Church of Christ in Garden City, Long Island. \n \n \n \n ""He was a top-notch minister and a dynamic actor in the pulpit even then,"" former parishioner and actor Bill Hayes told TV Guide in 1975. ""But I don\'t think Ralph ever enjoyed being asked to conform to the mold or the stereotype expected of most clergymen. He was disturbed by people telling him to straighten his tie or shine his shoes or fix the hole in his sock. He was a very individualistic guy who wanted to be himself."" \n \n STORY: Hollywood Remembers Ralph Waite \n \n \n \n It was during his ministerial tenure that Waite traveled to his own Damascus, a night he spent with Hayes at an acting class. At age 32, Waite left the ministry to pursue acting. \n \n \n \n His conversion from the church to the stage was immediately successful. In 1960, Waite got his first stage role in a Broadway production of Blues for Mister Charlie. In his first eight years of acting, he landed appearances in eight Broadway plays, including Hogan\'s Goat, Watering Place and The Trial of Lee Harvey Oswald. He also performed Blues for Mister Charlie in London. \n \n \n \n As his stage career gathered steam, Waite also garnered small roles in top films: Cool Hand Luke and Five Easy Pieces. In 1969, he featured in coming-of-age saga Last Summer, which starred an up-and-coming Richard Thomas. \n \n \n \n His other films include Lawman, The Grissom Gang, Dime Box and Sporting Club. \n \n \n \n He had two daughters, Kathleen and Suzanne.

As one of his last moves in office, outgoing Kentucky Gov. Steven Beshear signed an executive order Tuesday that grants voting rights to nonviolent felons who've finished their sentences, the New York Times reports. ""Once an individual has served his or her time and paid all restitution, society expects them to reintegrate into their communities and become law-abiding and productive citizens,"" the Democrat said at a news conference. ""A key part of that transition is the right to vote."" The Brennan Center estimates the number of immediately eligible felons at 140,000 (the Sentencing Project puts that figure closer to 100,000), with another 30,000 to come. Still not permitted to vote: felons with new pending charges, as well as those with sex crimes, violent crimes, bribery, or treason to their names. One of the main reasons for the drive to restore felon voting rights is to address the racial disparity present in such a ban. The Sentencing Project estimates one in 13 black men nationwide can't vote because of their felon status, the highest rate of any demographic, per the Times. The paper notes that Gov.-elect Matt Bevin has the legal right to swoop in and change or dump the executive order, but one of his reps tells the paper that Bevin ""has said many times that the restoration of voting rights for certain offenders is the right thing to do"" and that he'll check out the order over the next few weeks to make his final assessment."
477,"['Simon Bramhall pleads guilty to two counts of assault after using argon gas to sign ‘SB’ on patients’ organs \n \n A surgeon has pleaded guilty to marking his initials on the livers of two patients while performing transplant surgery. \n \n In a hearing at Birmingham crown court on Wednesday, Simon Bramhall admitted two counts of assault by beating relating to incidents on 9 February and 21 August 2013. He pleaded not guilty to the more serious charges of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. \n \n The renowned liver, spleen and pancreas surgeon used an argon beam, used to stop livers bleeding during operations and to highlight an area due to be worked on, to sign his initials into the patients’ organs. The marks left by argon are not thought to impair the organ’s function and usually disappear by themselves. \n \n The 53-year-old was first suspended from his post as a consultant surgeon at Birmingham’s Queen Elizabeth hospital in 2013 after a colleague spotted the initials “SB” on an organ during follow-up surgery on one of Bramhall’s patients. \n \n The following summer, while an internal disciplinary investigation into his conduct was ongoing, Bramhall tendered his resignation. Speaking to the press at the time, he said marking his initials on to his patients’ livers had been a mistake. \n \n “I had a disciplinary meeting on 15 May. I was not dismissed,” he said. “I made the decision on 16 May I would hand in my notice. It is a bit raw and I have to move on.” \n \n Speaking after Bramhall’s suspension, Joyce Robins, of Patient Concern, said: “This is a patient we are talking about, not an autograph book.” \n \n Sitting at the back of the court on Wednesday, Bramhall, wearing a pink shirt and dark suit, spoke to confirm his name and to confirm to the judge that he understood the proceedings. He was granted unconditional bail and will be sentenced on 12 January. \n \n Prosecuting, Tony Badenoch told the court that it was a “highly unusual and complex case, both within the expert medical testimony served by both sides and in law. It is factually, so far as we have been able to establish, without legal precedent in criminal law. \n \n “The pleas of guilty now entered represent an acceptance that that which he did was not just ethically wrong but criminally wrong. They reflect the fact that Dr Bramhall’s initialling on a patient’s liver was not an isolated incident but rather a repeated act on two occasions, requiring some skill and concentration. It was done in the presence of colleagues.” \n \n Badenoch concluded: “It was an intentional application of unlawful force to a patient whilst anaesthetised. His acts in marking the livers of those patients were deliberate and conscious acts … It will be for others to decide whether and to what extent his fitness to practise is impaired.” \n \n Ordering new victim impact statements and a pre-sentencing report, the judge Paul Farrer QC said the case concerned the “damage that was done to the surface of the liver” and not the emotional damage caused to the patients. \n \n Elizabeth Reid, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said Bramhall’s actions were an abuse of the trust placed in him by the patients. \n \n “It was an intentional application of unlawful force to a patient whilst anaesthetised,” she said. “His acts in marking the livers of those patients, in a wholly unnecessary way, were deliberate and conscious acts on his part.” \n \n In February 2017, Bramhall was issued with a formal warning by the General Medical Council, which said his conduct had not met the standards required of a doctor. \n \n “It risks bringing the profession into disrepute and it must not be repeated,” it said at the time. “Whilst this failing in itself is not so serious as to require any restriction on Mr Bramhall’s registration, it is necessary in response to issue this formal warning.” \n \n On Wednesday the GMC said it was standard practice to look into any criminal conviction handed to a doctor. \n \n Bramhall received media attention in 2010 when he successfully performed transplant surgery using a liver that had been salvaged from a plane that crashed in foggy conditions at Birmingham airport. \n \n Following reports of Bramhall’s suspension, his former patient Tracy Scriven told the Birmingham Mail that the surgeon should be immediately reinstated. “Even if he did put his initials on a transplanted liver, is it really that bad? I wouldn’t have cared if he did it to me. The man saved my life,” she said.', 'Eating a Mediterranean diet that is rich in nuts and olive oil may help delay cognitive decline in older adults, according to a new study. \n \n In the study, researchers randomly chose about 300 people to follow a Mediterranean diet for four years, and asked 145 people to eat a low-fat diet for the same period. Following a Mediterranean diet means consuming many vegetables and fruits, and eating some seafood, while eating only a little meat and dairy. \n \n In the study, 155 of the people who were on a Mediterranean diet were asked to include one liter of extra virgin olive oil in their diet per week, and 147 people were asked to supplement their diet with 30 grams per day of a mix of walnuts, hazelnuts and almonds. \n \n After four years, researchers compared the cognitive function of the people in each group. The average age of the people in the study was 67. \n \n It turned out that the groups of people who followed the Mediterranean diet experienced an improvement in cognitive function over four years, whereas it declined in the people eating the low-fat diet. [6 Foods That Are Good For Your Brain] \n \n ""Our results suggest that in an older population, a Mediterranean diet supplemented with olive oil or nuts may counteract age-related cognitive decline,"" the researchers wrote in the study. \n \n Given the lack of effective treatments for people suffering from a decline in cognitive function and dementia, strategies that could delay the onset of these conditions or minimize their effects are needed, they wrote. Although the new results are encouraging, more research is needed to confirm them, the researchers noted. \n \n The researchers also found that the people in the group who followed the Mediterranean diet plus extra nuts experienced significant improvements in memory abilities, compared with those on the low-fat diet. And those who followed the Mediterranean diet with the extra virgin olive oil showed significantly greater improvement in a number of cognitive functions related to working memory, reasoning and attention, compared with the low-fat diet group. \n \n There are a number of mechanisms that may explain the beneficial effect that the Mediterranean diet and the supplementary foods had on cognitive function, the researchers said. For example, it may be that the so-called phenolic compounds, found in both nuts and olive oil, may help counteract the chemical processes in the brain that lead to neurodegeneration. \n \n Dr. Raphael Kellman, an internist in New York City who was not involved in the study, said that the study shows that, when they are consumed, the omega fats in olive oil and nuts play an important role in improving the condition of cell membranes, including those in the brain. \n \n ""When you consume an abundance of these types of oils and fats, then you are improving brain function,"" which could help prevent neurodegenerative disorders, said Kellman, who also wrote the book ""The Microbiome Diet"" (Da Capo Press, 2014). \n \n On the other hand, if a person reduces how much of these types of fats they eat, it may have a negative effect on the brain and overall health, he said. \n \n The study also shows that ""you need fat — but the issue is what type of fat — not all fat was created equal,"" Kellman told Live Science. For example, consuming too much saturated fat could affect cell membranes in a negative way, he said. \n \n ""So it is about balance,"" he said. \n \n The study was published today (May 11) in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine.']",2,"– Targeted by the INS and the FBI after 9/11, one American artist reacted by overwhelming authorities with reams of personal data.

It later fell back slightly. \n \n It came as Moody\'s cut Spain\'s credit rating to one notch above ""junk"". \n \n Italy also saw borrowing costs rise, selling bonds repayable in three years with a yield of 5.3%, up from 3.9%. \n \n At the weekend, Spain agreed a 100bn-euro ($126bn; £81bn) bailout of its banks by fellow eurozone countries. \n \n It was hoped that the bailout would help calm fears in the financial markets about the strength of Spain\'s banks and ease Madrid\'s borrowing costs. \n \n However, Moody\'s said the eurozone plan to help Spain\'s banks would increase the country\'s debt burden. \n \n Moody\'s cut Spain\'s rating from A3 to Baa3 and said it could reduce this further within the next three months. \n \n Crisis jargon buster Use the dropdown for easy-to-understand explanations of key financial terms: AAA-rating AAA-rating The best credit rating that can be given to a borrower\'s debts, indicating that the risk of borrowing defaulting is minuscule. \n \n If Spain is cut to junk, some index-tracking investors would be forced to sell the country\'s bonds. This would add to upward pressure on yields and push Spain\'s financing costs higher, heightening the risk that the country will need a full-blown bailout. \n \n The difference in the rate between Spanish and safe-haven German 10-year bonds widened to a high of 5.44 percentage points. \n \n ""The risk of losing investment grade pressured the differential this morning and left it at historic highs,"" analysts at Spanish brokerage Renta 4 said in a market report. \n \n Meanwhile, Italy sold 3-year bonds by paying an interest rate of 5.3%, sharply up from the 3.91% paid at a similar sale on 14 May. \n \n Concern about Italy\'s debt levels have been growing despite Prime Minister Mario Monti insisting that the banking system and the government ability to repay its debts are secure. \n \n No quick fix \n \n On Wednesday, Moody\'s also cut its credit rating for Cyprus by two notches, from Ba1 to Ba3.

481,"['JUCHITAN, Mexico (Reuters) - At least 61 people died when the most powerful earthquake to hit Mexico in over eight decades tore through buildings and forced mass evacuations in the poor southern states of Oaxaca and Chiapas, triggering alerts as far away as Southeast Asia. \n \n The 8.1 magnitude quake off the southern coast late Thursday was stronger than a devastating 1985 temblor that flattened swathes of Mexico City and killed thousands. \n \n The tremor rattled Mexico City and shook Guatemala and El Salvador, but the Oaxacan town of Juchitan bore the brunt of the disaster, with sections of the town hall, a hotel, a church, a bar and other buildings reduced to rubble. \n \n Dalia Vasquez, a 55-year old cook, said she watched emergency workers haul the bodies of her elderly neighbor and her middle-aged son from their collapsed home. \n \n Her own house was badly damaged. Frightened by the possibility of aftershocks, she planned to sleep with dozens more in the streets and parks. “We have nothing now. We don’t have any savings,” she said. \n \n President Enrique Pena Nieto flew to the battered town to oversee rescue efforts. The town’s mayor, Gloria Sanchez, called it “the most terrible moment” in Juchitan’s history. \n \n Facades of shattered buildings, fallen tiles and broken glass from shop fronts and banks littered the pavements of Juchitan while heavily armed soldiers patrolled and stood guard at areas cordoned off due to the extent of the damage. \n \n Startled residents stepped through the rubble of about 100 wrecked buildings, including houses, a flattened Volkswagen dealership and Juchitan’s shattered town hall. Scores paced the terrain or sat outside warily, mindful of the frequent aftershocks and reliving the night’s terror. \n \n “It was brutal, brutal. It was like a monster, like a train was passing over our roofs,” said Jesus Mendoza, 53, as he milled about in a park across from the damaged town hall. \n \n Alma Rosa, sitting in vigil with a relative by the body of a loved one draped in a red shroud, said: “We went to buy a coffin, but there aren’t any because there are so many bodies.” \n \n All the deaths were in three neighboring states clustered near the epicenter that lay about 70 km (40 miles) off the coast. \n \n At least 45 people died in Oaxaca, many of them in Juchitan, while in Chiapas the count reached 12 and in Tabasco four people lost their lives, according to federal and state officials. \n \n In Chiapas, home to many of Mexico’s indigenous ethnic groups, thousands of people in coastal areas were evacuated as a precaution when the quake sparked tsunami warnings, but only two-foot waves were produced by the quake. \n \n Soldiers work to remove the debris of a house destroyed in an earthquake that struck off the southern coast of Mexico late on Thursday, in Juchitan, Mexico, September 8, 2017.

485,"['VANCOUVER, B.C. (CN) – A business in Vancouver, B.C., has sued its building council for blocking the lease of its restaurant property to “Moby Dick’s” fish-and-chips franchise, because the council says the word “Dick” is offensive. \n \n Plaintiff Mengfa International bought a unit in a commercial building in 2010 and in 2014 leased it to an Asian-fusion restaurant, “The Change,” for five years. The Change fell on hard times, though, and in May 2015, Moby Dick Restaurant, a fish-and-chip franchise, agreed to a lease and purchase arrangement. \n \n The building council wouldn’t allow it. It insisted “that the word ‘Dick’ in Moby Dick was an offensive term,” Mengfa says in its Jan. 9 lawsuit. \n \n The defendant is The Owners of Strata Plan LMS 4025. \n \n A strata corporation in Canada is a legal entity with all the powers of a natural person. It may be created to divide a building or buildings or land into “separate components that are individually owned and common components owned by all of the owners,” according to a British Columbia government website on housing and tenancy. \n \n The owners council also claimed a Moby Dick sign would hurt the value of neighboring properties, and that the restaurant would bring increased litter and violate city laws on odor. \n \n Mengfa finds that hard to believe. \n \n It says that the Moby Dick name and logo are “not offensive to the public, given its literary significance and fame.” \n \n Plus which: “A seafood fish-and-chips restaurant at the commercial property, being itself surrounded by the ocean and harbor, would not devalue the real estate property.” \n \n Mengfa and Moby Dick’s submitted several sign and renovation plans to the council in the summer of 2016, but all were denied. \n \n “It was clear by the end of August 2016 that the Strata intended to refuse any signage proposals belonging to Moby Dick which resembled its traditional trademark and brand,” the complaint states. “Instead, the Strata demanded that Moby Dick adopt a signage that was ‘minimalist’ both in color and design. As such, the Strata wrongfully denied Moby Dick’s use of its logo, brand name, and goodwill recognition at the commercial property.” \n \n Mengfa seeks declaratory judgment and damages for interference with business relations. Its attorney Glen Forrester did not respond to a request for comment. The Strata council’s manager did not return a voicemail message. \n \n Herman Melville didn’t have much better luck with “Moby Dick,” though it became many critics’ choice for the mythical Great American Novel. Published in 1851 as “Moby Dick, or the Whale,” only about 3,200 copies were sold during Melville’s lifetime, and in his old age its publisher dumped the unsold copies on him, which he had to buy, under terms of the contract. \n \n The story, of course, tells the tale of Captain Ahab, obsessed with finding and killing a great white whale which cost him half a leg. The book ends with its narrator (“Call me Ishmael”) floating on a coffin in the ocean after Moby Dick smashes the whaling ship and kills everyone else in it. \n \n Like this: Like Loading...', 'A Vancouver business is suing its strata corporation for refusing to allow the opening of a Moby Dick fish and chips franchise location, due in part to an ""offensive"" word in the restaurant\'s name. \n \n According to a lawsuit filed in B.C. Supreme Court, L&H Trading Corp. leased a commercial property on Denman Street in Vancouver\'s Coal Harbour, where it previously operated The Change, an Asian fusion restaurant. \n \n L&H hit hard financial times in early 2016, so, in May, it sold its restaurant business to Moby Dick, a fish and chips restaurant in White Rock named for the famous novel by Herman Melville about a giant white whale. \n \n But just before Moby Dick was to take over the property, court documents allege the building\'s strata council refused to allow the restaurant to open for a number of reasons — one of which was the restaurant name contained the word ""dick,"" an ""offensive term."" \n \n Restaurant would \'harm\' building image \n \n According to the lawsuit, the strata felt the restaurant would ""harm the image"" of the building and would decrease property values. \n \n Moby Dick had been looking to open a new location in a building formerly occupied by The Change, an Asian fusion restaurant in Vancouver\'s Coal Harbour that closed in early 2016. (The Change/Goole Maps) \n \n The strata was also allegedly concerned about increased litter and odours associated with a fish-and-chips restaurant. \n \n L&H alleges in the suit that Moby Dick proposed numerous sign changes and renovations, but that the strata council turned down anything resembling the restaurant\'s original logo, insisting on something ""\'minimalist\' both in colour and design."" \n \n The plaintiffs say the ongoing back-and-forth with the strata resulted in unnecessary delays that lost them potential rental income, and that the strata council violated its own bylaws in refusing the restaurant. \n \n In the lawsuit, L&H asks the court to resolve the dispute and also asks to be compensated for the lost income. \n \n None of the claims have been proven in court. \n \n Yuriy Makogonsky, owner of Moby Dick, declined to comment while the matter is before the courts but said the Coal Harbour location would have been the first in a series of planned franchise locations for the White Rock restaurant. \n \n The strata corporation also declined to comment. Its statement of defence has not yet been filed.']",2,"– Maybe if they had just called it Ishmael, none of this would have happened. A British Columbia company has filed a lawsuit against a building council that refuses to let it lease a unit it owns to a Moby Dick Restaurant fish-and-chips franchise in part because the second word in the eatery's name was deemed ""offensive,"" Courthouse News reports. The plaintiff, Mengfa International, has owned the unit since 2010, and it had initially leased the space to an Asian-fusion restaurant. But after that restaurant started having money troubles, Moby Dick Restaurant came onto the scene in May and agreed to a lease-and-purchase arrangement that would seemingly solve everyone's problems. However, that arrangement was rejected by the building in July. It said the ""word ‘Dick’ in Moby Dick was an offensive term,” per the lawsuit. The building council alleges that signs and other markers with the name and logo would sully the brands of other properties in the building and lower property values. The council also worried about litter and restaurant odors. The lawsuit, however, scoffs at claims that the name would somehow cause nearby property values to plummet, noting that it's a seafood restaurant in a waterfront community—right up the name's alley. Mengfa adds it would do its part to keep litter under control and points out it would be using the same kitchen ventilation system as the previous restaurant. As for the name fracas overall: ""Moby Dick"" is ""not offensive to the public, given its literary significance and fame,"" the suit says. The building council has not filed its defense statement, notes the CBC. (An odd question about Moby Dick answered.)"

White House press secretary Sarah Sanders tweeted the video, per the AP, which shows Acosta asking President Donald Trump a question on Wednesday as the intern tries to take his microphone away. But a frame-by-frame comparison with an Associated Press video of the same incident shows that the one tweeted by Sanders appears to have been altered to speed up Acosta's arm movement as he touches the intern's arm, according to Abba Shapiro, an independent video producer who examined the footage at AP's request. Earlier, Shapiro noticed that frames in the tweeted video were frozen to slow down the action, allowing it to run the same length as the AP one. The alteration is ""too precise to be an accident,"" said Shapiro. The tweeted video also does not have any audio, which Shapiro said would make it easier to alter. Sanders, who hasn't said where the tweeted video came from, noted that it clearly shows Acosta made contact with the intern. CNN has labeled Sanders' characterization of Acosta's exchange with the intern as a lie. Its position has been supported by witnesses including Reuters White House correspondent Jeff Mason, who was next to Acosta during the news.

The current airline executive, a 57-year-old man surnamed Yeo, faces charges of pressuring airline employees to cover up the incident, according to an official at the prosecutors’ office. \n \n Cho, the daughter of the Korean Air chairman, earlier this month resigned as vice-president at the airline and from all roles from the airline’s affiliates as public outrage mounted over her behaviour. On 5 December she forced a plane bound for South Korea from the US to return to a gate and forced off a flight attendant because the nuts were served in a bag and not on a plate. \n \n Prosecutors launched an investigation over the incident after a civic group filed a complaint against Cho. Last week, the transport ministry also reported Cho to prosecutors and said it would sanction Korean Air Lines for pressuring employees to lie during a government inquiry. \n \n Chang Man-yong, a transport ministry official, said the ministry had asked prosecutors to investigate an official suspected of leaking secrets about the ministry’s inquiry into Yeo, the 57-year-old Korean Air executive. The government official, surnamed Kim, worked at Korean Air for 15 years before getting a job at the transport ministry. \n \n When as part of the ministry investigation Kim questioned the crew member who had to leave the plane, Yeo, the executive facing the charge of trying to cover up the incident, sat next to the crew member, Chang said.

Kennedy airport in New York, and airlines officials may have tried to cover up the incident. \n \n Public outrage grew when Korean Air initially issued what many in the country took to be a half-hearted apology that instead appeared to rationalize Cho\'s conduct in the face of what it said was inadequate performance by the cabin crew. \n \n Cho resigned from all her posts at the airline and subsidiaries and apologized after she came under intense public outrage and ridicule. The airline\'s chairman Cho Yang-ho subsequently apologized and said her daughter\'s conduct was ""foolish"". \n \n The plane pushed away from the airport departure gate as the incident was taking place on board. The pilot then brought the plane back to the gate to expel the cabin crew chief, after Cho complained about being served macadamia nuts by a flight attendant in a bag and not on a dish. \n \n The crew chief said in a local television interview that Cho swore at him and jabbed his hand with a document folder, pointing her finger at him while he kneeled to apologize to her. \n \n The prosecutors are also investigating whether Cho physically assaulted any of the crew members. \n \n (Writing by Jack Kim; Editing by Jeremy Laurence)', '[Photo: Le Figaro] \n \n The latest effort by McDonald\'s to adapt to the local culture: adding the iconic baguette to its menus in France.

""NATO is not a threat to anyone ... it is a defensive alliance, it is simply meant to provide security,"" Kerry told a news conference. ""It is not focused on Russia or anyone else."" \n \n NATO diplomats said the decision sends a message to Moscow that it does not have a veto on the alliance\'s eastwards expansion, even if Georgia\'s membership bid has been complicated by its 2008 war with Russia. \n \n Moscow opposes any NATO extension to former communist areas of eastern and southeastern Europe, part of an east-west struggle for influence over former Soviet satellites that is at the center of the crisis in Ukraine. \n \n Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in September that any expansion of NATO was ""a mistake, even a provocation"". In comments to Russian media then, he said NATO\'s so-called open door policy was ""an irresponsible policy that undermines the determination to build a system of equal and shared security in Europe."" \n \n RIA news agency cited a Russian senator as saying on Wednesday that Russia will end joint projects with Montenegro if the ex-Communist country joins the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. The Adriatic state of 650,000 people is expected to become a member formally next year. \n \n Viktor Ozerov, head of the Russian Federation Council\'s defense and safety committee, said the projects which could be axed included those in military areas, RIA reported. \n \n NATO foreign ministers broke off practical cooperation with Russia in April last year after Moscow annexed Ukraine\'s Crimea peninsula and sparked the conflict in eastern Ukraine that has killed more than 8,000 people. They can still talk to Russia through political and military channels, however. \n \n Still, NATO allies are divided over what message to send to Georgia over its long-delayed membership bid, with some European capitals arguing the alliance would be unable to defend the ex-Soviet state in the event of a conflict with Russia. \n \n \'BLATANT\' CONTRADICTION \n \n Those difficulties were underlined by a foreign ministers\' joint statement that provided little momentum in Georgia\'s membership talks. \n \n Ministers repeated their long-held position that Tbilisi must continue to prepare for membership one day, calling for Russia\'s military to withdraw from Georgia\'s breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. \n \n Russia\'s continued presence there and agreements signed between Russia and the two regions ""blatantly contradict the principles of international law,"" the statement said. \n \n NATO\'s founding treaty deems an attack against one ally an attack against all, giving any member a guarantee of protection. But Georgia, which is a partner but not an ally, does not qualify for any such protection. \n \n NATO membership is also dependent on a country settling any outstanding territorial disputes - another big hurdle for Georgia. \n \n After Albania and Croatia joined NATO in 2009, only Serbia, Russia\'s closest ally in the Balkans, is the only Balkan country not actively pursuing membership of the alliance. Foreign ministers signaled support for Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, but neither are expected to join soon. \n \n Even though Montenegro has now been invited, it could take months for it formally to join. But Stoltenberg said he expected accession talks to go quickly, suggesting that the small Balkan state might become a member at the next summit of NATO leaders in July in Warsaw. \n \n (Additional reporting by Arshad Mohammed; Editing by Richard Balmforth)', 'Image caption It is Nato\'s first expansion into eastern Europe since Albania and Croatia joined in 2009 \n \n Nato has invited Montenegro to join the US-led military alliance, in its first expansion for six years. \n \n The decision, described by Nato head Jens Stoltenberg as ""historic"", comes 16 years after the alliance bombed Montenegro during the Kosovo war, when it was still part of Yugoslavia. \n \n Montenegro\'s accession would result in ""retaliatory actions"", said a spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin. \n \n Accession talks are expected to take about a year to complete. \n \n The invitation to Montenegro is Nato\'s first expansion into eastern Europe since Albania and Croatia joined in 2009. \n \n The mountainous Adriatic state of 650,000 people has a small military with about 2,000 active members. \n \n Nato diplomats say it sends a message to Russia that it cannot veto the alliance\'s expansion - but Russia has said it will retaliate. \n \n ""The continued eastward expansion of Nato and Nato\'s military infrastructure cannot but result in retaliatory actions from the east, i.e. from the Russian side, in terms of ensuring security and supporting the parity of interests,"" Mr Putin\'s spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. \n \n Mr Peskov added that it was too early to specify what the retaliatory actions would be. \n \n Analysis - Jonathan Marcus, BBC diplomatic correspondent \n \n Image copyright AP Image caption Nato aircraft bombed Montenegro in 1999 during the Kosovo war \n \n Montenegro is now on its way to becoming Nato\'s 29th member, some 16 years after Nato bombs were dropping on Serbian military targets in the country. \n \n It is an indication of the dramatic changes in the region. Montenegro\'s government believes that its eventual membership will be good news for the western Balkans and will contribute to increasing stability in the region. \n \n Montenegro has tiny armed forces. Its navy largely comprises two ex-Yugoslav frigates. Thus it is unlikely to be a major contributor to Nato\'s collective security. \n \n For Nato it is a further demonstration that the alliance\'s door remains open to new members. The invitation for Montenegro to begin the process of membership has clearly irritated Moscow, which regards Nato expansion as a provocation, while Nato insists that this decision has nothing at all to do with Russia. \n \n Montenegrins themselves remain divided over joining. \n \n Many remain angry that Nato bombed Serbia and Montenegro in 1999 as part of a strategy to halt the killing and expulsion of ethnic Albanians in Serbia\'s then southern province of Kosovo. \n \n The country has also seen an influx of Russian money, homebuyers and tourists since splitting from Serbia in 2006. \n \n The government of Milo Djukanovic - which is in favour of joining - has resisted calls from some opposition parties for a referendum on the issue. \n \n However, Nato diplomats point to polls that suggest public opinion is narrowly in favour of joining. \n \n Besides Montenegro and Georgia, the other current candidates for Nato membership are Bosnia and Herzegovina and Macedonia.', 'U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, center left, speaks with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, center right, during a round table meeting of Resolute Support at NATO headquarters in Brussels on... (Associated Press) \n \n BRUSSELS (AP) — Foreign ministers from NATO countries were expected to invite Montenegro to join the military alliance despite Russia\'s objection to the move, diplomats said, the latest sign of discord between the West and Moscow even as they both battle the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq. \n \n Montenegro\'s accession was one of several topics being discussed at two-day meeting of top diplomats from the alliance that began Tuesday. Other issues include the funding for NATO\'s longstanding mission in Afghanistan, improving Turkish defenses, and injecting ""predictability"" in relations with an increasingly assertive Russia in places like Ukraine and Syria in recent months, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said. \n \n ""The security environment in which we meet today is dark: Terrorist attacks, violent instability (and) the breach of international rules. These are serious challenges from many different directions, and NATO is responding,"" Stoltenberg said. He pointed to violent extremism in the ""South"" — a NATO buzzword for the Middle East and North Africa — and said recent extremist attacks show a ""qualitatively new challenge."" \n \n The decision on a formal invitation to Montenegro — part of the alliance\'s longstanding ""open-door"" policy for potential new members — comes Wednesday, Stoltenberg said, but two NATO diplomats said it\'s a done deal. Russia has warned Montenegro that its joining NATO would be regarded as a provocation. The diplomats requested anonymity to speak about a pending decision. \n \n On Monday, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Elizabeth Trudeau said Washington supports an invitation to Montenegro. \n \n ""We believe Montenegro\'s membership in NATO will contribute to Balkan and European security,"" she said. \n \n Accession by Montenegro is on track to take place at the alliance\'s summit in Warsaw next year, about seven years after NATO last expanded by taking in Albania and Croatia — a year after they too were invited. \n \n Last week, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said at a briefing that a decision by NATO to start negotiations with Montenegro on its accession to the alliance would be ""yet another serious blow"" to the existing security system. She said such a move would be ""confrontational"" and ""could lead to further complication of the already difficult relations between Russia and NATO."" \n \n Sergei Zheleznyak, a prominent member of Russia\'s parliament, on Monday said Russia would have to reassess its relations with Montenegro if it joined NATO without holding a referendum. \n \n ""We would have to change our policy in regard to this friendly country,"" he said. ""If NATO military infrastructure were placed there, we would have to respond by limiting our contacts in economic and other spheres."" \n \n Russia began airstrikes in Syria on Sept. 30 that it says are focused on fighters from IS, which a U.S.-led coalition has been hitting with airstrikes in parts of Syria and Iraq that the group controls. Some observers say Russia is targeting other rebel groups to bolster the forces of Syrian President Bashar Assad, a key ally of Moscow. \n \n Douglas Lute, the U.S. ambassador to NATO, said Monday: ""I understand Russia\'s perspective on this,"" but insisted the accession of Montenegro is ""not designed in any way as a message to Russia."" Lute also noted that public opinion in Montenegro, which many Russians visit as tourists and some have bought property and businesses, has not been fully supportive of its entry into the alliance. \n \n Montenegro is one of four countries now being considered for NATO inclusion, along with fellow one-time members of Yugoslavia, Macedonia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, plus Georgia — a former Soviet republic and Russia neighbor whose candidacy is widely seen as far more problematic. \n \n ""We believe that Georgia\'s relationship with the alliance contains all the practical tools that will prepare it for eventual membership,"" Trudeau said. \n \n ___ \n \n Lynn Berry contributed from Moscow.']",3,"– Montenegro is smaller than Connecticut and it has far fewer people, but the former Yugoslav republic is now punching well above its weight in international relations. Despite Russia's objections, NATO invited the country to join the alliance on Wednesday, marking its first expansion since Albania and Croatia joined in 2009, reports Reuters. NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg—who declared ""the beginning of a very beautiful alliance"" during a meeting at alliance headquarters in Brussels—insists that the move was made without Russia in mind, Reuters notes, though the BBC reports that NATO diplomats say it's a message to Moscow that it cannot impede the alliance's expansion. Reuters describes Russia's position as such: ""Moscow opposes any NATO extension to former communist areas of eastern and southeastern Europe, part of an east-west struggle for influence over former Soviet satellites that is at the center of the crisis in Ukraine."" The BBC notes that with a military of around 2,000 people out of a population of 650,000 and a navy that ""largely comprises two ex-Yugoslav frigates,"" Montenegro will not be a major military contributor to NATO as its 29th member. Russia has described NATO negotiations with Montenegro as ""confrontational"" and ""yet another serious blow"" to the current security situation, reports the AP, which notes that Macedonia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and—most alarmingly for Russia—Georgia are also on course to join NATO."

491,"['Darren Aronofsky\'s Noah is the Old Testament on acid. It\'s the movie equivalent of Christian death metal. It\'s an antediluvian Lord of the Rings, fist-pumping, ferocious, apocalyptic, and wet - very wet. \n \n With a brooding, burly Russell Crowe in the title role, Noah begins like some hallucinogenic, parallel-universe version of the History Channel\'s Bible series. It\'s the Book of Genesis\' ""In the beginning . . . "" all montaged up with places to go: nothingness, somethingness, Adam, Eve, the apple, the snake, whoosh, whoosh, all to a thunderous clang of BIG MUSIC. \n \n Then, on to the matters at hand. Noah, of the house of Seth, wanders the desert with his wife Naameh - Crowe\'s A Beautiful Mind costar, Jennifer Connelly, again worrying that her husband may be totally batty. Noah and Naameh have two sons, Shem (Douglas Booth) and Ham (Logan Lerman). They\'re like some freegan clan, long-haired, dust-caked, scrounging the land. \n \n But all is not right with the world. The descendants of Cain are a most uncivil civilization - debauched, plundering, polluting, impervious to good grooming. In a series of trippy dreams, Noah gets the message that God has decided to rid Earth of humankind, ""all life blotted out because of what man has done."" It is up to Noah to build an ark and save the birds and beasts from the mighty deluge. \n \n Oh, and to help Noah and his team erect their giant cargo container (that\'s what the ark looks like, football-field-long and coffin-shaped), there are the Watchers - the guardian angels from the Apocrypha, here like something out of the Marvel Comics Universe: towering, six-armed rock creatures, eyes burning with coal fire, voices rumbling like Nick Nolte after a case of whiskey and a carton of cigarettes. (Nolte supplies the line-readings, gravelly and bellowing, for Samyaza, the chief Watcher.) \n \n After a wary get-to-know-you session in a deep ravine, the Watchers align themselves with Noah and his family, assisting in their ambitious project, and joining them in battle when the armies of Tubal-cain (a hairy Ray Winstone) lay siege. Tubal-cain isn\'t happy that he and his gang are to be washed away, forever. \n \n How all of this will play with by-the-Book Christian moviegoers is a question of great interest, and one that distributor Paramount has tiptoed around, marketing its biblical action pic as ""inspired by the epic story of hope, courage, and survival."" You could also attach that tagline to Captain Phillips or Divergent - or Mr. Peabody & Sherman, even. \n \n Aronofsky\'s films have centered on lone, somewhat lunatic figures: the nutty numbers theorist of Pi; the Coney Island addicts of Requiem for a Dream; the dimension-hopping M.D. of The Fountain; the comeback sad-sack of The Wrestler; and the psychologically damaged ballerina of Black Swan. \n \n Noah is alone, and arguably lunatic, too. Is he heeding God\'s call, even when it means doing something terribly cruel? Or is this man only imagining that God is speaking to him? Are the signs misread, misunderstood? \n \n And what are we to make of this God? Merciful, or merciless? \n \n Crowe, who sports a buzzcut when it\'s time to get down to business, brings his usual brute intensity. Connelly is watchful, worried, and has a couple of defiant-spouse speeches. Emma Watson transitions from Harry Potter\'s Hermione to Shem\'s wife, Ila. And Anthony Hopkins appears now and again to offer a fertile thought or two as Noah\'s grandfather, Methuselah - an old sage who likes to go berry-picking. Fruit, but not forbidden. \n \n With its computer-generated armies, its behemoths and beasts, and its epic meteorological event (and none-too-subtle cautionary climate-change analogy), Noah is not, for even one second, dull.

Running time: 2 hours, 18 minutes. Parent\'s guide: PG-13 (for violence, disturbing images and brief suggestive content).', 'Unlike the thousands of CGI beasts of the land and air who hitch a ride on “Noah,” Darren Aronofsky‘s highly-anticipated epic is neither fish nor fowl; in no way is it a straightforward Bible tale (and given the brevity of Genesis’ account of the flood, such a thing would be next to impossible) nor is it the sort of unfettered freak-out that fans of “Black Swan,” “Pi” or “The Fountain” would expect from its director and co-writer (with Ari Handel). \n \n “Noah” has its share of interesting ideas, from rock-covered fallen angels to Noah’s idea that he and his family should be the last human beings on earth, per his interpretation of what “the creator” tells him, but the film winds up feeling like a bit of a soggy slog, both overblown and underwritten. \n \n See video: Emma Watson Introduces New ‘Noah’ Trailer, Full of Epic Apocalyptic Destruction (Video) \n \n The tricky thing about adapting Bible stories into drama is that the characters tend to have only one or two dominant traits rather than emerging as richly complicated people. In the case of “Noah,” we not only have to allow for quite literal deus ex machina — a lot of story elements can only be swallowed with a healthy dose of “because God willed it, that’s why” — but we’re also forced to deal with the practical implications of a story that ends up with a handful of people being left to repopulate the planet, most of whom are already related by blood. \n \n As “Noah” tells it, the world was divided after Adam and Eve’s expulsion from the Garden of Eden and Cain’s murder of Abel — the line of Cain built decadent cities and exploited the resources, and the line of Seth lived in peace and harmony. As such, Cain’s heirs pretty much wiped out Seth’s, until the only one left among the latter is young Noah, who witnesses the murder of his own father. \n \n Years later, Noah (Russell Crowe) and his wife Naameh (Jennifer Connelly) try to instill his values in their sons. One night, Noah has a vision of a terrible flood; he visits his grandfather Methuselah (Anthony Hopkins), who slips him a mickey via some hallucinogenic tea, leaving Noah convinced that he must build an ark to save the animals of the world while the creator wipes out the wicked with a great flood. \n \n Methuselah gives Noah a seed when, which planted, creates a spring (or fountain, for you future MFA candidates looking for motifs in Aronofsky’s work) that in turn causes a forest to spring up all across the wasteland. With the help of the watchers (the aforementioned angels, who were encrusted with rock and lava when they fell to earth trying to help mankind), Noah builds his watercraft. (Aronofsky apparently follows the specs from Genesis, leading to a rather boxy and unwieldy ship and not the usual curved-bow boat we’ve seen in previous adaptations.) \n \n While oldest son Shem (Douglas Booth) is in love with Ila (Emma Watson) — adopted by Noah as a young girl after he finds her wounded and abandoned — there are no potential wives for middle son Ham (Logan Lerman, Watson’s “Perks of Being a Wallflower” co-star) or young Japheth (Leo McHugh Carroll). Noah goes out amidst the wicked (who have camped out in the area just outside the ark’s construction site) to rustle up some more daughters-in-law, but when he sees Satan with Noah’s face, he thinks this means God intends to wipe out humanity, including Noah’s own bloodline. \n \n Also read: ‘Noah’ VFX Firm Loses a Bundle on Biblical Epic (Exclusive) \n \n This doesn’t go over particularly well with the rest of the family, especially after Methuselah blesses Ila’s previously barren womb. (If you’re prone to inappropriate snickering, bite down hard during this moment.) Once the admittedly impressive flood happens, the third act vacillates between Noah threatening to murder Ila’s child and an embittered Ham hiding the evil Tubal Cain (Ray Winstone), who has stowed away on the ark. \n \n “Noah” has snakes and bears and herbalist anesthesia and rock-angels and rampaging armies and panicky sinners, so why is it such a drag? Clearly Aronofsky isn’t out to make yet another stodgy Bible movie, but it often feels as though he’s reining in his showier artistic impulses lest he offend the faithful. As a result, he’s wound up with a movie that will please neither the “Son of God” crowd nor the people excited about a reunion between the director and leading lady of “Requiem for a Dream.” \n \n Also read: Darren Aronofsky Knew Nothing About Paramount’s Last-Minute ‘Noah’ Changes (Exclusive) \n \n Crowe pretty much plays it straight, maintaining his hoarse intensity even when Noah goes to some dark places in what he thinks is the service of the creator. All the other characters are too easily summed up (e.g. “loyal,” “loving,” “duplicitous”), leaving little room for the actors to flesh them out. \n \n Some might consider the story of Noah to be as much of a bad-luck charm to the movies as “Macbeth” is to the stage; the 1928 “Noah’s Ark,” produced by young Darryl F. Zanuck, infamously led to the drowning of several extras during the big flood scene. No animals or cast members were harmed by “Noah,” true, but this new vessel doesn’t do much for the floating zookeeper’s big-screen reputation.', ""New York (CNN) A fire broke out at Trump Tower on Saturday, leaving one man dead and six firefighters injured, the New York City Fire Department said. \n \n Police identified the man killed as Todd Brassner, 67, a resident of the building's 50th floor. He was taken to the hospital in critical condition but later died, said spokeswoman Angelica Conroy of the Fire Department. \n \n Brassner was unconscious and unresponsive when firefighters pulled him out, the New York Police Department said. The medical examiner's office will determine the cause of death. \n \n The fire was contained to the 50th floor of the tower, located on Fifth Avenue in New York.

But the biblical epic, directed by Darren Aronofsky and starring Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly, is actually getting a lot of praise—even if most of it acknowledges that the movie is nuts. Here's what people are saying: ""Noah is less an epic than a horror movie,"" writes AO Scott at the New York Times. ""The most potent special effects are Mr. Crowe’s eyes."" Crowe's Noah is ""a genocidal lunatic"" who believes he ""has been chosen not to save mankind but to ensure its annihilation."" Yeah, this is a dark, risky film, because Aronofsky ""takes the narrative and its implications seriously,"" imagining ""what it might have felt like to live in a newly created, already-ruined world."" ""First of all, let's acknowledge that Darren Aronofsky's Noah was a bad idea,"" writes Alex O'Hehir at Salon. But ""at least it's a bad idea on a grand scale."" Aronofsky seems to have realized how screwed he was, and gone wild, producing ""a grandiose and baffling journey that's almost worth taking. ... When it connects it's awesome, and when it doesn't it's awesomely silly."" It's ""like some hallucinogenic, parallel-universe version of the History Channel's Bible series,"" writes Stephen Rea at the Philadelphia Inquirer. ""Noah is not, for even one second, dull. Aronofsky's film is crazy, bold, and, yes, biblical,"" though it's unclear ""how all of this will play with by-the-book Christian moviegoers."" But Alonso Duralde at The Wrap thinks Aronofsky has actually reined himself in too much to avoid ruffling the faithful's feathers. ""Noah has snakes and bears and herbalist anesthesia and rock-angels and rampaging armies and panicky sinners, so why is it such a drag?"" he asks. It's ""a movie that will please neither the 'Son of God' crowd nor the people excited about a reunion between the director and leading lady of Requiem for a Dream."""
492,"['A 34-year-old man has filed an $800,000 lawsuit against a Albany construction company, claiming the owner fired him after he refused to attend weekly Bible study. \n \n Ryan Coleman’s lawsuit states that he discovered only after he was hired as a painter for Dahled Up Construction that the job entailed more than just fixing up homes. According to Coleman and his lawsuit, owner Joel Dahl told him all employees were required to partake in regular Bible study sessions led by a Christian pastor during the work day, while on the clock. \n \n Coleman told Dahl that the requirement was illegal, but Dahl wouldn’t budge, according to the lawsuit. In order to keep his job, Coleman obliged for nearly six months but ultimately told Dahl he couldn’t go, the suit says. \n \n “I said ‘I’ve kept an open mind, and it’s just not my thing.’ And he said, ‘Well, I’m going to have to replace you,\'” Coleman told The Oregonian/OregonLive. \n \n “He said ‘You’re not going to tell me how to run my own company,’” Coleman continued. “I said ‘I’m not trying to tell you how to run your own company, but you’re not going to tell me what god to pray to.’” \n \n Coleman said his religious beliefs are indigenous: He’s half Caucasian and half Native American, with Cherokee and Blackfoot heritage. \n \n Coleman worked for the small construction company from October 2017 to this past April, when he was fired, the suit states. \n \n “This is so illegal,” said Corinne Schram, a Portland attorney representing Coleman. “Unless you are a religious organization like a church, you cannot force your employees to participate in religious activities.” \n \n Dahl\'s Albany attorney, Kent Hickam, doesn\'t dispute that Dahl requires all of his employees to attend Bible study, but says it’s legal because Dahl pays them to attend. \n \n “Mr. Dahl feels that it’s unfortunate that he (Coleman) is now trying to exploit Mr. Dahl’s honorable intentions for unjustified financial gain,” Hickman said. \n \n Dahl told The Oregonian/OregonLive that he’d struggled with drugs and alcohol and served time in prison for attempted second-degree assault. He said he’s been clean and sober for seven years. He started his company in 2016, with the idea of helping other convicted felons or people who’ve battled addictions rebuild their lives. \n \n “I’m a second-chance employer,” Dahl said. (Joel Dahl says he’s not related to another second-chance employer, Dave Dahl of Dave’s Killer Bread.) \n \n God is a big part of Joel Dahl’s life. The company\'s Facebook page features photos of recently completed home remodels -- often alongside praise to God or Jesus. \n \n After stripping a 106-year-old home down to the studs and renovating it to look brand new, one post states: “Fixing up this old house at times I was discouraged ‘cause there was so much to fix. But Me and God did this together and we got er done.” \n \n Another post expresses gratitude for the work that has come to Dahled Up Construction: ""Just finished these 2 roofs ... Look at God go. He is so awesome.” \n \n Coleman said he’s served prison time for delivery of methamphetamine and child neglect but has now been clean and sober for nearly four years. Earlier this week, he won back full custody of his two children, he said. \n \n Coleman’s past left him fearful that he wouldn’t be able to find other work, so he said stuck with the weekly, hourlong Bible study sessions for six months, until he took a stance and said he wouldn’t go. \n \n Coleman\'s legal team has started a web page, where it plans to offer updates about the case.

In a lawsuit filed this month, Ryan Coleman, 34, says he didn't find out about the weekly Bible study requirement until after Joel Dahl of Albany-based Dahled Up Construction hired him as a painter in late 2017, OregonLive reports. He says he went along with it for about six months before telling Dahl, ""It's just not my thing."" Dahl's response, per Coleman, ""He said, 'well, I'm going to have to replace you."" That was in April, KEZI reports. Now, Coleman is seeking $800,000—$50,000 in lost earnings and $750,000 for ""severe emotional distress, anguish, humiliation, anger, shame, and anxiety,"" per the lawsuit's ironically titled ""prayer for relief."" Dahl's attorney, accusing Coleman of seeking ""unjustified financial gain,"" concedes that Dahled Up employees are required to go to Bible study. But it's legal, he argues, because they're still on the clock when they attend. Colman's attorney disagrees: ""This is so illegal,"" she says, adding that only religious organizations could have such a requirement. Dahl, who admits to past legal problems, says he's a ""second-chance employer,"" with OregonLive noting that ""God is a big part of Joel Dahl's life."""

It\'s still on the edge of the so-called habitable zone, but the atmosphere is heated in the extreme by greenhouse effects caused by the dense, mostly carbon dioxide atmosphere. The thick clouds also reflect 70 percent of sunlight back into space, making it the brightest object in the sky, other than the moon. \n \n Astronomers figure it wasn\'t always like that, though. While Venus now has very little water in its atmosphere, it could have had oceans as deep as 525 meters (1,700 feet) billions of years ago. The atmosphere was likely far less thick and toxic, too. The Goddard team plugged all of those factors into climate models used for Earth, and they showed that it had a mean surface air temperature of 11 degrees C (52 degrees F), with max temperatures at 95 degrees F. That means that several billion years ago it could have been just as likely to support life as Earth, if not more so. \n \n The surface of Venus in false color (NASA/JPL) \n \n There are a lot of ""ifs,"" though. The simulation depends on the rotational period and topography of Venus being about the same as they are today. Venus currently takes a ridiculous 243 Earth days to spin once on its own axis (longer than its 225-day year), but planets often spin faster when they\'re younger. When the simulation was re-run with a much faster rotational period of 16 Earth days, average temperatures were nearly five times hotter -- 133 degrees F, maxing at an inhospitable 183 degrees F. Changing the landscape to be more Earth-like, meanwhile, yielded temperatures warmer by 18 degrees F, which is also borderline for life. \n \n The new models don\'t prove that Venus was once habitable, but they do show that it could have been. That knowledge may allow astronomers to reconsider exoplanet habitable zones by taking rotation into account. It also provides another theory for how life got on Earth. Scientists already think that meteor impacts spread materials between Mars and our planet, possibly seeding life. If Venus harbored life billions of years ago, it might have done so, too. \n \n The work may also motivate scientists to search for life on Venus as well as Mars. That won\'t be easy, however, because the Venera probes Russia sent didn\'t last more than a couple of hours in the extreme temperatures.', ""Ronald Reagan's Grandson Arrested \n \n Ronald Reagan's Grandson Arrested \n \n 's 31-year-old grandson was arrested at his parent's home this morning in L.A. -- after someone pushed a panic button inside the house.We're told when LAPD officers arrived at the home,-- son of political radio host-- was screaming profanities at the cops.Reagan was ultimately taken into custody at 12:20 AM.

After plugging topographic data and the hydrogen isotope ratio in Venus' atmosphere into climate models, NASA researchers say Earth's closest planet neighbor may have had an average surface temperature of 52 degrees, with a maximum temperature of 95 degrees, and liquid water oceans up to 1,700 feet deep before volcanic activity gave it a facelift 700 million years ago, reports Engadget. In other words, it may have had ""the requirements for the origin of life"" as far back as 3 billion years ago, a researcher tells New Scientist. Of course this scenario depends on certain factors. If the planet spun significantly faster than it does today—spinning once on its axis every 16 Earth days, as opposed to 243—or had topography similar to Earth, it would have been much hotter, reaching a max temperature of 183 degrees, researchers write in Geophysical Research Letters. ""We really need more data before we can say much more … but if you have a Venus-like world around a solar-type star with a slow rotation, it could be quite a reasonable place for life to exist, especially in the oceans,"" says study author Michael Way. ""You get temperatures almost like Earth. That's remarkable."" Researchers hope a probe might eventually find signs of water erosion near Venus' equator, which would back up the model.

496,"[""Rice: White House Summit To Show Africa's Potential To Investors \n \n DAVID GREENE, HOST: \n \n Think of a summit meeting in Washington this week is part of a new scramble for Africa. \n \n STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: \n \n That's a phrase from the colonial area, when European nations scrambled to own most of that continent. \n \n GREENE: This new scramble is different - independent African nations, for all their problems, have growing economies. \n \n INSKEEP: And great powers from around the world are competing for access to African resources and markets. \n \n GREENE: And the United States is hosting African leaders in an effort to get more seriously in that game. \n \n INSKEEP: Now, in our reporting this week, we're hearing the voices of African presidents, African business leaders and right now, a U.S. official who wants U.S. companies to play a bigger role. She is President Obama's national security adviser, Susan Rice. How is it Ambassador Rice, that China and Europe are seen as so far ahead of the United States when it comes to investing in Africa? \n \n SUSAN RICE: Well, Europe of course has the history of its colonial relationship with Africa that has led it to have long-standing economic ties. Chinas are much more recent. China has largely gone in and invested heavily in minerals, oil, other resources. It has also invested in infrastructure. But typically the nature of China's engagement is it brings in thousands of Chinese workers and uses Chinese to build roads, build buildings, rather than giving jobs and opportunity and capacity building for Africans, which is a real distinction between the American approach and the Chinese approach. The American approach is not to bring in a bunch of foreigners to take jobs from Africa, but it's actually to build Africa capacity. \n \n INSKEEP: Well, let me try to clarify that if I can because we're hearing from Tony Elumelu (ph) - he's a Nigerian businessman, very prominent part of this summit and known to you at the White House. And he said for better or worse, we know what China wants. They want resources, they're willing to give infrastructure. He went on to say we don't know what America wants. Why is there such confusion in Africa about what the United States really wants out of this relationship? \n \n RICE: Well, I don't know Steve if there's confusion - what we want is for Africa to thrive, for Africa to create jobs for its own people, for Africa to live in peace and security. Why do we want that? Because it's in the United States interest, and it's in the interest of the wider international community. A strong Africa that can tend to itself is able to deal with the threat of terrorism, the threat of international criminal organizations or infectious disease as we are even seeing today with respect to the Ebola challenge. \n \n INSKEEP: Is part of the problem that you're dealing with individual American investors and individual American companies and they say well, that's a place that has Ebola, that's a place that has terrorism, that's a place that - perhaps most gravely from a business perspective - has corruption, that it's not worth the risk? \n \n RICE: I think that is part of the challenge - that there's a big gap, Steve, in the perception of Africa, particularly the perception of Africa in the United States, and the perception of Africa in other parts of the world. One of the main objectives of this summit is to enable American investors, both those that are from the corporate world and those who might be involved in small and medium size enterprises, to see Africa's potential. Clearly the competitors have figured this out. We're a little bit behind, both in terms of how our business community views Africa, but I think also, Steve, how the American people view Africa. Africa is not a place solely of conflict, poverty and disease - quite the contrary. It's vibrant, it's growing, its increasingly peaceful and democratic. And sure there are huge troubles, including endemic corruption. But what is new and different about Africa, and we're seeing this here in the context of the summit, is that Africans are coming together to fight corruption. \n \n INSKEEP: Ambassador Rice, I want to ask about a country in North Africa, Libya, where, as you know very well, conditions are so chaotic, the U.S. Embassy has had to be moved out of the country. As you look back over the last three years of U.S. involvement in the overthrow and the aftermath of the overthrow of Moammar Gahdafi, has the United States had the right level of engagement to ensure a successful outcome in Libya? \n \n RICE: Well, Steve, before I answer the latter part of your question, let me just clarify something important; the United States hasn't moved its embassy, the United States has temporarily suspended our embassy operations... \n \n INSKEEP: OK. \n \n RICE: ...And taken our staff out. Our staff is now working out of next door line Tunisia. But the problem that is bedeviling Libya is that the militias that were so very involved in the revolution to overthrow Gahdafi have now split amongst themselves. \n \n INSKEEP: Right. \n \n RICE: And are fighting now in the urban areas, including in Tripoli and Benghazi. And it's the fighting between the militias that has necessitated this temporary suspension of our embassy operations... \n \n INSKEEP: Well, that's I wondering about, Ambassador Rice. There's a study in Foreign Affairs magazine in the latest issue of it that looks at more than a century of uprisings - violent and nonviolent. And it seems to - when you look at history - it seems to be fairly predictable that when you have a violent overthrow of a government as in Libya, you're going to have chaos, maybe years of chaos afterward. Wasn't this a predictable crisis? \n \n RICE: Steve, I don't know if you would necessarily say it was predictable. Each of these circumstances are different. What was predictable was that Gahdafi governed for 40 years and never created the institutions of state. There were never functioning ministries, functioning public service - even a credible army because Gahdafi feared having a strong army, which is why it was able to be toppled by militia. So Libya began post-Gahdafi as a shell of a state. But the reality is there was very little there beforehand. And the Libyans have struggled to be able to establish these institutions. \n \n INSKEEP: Having become involved in the overthrow of Gahdafi, should the United States have done more since to ensure a better outcome? \n \n RICE: Well, Steve, certainly the United States feels a commitment of partnership to Libya and we have invested, as I said, quite heavily over the course of the last few years to try to support Libya's transformation. We had, as you're well aware, the tragic loss of our ambassador and three other Americans in Benghazi in 2012. And that certainly necessitated a draw down in that context of our personnel and presence. But there remains a question of creating the institutions of a functioning state. \n \n INSKEEP: Susan Rice is the national security adviser. She's at the White House.

Terrorist networks have expanded their reach in some countries, most notably in Nigeria, where hundreds of schoolgirls remain at large after being kidnapped earlier this year. And while U.S.-backed efforts have helped slow the spread of HIV/AIDS in Africa, countries there rate among the lowest in life expectancy and infant mortality. \n \n ""The importance of this for America needs to be understood,"" President Barack Obama said on Friday about the summit. \n \n JUST WATCHED West African Ebola epidemic Replay More Videos ...

MUST WATCH Obama: U.S. prepared for Ebola 02:11 PLAY VIDEO \n \n He added later that Africa ""happens to be one of the continents where America is most popular and people feel a real affinity for our way of life."" \n \n Here are five reasons that the U.S.-Africa Leader\'s Summit, which kicked off on Monday, is important: \n \n 1. Health scare: The health problems in Africa were underscored this week when an Ebola outbreak prompted leaders of two nations to cancel their trips to Washington. \n \n Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, and Ernest Bai Koroma, the leader of Sierra Leone, both said they would remain in their countries. \n \n Ebola has killed more than 700 people in three nations: Guinea, Liberia and Sierra. \n \n Summit leaders, and even Obama, have stressed there is no risk to Washingtonians from those arriving from Africa this week. \n \n Obama said anyone who might have been exposed to the virus would be screened both in their home countries and upon arrival in the United States. \n \n But worry over the worsening outbreak only highlighted challenges Africa faces in combating disease and poverty, despite the billions in U.S. aid over the years. \n \n ""This is an uphill challenge for them,"" said Gayle Smith, Obama\'s senior director for development and Democracy, noting both Liberia and Sierra Leone had recently emerged from periods of civil war. \n \n Obama hopes to move past the traditional elements of humanitarian aid to Africa, focusing instead on potential trade. \n \n But promoting commercial ties with countries engulfed in Ebola outbreaks could prove to be difficult. The State Department warned against non-essential travel to Sierra Leone and Libera last week, and some schools and businesses have closed. \n \n ""The timing is very unfortunate, and no one would have wished for this,"" said Howard French, an associate professor of international affairs at Columbia University. ""Having high-level discussions between the U.S. and Africa on business and investment are infrequent. So to the extent that this distracts from that I think will be regretted all around."" \n \n 2. Security challenges: Another potential barrier to U.S. investment in Africa: Growing extremism on the continent, which has overwhelmed certain governments. \n \n The most flagrant example came earlier this summer, when the group Boko Haram kidnapped more than 200 school girls in Nigeria. The incident prompted international outrage and so far, a U.S.-backed team has not located them. \n \n Nigeria-based Boko Haram opposes western-style education, and there are fears the group\'s influence could be crossing borders. \n \n Last month, armed gunman suspected to be Boko Haram militants abducted the wife of Cameroon\'s deputy prime minister. \n \n Intra-country sniping has followed. Nigeria has expressed frustration with Cameroon for not doing enough to fight Boko Haram on its side of the border, a charge Cameroon has denied. \n \n The unrest has inflicted damage on African economies, including Nigeria\'s, the largest on the continent. Other African nations combating violent extremism, like Mali, Kenya and Somalia, are also tough sells for U.S. investment. \n \n Many of those nations want more U.S. assistance to counter militants, sentiments likely to be expressed at this week\'s summit. \n \n ""We are concerned about efforts by terrorist groups to gain a foothold in Africa,"" said Ben Rhodes, Obama\'s deputy national security adviser. \n \n He pointed to U.S. counterterror efforts that aim to partner with nations in stemming unrest. \n \n ""We\'re looking at how do we get at the broader issue of countering violent extremism in Africa so that these groups, like Boko Haram, like al-Shabaab, like al-Qaeda, are not able to prey on young people with disinformation and intimidation,"" he said. \n \n 3. Countering China: The United States has some catching up to do in Africa when it comes to trade and investment. \n \n China\'s imports of African oil and natural minerals have skyrocketed over the past two decades. Alongside have come massive Chinese investments in African infrastructure and construction projects, manned by waves of Chinese workers who ended up remaining in Africa. More than a million Chinese citizens now live there. \n \n ""Africa is in a very particular moment, economically speaking,"" said French during an interview with CNNI from Nairobi. ""The continent has been growing very fast. Demographically, there\'s a bulge in terms of it\'s youth population. And Africa needs partnerships."" \n \n Obama wants to make sure the United States is one of those partners, and a more attractive one than China. \n \n ""My advice to African leaders is to make sure that if, in fact, China is putting in roads and bridges, number one, that they\'re hiring African workers; number two, that the roads don\'t just lead from the mine to the port to Shanghai, but that there\'s an ability for the African governments to shape how this infrastructure is going to benefit them in the long term,"" Obama told The Economist last week. \n \n 4. Cementing legacy: Obama\'s two predecessors both secured legacy achievements in Africa -- Bill Clinton through his African Growth and Opportunity Act, and George W. Bush through his program combating HIV/AIDS. \n \n Obama similarly hopes for a way to leave his mark on the continent after he leaves office, though his status as the first president of African descent has already made history. \n \n That fact led some Africans to regard Obama with outsized expectations when he took office in 2009, leading to some disappointment that he hasn\'t focused more on shoring up U.S.-Africa ties. \n \n During his time in office, Obama has focused on terrorism, uprisings in the Arab world, Russian provocations, and the much-awaited pivot to Asia. \n \n Obama made his first presidential trip to sub-Saharan Africa in 2009 when he visited Ghana. He didn\'t return again until 2013 with tour of Senegal, Tanzania and South Africa. \n \n He\'s embarked upon an initiative that aims to bring electricity to more Africans, and a program supporting young leaders working toward Democratic governments. \n \n Both are elements to a legacy designed to shore up conditions for individuals on the continent. \n \n And the summit itself, while not expected to produce any large-scale trade agreements, is meant to signal a shift from purely humanitarian assistance to a two-way partnership. \n \n ""We believe it can be a game-changer in the U.S.-Africa relationship,"" Rhodes said of the summit. \n \n 5. Not invited: While the bulk of Africa\'s leaders will be in Washington, the continent\'s most reviled leaders won\'t be attending.

That way we\'re not singling out individuals at the expense of the other leaders,"" Rhodes said. \n \n He noted Obama would speak with each leader individually during a dinner at the White House on Tuesday. \n \n That event has taken on state dinner-type proportions, with a large tent constructed on the South Lawn. Organizers have the added stress of accommodating leaders of 50 nations, all with varied religious and cultural sensitivities that must be respected. \n \n For example, servers must know who drinks alcohol and who abstains for religious reasons. \n \n It\'s a reflection of just how diverse Africa is, and how high the stakes are for Obama as he forges new relationships there.', 'At the U.S.-Africa Business Forum on Tuesday, President Obama announced that the U.S. plans to expand its business presence in Africa, investing billions into banking, trade, construction and technology. (AP) \n \n At the U.S.-Africa Business Forum on Tuesday, President Obama announced that the U.S. plans to expand its business presence in Africa, investing billions into banking, trade, construction and technology. (AP) \n \n A group of African and U.S. firms on Tuesday will announce an additional $7 billion in spending to promote agricultural development in Africa, nearly doubling an Obama administration initiative aimed at mobilizing private money to ease hunger and poverty on the continent. \n \n The commitments — which are being made as part of this week’s U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit and include a $5 billion pledge by \xadCoca-Cola to source more of its products from Africa by the end of the decade — highlight how U.S. food aid policy has shifted under President Obama. Rather than relying primarily on federal funds to support small farmers overseas, the administration has enlisted African companies and major multinationals to help address some of the development challenges Africans still face. \n \n In an interview, U.S Agency for International Development Administrator Rajiv Shah said the New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition — the private-sector-oriented program Obama launched at Camp David in 2012 — was attracting new investment “because this way is working.” \n \n “We have been able to do some extraordinary things to dramatically reduce hunger through the commercialization of the agriculture sector,” Shah added. \n \n The initiative attracted $3.5 billion when it launched, with the majority of the money coming from large international companies. The new commitments bring it close to $15 billion. Two-thirds of the firms participating are African, and these companies account for roughly half of the program’s pledges. \n \n Tuesday’s financial commitments include an array of initiatives, including plans by Coca-Cola to secure more reliable sources of mango puree in Kenya and Malawi and promote orange and pineapple concentrate production in Nigeria; $5 million from the Global Shea Alliance to provide storage facilities for women in communities that collect and process shea butter for Western food and cosmetic brands; and $1.2 million from Agriaccess Ghana Ltd. in support of training for local sorghum farmers. \n \n Carl LeVan, an African-politics professor at American University and author of the new book “Dictators and Democracy in African Development,” wrote in an e-mail that the administration’s approach to food aid has benefits, as well as potential risks. \n \n “Partnering with the private sector will increase the volume of aid, and it has the potential to improve the impact and efficiency of assistance, especially where corporations like Coca-Cola already have infrastructure and experience in Africa,” LeVan wrote. But he added that “private interests do not always line up with foreign policy objectives,” such as when multinational firms did business with South Africa under apartheid, or when they purchase land in Africa even if it means displacing villagers. \n \n Shah said he is aware of the skepticism some Africans have of corporate investors, noting that each year the U.S. government publishes a report on the deals it helps secure under its food assistance programs. “We have to work hard to build trust and transparency with civil society and small farmers,” he said. \n \n The administration has a separate initiative called Feed the Future, which launched in 2010 and receives about $1.1 billion a year in federal money. Rep. Betty McCollum (D-Minn.) announced Monday that she is working on bipartisan legislation to make the program permanent. It has provided assistance to 7 million small farmers in Africa, Shah said, and ensured that more than 12 million children there are “adequately nourished.” \n \n In many instances, the United States has leveraged its aid dollars to push for new agricultural policies. In Ethi\xado\xadpia, the government liberalized its regulations to allow private players — including DuPont, a participant in the administration’s New Alliance program — to develop and distribute seeds to farmers. Tanzania opted not to impose a ban on agricultural exports after working with U.S. officials. And Ni\xadger\xadian President Goodluck Jonathan said in a statement that his government “ended corruption of four decades in the fertilizer sector” by developing an “electronic wallet system” that allows farmers to get subsidized seeds and fertilizers though coupons they receive on their cellphones. \n \n Vice President Biden emphasized the importance of cracking down on corruption while speaking to African activists and nonprofit organizations Monday at the summit, calling it a “cancer.” \n \n “Widespread corruption is an affront to the dignity of your people and a direct threat to each of your nations,” Biden said. “It stifles economic growth and scares away investment and siphons off resources that should be used to lift people out of poverty.” \n \n Transparency International rates all countries in Africa as moderately to highly afflicted with official corruption. Botswana got the nonprofit organization’s highest rating for the continent last year, with a score of 64 out of a possible 100. Somalia scored the worst among African nations, with eight points. \n \n Humanitarian aid groups have generally praised Obama — who took office shortly after rising food prices led to serious shortages in the developing world — for placing an early emphasis on alleviating hunger. But they have also cautioned against an overreliance on private companies to address the needs of the poor in Africa, as well as some anti-terrorism policies that have constrained humanitarian assistance activities in conflict zones. \n \n Oxfam America policy director Gawain Kripke said the president and his deputies “deserve credit” for making agriculture and food security “a trademark, branded priority for this administration.” But Kripke warned that depending on corporations to provide the financial resources to lift the agricultural sector in Africa does not substitute for government aid, because “a lot of small farmers aren’t commercially viable or aren’t commercially interesting.” \n \n Separately, several aid groups have questioned why the administration had not done more to modify a legal prohibition that bars organizations from conducting any transactions with groups on the federal terrorist list — even if it is minimal contact, such as paying a road toll, to deliver food assistance to civilians. Officials from Somalia — a country that suffered a famine in 2011 and still faces food shortages — said this week they are concerned these prohibitions will again impede assistance efforts there. \n \n “They haven’t made a reasonable attempt to balance the humanitarian need for food assistance with the security needs,” said Kay Guinane, director of the D.C.-based Charity & Security Network. \n \n Anne Gearan contributed to this report.']",3,"– This week, Washington is hosting most of Africa's leaders for the White House's US-Africa Leaders Summit, which aims to forge stronger ties between the US and the continent, CNN reports.

498,"['BRIDGEWATER, N.J. — President Trump is planning to jab, not punch, China for allegedly stealing intellectual property from American businesses, part of an effort to fulfill his hard-edge campaign promises on trade without alienating Beijing during the crisis over North Korea’s nuclear weapons program. \n \n Mr. Trump will return to Washington from his working vacation at his Bedminster, N.J., golf resort on Monday to sign an executive memo asking the United States Trade Representative to determine whether to investigate state-backed theft by China of intellectual property from American technology and defense companies. \n \n The request for an investigation will focus on Beijing’s practices of coercing American companies doing business in China to partner with local firms, which require them to turn over proprietary technological secrets as part of what American officials described as a coordinated effort to steal intellectual property. \n \n Mr. Trump’s trade advisers, speaking to reporters on a conference call early Saturday, did not say why the administration decided to add the intermediate step of requesting an investigation, rather than starting one immediately. This month, people familiar with Mr. Trump’s deliberations suggested that the administration was prepared to immediately begin an inquiry into Chinese theft under the 1974 Trade Act.', 'President Donald Trump on Monday will order his top trade adviser to determine whether to investigate Chinese trade practices that force U.S. firms operating in China to turn over intellectual property, senior administration officials said on Saturday. \n \n The move, which could eventually lead to steep tariffs on Chinese goods, comes at a time when Trump has asked China to do more to crack down on North Korea\'s nuclear missile program as he threatens possible military action against Pyongyang. \n \n Trump has said he would be more amenable to going easy on Beijing if it were more aggressive in reining in North Korea. \n \n An administration official, however, insisted diplomacy over North Korea and the potential trade probe were ""totally unrelated,"" saying the trade action was not a pressure tactic. \n \n ""These are two different things,"" the official said, speaking to reporters on a conference call. \n \n Trump will direct U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to determine if an investigation is warranted of ""any of China\'s laws, policies, practices or actions that may be unreasonable or discriminatory, and that may be harming American intellectual property, innovation and technology,"" the official said. \n \n ""China\'s unfair trade practices and industrial policies, including forced technology transfer and intellectual property theft, harm the U.S. economy and workers,"" a second official said. ""The action being taken on Monday is a reflection of the president\'s firm commitment to addressing this problem in a firm way."" \n \n Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer took issue with that assessment. \n \n ""President Trump\'s pattern continues: Tough talk on China, but weaker action than anyone could ever imagine,"" he said in a statement. ""To make an announcement that they\'re going to decide whether to have an investigation on China\'s well-documented theft of our intellectual property is another signal to China that it is O.K. to keep stealing."" \n \n Any investigation that may be launched could take as long as a year to conclude, a third official said. He said it would be premature to speculate on actions that could eventually be taken against China, and added that the issue could be resolved through ""negotiated agreement."" \n \n Trump, who will interrupt a 17-day working vacation to make a day trip to Washington for the trade announcement, had been expected to seek a so-called Section 301 investigation earlier this month, but an announcement was postponed as the White House pressed for China\'s cooperation on North Korea. \n \n While China joined in a unanimous U.N. Security Council decision to tighten economic sanctions on Pyongyang, Trump has kept up pressure on Beijing to do more. \n \n ""We lose hundreds of billions of dollars a year on trade with China. They know how I feel,"" he told reporters on Thursday. ""If China helps us, I feel a lot different toward trade."" \n \n Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke by telephone on Friday and reiterated their mutual commitment to denuclearize the Korean peninsula, the White House said in a statement. It was unclear whether the issue of trade came up. \n \n Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, a popular trade tool in the 1980s that has been rarely used in the past decade, allows the president to unilaterally impose tariffs or other trade restrictions to protect U.S. industries from ""unfair trade practices"" of foreign countries. \n \n The process can bypass World Trade Organization procedures for adjudicating grievances. Though widely used worldwide, the WTO process is viewed unfavorably by the Trump administration. \n \n ""We\'re at the beginning of this process and no firm decisions have been made as to how that is going to work in terms of whether we would pursue WTO action or action outside the WTO,"" the first administration official said. \n \n In addition to the United States, the European Union, Japan, Germany, and Canada have all expressed concern about Chinese theft of intellectual property. The technology sector has been especially hard-hit in intellectual property disputes.', 'FILE - In this July 8, 2017, file photo, U.S. President Donald Trump, left, and China\'s President Xi Jinping arrive for a meeting on the sidelines of the G-20 Summit in Hamburg, Germany.

(AP) — Even as he seeks Beijing\'s help on North Korea, President Donald Trump is poised to seek a trade investigation of China for the alleged theft of American technology and intellectual property. \n \n Trump is expected to sign an executive order Monday asking his trade office to consider the probe. In the midst of a 17-day vacation, Trump plans to leave his New Jersey golf club and return to Washington to sign the order. \n \n There is no deadline for deciding if any investigation is necessary. Such an investigation easily could last a year. \n \n In a phone call Friday, Trump praised Chinese President Xi Jinping for backing the recent U.N. vote to impose tougher sanctions on North Korea, and the leaders reaffirmed their commitment to a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula. But Trump also told Xi about the move toward a possible inquiry into China\'s trade practices, according to two U.S. officials familiar with that conversation. They were not authorized to publicly discuss the private call and spoke on condition of anonymity. \n \n China announced Monday it will cut off imports of North Korean coal, iron and lead ore and other goods in three weeks under U.N. sanctions imposed against Pyongyang. \n \n Trump wants government officials to look at Chinese practices that force American companies to share their intellectual property in order to gain access to the world\'s second-largest economy. Many U.S. businesses must create joint ventures with Chinese companies and turn over valuable technology assets, a practice that Washington says stifles U.S. economic growth. \n \n Trump\'s action amounts to a request that his trade representative determine whether an investigation is needed under the Trade Act of 1974. If an investigation begins, the U.S. government could seek remedies either through or outside of the World Trade Organization. \n \n While Beijing has promised to open more industries to foreign companies, it also has issued new rules on electric car manufacturing, data security, internet censorship and other fields. \n \n An administration official who confirmed that Trump would sign the order contended it was unrelated to the showdown with North Korea. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the order before Trump\'s formal announcement. \n \n As the crisis involving North Korea has unfolded, Trump has alternated praising China for its help and chiding it for not ratcheting up pressure on its Asian neighbor. \n \n ""I think China can do a lot more,"" Trump told reporters Thursday. ""And I think China will do a lot more."" \n \n China, the isolated North\'s main trading partner, has been reluctant to push leader Kim Jong Un\'s regime too hard for fear it might collapse. But Beijing is increasingly frustrated with Pyongyang and supported a U.N. Security Council ban on Aug. 5 on coal and other key goods. \n \n The Chinese customs agency said Monday that it will stop processing imports of North Korean coal, iron and lead ores and fish at midnight on Sept. 5. \n \n ""After that, entry of these goods will be prohibited,"" said an agency statement. \n \n Trump has escalated his harsh criticism of North Korea for days, tweeting Friday that the U.S. had military options ""locked and loaded."" Xi, in his phone conversation with Trump, urged calm, the officials said. \n \n Trump, in the past, has tied trade policy to national security, leading to speculation that raising the possibility of a probe — without committing to one — could be a negotiating tactic to get China to step up its assistance with North Korea. \n \n The forced sharing of intellectual property with Chinese firms has been a long-standing concern of the U.S. business community, with reports suggesting that losses stemming from it could total hundreds of billions of dollars annually that cost the U.S. economy millions of jobs. \n \n Trump has requested similar inquiries on trade, but the reports haven\'t been delivered on deadline. Trump made addressing the U.S. trade deficit with China a centerpiece of his campaign last year and has suggested raising tariffs on goods from China. \n \n ___ \n \n Boak reported from Baltimore.

From there, he heads to Welfare Square to meet with officials from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and where he’s expected to take a quick tour of the faith’s humanitarian efforts for the needy. \n \n After that, Trump will appear at the Capitol to sign an executive order reportedly removing some 2 million acres from the national monuments created by his Democratic predecessors in southern Utah. Sen. Orrin Hatch and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, who are traveling with the president from Washington, are expected to speak as well. \n \n Trump departs Salt Lake City at 1:35 p.m. \n \n The Capitol event is open only to invited guests, guaranteeing a friendly crowd excited about the reductions in the monument, as well as pre-credentialed m edia. A protest also is planned in the area. \n \n The Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance told supporters in an email and Facebook post that it is planning a protest starting at 10:45 a.m. just across from the Capitol grounds along 300 North, calling Trump’s actions an “egregious assault on America’s public lands” that amounts to “the largest rollback of protected areas in U.S. history. It is also an appalling affront to Native American tribes who sought healing and cross-cultural understanding through protection of their sacred sites and ancestral homelands.” \n \n The group cautioned, “This is a peaceful protest. We do not condone violence or destruction of property.” \n \n Article continues below \n \n Sportsmen for Fish and Wildlife, founded by Don Peay, one of Trump’s biggest Utah backers, took out a full-page ad in Utah’s metro newspapers Sunday to thank Trump for “hearing the voice of the Utah people, and for protecting our lands, wildlife and heritage of our public lands.” \n \n As with any presidential visit, police are likely to shut down freeways and some roads as Trump and his motorcade move about Salt Lake City. The area around Welfare Square, just west of downtown, and the Capitol are likely to be secured as well.']",4,"– US relations with China took a potentially nasty turn on Monday when President Trump ordered a preliminary inquiry into Beijing's trade practices. Even before Trump formally signed a memorandum to put things in motion, China made it clear it was unhappy. The move will hurt the US economy and ""poison"" US-China relations, declared an editorial in the official China Daily newspaper, per Reuters. And a foreign ministry spokeswoman warned of a potential trade war with ""no winner,"" per the AP. The basics: Trump directed his top trade official, US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, to look into whether China is treating US businesses unfairly and infringing on their intellectual property, per CNBC. Lighthizer's task is to figure out whether a larger, formal investigation is warranted. There's no timetable, but it could take him up to a year. Which means: This isn't so much an investigation as it is an investigation into an investigation, and this interim move could give the two sides time to work something out before things get too far along, explains the New York Times. Trump: ""It's a very big move,"" the president said in signing the memorandum. He called it an important step to ""protect the intellectual property of American companies"" and thus American jobs. See the video. One main complaint: China often forces US companies who want to work in the nation to partner with Chinese companies and thus share proprietary tech secrets, per the Times. A member of a bipartisan group called the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission says the White House action is ""long overdue"" because “China’s been engaged in the theft and forced transfer of US technologies and intellectual property for years."" Too soft? China may be ticked, but Trump critics such as Sen. Charles Schumer think the White House is going easy on Beijing. ""To make an announcement that they're going to decide whether to have an investigation on China's well-documented theft of our intellectual property is another signal to China that it is OK to keep stealing."" North Korea: Of course, all this is playing out amid the backdrop of North Korea, with the White House hoping to get China to help rein in the North. There are two schools of thought on that: This inquiry could be leverage to pressure China, notes the Washington Post, or it could backfire and make Beijing more reluctant than ever to help the US. The story notes that the announcement seems to have been delayed to come after the US got China to go along with UN sanctions on Pyongyang. Tit for tat: In the Asia Times, Ken Moak argues that this could end disastrously for both countries. If the US eventually restricts Chinese imports, expect Beijing to penalize US imports, thus hurting American businesses. ""Coupled with insufficient domestic demand, losing the Chinese market could be a replay of a Deep Recession."""

The ""Avril Lavigne"" pizza: At La Pizzeria in the Canadian singer's hometown of Napanee, Ontario, you can order a pepperoni, mushrooms, and green olive pie in honor of Avril, who, for the record, no longer eats those toppings. The ""Joaquin Phoenix"" vegan sandwich: The actor has been a committed vegan since the age of 3, so it's fitting that his sandwich at Two Beards Deli in Grand Rapids, MI contains ""curry tofu salad"" and veggies. The ""Alyssa Milano"" chicken sandwich: At Lioni Italian Heroes in Brooklyn, NY, there are numerous sandwiches on the menu named after celebrities, but the ""Alyssa Milano,"" a chicken cutlet hero with prosciutto, mozzarella, and basil, is a favorite among regulars. As one Yelp reviewer put it: ""Let's describe Alyssa Milano at Lioni's... she's beautiful in person, she has a nice tan, perfect size and packing quality meat.
