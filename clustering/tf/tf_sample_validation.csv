2,"['A CAR park in a Highland town has been confirmed by archaeologists as the meeting place of a medieval Norse parliament. \n \n Excavations at the Cromartie Memorial car park in Dingwall uncovered evidence of a mound that archaeologists believe was established in the 11th century as a gathering spot for a Viking parliament, known as a “Thing”. \n \n Picture: Contributed \n \n When it was constructed the “Thing” would have been on a man-made islet in the estuary of the River Pefferey, historians claimed. They believe the mound was built on the instructions of Thorfinn the Mighty, a powerful Viking earl who died in 1065. \n \n He is thought to have laid the foundations of what would later become the royal burgh of Dingwall in Ross-shire. \n \n It is only the second time a “Thing” site has been uncovered in the UK. Yesterday historians said the discovery would help them learn more about the Norse Vikings, who battled for control of land across the north of Scotland. \n \n David MacDonald, of Dingwall History Society, which was part of the dig partnership, said that a road, a ditch and an aqueduct, known as the Water of Dyke, that drew water from hillside springs, were also constructed when Thorfinn was in control of Ross-shire. \n \n He said Thorfinn’s rise to power was aided by his victory in a battle at Torfnes on the south side of the Cromarty Firth, possibly against MacBeth’s troops. At the height of his power, Thorfinn became Lord of Caithness, Shetland and Orkney. \n \n The origins of the town of Dingwall as a Viking Thing-site had long puzzled historians and archaeologists alike, with many believing it was elsewhere on the Black Isle in Ross-shire. \n \n But now the results of the archaeological dig, the culmination of Highland Council’s participation as a partner in the EU Northern Periphery International Thing Project, has come up with real answers. \n \n Mr MacDonald said: “You can call this the official confirmation of the car park being the location of a ‘Thing’. \n \n “It has been very exciting over the years, but all the historical research points in this direction.” \n \n In recent times historical investigation identified the Cromartie car park – which contains the burial place and memorial monument of George, first earl of Cromartie, who died in 1714 – as the site of the long lost Moothill of Dingwall, the town’s medieval meeting place. This has now been confirmed as deriving from the Viking Thing-mound. \n \n A trial trench excavation in the car park in 2012 showed significant radio-carbon datings. \n \n According to archaeologist Dr Oliver O’Grady, a leading authority on the assembly mounds of Scotland, who was part of the dig : “The excavations have confirmed the presence of important archaeological remains and indicated that the mound was man-made and probably created during the 11th century. \n \n “The radio-carbon datings provide strong scientific evidence to support the interpretation that the mound was created during the period of late Norwegian political influence in Ross-shire and wider North-east Scotland. \n \n “The lack of substantial occupation remains or burial activity is also further circumstantial evidence that the mound was created for an assembly site or Thing. \n \n “The substantial manpower and effort required to create a monument on the scale of the Dingwall mound would also seem in keeping with the establishment of a major regional judicial and administrative centre.” \n \n Dingwall, which lies at the head of the Cromarty Firth, is a location on a European tourist trail of Thing sites. Funded by the EU, the Thing Sites GeoTour involves Scotland, Norway, Iceland, the Faroes and Isle of Man.', 'A parking lot in Scotland was once the site of a Viking parliament, new research suggests \n \n A Viking parliamentary site that dates to the 11th century has been found beneath a parking lot in Scotland. \n \n The site, located in the town of Dingwall, Scotland, was dubbed a ""Thing"" site, referring to its name in antiquity. Like other Thing sites, this one was likely a place where ancient Norsemen gathered to settle legal disputes, uphold laws and make key political decisions. \n \n ""It\'s a fantastic find, really,"" said Oliver J. T. O\'Grady, the director of the site\'s excavations and an archaeologist who runs an archaeological consulting firm called OJT Heritage. ""No one\'s had dating [information] from a Thing site in Scotland."" \n \n The Thing \n \n Historians had long wondered whether Dingwall was a site of a Viking parliamentary gathering known as the Thing because the word Dingwall probably originated from the word thingvellir, which means ""the field of the assembly."" [Fierce Fighters: 7 Secrets of Viking Culture] \n \n Such Thing sites are scattered from Iceland to Norway to the Shetland Islands, and Norsemen traveled from far and wide to get to the seasonal gatherings, often to settle disputes that would otherwise end in bloodshed. But Things were held mostly at open-air fields, and people only stayed temporarily, leaving relatively few archaeological traces of their presence. \n \n ""Many archaeologists have said, \'How do you find the archaeology of a bunch of people gathering together?\'"" O\'Grady told LiveScience. \n \n O\'Grady and his colleagues at The Thing Project, which works on similar sites around Europe, were not deterred, because traces of temporary dwelling booths had turned up at other Thing sites. \n \n Digging up democracy \n \n Using historical records, the team found a mound near the inlet of an estuary in Dingwall that was called the moothill, or assembly mound, in the 13th century. Later on, Scottish earls were buried there. In 1947, local authorities bulldozed the top of the mound and turned the area into a parking lot. (Parking lots seem to be rich sources of history in the U.K. — Richard III\'s skeleton was found underneath a parking lot, as was a medieval knight in Scotland.) \n \n The team dug a small trench across the mound and used radioactive carbon isotopes, or atoms of carbon with different molecular weights, to date the charcoal found in the soil. (These radioactive isotopes decay at different rates and can be used to date soils and objects.) \n \n The team found that some of the upper layers of the soil date to the medieval period, likely when it was called the moothill, and contain shards of pottery and fragments of an iron vessel. \n \n A site in Dingwall, Scotland, revealed traces of a 13th century iron vessel underneath a parking lot. Credit: Dr. Oliver J. T. O\'Grady \n \n But below that, the team found the first layers that were used to construct the mound, with soil dating to around the 11th century. \n \n By this period of history, the Vikings were no longer feared marauders sailing the seas and raiding Europe. Instead, the people who gathered at Dingwall were more likely subjects of Norse kings who ruled from the Orkney and Shetland Islands. \n \n No one knows yet who built the site, though the sheer size of the mound suggests it was a fairly significant undertaking that required a lot of political power and resources. \n \n No historical documents mention a Thing gathering site near the region, but Earl Thorfinn the Mighty came down from the Orkney Islands at the time and fought a battle in the general region. \n \n ""He would certainly have had a political reason to make a statement,"" O\'Grady said. \n \n Follow Tia Ghose on Twitter and Google+.

6,"['Hunger is assumed to motivate eating, which satisfies the caloric needs underlying the motivation. However, hunger’s influence extends beyond food consumption to the acquisition of nonfood items that cannot satisfy the underlying need (e.g., binder clips), suggesting that domain-specific motives can influence behavior in unrelated domains that are irrelevant to the motive. This is likely to occur when the domain-specific response includes concepts and behaviors that can also guide decisions in other domains. \n \n Abstract \n \n Hunger motivates people to consume food, for which finding and acquiring food is a prerequisite. We test whether the acquisition component spills over to nonfood objects: Are hungry people more likely to acquire objects that cannot satisfy their hunger? Five laboratory and field studies show that hunger increases the accessibility of acquisition-related concepts and the intention to acquire not only food but also nonfood objects. Moreover, people act on this intention and acquire more nonfood objects (e.g., binder clips) when they are hungry, both when these items are freely available and when they must be paid for. However, hunger does not influence how much they like nonfood objects. We conclude that a basic biologically based motivation can affect substantively unrelated behaviors that cannot satisfy the motivation. This presumably occurs because hunger renders acquisition-related concepts and behaviors more accessible, which influences decisions in situations to which they can be applied.', 'A wedding crasher ruined a couple’s big day when she hurled a drink at guests and got involved in a bridesmaids brawl, police said. \n \n Shelby McDowell, 20, was arrested Sunday night after she showed up uninvited to spy on a guest she claimed was her boyfriend at a wedding in Palm Coast, Florida, according to news station WKMG. \n \n McDowell claimed, upon arriving at Hammock Beach Resorts, that she saw her boyfriend, Darby Johns, dancing with and kissing a woman on the dance floor. \n \n She then poured a drink on the pair, punched the woman in the face and made a break for the bathroom, according to authorities. \n \n Several bridesmaids, however, decided to take matters into their own hands and dragged McDowell out of the bathroom stall, according to WKMG. \n \n While pulling her out by the feet, the women reportedly began pummeling the wedding crasher. \n \n The resort manager came to break up the fight, but McDowell was on top of her boyfriend’s dancing partner and punching her, authorities said. \n \n Johns told authorities that the unruly wedding crasher was not his girlfriend.

And even when people had to pay (this time for department store items), the hungry ones spent 64% more. ""It's probably better to feed yourself before any type of shopping, whether you're going on an actual shopping trip or shopping online,"" researcher Alison Jing Xu tells Smithsonian. ""And if you're really hungry, you'd better think twice before purchasing any items at all or you might regret those purchases later."" (The study notes that ""hunger does not influence how much they like nonfood objects."") New Scientist reports Xu was inspired by a shopping trip of her own, during which she bought 10 pairs of tights on an empty stomach, ""not just the two I needed."" She says ghrelin, a hormone released by the stomach that makes people seek out food, may also affect other behaviors. (Doctors are puzzled by a boy who's never hungry.)"

8,"['STORRS, Conn. (WTNH) — Eight people have been arrested in Connecticut State Police‘s investigation into the death of UConn student Jeffny Pally. \n \n On October 16, police were called to the UConn Fire Department after a student was hit by a fire truck responding to a call. Jeffny Pally, 19, was sitting on the ground with her back against the outside of the fire station door. When the door went up for officials to respond to the call, Pally fell back and was hit by a UConn Fire vehicle. \n \n State Police say on January 31, they applied for arrest warrants for six students that had hosted an off-campus fraternity party that Pally had attended that night. According to the affidavit, Pally had three times the legal limit in her system. \n \n On Friday, police arrested the following: \n \n Patrick Callahan, 21, Mansfield, CT. Charged with eight counts of permitting a minor to illegally possess alcohol. \n \n Matthew Moll, 21, Mansfield, CT. Charged with eight counts of permitting a minor to illegally possess alcohol. \n \n Austin Custodio, 21, Pine Bush, NY. Charged with sale/delivery to minors. \n \n Dominic Godi, 21, Bolton, CT. Charged with possession of alcohol by a minor. \n \n Dylan Morose, 22, Mansfield, CT. Charged with eight counts of permitting a minor to illegally possess alcohol. \n \n Jonathan Polansky, 22, Beverly, MA. Charged with eight counts permitting a minor to illegally possess alcohol. \n \n The fraternity that the men were members of, Kappa Sigma, has recently lost its recognition on campus for sanctions unrelated to Pally’s death. \n \n All of the men are due in court on March 8. \n \n UConn sent News 8 the following statement: \n \n Jeffny Pally was a talented, ambitious, promising young woman and her death was a terrible tragedy. The entire university community joins her family and friends in continuing to mourn her loss. The University appreciates the thoroughness of the Connecticut State Police investigation. Questions about that criminal investigation and the arrests announced today should be directed to the Connecticut State Police. Federal student privacy law prevents UConn from discussing whether individual students face discipline cases. Generally speaking, any UConn student found to have violated the provisions of The Student Code may face penalties that range from probation to expulsion. The University has the authority to apply the requirements of the Code to students even when their conduct takes place off campus. The fraternity referenced in the arrest warrant affidavit, Kappa Sigma, recently lost its UConn recognition and housing based on off-campus incidents in September and October. Those incidents, which are referenced in the attached sanctions letter, were unrelated to Jeffny’s death. Kappa Sigma’s national office also has revoked the local group’s charter. \n \n The call that the fire department was responding to when Pally was killed turned out to be a false alarm. UConn police says that two students were involved in setting off a fire alarm that night. According to police, 20-year-old Jacob San-Juan and 19-year-old Michael Vaz stole a fire extinguisher from the Gant Science Building and set it off on the fourth floor of Russell Hall, a dormitory within the Northwest Residence Halls. \n \n Vaz and San-Juan are each charged with two counts of fourth-degree criminal mischief and sixth-degree larceny.

The 19-year-old sophomore fell back and was struck by a Chevy Tahoe leaving the firehouse. Why she chose to sit in front of the bay remains unknown, but police say they've pieced together what allegedly happened in the hours beforehand. On the evening of Oct. 15, Pally attended a party at the Kappa Sigma fraternity that revolved around building a homecoming parade float; now six frat members have been charged with alcohol-related offenses related to Pally's death, reports the Hartford Courant. Pally arrived around 10:30pm and stayed about two hours, during which witnesses say she had one to five beers; she reportedly drank prior to the party, and her blood alcohol content was .25. Patrick Callahan, Matthew Moll, Austin Custodio, and Dominic Godi, all 21, and Dylan Morose and Jonathan Polansky, 22, face varied charges tied to allegedly purchasing and transporting the booze and permitting a minor to illegally possess alcohol. Their arraignment is set for March 8. The 60-year-old shift commander who drove the Tahoe told police he did feel a bump as he exited, but assumed what he saw in his rearview mirror was fire equipment. Pally's body was discovered upon the fire crew's return to the station for what WTNH reports was a false alarm sparked after two students allegedly set off a stolen fire extinguisher in a dorm. They face criminal mischief and larceny charges. (Last year, a court ruled that parents could be held responsible for underage drinking.)"
9,"['For Republicans on Capitol Hill, Donald Trump may finally have gone too far. \n \n Tuesday’s report that Trump asked former FBI Director James Comey to end the criminal investigation into ex-national security adviser Michael Flynn was more than just another embarrassing revelation for a president used to a near-daily barrage of scandal and staff intrigue. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n Republicans are privately beginning to worry that they may one day have to sit in judgment of Trump, or that more damaging information from Comey could force the president to step down. Within hours of Tuesday\'s report by The New York Times, there was a distinct shift among congressional Republicans, who until now have mostly resisted criticizing Trump, let alone demanding the president be held to account for all he says or does. \n \n House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) immediately said he’s prepared to subpoena the memos that Comey reportedly wrote contemporaneously to document his interactions with Trump. Chaffetz sent a letter to the FBI on Tuesday night asking for any notes, documents or records of Trump and Comey’s conversations to be turned over to his panel by May 24. \n \n His request was echoed by AshLee Strong, spokeswoman for House Speaker Paul Ryan: ""We need to have all the facts, and it is appropriate for the House Oversight Committee to request this memo."" \n \n Comey has also been invited by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) to testify publicly at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing to “tell his side of the story” about his dealings with Trump, Graham said Tuesday, even before this latest story broke. \n \n More Republicans have openly discussed the possibility of a select committee or the appointment of a special prosecutor to look into the Trump-Russia connection. It\'s still a minority of GOP lawmakers, but Republican leaders are watching closely. \n \n The White House vehemently denied the New York Times report, and Trump has defended his firing of Comey and reported disclosure of classified information to Russian officials. \n \n Not since October’s “Access Hollywood” moment — when many Republicans believed Trump would have to drop out of the race over his hugely offensive comments about women — has the president faced such a serious political threat. Even conservatives from districts that Trump won overwhelmingly in November want to find out what occurred between the president and Comey, no matter how damaging it may be to Trump. This is a dramatic turn for the party that\'s been whiplashed by Trump’s drama since his first day as a candidate in June 2015 yet has still stuck with him. \n \n “It is important to get to the bottom of it,” said Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), chairman of the Freedom Caucus. Meadows was last seen celebrating passage of the House GOP health care bill in the Rose Garden with Trump and dozens of his Republican colleagues. “We\'ve got one standard, and we need to make sure that applies to everybody.” \n \n Top Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway met with the Freedom Caucus on Tuesday night and would not say afterward what they discussed. Meadows insisted the Comey matter did not come up, but he told reporters that he intends, through his role on the Oversight Committee, to help get to the bottom of what happened. And he expects cooperation from the White House. \n \n “If this is legitimately something that there was some kind of influence or pressure from Comey doing his work, I’m going to be very disappointed,"" added Rep. Mark Walker (R-N.C.), chairman of the conservative Republican Study Committee. \n \n In private, top Republicans fear that this latest Trump controversy — coming just a week after he fired Comey, and only one day after it was revealed that the president revealed highly classified intelligence information during a meeting with Russian officials — will overwhelm everything they are trying to do legislatively. Health care, tax reform, building up the Pentagon — all of it is potentially threatened by the latest furor. \n \n And if Republicans are paralyzed and can’t pass anything despite control of the White House and Congress, how can they justify their majorities when they go before voters next year? \n \n Sen. Lindsay Graham listens as Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse holds up a copy of ""The Kremlin Playbook"" at a hearing of the Senate Judicary Committee\'s Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism on Capitol Hill on May 8. | Getty \n \n “I don’t think we can just shrug our shoulders and walk away from this one,” said a top House Republican, who asked not to be named. “I don’t know where this goes.” \n \n What is most worrying for congressional Republicans is how easy this latest episode is to explain to the public — Trump reportedly tried to interfere with a criminal investigation by the FBI but was rebuffed, then fired Comey — and thus fodder for endless cable TV coverage. That could spur moderate Republicans in swing districts, already nervous about 2018, to openly break with Trump. \n \n “If these allegations are true, it’s deeply troubling and it certainly opens up a new chapter that all of us have to consider very carefully,” said Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.) outside the House chamber Tuesday night. ""We need to get to the truth as soon as possible. This weekly scandal, this weekly controversy is unhealthy for the country. It’s a major distraction for the country and it’s just bad for the psyche of every American.” \n \n “I hope Director Comey testifies before Congress as soon as possible,” said Rep.

Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) tweeted late Tuesday night. \n \n Rep. Pat Meehan (R-Pa.), a former federal prosecutor, suggested Trump’s interactions with Comey threatened the public perception of the Justice Department as an autonomous entity. \n \n “This whole process is very difficult because we are seeing the central institution — the Justice Department, and the independence of the Justice Department — stretched. And people want to have confidence in the independence of [DOJ’s] activities,” Meehan said. “I’m hoping that throughout this long process, it can get back into a place where there could be confidence in the ability of the institutions to do their work.” \n \n Kyle Cheney contributed to this report.', 'We don’t actually know if Richard Nixon ordered the break-in to the Democratic National Committee headquarters in the Watergate complex on June 17, 1972. \n \n That, to me, is still the most remarkable feature of the Watergate crisis. A president was forced out of office for the first time in American history by a scandal centering on a single crime, and we still don’t know if he actually ordered it. \n \n In his memoirs, Nixon denies it, though he smugly adds, ""I could not muster much moral outrage over a political bugging."" Jeb Magruder, a dirty tricks operative for Nixon, revealed three decades later that he had overheard Nixon and his reelection chair John Mitchell planning the burglary. But as historian David Greenberg notes, “Mr. Magruder had [previously] discussed that same meeting without noting Nixon\'s participation.” Dirty tricks operatives aren’t the most reliable of sources. \n \n We don’t even know why it happened — if the burglars were looking for evidence that the DNC was receiving money from the North Vietnamese or Cuban governments (as conspirator Howard Hunt insisted), or information embarrassing to White House counsel John Dean (as G. Gordon Liddy, who planned the break-in with Hunt, claimed), or, as another popular theory has it, trying to find out how much DNC chair Larry O\'Brien knew about Nixon’s financial dealings with billionaire tycoon Howard Hughes. \n \n But what we do know, the “smoking gun” that eventually forced Nixon out of office, was that Nixon ordered his chief of staff to get the CIA to force the FBI to abandon its investigation into the break-in. \n \n That was enough. \n \n Some Republicans had stood by Nixon through his firing of the independent counsel investigating the matter, through multiple aides and Cabinet officials resigning, through the White House’s effort to resist subpoenas for documents and tapes. But when the “smoking gun” White House tape was released on August 5, 1974, Nixon’s remaining support from Republicans evaporated. Two days later, Senate Minority Leader Hugh Scott (R-PA), House Minority Leader John Jacob Rhodes (R-AZ), and former presidential candidate Sen. Barry Goldwater (R-AZ) went to the White House and informed the president that he had no support left in Congress. \n \n They were shocked and horrified that Nixon had personally participated in the cover-up; before then there was still a sliver of a chance that the president himself wasn’t part of the conspiracy. They told Nixon that, now that his role in the cover-up was known, the votes were there to impeach him and remove him from office. The day after that, the president announced his resignation. \n \n Similarly, there’s a lot we don’t know about Trump and his campaign’s ties to Russia. We know that the FBI and other agencies have been looking into any contact Trump\'s campaign advisers Paul Manafort, Carter Page, and Roger Stone might have had with the Russian government during the election, as well as into White House senior adviser and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner’s post-election contacts. We know that intelligence agencies suspect those three might have worked the Russian officials to coordinate the release of hacked emails. We know that disgraced former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, Kushner, and Attorney General Jeff Sessions all lied about or failed to disclose communications with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. \n \n We don’t know how all these pieces fit together. We don’t know exactly what Donald Trump Sr.’s direct involvement is, or how aware he was of his advisers’ efforts, or the nature of his business relationship with Russia. That’s provoked a lot of very valuable investigative journalism, as well as a lot of outright conspiracy theorizing. \n \n But focusing too granularly on the details of Trump’s personal involvement risks setting the bar too low for him. It risks suggesting that unless we find undeniable proof of collusion between Trump and the Russian government, he’s in the clear. \n \n The fact of the matter is that without any more information than we already have, we already know Trump’s conduct is at least as outrageous as what Nixon acknowledged in the smoking gun tape. \n \n In Nixon’s case, what crossed the line, moving top leaders from his own party to go to the White House and tell Nixon that his presidency was over, was Nixon’s attempt to hamper the FBI’s investigation into Watergate. \n \n And we now know that before Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, he asked Comey to stop investigating former National Security Adviser Flynn; Comey confirms as much in his testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee, and further indicates that Trump asked him to “lift the cloud” of the Russia investigation more broadly. This is exactly the same kind of FBI investigation interference that forced Nixon out of the White House and shocked his Republican allies out of defending him. \n \n We also know that Trump asked the Director of National Intelligence and the director of the National Security Agency to publicly deny the existence of collusion between his campaign and Russia — an attempt at interference in the intelligence community that calls directly to mind Nixon\'s attempt to use the CIA to scuttle an FBI probe. \n \n This is not a “where there’s smoke there’s fire” situation. We don’t need to know much more to know that the president has committed conduct that was once thought sufficient to warrant removal from office. \n \n The Comey firing isn’t smoke. It’s fire.', '""There is no cover story or obvious response to soft-pedal what Trump meant,"" said one law professor. | AP Photo Trump\'s alleged plea to Comey stirs obstruction talk Many lawyers say impeachment is only viable penalty for a president\'s actions in office. \n \n The revelation that Donald Trump allegedly urged former FBI Director James Comey to drop a probe into former adviser Michael Flynn fueled speculation the president may have obstructed justice, but any penalty would likely come from Congress and not the criminal justice system, lawyers said Tuesday. \n \n ""When someone at the White House is telling someone at DOJ or the FBI to soft-pedal or abandon an investigation, that\'s when people start talking about obstruction,"" said University of Texas law professor Stephen Vladeck. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n While Trump and other officials have offered a panoply of reasons for Comey\'s firing last week, the ongoing FBI probe into Russian influence on the 2016 election was cited as part of the reason for Trump\'s dissatisfaction with the FBI director\'s performance. \n \n The disclosure by the New York Times Tuesday, which was confirmed by POLITICO, that an FBI memo indicated that Trump asked Comey at a February White House meeting if he could let go of the probe into Flynn, a former campaign adviser and national security adviser, only intensified allegations the president was trying to rein in the ongoing inquiries into his associates. \n \n ""There is no cover story or obvious response to soft-pedal what Trump meant,"" Vladeck said. \n \n ""I\'m hard-pressed to think of another time that someone has put his finger on the scale as brazenly as President Trump has. If this were anyone other the president, it is classic, vanilla obstruction,"" said Jeff Cramer, a Chicago-based former federal prosecutor now with Berkeley Research Group. \n \n Trump aides dispute Comey\'s reported account of that conversation. White House officials insisted Tuesday that Trump had made no request to end the investigation. \n \n ""While the president has repeatedly expressed his view that General Flynn is a decent man who served and protected our country, the president has never asked Mr. Comey or anyone else to end any investigation, including any investigation involving General Flynn,” the White House said in a statement. Even if Comey\'s version of events proves accurate, not everyone agrees Trump\'s actions would amount to obstruction. \n \n Regardless, it would likely be up to Congress to act. While other officials alleged to have sought to stymie investigations would have to worry about criminal charges, there\'s broad consensus a president can\'t be charged criminally while he\'s in office. \n \n ""It\'s the longstanding position of the executive branch that the president cannot be indicted while in office,"" said Harvard law professor Jack Goldsmith, a top Justice Department official under President George W. Bush. ""The remedy for a criminal violation would be impeachment."" \n \n As the Monica Lewinsky controversy swirled around former President Bill Clinton, a Senate panel held a hearing on whether the president could be indicted. Most in Congress, including many Republicans, seemed to hold the view that the Constitution sets up impeachment as the mechanism for punishing presidential misconduct. \n \n When Independent Counsel Ken Starr believed he had ""substantial and credible"" evidence against Clinton, Starr did not seek an indictment but delivered reams of material to the House of Representatives instead. One of the articles of impeachment on which the House voted against Clinton was for obstruction of justice. The Senate acquitted Clinton on all the charges. \n \n Breaking News Alerts Get breaking news when it happens — in your inbox.

Some argued that his broad constitutional authority to direct the executive branch provides a defense against such charges. They also saw ambiguities in Trump\'s reported language. \n \n ""If it was a polite request saying, \'Oh, you know, he\'s a good guy, Flynn, I wish you\'d back off this thing,\' that\'s not an obstruction of justice,"" Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz said on MSNBC Tuesday. ""If it was a command, it would raise stronger problems...I just think it\'s a very, very high bar to get over obstruction of justice for a president who, in fact, is the head of the unitary executive branch that includes the FBI and the Justice Department."" \n \n Another prominent defense attorney who advised a client facing obstruction of justice allegations said the evidence to make such a case against Trump was still lacking. \n \n ""Did Trump talk like this because he was actually trying to pressure Comey or was he just blowing off steam? ....If you look at the obstruction cases that are brought, they involve coercion, threats and bribes. I don\'t think we\'re there yet,"" said the lawyer, who asked not to be named. \n \n Still, the lawyer, a veteran of several Washington scandals, said Trump\'s alleged comments to Comey were unwise. \n \n ""It\'s just bad judgment. Of course, if you\'re trying to give him counsel, it\'s not anything you would want him to do or say,"" the attorney said. ""Since Watergate, the most surefire way to blow yourself up is to attempt to pressure someone lower-down in the chain....It Just doesn\'t work.""', 'Multiple news outlets are now reporting that James Comey wrote in a memo that Donald Trump asked him to drop the FBI’s investigation of former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Here’s the New York Times story that started it all: \n \n President Trump asked the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, to shut down the federal investigation into Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, in an Oval Office meeting in February, according to a memo Mr. Comey wrote shortly after the meeting. “I hope you can let this go,” the president told Mr. Comey, according to the memo. \n \n The Times does not have a copy of the memo and claims instead that a Comey associate read excerpts to a reporter: \n \n Mr. Comey shared the existence of the memo with senior F.B.I. officials and close associates. The New York Times has not viewed a copy of the memo, which is unclassified, but one of Mr. Comey’s associates read parts of the memo to a Times reporter. \n \n The Trump administration is denying Trump made the request, writing in an unsigned statement: \n \n “The president has never asked Mr. Comey or anyone else to end an investigation, including any investigation involving General Flynn. . . . This is not a truthful or accurate portrayal of the conversation between the president and Mr. Comey.’’ \n \n The analysis here is pretty simple. If the memo exists, then there is compelling evidence that the president committed a potentially impeachable offense. Here is the alleged chain of events: First, Trump asked Comey to drop an investigation of a close former associate and a former senior official in his administration. Second, Comey refused. Third, weeks later Trump fired Comey. Fourth, Trump then misled the American people regarding the reason for the dismissal. Each prong is important, but it’s worth noting that the fourth prong — Trump’s deception regarding the reason for Comey’s termination — is particularly problematic in context. Deception is classic evidence of malign intent. \n \n If true, this is a serious abuse of power, and a Republican Congress would certainly impeach a Democrat if the roles were reversed. But — and this is vitally important to everyone at DEFCON 1 on Twitter — we don’t know yet if the New York Times account is true. Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr raised reasonable objections: \n \n “I actually believe the director might have told us that there’d been a request like that and it was never mentioned by him,” the North Carolina Republican told reporters. “So somebody’s going to have to do more than have anonymous sources on this one for me to believe that there’s something there.” \n \n Lindsay Graham — no fan of Trump — also raised a legitimate point: \n \n “If this happened, the FBI director should have done something about it or quit,” Graham said. “If the president asked the FBI director to do something inappropriate, the FBI director should have said no and quit.” \n \n The bottom line is that Americans need to see the memo, if it exists. The gravity of the accusation demands immediate Congressional action. Burr’s committee should subpoena that memo and every memo or other document reflecting the content of conversations between Comey and President Trump. Do it today. Burr told reporters that the “burden is on the New York Times” to produce the memo, but that’s absurd. The Times doesn’t have the ability to compel its production. House and Senate committees do, and they need to do their job. \n \n There is no good outcome here. Either there is now compelling evidence that the president committed a serious abuse of power, or the nation’s leading press outlets are dupes for a vindictive, misleading story. Either outcome violates the public trust in vital American institutions. Either outcome results in a degree of political chaos. If the memo is real and as damaging as the Times claims, the chaos is likely greater, but don’t underestimate the cultural and political damage if our nation’s most prestigious press outlets run a story of this magnitude based on a malicious fiction. It’s time for facts and documents, not anonymity and allegations. It’s time for the truth.']",4,"– President Trump is no stranger to scandal, but reports that he asked former FBI director James Comey to halt the investigation of Michael Flynn may have taken things to the next level. The report may have been the last straw for congressional Republicans, who appeared to be shifting against Trump on Tuesday night, Politico reports. House Oversight Committee Rep. Jason Chaffetz says he has asked the FBI for Comey's memos on the Trump request and other interactions with the president and he is ready to issue subpoenas if necessary. Some legal analysts say there could now be an obstruction of justice case against Trump, though it could be tough to prove. The latest: Obstruction of justice. The New York Times describes obstruction of justice as a ""murky"" charge, the exact definition of which was being hotly debated on Capitol Hill Tuesday night. Experts say it could certainly cover asking the FBI director to drop its investigation and then firing him. Any criminal case would probably have to prove that Trump had ""corrupt intentions,"" though if Trump is tried, it will be by Congress, not the courts. ""If this were anyone other than the president, it is classic, vanilla obstruction,"" former federal prosecutor Jeff Cramer tells Politico. The showdown. It now appears certain that a ""theatrical showdown"" between Trump and Comey looms, with Americans having to decide whose word they trust more, CNN reports. Comey is expected to be called to testify before Congress about the Feb. 14 meeting with Trump. Reasons for Trump to worry. The Times' sources say Comey kept detailed memos about his meetings with Trump, which ""should strike fear into the White House,"" according to the Washington Post. The notes may describe other times Trump allegedly crossed the line—and courts in previous cases have considered memos from FBI directors to be credible evidence. ""Reasonable objections."" The National Review notes that while there is ""no good outcome"" here, it is premature to say Trump is doomed to face impeachment proceedings: The allegation has not been proven, and the ""reasonable objections"" include Sen. Lindsey Graham's observation: ""If this happened, the FBI director should have done something about it or quit."" GOP reaction. Republican lawmakers including House Freedom Caucus chairman Rep. Frank Meadows are calling for an investigation of the ""disturbing"" allegation. Some have signaled that their patience is wearing out. ""This weekly scandal, this weekly controversy is unhealthy for the country. It’s a major distraction for the country and it’s just bad for the psyche of every American,"" said Florida Republican Rep. Carlos Curbelo, per Politico. Nixon comparisons. There are many comparisons to the Watergate scandal being made. Vox notes that what ended Richard Nixon's presidency wasn't the Watergate break-in itself—his involvement was never proven—but his attempt to force the FBI to abandon its investigation. Prison for the press. CNBC notes that amid the Flynn uproar, another allegation has been overlooked: Trump also allegedly asked Comey to consider imprisoning members of the press for publishing classified allegations that had been leaked."

He drove off in a rental vehicle that was checked for any secretly placed GPS tracking devices, the Herald said. \n \n The team planned the ""jail escort plan"" that eventually had Zimmerman dressing in disguise and changing vehicles on his way to a safe house. \n \n Zimmerman\'s lawyer, O\'Mara, claimed last week he paid the company $40,000 and that the charges were exorbitant and that he never signed a contract, according to the Herald. \n \n The attorney representing the security company, Stephen Milbrath, says Zimmerman and O\'Mara are bound by an oral contract. \n \n The Trayvon Martin shooting caused national outrage and raised racial tensions at rallies across the country who believed the shooting death of the teenager was unjustified.

It became one of the most respected defense contractors in the world, but also attracted sharp criticism over its role in those missions. \n \n It has been trying to rehabilitate its image since a 2007 shooting in Baghdad that killed 17 people, outraged the Iraqi government and led to federal charges against several Blackwater guards. The accusations later were thrown out of court after a judge found prosecutors mishandled evidence. \n \n In March, Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin suggested the Pentagon should consider banning Xe from a $1 billion deal to train Afghan police.

Jimmy Choo shares were up 17 percent at 228.00 pence at 1510 GMT. \n \n FILE PHOTO: A store of shoe designer Jimmy Choo is seen in the mountain resort of St. Moritz, Switzerland March 15, 2016.

Kering houses brands including Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent and Alexander McQueen. \n \n Jimmy Choo put itself up for sale in April after its majority-owner JAB, the investment vehicle of Germany’s billionaire Reimann family, signaled its intention to focus on consumer goods instead. \n \n Jimmy Choo will continue to be led by the same management team, including Creative Director Sandra Choi who joined the company at its inception. \n \n Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan acted for Michael Kors on the deal, while Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, Liberum and RBC Europe acted for Jimmy Choo.', '(CNN) -- Police have found evidence that ""strongly indicates"" a 12-year-old boy who was witnessed being snatched by a crocodile in a remote part of Australia was killed in the attack. \n \n ""No specifics will be given in relation to the trauma or type of evidence located out of respect for the family,"" acting police commander Michael White said in a statement Tuesday. \n \n The family of the boy -- who would have returned to school Tuesday after the summer break -- have been informed, a spokeswoman for the Northern Territory police, Rebecca Forrest, told CNN. \n \n ""As expected they\'re grieving,"" Forrest said.

The crocodile then turned on his friend, aged 12, said police sergeant Stephen Constable. \n \n ""The 15-year-old boy was grabbed on his right arm. He started fighting off the croc, and it took him by the left arm; then it let him go and took hold of the 12-year-old boy, and swam off with him."" \n \n Police officers and park rangers have been using helicopters and boats to search the area since the attack occurred. \n \n A crocodile expert who examined the first boy\'s wounds, believed the crocodile was between 2.5 to three meters long (around eight to nine feet), Constable said. \n \n Search crews have also been looking for larger crocodiles that may have attacked the one that took the 12-year-old. \n \n ""On occasion a smaller crocodile may take some food, and a bigger crocodile will take it off them,"" said Constable. \n \n According to local media reports, people had been warned against swimming in the area after a teenager survived an attack by a five-meter-long crocodile in the region in January last year. \n \n Constable said this time of year is particularly dangerous due to seasonal flooding. \n \n Australian boy says kangaroo saved him \n \n Coroner rules dingo to blame for Australian baby\'s death \n \n CNN\'s Pierre Meilhan contributed to this report.']",2,"– Shoes and handbags go together like … well, Jimmy Choo and Michael Kors, now that the latter has agreed to purchase the former for $1.2 billion, the Wall Street Journal reports.

Longacre is 24, and will still be 24 when the Miss America pageant is held in September—and she says she was told that as long as she was 24 during the Miss America competition, her age was not an issue. But officials now say that according to the fine print, Miss America can't turn 25 any time in 2014; Longacre's birthday is in October, the Smyrna-Clayton Sun-Times explains. Longacre had no trouble while competing on the local level, and when she advanced to the state level, she says her age and birthday were clearly stated on her contract, which the Miss Delaware Scholarship Organization signed, she tells NBC Philadelphia. The organization verified her birth certificate, license, and social security card before the competition. A media relations coordinator for the Miss Delaware organization even confirms that Longacre didn't do anything wrong, and calls the whole thing ""a terrible mistake."" After being told on Tuesday she'd be losing her title (plus prizes including $11,000 in scholarship money), Longacre says officials have been ""ignoring"" her. Making things worse: She had deferred her master's program and her Department of Justice internship for a year so that she could fulfill her Miss Delaware duties.

She’s injured,” Ali told reporters at the scene. “[It] breaks my heart. That was my grandchild.” \n \n Al-Rahabi is still in the emergency room at Coney Island Hospital recovering from the accident. \n \n A neighbor said that when Areej’s father came home, he nearly passed out. “They’re all screaming and crying next door,” the neighbor added. \n \n Jeff Delacruz, who lives in the building, said his aunt spoke to the baby’s mother. “She keeps saying, ‘Everything is OK. It’s OK. God only gave me my baby for one month . . . She’s probably traumatized,” said Delacruz, 28. \n \n His wife said the elevators are always out of service. \n \n “About a week ago, the same one was out of service. The door just didn’t open,” said Elizabeth Delacruz, 26. \n \n The Bay Park complex has a “chronic problem” with its elevators, according to one of hundreds of Department of Buildings complaints. \n \n There’s one active complaint from Sept. 30 about the elevator that caused Areej’s death. \n \n Two complaints for that elevator from July 17 that have been resolved and a complaint from March 9, 2015, that says the elevator is “constantly getting out of service” and “has not been working for 2½ weeks.” \n \n There are 45 total elevator complaints dating back to 2000 at 3415 Neptune Ave. There are also 159 elevator-related violations in the complex dating back to 1994 — with 31 still active. \n \n The Department of Buildings said the elevator involved was last inspected on Aug. 8, and one nonhazardous violation was issued because the emergency phone in the car didn’t work. \n \n But DOB inspectors determined it could “safely remain in operation.” \n \n They added the elevator passed inspections in January 2016, including a thorough, “once-every-five-years inspection” where special load tests are conducted to measure the weight limits of the car. \n \n The Starrett Corporation, which owns the building, issued a statement saying: “We are saddened by today’s tragic incident . . . The incident is now under active investigation and we are cooperating fully with all authorities and agencies to determine the facts surrounding the event. We extend our deepest sympathies to the families involved and management is making arrangements to offer grief counseling upon request.”', 'NEW YORK (AP) — A 6-week-old baby died Thursday when her stroller accidentally plunged down an empty elevator shaft in a Brooklyn building. \n \n The infant\'s mother was waiting with the stroller on the 23rd floor of an apartment building in Coney Island around 11:40 a.m., officials said. \n \n When the doors opened, the woman stepped forward and both she and the stroller fell down the shaft and landed on the elevator car, which was out of service eight stories below, police said. \n \n A mechanic who had been working on the elevator heard the mother\'s screams and helped pull her to safety, police said. \n \n The circumstances of exactly where the elevator was when the woman and stroller landed on it were unclear. \n \n The baby girl, identified as Areej Ali, of Brooklyn, was pronounced dead at Coney Island Hospital.

18,"['If wedding costs are an indicator of consumer confidence, Americans must be feeling pretty good about their finances right now. \n \n The average cost of a wedding last year exceeded $31,213, up 4.5% from $29,858 the previous year and an increase of 16% from a recent low of $26,984 in 2010, according to a survey of 15,800 brides by wedding website The Knot. The most expensive place to get married last year was Manhattan (an average cost of $76,328) — five times the cost of getting married in Utah, the least expensive place (where the average wedding cost just $15,257). Long Island, N.Y. ($55,327), North-Central New Jersey ($53,986), Westchester County and Hudson Valley, N.Y. ($52,954) and Chicago ($50,934) also topped the list of the most expensive places to get hitched. \n \n Of the $31,213, the highest since The Knot began tracking wedding costs in 2007, Americans will spend $14,006 on a venue, $3,587 on a reception band, $5,855 on an engagement ring, $2,556 on a photographer and $2,141 on a florist or decor. \n \n Wedding costs soar to new highs (3:40) As Americans feel better about the economy, the optimism is reflected in higher spending on weddings. Quentin Fottrell joins Lunch Break. \n \n The rest goes to such things as a wedding dress ($1,357), rehearsal dinner ($1,206) and invitations ($439) and even party favors ($275). “This shows that people are feeling better about the economy,” says Sreekar Jasthi, analyst with personal finance site NerdWallet.com. “But our research shows that the least-expensive counties spend a greater portion of their income. That’s concerning.” \n \n Read: How much should I spend on a wedding gift? \n \n Before spending so much money on one day, there are a few considerations couples might want to take into account. First, the cost of getting married in the U.S. also happens to be exactly the same — give or take $92 — as a 15% down payment on a median-priced home worth $208,700 in the fourth quarter of 2014, according to data from HSH.com, the Riverdale, N.J.-based mortgage-information firm. And, second, nearly one-fifth (17%) of couples who get married will decide to marry again (15% twice and 4% three or more times), according to a report, “Remarriage in the United States,” released this week by the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey. \n \n And nearly one-quarter are destination weddings, The Knot found, which also pushes up the cost of attending — including travel and accommodation — for guests. In fact, guests spend around $592 per wedding, according to a 2014 survey by American Express. And as the cost of attending weddings increases, so does the volume of RSVPs marked “Declines with regret.” Some 43% of Americans say they’ve declined to attend a wedding for financial reasons, while 36% of people say they’ve gone into debt to attend a friend’s wedding, according to a separate 2013 poll by American Consumer Credit Counseling, a non-profit financial advisory in Auburndale, Mass. \n \n Read: The larger the rock, the rockier the marriage', 'CLOSE With thousands of people evacuating the coasts of Florida and Georgia ahead of Hurricane Irma, some Miami Beach residents are counting on their storm-resistant structures and staying.

In its eighth report, the wedding site reveals in a press release that when it came to the 16,000 brides and grooms married in 2014 and then surveyed, most couples split that bill evenly with the bride's parents: On average, each footed 43% of the bill, with the groom's parents chipping in 12%. In fact, only 12% of couples paid for their weddings themselves. And sticking to the budget is apparently tough: 45% of couples didn't manage to do so (another 23% didn't even make a budget). As for the dress, brides spent an average $1,357. The survey also found that the most expensive place to wed was Manhattan, where the average price tag was $76,328 (which is actually down almost $10,000 from the previous year), while the least expensive was Utah, where weddings cost less than half the national average at $15,257. Couples are spending more per head, too, as the average guest list shrunk from 149 in 2009 to 136 in 2014.

After a volatile session, the Dow ended down 1,175 points, or 4.6%, at 24,346. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n It was the largest ever single-day point drop for the Dow and it rattled both Wall Street and Washington, abruptly ending a remarkable period of placid markets where it often seemed the only direction was up. A young generation of Wall Street traders has never seen the kind of whipsaw action that seized markets Monday. \n \n While the point drop was the largest, Monday’s decline did not rival some of the bloodiest days in Wall Street history given how fast the Dow has raced ahead in recent years. On Oct. 19, 1987, the notorious “Black Monday,” the blue chip average gave up nearly 23 percent of its value. On Sept. 29, 2008, in the depths of the financial crisis, the Dow sank nearly 7 percent. \n \n But it was still a large and shocking decline. It arrived amid growing concern that an economy juiced by a massive corporate tax cut, and already at full employment, could overheat and require forceful action from a new and untested Federal Reserve chairman — installed by Trump — to cool things down. \n \n On top of concerns about rising inflation, the tax cuts are already increasing the federal government’s need to borrow and accelerating the date by which Congress must raise the federal debt limit. And as of Monday, there was still no plan in Washington to raise the limit and avoid a catastrophic default. \n \n The result is that a president who tossed aside traditional presidential caution in cheerleading the stock market now stands poised to take the blame for any correction. \n \n “This is a risk that the president clearly set himself up for,” said Charles Gabriel of Capital Alpha Partners, a Washington research firm. “Until now, Trump’s had kind of a free ride in this market and taken so much credit for it, even though so much of it was due to easy-money policies from Janet Yellen and the Fed.

But he is a lesser-known figure on Wall Street. \n \n And if the recent jump in hourly wages gets pushed up even more by corporations handing out bonuses and pay bumps in the wake of the tax bill, the Fed may be forced to move faster to fight inflation — offsetting the economic benefits of the tax cuts. \n \n Interest rates are already rising as the government discloses it will have to ramp up borrowing in 2018 to make up for revenue lost to the tax-cut bill. Higher rates on government bonds make stocks look less appealing. They also can make it harder for businesses and consumers to borrow and spend, possibly slowing the economy. \n \n On top of all this, stocks blew past traditional valuations as they raced ahead in 2017 and early 2018. A widely followed ratio designed by economists Robert Shiller and John Campbell that compares stock prices to corporate earnings hit 34 this year. The historic median for the ratio is 16. \n \n This could have served as a warning to Trump not to associate himself too closely with a rally that looked tenuous to many Wall Street analysts. Instead, Trump bragged about the gains at every opportunity on Twitter and even in his State of the Union address. \n \n “The stock market has smashed one record after another, gaining $8 trillion in value,” Trump said in his address to Congress. \n \n Last week’s decline alone wiped out nearly $1 trillion in that value, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. \n \n Trump has regularly boasted on Twitter that the stock market rise, which actually began in 2009 at the end of the last recession, is the direct result of his policies on taxes and regulation. \n \n “Business is looking better than ever with business enthusiasm at record levels. Stock Market at an all-time high. That doesn\'t just happen!” he tweeted last August. \n \n Other senior administration officials such as Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn have also tied the market’s gains directly to Trump policy moves. \n \n The latest declines left a White House that has basked in the glow of the market rally scrambling to explain away the massive decline and calm frayed investor nerves. \n \n “The President’s focus is on our long-term economic fundamentals, which remain exceptionally strong, with strengthening U.S. economic growth, historically low unemployment, and increasing wages for American workers,"" White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement. ""The President’s tax cuts and regulatory reforms will further enhance the U.S. economy and continue to increase prosperity for the American people.” \n \n Stocks are still far higher than they were when Trump took office, but the return of sharp volatility — and the possibility of further declines — has now put Trump in the uncomfortable position of being directly associated with daily market moves. \n \n “Presidents historically haven’t commented on the stock market anywhere near as much as President Trump has,” said Ed Yardeni, market analyst at Yardeni Research Inc. “I think Barack Obama said something in 2009 about how he thought stock prices seemed low, and that was about it. So he obviously likes to take credit for the positives. Now what does he say when the market suddenly goes down?” \n \n Dow Jones erases its gains for the year in the largest single-day point drop \n \n So far, Trump has not weighed in publicly on the market declines. A White House official sent a statement to CNBC on Monday expressing concern over the drop. “We\'re always concerned when the market loses any value, but we\'re also confident in the economy\'s fundamentals,” the statement said. \n \n Both the U.S. and global economies are in fact on stronger ground than they have been in years, leading many Wall Street analysts to suggest that the current bout of selling represents something of a healthy correction to stock market valuations and not the beginning of a bear market. \n \n Unemployment in the U.S. is low, corporate profits are strong, and growth in the first quarter is currently running as fast as 5.2 percent, according to the most recent estimate from the Atlanta Fed. Europe and Japan are also growing, a kind of synchronized global expansion not seen in recent years. \n \n “Corrections of 5% to 15% occur on average once a calendar year,” Jason Pride, director of investment strategy at Glenmede, wrote in a client note Monday. “Further, history has shown the market capable of making it through such corrections and going on to positive returns for the full year period, particularly in cases of ongoing expansions.” \n \n The market may indeed quickly reverse course in the coming days and go on to move higher over the course of the year, allowing to Trump to start bragging again and possibly aiding Republicans in their efforts to tout the tax-cut bill and limit potential losses in the midterm elections. \n \n But significant risks lie ahead in Washington. The biggest is whether Powell and the Fed can navigate a difficult path between allowing the economy to thrive and wages to rise without letting potentially crushing inflation take hold. And if Powell and his colleagues decide they need to pump the brakes hard, that could leave them in direct conflict with a president not shy about criticizing people he himself put into office. \n \n And it could leave Trump with regret about jettisoning a Fed chair whom Wall Street came to love. “For the past four years, Yellen was the fairy godmother of the bull market,” said Yardeni. “And now that she’s gone, maybe we don’t get the fairy dust anymore.”']",2,"– President Trump himself hasn't addressed Monday's miserable day for the stock market, but two White House officials made a point to downplay the trouble and emphasize perspective. ""Look markets do fluctuate,"" said deputy White House press secretary Raj Shah. ""But the fundamentals of this economy are very strong."" Press chief Sarah Huckabee Sanders said similarly that the ""president's focus is on our long-term economic fundamentals, which remain exceptionally strong."" As many outlets are now pointing out, Trump has repeatedly boasted of the booming stock market. In his recent State of the Union address, for example, he spoke of it smashing ""one record after the other,"" notes USA Today, which rounds up several tweets from Trump with a similar sentiment. Despite Monday's 1,175-point loss, the Dow is still up 23% since Trump took office, reports Business Insider. But the rough day illustrates the danger of the president taking too much credit for the market's performance, notes Politico. “This is a risk that the president clearly set himself up for,” Charles Gabriel of Capital Alpha Partners tells the news site. “Until now, Trump’s had kind of a free ride in this market and taken so much credit for it, even though so much of it was due to easy-money policies from Janet Yellen and the Fed."" Monday may have seen the biggest single-day point loss in the Dow's history, but in terms of percentage, the 4.46% loss is well below the 7% single-day drop of Sept. 29, 2008."

There’s the blues standard “Keys to the Highway” from 1970, and a not-quite-finished run through “Whole Lotta Love,” both of which should serve as appetizers for the gigantic pile of songs—a rarities disc with each album—ranging from alternate takes and live performances, including an entire Paris gig from 1969, to work-in-progress ideas and the occasional lost gem. \n \n Jimmy Page has spent the last couple of years putting the releases together from the band’s vault of recordings. And he told BBC News that the unvarnished version of a song like “Whole Lotta Love” made him aware of how much work the band put into the fine polish and extra guitars and vocals to really make it fly: “You realize just how important all of those additional layers and the filigree work is. \n \n “There’s all manner of bells and whistles to make it the song ‘Whole Lotta Love’ as we all know it.” \n \n That said, it’s not as if laying the songs bare has exposed an essential weakness in their sound: “It’s undeniable that we’re good,” he said. “The band was the real deal.” \n \n For Robert Plant, it has been a slightly different experience, in that there are a lot of things he rather wishes he had done differently: “My enthusiasm sometimes got in the way of finesse. I listen to it and go, wow, why didn’t I shut up a bit? I kind of overcooked it.” \n \n But his enthusiasm for the work still shines through: “It was a particularly prolific time, where we were learning about each other’s capabilities. \n \n “Jimmy and I were just fooling around with the stuff that we would play at home. We were just trying things out. Nothing was premeditated.” \n \n And he offers firm advice for any would-be listeners: “These things aren’t to study.

21,"[""Mobb Deep Songs Remixed: Listen to 7 of the Best \n \n The rap world is reeling from the shocking news that Prodigy, iconic rapper and one-half of Mobb Deep, died Tuesday (June 20) at age 42. He had been admitted to the hospital days earlier due to complications caused by a sickle cell anemia, a condition he'd struggled with from birth. \n \n As the music world mourns across genres and generations, we at Billboard Dance take a moment to honor his legacy with a list of remixes that best reinterpret a few of Mobb Deep's most beloved songs. No one can ever replace Prodigy, a man who inspired many young MCs to first pick up the mic, but we can continue his life by enjoying the fruits of his lifelong labor. \n \n Mobb Deep – “Shook Ones” (Spaveech Remix) \n \n Take the ride from New York to New Jersey with Spaveech, as he puts a dance music spin on the Infamous anthem. The classic piano melody keeps things eerie, even as the house vibe gets booties moving on the dance floor. \n \n Mobb Deep – “Shook Ones” (Izzamuzzic Remix) \n \n The influence extends to Kazakhstan as Izzamuzzic turns “Shook Ones” into a beautiful, dark modern trap anthem. Havoc and Prodigy's words up the rhythm on the slowed beat, while the hook is catchy as ever. \n \n Mobb Deep – “Shook Ones” (DJ Premier Remix) \n \n DJ Premier is a legend in his own right. One-half of Gang Starr and a gifted producer on the solo tip, he takes a classical eye to this, one of Mobb Deep's biggest hits. It adds a flair of the cinematic, but the hip-hop drums keep this all New York hip-hop. \n \n Mobb Deep – “Survival of the Fittest” (Wonderboy Remix) \n \n Don't let the West Coast sound of this beat fool you. The Mobb Deep boys cross oceans to inspire this U.K.-based producer to cut and scratch all over this classic cut from the duo's second album, The Infamous, for an extra funky take. \n \n Mobb Deep – “Survival of the Fittest” (Benitoloco Remix) \n \n Flutes and strings up the ante on this emotive remix from the U.K.'s Benitoloco. He thrives on the classic New York hip-hop sound, twisting it with some worldly influence that has us coming back for more. \n \n Mobb Deep – “Hell on Earth” (Aesthetic Remix) \n \n This title track from Mobb Deep's third album gets a jazzy face lift, full of laid-back drums and off-center horn, string and piano notes that give the classic tune a cool new sting. There's something sinister about it, like the underlying darkness that made Mobb Deep so compelling in the first place. \n \n Mobb Deep – “Hell on Earth” (Baghiri Remix) \n \n Spanish producer Baghiri went diggin' in the crates for this classic hip-hop-style rework of “Hell on Earth.” Rain falls in the background and sets a scene of introspection as a repetitive standing bass keeps the pace. Definitely worth a few listens."", 'Mobb Deep\'s Prodigy Dies At 42 \n \n Enlarge this image toggle caption Bryan Bedder/Getty Images Bryan Bedder/Getty Images \n \n Prodigy, one-half of iconic New York rap duo Mobb Deep, has died, according to a statement provided to NPR by a publicist for the group. The statement goes on to say that the rapper, born Albert Johnson, was hospitalized ""a few days ago in Vegas after a Mobb Deep performance for complications caused by sickle cell anemia crisis."" Johnson battled the disease throughout his lifetime. He was 42 years old. No cause of death is known at this time. \n \n The emcee was best known for crafting narratives of struggle and survival, depicting New York in the depths of the crack era, but he had music flowing through his veins from the beginning. \n \n Prodigy\'s mother, Fatima Johnson, was a member of the \'60s R&B; group The Crystals, and also served as Mobb Deep\'s first manager. When she passed, on Christmas Eve, 2016, Prodigy publicly eulogized her on Instagram: ""I want to take a moment and salute this beautiful soul. Fatima Johnson, may u Rest In Peace,"" he wrote. ""There wouldn\'t be a Mobb Deep without you literally!! Our first manager, our first support team and believed in us when no one else did! You\'ll always always be remembered."" \n \n Prodigy co-founded the Queens-based Mobb Deep in the early \'90s, alongside partner Havoc (Kejuan Muchita). The two became synonymous with a brand of East Coast gangsta rap that represented the ill street blues, grit and grime of pre-gentrified New York City, debuting with Juvenile Hell in 1993. But it was their 1995 follow-up, The Infamous, that cemented their image and legacy. The music was dark, with eerie undertones that reflected the environmental hazards and criminal exploits of day-to-day living in the hood. \n \n ""New York got a n**** depressed / so I wear a slug-proof underneath my Guess,"" Prodigy rapped on 1995\'s ""Survival of the Fittest."" \n \n The Queensbridge Houses from which they hailed and represented on record are the same, storied projects that nurtured hip-hop legends Marley Marl, MC Shan, Roxanne Shante, and Mobb Deep contemporaries Nas, Cormega, Nature, Tragedy Khadafi, and more. Like the projects, Mobb Deep\'s discography stands as a testament to the socioeconomic conditions into which they were born and bred. \n \n ""I got you stuck off the realness / we be the infamous / you heard of us / official Queensbridge murderers,"" Prodigy raps in their most memorable song, ""Shook Ones Pt. II."" Other classics among Mobb Deep\'s eight-album discography include ""Quiet Storm,"" the duo\'s 1999 collaboration with Lil\' Kim. \n \n In recent years, Prodigy had parlayed a prison sentence into a solo career, an autobiography (My Infamous Life) — even a cookbook. Released in 2016, Commissary Kitchen: My Infamous Prison Cookbook highlighted the ingenuity he exercised to eat healthy while serving a three-and-a-half year sentence for gun possession. \n \n YouTube \n \n Prodigy had been in Las Vegas, where Mobb Deep performed over the weekend as part of the Art of Rap tour, featuring other legendary acts Onyx, Ghostface Killah, KRS-One, and Ice-T.', 'This is a set of web collections curated by Mark Graham using the Archive-IT service of the Internet Archive.

22,"['Talk about too many cooks in the kitchen: Mitt Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign near the end of the race needed upwards of 22 people to sign off on a social media post before it could go live. \n \n That’s one of the findings in a new paper released Friday by University of North Carolina journalism professor Daniel Kreiss, who studied how both Romney and President Barack Obama used Twitter, Facebook and other online tools to shape their campaign messages. \n \n “So whether it was a tweet, Facebook post, blog post, photo—anything you could imagine—it had to be sent around to everyone for approval. Towards the end of the campaign that was 22 individuals who had to approve it,” Caitlin Checkett, the Romney campaign digital integration director, told Kreiss. “The digital team unfortunately did not have the opportunity to think of things on their own and post them. ... The downfall of that of course is as fast as we are moving it can take a little bit of time to get that approval to happen.” \n \n By contrast, Kreiss writes that Obama digital director Teddy Goff and his team of four social media staffers “had significantly more autonomy” to quickly respond to fast-breaking campaign events. For example, Obama’s campaign quickly responded to Clint Eastwood’s empty chair speech at the Republican National Convention by posting on Twitter a picture of Obama seated in the White House, with the message “This Seat’s Taken.” The post got almost 60,000 retweets, more than 23,800 favorites and was cited in a variety of media reports. \n \n Both the Obama and Romney campaigns also obsessed over their scripted social media attacks and rebuttals in trying to use a bit of psychology on the reporters covering the campaign, Kreiss found. \n \n Prepping for over a month ahead of their first debate, Romney’s campaign did Saturday dry runs and created 200 pre-made info-graphics. Obama’s digital team didn’t do extensive planning ahead of the first debate, but Kreiss writes that the president’s campaign was ready for the second debate by pre-writing hundreds of tweets to go up under handles for Obama, campaign manager Jim Messina or senior strategist David Axelrod. \n \n Goff told Kreiss that the Obama digital team’s job was to “make sure that no matter what was going on, frankly whether or not the president did his job, you know, there would be very loud voices talking about how we were doing well so that if we were doing well that would be perfectly clear to reporters and if we weren’t doing that well they would look at Twitter and see that it was a lot more mixed than they expected and sort of second guess their own perception that maybe the president wasn’t doing that well.” \n \n Goff also said that while the campaign probably didn’t persuade any voters through Twitter, its use of the platform still made a difference by hitting ""the somewhat elite core of supporters and then very importantly reached reporters as well.” \n \n ""So for Twitter we spent a lot of time thinking about how we could sort of manipulate the sort of national dialogue, the dialogue around politics,” he told the professor. \n \n Read more about: Mitt Romney', 'When Mitt Romney\'s digital team wanted to send out a tweet during the 2012 campaign, it wasn\'t easy for them. A new paper by Daniel Kreiss, an assistant professor at UNC Chapel Hill (and flagged by Brendan Nyhan on Twitter), finds that, late in the campaign, as many as 22 people had to sign off on the language of each tweet from the @MittRomney feed. That\'s according to Romney\'s digital integration director Caitlin Checkett, who said: \n \n CHECKETT: ""So whether it was a tweet, Facebook post, blog post, photo — anything you could imagine — it had to be sent around to everyone for approval. Towards the end of the campaign that was 22 individuals who had to approve it. ... The digital team unfortunately did not have the opportunity to think of things on their own and post them."" \n \n Romney\'s digital director Zac Moffatt concurred, telling Kreiss the campaign had ""the best tweets ever written by 17 people ... It was the best they all could agree on every single time."" \n \n In contrast, Kreiss finds that Obama\'s digital team had ""more autonomy,"" which made it easier for staffers ""to respond to political events in the moment and in a communicative style that accords with the norms and expectations of networked publics on Twitter."" He cites a humorous tweet from the @BarackObama feed responding to Clint Eastwood\'s ""empty chair"" Republican convention speech earlier that night. \n \n Politicians and their staffers are generally very cautious with official tweets, and that\'s understandable. There\'s little upside from most campaign tweets, and potentially a lot of downside from a Twitter blunder dominating the headlines. Still, having 17 to 22 people vet each tweet seems like a bit of an overcorrection, and makes one wonder what Romney\'s management style would have been like in the White House.']",2,"– The fast-paced world of social media wasn't quite so speedy at the Mitt Romney presidential campaign. Sure, tweets may only be 140 characters at most, but they required the approval of 22 different people ""towards the end of the campaign,"" a digital media campaign staffer says in a new study. ""Whether it was a tweet, Facebook post, blog post, photo—anything you could imagine—it had to be sent around to everyone,"" Caitlin Checkett told journalism professor Daniel Kreiss, as Politico reports. The campaign's digital director calls them ""the best tweets ever written by 17 people,"" Vox reports. At the Obama campaign, things were a little different. Digital head Teddy Goff's four-person team ""had significantly more autonomy"" to decide what should be posted, the study says. That made it easier to respond right away to events like Clint Eastwood's Republican convention speech. The team aimed to ""make sure that no matter what was going on—frankly, whether or not the president did his job—there would be very loud voices talking about how we were doing well,"" Goff says."

Photograph: Brook Lapping/Kessler Prod/BBC \n \n Israel has made public a decades-old handwritten plea for clemency from Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann for his role in the Holocaust, dated two days before he was executed. \n \n In the request, written after he was brought to Israel in 1960, then tried, convicted and sentenced to death, Eichmann says the Israeli court overstated his role in organising the logistics of Hitler’s Final Solution, which involved the extermination of 6 million Jews. \n \n \n \n President Reuven Rivlin presented the previously unreleased letter, which was written to then president Yitzhak Ben-Zvi, at a ceremony to mark International Holocaust Remembrance Day. \n \n Hitler’s world may not be so far away | Timothy Snyder Read more \n \n “There is a need to draw a line between the leaders responsible and the people like me forced to serve as mere instruments in the hands of the leaders,” the presidency quoted Eichmann’s letter as saying. \n \n “I was not a responsible leader, and as such do not feel myself guilty,” the German wrote. \n \n “I am not able to recognise the court’s ruling as just, and I ask, Your Honour Mr President, to exercise your right to grant pardons, and order that the death penalty not be carried out.” \n \n The letter was signed and dated: “Adolf Eichmann Jerusalem, May 29, 1962.” \n \n He was hanged at about midnight on 31 May. \n \n Eichmann, one of the main organisers of the Holocaust, escaped from a prisoner-of-war camp after the second world war and fled to Argentina in 1950, where he lived under a pseudonym until he was snatched by Mossad agents in Buenos Aires in May 1960 and smuggled into Israel. \n \n The ability of the security services to bring him to justice was a source of pride for the Jewish state, and Rivlin referred to the trial as a momentous moment in Israel’s history. \n \n “In the first years after the Holocaust, the people in Israel were busy rebuilding and founding an independent state,” he said. “The renewed Israeli society was not in the mindset to, or able to, remember. \n \n “The Eichmann trial broke the dam of silence. The ability of the young Jewish state to capture the Nazi murderer afforded a basic sense of security to the survivors of the Holocaust.” \n \n Dismissing Eichmann’s claims to be just a bureaucrat, Rivlin said: “The people who suffered from Eichmann’s weakness were not given a moment of grace.” \n \n Israel and its allies have continued to use their resources across the globe to pursue those responsible for carrying out the Holocaust, even though the majority of perpetrators are now close to death. \n \n On Tuesday, the Simon Wiesenthal Center – named after the famous Nazi hunter – produced a list of 10 alleged Nazis who could be prosecuted in 2016.

Zuckerberg tells the BBC that Facebook's mission of connecting the world has become more controversial in recent years, and while he still believes in building a global community, it must involve helping those who feel they've been left behind by globalization. Some key points from the manifesto: Facebook's next step. ""For the past decade, Facebook has focused on connecting friends and families,"" Zuckerberg writes. ""With that foundation, our next focus will be developing the social infrastructure for community—for supporting us, for keeping us safe, for informing us, for civic engagement, and for inclusion of all."" ""Meaningful communities."" Zuckerberg says he wants Facebook to do more to help people connect with ""meaningful communities"" both online and offline, citing examples including the Black Fathers group. Safety measures.

He says since standards vary between users and between societies, people will be allowed to have their own settings, and ""content will only be taken down if it is more objectionable than the most permissive options allow."" ""History has had many moments like today,"" Zuckerberg writes in conclusion. ""As we've made our great leaps from tribes to cities to nations, we have always had to build social infrastructure like communities, media and governments for us to thrive and reach the next level ... We have done it before and we will do it again."" He closes with a quote from Abraham Lincoln: ""We can succeed only by concert. It is not 'can any of us imagine better?' but, 'can we all do better?'

Critics had said Ashcroft had misused this authority as a means of seizing people even when the government had no reason to believe they had committed a crime.Two years ago, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals sided with Al Kidd\'s suit against Ashcroft and said the Constitution does not give government ""the power to arrest and detain American citizens for months on end … merely because the government wishes to investigate them for possible wrongdoing.""The Obama administration appealed on Ashcroft\'s behalf and won a reversal Tuesday.Justice Antonin Scalia said the officers who arrested Al Kidd had obtained an arrest warrant from a magistrate.

It also could point to help for people on sleep/wake schedules that don’t align with their circadian rhythms and people who suffer from seasonal affective disorder, a type of depression. The researchers also are investigating whether..."", 'Exposing people to short flashes of light while they’re sleeping could provide a fast and efficient method of preventing jet lag, according to a study by researchers at the Stanford University School of Medicine. \n \n “This could be a new way of adjusting much more quickly to time changes than other methods in use today,” said Jamie Zeitzer, PhD, assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences. \n \n Zeitzer is senior author of the study, which was published online Feb. 8 in the Journal of Clinical Investigation. The lead author is Raymond Najjar, PhD, a former postdoctoral scholar at Stanford now at the Singapore Eye Research Institute. \n \n Researchers led by Zeitzer have been working on developing an optimal technique for using light exposure to help people adjust more quickly to changes in their sleep cycles. Current light-therapy treatments for sleep disturbances include sitting in front of bright lights for hours at a time during the day, which allows you to transition your body clock to a new time zone in small steps prior to taking a trip. \n \n Night light \n \n In an earlier study, Zeitzer and his colleagues found that light therapy works best at night because the body’s circadian rhythms, which control sleep cycles, are more sensitive to light at night, even through closed eyelids. \n \n In the latest study, Zeitzer and Najjar found that short flashes of light at night are more effective than continuous light exposure and could further speed up the process of adjusting to a different time zone before a trip. \n \n The transfer of light through the eyes to the brain does more than provide sight; it also changes the biological clock. A person’s brain can be tricked into adjusting more quickly to disturbances in sleep cycles by increasing how long he or she is exposed to light prior to traveling to a new time zone. \n \n After arriving in a new time zone, the body will eventually adjust on its own, but at a slow pace of about one hour a day. Meanwhile, jet lag, which occurs because your body’s clock is still synced to your original time zone, can cause fatigue, lack of alertness, a general feeling of malaise and sometimes gastrointestinal problems. \n \n Biological ‘hacking’ \n \n Light therapy is designed to speed up the brain’s adjustment to time changes. By conducting light therapy at night, the brain’s biological clock gets tricked into adjusting to an awake cycle even when asleep. It’s a kind of “biological hacking” that fools the brain into thinking the day is longer while you get to sleep, Zeitzer said.', 'Uma Thurman is grateful for a lot of things in 2017—chief among them, the downfall of Harvey Weinstein. She\'s shared credits with the disgraced producer in seven movies, including her Academy Award-nominated role in Pulp Fiction and Quentin Tarantino\'s Kill Bill, Vols. 1 and 2, and after the first wave of sexual misconduct allegations against him came out in October, Access Hollywood asked Thurman how she felt about them. ""I don\'t have a tidy soundbite for you, because I have learned, I am not a child. And I have learned that when I\'ve spoken in anger, I usually regret the way I express myself,"" she said at the time, carefully choosing her words.

You don\'t deserve a bullet.""']",3,"– Researchers at Stanford University have discovered what a press release calls a ""fast and efficient"" way to stop jet lag before it starts: repeatedly flashing light into your eyes while you sleep. ""If you are flying to New York tomorrow, tonight you use the light therapy,"" Dr. Jamie Zeitzer says. ""If you normally wake up at 8am, you set the flashing light to go off at 5am. When you get to New York, your biological system is already in the process of shifting to East Coast time."" A flash every 10 seconds for one hour, used toward the end of the night, will push the body's circadian rhythm forward by about two hours, the Wall Street Journal explains. Using the flashes of light at the beginning of the night, on the other hand, will delay the circadian clock and could be helpful when the aforementioned traveler heads back to the West Coast. Current in-advance methods for dealing with jet lag and sleep-cycle issues involve continuous light administered while awake. Not only did the study find flashing lights to be more effective—they change the body's circadian rhythm up to three times faster than a steady light—they don't interrupt a person's life. ""Most people can sleep through the flashing light just fine,"" Zeitzer says in the press release. Researchers are hoping to have a light-flashing sleep mask available for consumers later this year. This same method could be used to help people who work the night shift or have seasonal affective disorder. And researchers are currently testing it on a group of teens to improve school performance. ""We’re basically looking to intentionally jet lag teens so that they can go to bed at a reasonable time,"" Zeitzer tells the Journal. (This family of five gave itself perpetual jet lag by switching to Martian time.)"

Researchers at Stanford University have discovered that a genetic variation made humans shorter and more compact as a means of protecting them against frostbite in the colder temperatures of northern climates, Newsweek reports. In addition, their limbs got shorter, making them less vulnerable to breaking if people should, say, slip on ice. The downside of this evolutionary adaptation was an increase in the likelihood of osteoarthritis. The Stanford study, published Monday in Nature Genetics, shows how a variation in the GDF5 gene became more prevalent in humans moving out of Africa into colder climates 50,000 to 100,000 years ago. This variation doubles the chances of developing painful joint problems while also reducing height by about 0.4 inches on average, the Telegraph reports. And since arthritis generally doesn't develop until after the age of reproduction, the gene mutation was passed on from generation to generation. The Stanford researchers discovered that the genetic variation causing this increase in arthritis is common among Europeans but rare in African populations.

He doesn’t get high, he says, just ""pleasantly painless.” \n \n The similarities to Chatroulette aren’t unintended. As that site grew in popularity, Dan saw an opportunity to create a place where smokers could meet and smoke in a safe environment—one free of the voyeurs and masturbators that plagued Chatroulette in its early iterations. \n \n According to site rules, all users must be 18 or older and users may smoke only legally issued medicinal marijuana. Also, there are no acts of indecency allowed on Seshroulette, where the rules warn that transgressors “will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.” \n \n “I am yet to see a penis on my site,” Dan told me. “And if I or one of my users does, I encourage them to contact me via the tools on the website to make sure we can get rid of them immediately.” \n \n He used a clone script to “strike while the iron was hot” and launched Seshroulette nearly overnight.

33,"['Photo: KUVP archives \n \n The Black Hills mountain range, which stretches from South Dakota to Wyoming, is known for its lush forests, scenic waterfalls, and dense, intricate cave systems. But 150 million years ago, humongous, long-necked dinosaurs called sauropods roamed there—and scientists just identified one of their colossal, fossilized feet. \n \n \n \n The nearly complete foot fossil, made up of 13 bones, was unearthed in 1998 from a body of rock spanning multiple states called the Morrison Formation. That area has produced a wealth of dinosaur fossils from the Late Jurassic Period, or between 155 million to 148 million years ago. Scientists there have dug up diplodocuses, allosauruses, stegosauruses—the list goes on. The staggering amount of fossils there, compared to the available scientists to examine them, is why it took two decades to identify this massive foot. \n \n Advertisement \n \n The foot seems to have belonged to some kind of brachiosaur that stretched 80 feet long, the researchers wrote in their paper published Tuesday in PeerJ. To figure that out, they used a 3D scanning technique to make computerized images of the foot bones, and compared them to other sauropod foot fossils. \n \n “It very likely is a type of brachiosaur, the kind that got famous in Jurassic Park (and then got horribly murdered in Fallen Kingdom),” Femke Holwerda, a study-author and paleontologist at the Bavarian State Collection of Paleontology and Geology, told Gizmodo via email. “The only problem is that feet can rarely be diagnostic down to species level, hence the assignment to brachiosaur and not to any specific species.” \n \n The same dig site where this foot was unearthed in northeastern Wyoming also contained a separate, smaller, nearly complete brachiosaur, and a handful of other long-necked dinosaurs like diplodocuses and camarasaurs. The research team was surprised to see a brachiosaur that far north, because the animals had been thought to occupy much smaller, more southern chunks of land. \n \n Advertisement \n \n “This brachiosaur showing up in Black Hills in Wyoming brings up some questions,” says David Burnham, a paleontologist at the University of Kansas who worked on the paper. “Is it a different species than the brachiosaurs down south? Or maybe they were migrating north to south? It’s several hundreds of miles from where we thought these guys were, so we have a lot of new questions. It’s great—I welcome the new questions and opportunities for further research.” \n \n Illustration: Nobu Tamura (Wikimedia Commons) \n \n Still, the huge brachiosaur foot is notable for more than just its surprising location. At just under a meter wide, the researchers said it is the largest sauropod foot ever discovered. Philip Mannion, a paleontologist at Imperial College London who wasn’t involved with this discovery, agreed with that assessment. \n \n \n \n Advertisement \n \n “The metatarsals do seem to be longer than those of any other known sauropod dinosaur, so in that regard this is probably the largest foot ever discovered,” Mannion told Gizmodo. “There are other species with feet that aren’t much smaller, though.” \n \n \n \n Plus, as Mannion and the study authors point out, we’ve never found the feet of the world’s largest sauropods, the titanosaur and argentinosaurus, who would surely surpass this brachiosaur in foot size. We haven’t seen those dinosaurs’ feet yet because foot fossils are notoriously elusive, according to study author Anthony Maltese, a paleontologist at the Rocky Mountain Dinosaur Resource Center in Colorado. Throughout history, they’ve had a much higher chance of being lost in waterways or eaten by scavengers because they’re so small compared to the rest of the animal. That makes the most recent discovery an especially exciting one. \n \n “It’s great to finally have a brachiosaurus foot,” Elizabeth Freedman Fowler, a paleontologist at Dickinson State University who wasn’t involved with this work, told Gizmodo. “Getting a decently complete foot for any dinosaur is a lucky find. As we keep digging and finding more bones, we are getting an idea of just how huge each dinosaur species can truly grow. I think we are going to keep breaking the record for ‘biggest’ over and over for many years to come.” \n \n Advertisement \n \n [PeerJ]', 'The largest dinosaur foot ever found, belonging to one of the largest land animals this planet\'s ever seen, surely deserves the title ""Bigfoot"" more than Sasquatch. \n \n Excavated in 1998 by an expedition from the University of Kansas, and described in a new study published in PeerJ – the Journal of Life and Environmental Sciences, ""Bigfoot"" was discovered in the Black Hills area of Wyoming. Scientists determined the dinosaur — a very close relative of Brachiosaurus — had the biggest feet of any sauropod, and roamed the area 150 million years ago. \n \n Crew member Anthony Maltese, who is also the lead author of the study, writes that the foot was nearly 1 meter wide. It didn\'t belong to the largest dinosaur ever discovered, the study said, but ""Bigfoot"" did have particularly large feet. \n \n Maltese and his team of researchers from the U.S., Switzerland, and Germany have identified the enormous foot as belonging to an animal related to Brachiosaurus, a member of the sauropod family — you know, the dinosaurs with the long necks and tails. It\'s not only the largest sauropod foot ever identified, but also the first confirmed brachiosaur foot from the Late Jurassic period of North America. \n \n A rendering of Brachiosaurus-araucaria, or ""Bigfoot.""

Maltese and team members Emanuel Tschopp, Femke Holwerda, and David Burnham used 3D scanning and highly detailed measurements to compare the large specimen to various species of sauropod, including Camarasaurus and Diplodocus. \n \n By comparing elements of the foot — like metatarsals and phalanges — with existing examples, the scientists determined it was neither of those two, but more likely that of a brachiosaurid. \n \n And there\'s still plenty to discover. Maltese said in a press statement that the rock outcrops that produced this fossil hold many more ""fantastic dinosaur skeletons,"" and that the research team will press on with their studies from there. \n \n Personally, I\'d like to know if ""Bigfoot"" sneezed as dramatically as the Brachiosaurus in Jurassic Park.', 'As it turns out, ""Bigfoot"" was a dinosaur--a giant, plant-eating one. A new study based on fossils excavated in Wyoming reveals the largest dinosaur foot ever found and identifies it as a brachiosaur, a type of sauropod dinosaur that was among the largest land animals on Earth. The work, published today in the journal PeerJ, also confirms that 150 million years ago brachiosaurs called a huge swath of North America home. \n \n ""There are tracks and other incomplete skeletons from Australia and Argentina that seem to be from even bigger animals, but those gigantic skeletons were found without the feet. This beast was clearly one of the biggest that ever walked in North America,"" said co-author Emanuel Tschopp, a Theodore Roosevelt Richard Gilder Graduate School postdoctoral fellow in the American Museum of Natural History\'s Division of Paleontology and author on the new PeerJ study. \n \n The foot was excavated in 1998 by an expedition team from the University of Kansas which included Anthony Maltese, now at the Rocky Mountain Dinosaur Resource Center in Woodland Park, Colorado. \n \n ""It was immediately apparent that the foot, nearly a meter wide, was from an extremely large animal, so the specimen was nicknamed \'Bigfoot,\'"" said Maltese, lead author of the study. \n \n Now, after thorough preparation and examination, Maltese, Tschopp, and collaborators have identified the foot as belonging to an animal very closely related to the long-necked, long-tailed sauropod Brachiosaurus, best known as the sauropod featured in the movie Jurassic Park. The researchers used 3D scanning and detailed measurements to compare the specimen to feet from numerous dinosaur species. Their research confirms that this foot is the largest dinosaur foot discovered to date. \n \n The study also shows that brachiosaurs inhabited a huge area from eastern Utah to northwestern Wyoming. \n \n ""This is surprising,"" Tschopp said. ""Many other sauropod dinosaurs seem to have inhabited smaller areas during that time."" \n \n The rock outcrops that produced this fossil--the Black Hills region of Wyoming, famous today for tourist attractions like Deadwood and Mount Rushmore--hold many more fantastic dinosaur skeletons, says Maltese.

[Titanosaur Photos: Meet the Largest Dinosaur on Record] \n \n Researchers found the jumbo-size foot fossils in 1998, buried underneath the tail of a long-necked Camarasaurus dinosaur. These fossils are part of the Morrison Formation — a rocky expanse known for its Late Jurassic period fossils, especially its sauropods (long-necked herbivorous dinosaurs that walked on all fours), such as Diplodocus, Brachiosaurus and Apatosaurus. Though the scientists aren\'t sure what species the fossils came from, it\'s likely a close relative of Brachiosaurus, which made a cameo in the 1993 film ""Jurassic Park."" \n \n A Brachiosaurus nibbles from an Araucaria tree. These dinosaurs had enormous necks and relatively short tails. The newly described dinosaur was likely a close relative of Brachiosaurus. Credit: Copyright Davide Bonadonna, Milan, Italy \n \n During the dig, the paleontologists found ""several individuals of various ages and from at least three different species,"" Tschopp said. ""This foot definitely belonged to the largest individual preserved in this quarry, but unfortunately, nothing else of it was found."" \n \n The foot — a left hindfoot — was so massive that the paleontologists from the 1998 dig nicknamed it ""Bigfoot."" But despite its gargantuan size, the foot hadn\'t been described in detail until now, said lead study researcher Anthony Maltese, curator of the Rocky Mountain Dinosaur Resource Center in Woodland Park, Colorado, who also took part in the 1998 excavation. \n \n To investigate, Maltese and his colleagues used a 3D-scanning technique to take precise measurements of the mystery dinosaur\'s foot and then compared those with the foot bones of other sauropods. They found that the beast was closely related to Brachiosaurus and that it likely stood about a whopping 13 feet (4 m) tall at the hip. \n \n Given the dinosaur\'s fantastic foot size, it\'s safe to call it a titanosaur — the largest group of sauropod dinosaurs — which includes the 122-foot-long (37 m) Patagotitan and the 115-foot-long (35 m) Argentinosaurus. \n \n The newly described foot bones are slightly larger than those of the long-necked Giraffatitan sauropod dinosaur and ""considerably larger than those of Dreadnoughtus, which was reported to be one of the largest sauropods ever found."" Even so, it\'s by no means the largest dinosaur on record, the researchers wrote in the study. That\'s because foot size doesn\'t directly equate to body size. \n \n ""Some of the largest sauropods such as Argentinosaurus or Patagotitan do not preserve pedal [foot] material, but have femur lengths that considerably exceed our estimate for [the newly discovered dinosaur],"" the researchers wrote in the study. For instance, the mystery dinosaur has an estimated femur length of 6.7 feet (2 m), while Argentinosaurus had a femur length of 8.3 feet (2.5 m) and Patagotitan\'s was 7.7 feet (2.3 m), the researchers said. \n \n The finding also reveals that large brachiosaurs and their close relatives inhabited huge geographical swaths 150 million years ago, from eastern Utah to northwestern Wyoming. \n \n ""This is surprising,"" Tschopp said in a statement. ""Many other sauropod dinosaurs seem to have inhabited smaller areas during that time."" \n \n The study was published online today (July 24) in the Journal of Life and Environmental Sciences. \n \n Original article on Live Science.']",4,"– ""Bigfoot"" has been found, just not the apish version. An international team of paleontologists has announced the discovery of the largest known dinosaur foot, which belonged to a close relative of the Brachiosaurus now dubbed ""Bigfoot."" Appropriately so, as a nearly complete left hind-foot fossil totaling 13 bones, found two decades ago in the Black Hills area of Wyoming alongside separate and smaller brachiosaur remains, shows the 80-foot-long sauropod had feet that were about 3 feet wide, report Live Science and Gizmodo. ""There are tracks and other incomplete skeletons from Australia and Argentina that seem to be from even bigger animals, but those gigantic skeletons were found without the feet,"" researcher Emanuel Tschopp explains in a release. Described in journal PeerJ, ""this beast was clearly one of the biggest that ever walked in North America."" Researchers, who compared the foot to those of other dino species, believe it came from a brachiosaur that lived 150 million years ago, making it the first brachiosaur foot known to come from North America's Late Jurassic Period, per Mashable. Though it's not enough to identify a specific species, it's evidence that brachiosaurs covered a larger area of North America, from eastern Utah to northwestern Wyoming, than previously known. ""This is surprising"" as ""many other sauropod dinosaurs seem to have inhabited smaller areas,"" Tschopp says. Noting the discovery occurred ""several hundreds of miles from where we thought these guys were,"" fellow researcher David Burnham will look to answer new questions: ""Is it a different species than the brachiosaurs down south? Or maybe they were migrating north to south?"" (These tire-sized dino prints hid in plain sight.)"

Stormy Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, is suing President Donald Trump and wants a California judge to invalidate a nondisclosure agreement she signed... (Associated Press) \n \n LOS ANGELES (AP) — An adult film actress who has said she had sex with Donald Trump filed a lawsuit seeking to invalidate a nondisclosure agreement and ""set the record straight,"" her lawyer said Wednesday. \n \n Stormy Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles County Superior Court on Tuesday. She alleges that the agreement she signed days before the 2016 presidential election, which prevented her from discussing the alleged sexual encounters, is ""null and void and of no consequence"" because Trump didn\'t personally sign it. \n \n Her lawyer, Michael Avenatti, said on morning news shows Wednesday that she wants ""to set the record straight."" He said on NBC there was ""no question"" Trump knew about the agreement, though he did not offer any proof. \n \n Avenatti said Clifford wasn\'t looking to profit from her story. But he told CBS: ""I don\'t know whether she\'s going to ultimately seek payment or not."" \n \n Clifford initially claimed she had sex with Trump once and then carried on a subsequent yearslong platonic relationship. \n \n But the lawsuit filed Tuesday refers to her beginning an ""intimate relationship"" with Trump in 2006 that continued ""well into the year 2007."" She said the relationship included encounters in Lake Tahoe, Nevada, and Beverly Hills, California. Trump married his current wife, Melania Trump, in 2005. \n \n She also has also previously denied through a lawyer that the two had an affair, but Avenatti said Wednesday that was to meet the terms of the nondisclosure agreement. Trump\'s attorney Michael Cohen has denied there was ever an affair. \n \n Cohen has said he paid the porn actress $130,000 out of his own pocket as part of the agreement. He has also said that ""neither the Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign was a party to the transaction with Ms. Clifford, and neither reimbursed me for the payment, either directly or indirectly."" \n \n The lawsuit charges that the Oct. 28, 2016, ""hush agreement"" is legally invalid because it was only signed by Clifford and Cohen. The agreement refers to Trump as David Dennison and Clifford as Peggy Peterson, but an attached exhibit details their true identities. \n \n On Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said Trump has ""made very well clear that none of these allegations are true."" \n \n ""The president has denied the allegations against him and again this case has already been won in arbitration,"" Sanders said. \n \n Sanders declined to elaborate and referred additional questions to Cohen, who did not respond to requests for comment on Tuesday and Wednesday. \n \n An arbitrator in California issued a temporary restraining order last week that barred Clifford from disclosing any confidential information tied to the nondisclosure agreement or details about the arbitration hearing, according to a copy of the order that was obtained by NBC News. \n \n Clifford\'s lawsuit alleges that Cohen had ""surreptitiously initiated a bogus arbitration proceeding"" against Clifford and within the last week used an ""improper and procedurally defective arbitration proceeding hidden from public view."" \n \n The suit also charges that Trump and Cohen ""aggressively sought to silence Ms. Clifford as part of an effort to avoid her telling the truth, thus helping to ensure he won the Presidential Election."" \n \n ""To be clear, the attempts to intimidate Ms. Clifford into silence and \'shut her up\' in order to \'protect Mr. Trump\' continue unabated,"" the lawsuit said. Clifford alleges that as recently as last week, Trump\'s attorney tried to initiate an arbitration proceeding against her. \n \n ___ \n \n Lucey reported from Washington. Associated Press writer Jill Colvin in Washington contributed to this report.', 'Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. \n \n / Updated By Sarah Fitzpatrick \n \n President Donald Trump\'s lawyer is trying to silence adult-film star Stormy Daniels, obtaining a secret restraining order in a private arbitration proceeding and warning that she will face penalties if she publicly discusses a relationship with the president, NBC News has learned. \n \n The new pressure on Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, comes a day after she filed a lawsuit in a Los Angeles court alleging that a nondisclosure agreement she made to keep quiet about an ""intimate"" relationship with Trump is invalid because he never signed it. \n \n Tuesday\'s lawsuit says that Trump attorney Michael Cohen — who brokered the agreement with Clifford during the presidential campaign — attempted to ""intimidate"" Clifford and ""shut her up"" by initiating what it calls a ""bogus arbitration proceeding"" against her in Los Angeles on Feb. 27. \n \n On that day, Cohen obtained a temporary restraining order against Clifford from the private arbitrator, a retired judge, which bars her from disclosing ""confidential information"" related to the nondisclosure agreement signed in October 2016, according to a copy of the order obtained by NBC News. \n \n Read the temporary restraining order against Stormy Daniels \n \n On Feb. 28, Cohen emailed the restraining order to Clifford\'s former attorney, Keith Davidson. ""The document itself is to remain confidential and not to be disclosed to anyone as per the terms of the judge\'s order,"" the email, obtained by NBC News, said. \n \n Reached for comment late Wednesday afternoon, Clifford\'s current attorney, Michael Avenatti, said Cohen, through his own attorney, Lawrence Rosen, has made further attempts to enforce the order and caution Clifford that she is subject to damages if she talks about Trump. \n \n ""Earlier today, Mr. Cohen through his attorney, Mr. Rosen, further threatened my client in an effort to prevent her from telling the truth about what really happened,"" Avenatti said. ""We do not take kindly to these threats, nor we will be intimidated."" \n \n Cohen and Rosen did not immediately respond to requests for comment from NBC News. \n \n But Rosen, who has represented Trump and his companies in the past, said in a statement to other media outlets that the agreement with Clifford contained an arbitration clause with permission to ""seek an injunction in the event of a breach or threatened breach of the agreement."" \n \n “The designated judge from the arbitration tribunal found that Ms. Clifford had violated the agreement and enjoined her from, among other things, filing this lawsuit,"" Rosen said in the statement. \n \n White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a press briefing Wednesday that Trump denies ""all of these allegations"" — that he had an affair with Clifford more than a decade ago or that he knew Cohen had paid her $130,000. \n \n ""I have had conversations with the president about this and as I outlined earlier, this case had already been won in arbitration,"" Sanders said. It\'s unclear what Sanders was referring to; Trump is not listed as a party on the restraining order issued by the arbitration judge. \n \n Asked about that comment, Avenatti quipped, ""Yeah, and he won the popular vote, too."" \n \n Analysis: Stormy Daniels isn\'t suing Donald Trump for cash \n \n “President Trump hasn’t won anything relating to Ms. Clifford,"" he added. \n \n ""First of all, it does not appear as if he was even a party to the arbitration Ms. Sanders is referring to. How can you win something you’re not even a part of? Secondly, claiming that Mr. Trump ‘won’ at arbitration when there has been no hearing, no notice to Ms. Clifford, no opportunity given to her to respond, and no decision on the merits, is completely bogus."" \n \n Earlier on Wednesday, Avenatti told ""Today"" that Clifford\'s lawsuit, if successful, would allow his client to ""tell her story."" \n \n ""She believes it\'s important that the public learn the truth about what happened,"" he said. ""I think it\'s time for her to tell her story and for the public to decide who is telling the truth."" \n \n The suit asks a California court to affirm that the agreement Clifford signed is invalid. \n \n The ""hush agreement,"" as it\'s called in the suit, refers to Clifford as Peggy Peterson and another individual as David Dennison. In one of the documents, the true identity of Dennison is blacked out, but Avenatti said the individual is Trump. \n \n Clifford signed both the agreement and a side letter agreement using her professional name on Oct. 28, 2016, just days before the 2016 presidential election. Cohen signed the document the same day. Both agreements were appended to the lawsuit as Exhibit 1 and Exhibit 2. \n \n Each document includes a blank where ""DD"" is supposed to sign, but neither blank is signed. \n \n Clifford and Trump had an intimate relationship that lasted from the summer of 2006 ""well into the year 2007,"" and meetings in Lake Tahoe and at the Beverly Hills Hotel, the lawsuit alleges. In the past, Cohen has said the president denies there was ever a relationship. \n \n The lawsuit says that Cohen — who says he used his personal funds to facilitate a payment to Clifford — has been trying to scare the actress into not talking. \n \n ""To be clear, the attempts to intimidate Ms. Clifford into silence and \'shut her up\' in order to \'protect Mr. Trump\' continue unabated,"" says the suit. ""On or about February 27, 2018, Mr. Trump\'s attorney Mr. Cohen surreptitiously initiated a bogus arbitration proceeding against Ms. Clifford in Los Angeles."" \n \n The nondisclosure agreement said any further dispute would be resolved by binding arbitration ""to the greatest extent permitted by law."" \n \n If the agreement is void because Trump didn\'t sign it, as Clifford argues, the arbitration clause would also be unenforceable.', 'Mark Thompson, the BBC\'s director general, is gaining a reputation as something of a rottweiler as he slashes into the corporation\'s staffing structure. \n \n Yesterday this image took on a physical manifestation when allegations emerged that, when he was editor of the Nine O\'Clock News, Mr Thompson sank his teeth into the arms of a colleague in a canine-like display of workplace frustration. \n \n The BBC yesterday played down the incident, which has been the subject of frenzied gossip within the BBC as the story was passed around by email this week, as ""high jinks and horseplay"". \n \n But Mr Thompson\'s victim, a junior member of staff who went on to be Kate Adie\'s producer, has disclosed that he considered making a formal complaint about the incident at the time. \n \n The story emerged because Jeremy Paxman, the Newsnight presenter, was preparing to interview Mr Thompson for an internal BBC event and emailed the producer to ask if the incident - the subject of apocryphal tales in the corporation\'s newsroom - really happened. The producer, Anthony Massey, replied in florid terms. \n \n ""It was late summer or early autumn of 1988 when he [Thompson] was the newly appointed editor of the Nine O\'Clock News, and I was a Home News Organiser. It was 9.15 in the morning, in the middle of the old sixth floor newsroom. \n \n ""I went up to his desk to talk about some story after the 9.00 meeting we used to have then. I was standing next to him on his right, and he was sitting reading his horoscope in the Daily Star (I always remember that detail). \n \n ""Before I could say a word he suddenly turned, snarled, and sank his teeth into my left upper arm (leaving marks through the shirt, but not drawing blood). It hurt. I pulled my arm out of his jaws, like a stick out of the jaws of a labrador."" \n \n Massey told his then boss, Chris Cramer, now a senior CNN executive, that he wanted to ""bring the whole BBC disciplinary process"" against Mr Thompson, but the incident ""lost momentum"" when Mr Massey was sent on a month-long assignment abroad. \n \n Paxman, in his reply, said he found the tale extraordinary. ""If any of this came out, he\'d be toast,"" he wrote of Thompson. \n \n Mr Massey passed the email exchange with Paxman to a friend, who passed it to other colleagues in the BBC, and it was quickly forwarded to scores of people, and leaked to the Guardian. \n \n Today Mr Massey was refusing to comment: ""I\'m afraid I cannot help."" But the BBC, concerned that it might be seen to victimise the producer for what it admitted was ""just gossip"" that was never intended for publication, said there would be no recriminations and that Mr Massey was expected to turn up for work as normal last night. \n \n After speaking to Mr Thompson, a BBC spokesman confirmed there had been an incident, but attempted to play down the story. \n \n ""There was an incident 17 years ago when Mark was editor of the Nine O\'Clock News. Mark would have been about 30. There was a pretty robust atmosphere in the newsroom then. There was a lot of horseplay. People can recollect there were rows about allocation of camera crews. \n \n ""There was some high jinks going on and Mark leant forward and did something like a biting gesture. He thought it would be quite funny and it would defuse things but clearly it was hugely misinterpreted. \n \n ""Then he walked off, thinking nothing of it. Somebody went up to Mark and said that Anthony had taken it the wrong way. Mark apologised. \n \n ""Our view is that it was a long time ago, there was an apology at the time, and it was high jinks and horseplay."" \n \n · To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediaguardian.co.uk or phone 020 7239 9857 \n \n · If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly ""for publication"".', 'HOUSTON - For decades, United Airlines has boasted ""come fly the friendly skies of United,"" but in April, video of Dr. David Dao being dragged off a United flight in Chicago went viral. \n \n When Dao refused to give up his seat onboard an overbooked flight, security officers began dragging him down the aisle and off the plane in front of horrified passengers. \n \n Now, Channel 2 Investigates has obtained video of another physical confrontation between United employees and a 71-year-old Houston man at Bush Intercontinental Airport in 2015. That man has filed a lawsuit. \n \n VIDEO: Full airport surveillance video of United worker pushing Houston passenger to ground \n \n ""This is just one of the most inhumane things I\'ve ever seen in my life,"" attorney William Hoke said. \n \n In the video, recorded on a surveillance camera at the airport, Ronald Tigner -- a frequent flyer, father and grandfather -- is shown being pushed to the ground by a United Airlines customer service rep, right in front of the United ticket counter. \n \n After hitting his head on the ground, Tigner lies motionless with his arms splayed out and yet not one United employee bothers to bend down and talk to him. \n \n ""He violently shoves a 71-year-old man to the ground,"" Hoke said. \n \n ""Was your client knocked unconscious?

""And he tells Anastasia to wipe that smile off his face. That\'s when Anastasia says, \'I\'ll kick your (expletives)\' and shoves Tigner to the ground."" \n \n Anastasia was later charged with the felony crime of injury to an elderly individual, ordered to pay a fine, write a letter of apology and attend anger-management classes. \n \n He was fired after the incident, according to United. \n \n Alejandro Nestor Anstasia \n \n Channel 2 Investigates went to Anastasia\'s home, but no one answered the door. \n \n ""Mr. Anastasia, what would possess you to throw a 71-year-old man to the floor?""

The temporary Feb. 27 order, obtained in a private arbitration meeting with a retired judge, prohibits Daniels (whose real name is Stephanie Clifford) from discussing ""confidential information"" related to the nondisclosure agreement she signed in Oct. 2016, NBC News reports. Daniels' lawyer tells NBC that Cohen has continued to make efforts to silence Daniels via ""threats"" and ""intimidation"" since the order was procured, warning her she is subject to damages should she talk. In her lawsuit against Trump attempting to have the NDA declared invalid, filed Tuesday, Daniels refers to a ""bogus,"" ""improper and procedurally defective arbitration proceeding hidden from public view,"" the AP reports. Cohen's own attorney says the NDA Daniels signed included an arbitration clause with permission to ""seek an injunction in the event of a breach or threatened breach of the agreement,"" and that ""the designated judge from the arbitration tribunal found that Ms. Clifford had violated the agreement and enjoined her from, among other things, filing [her lawsuit against Trump]."" Also Wednesday, White House rep Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that Trump denies ""all of these allegations""—both the affair and any knowledge of Cohen's $130,000 payment to Daniels—and that ""this case [has] already been won in arbitration."" Her exact meaning was not clear, as Trump is not listed as a party on the restraining order, and CNN's Chris Cillizza notes several of Sanders' ""non-answers"" skirt the issue of whether Trump knew about the hush money.

The Huffington Post cites a passage in the Runaways’ 2013 band biography: “They can talk about it until the cows come home but, in my mind, I didn’t make love to anybody in the Runaways nor did they make love to me.” \n \n Fuchs left the group in 1977.

36,"['T \n \n he most likely person to replace retiring Sen. Jim DeMint (R-S.C.), at least according to early political prognostications, is Rep. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), a black conservative first elected in the Tea Party wave of 2010. DeMint reportedly favors Scott to replace him, other conservatives love him, and he appears to have a good relationship with the only person who matters, Gov. Nikki Haley (R-S.C.). (Haley will handpick a senator who will serve until an election is held in 2014.) But almost as soon as Scott\'s name popped up, another South Carolina native was roped in: Stephen Colbert. \n \n The ubiquitous mock Twitter feed, @ColbertforSC, appeared almost immediately after DeMint shocked Capitol Hill with the announcement that he\'s jumping ship to head up the Heritage Foundation. But Colbert didn\'t exactly run away from the encouragement. ""Stephen is honored by the groundswell of support from the Palmetto State and looks forward to Governor Haley\'s call,"" says his personal publicist, Carrie Byalick. And on his own (real) Twitter feed, Colbert just fed the speculation: \n \n Tweet @nikkihaley & tell her why I belong in the US Senate. For one, I wouldn\'t just block legislation, I\'d body-check it! #SenatorColbert — Stephen Colbert (@StephenAtHome) December 7, 2012 \n \n Conservatives are throwing cold water on the idea, though perhaps a little defensively. ""Colbert and his supporters are likely destined for disappointment in getting the host appointed to fill DeMint\'s seat,"" says Madeleine Morgenstern at Glenn Beck\'s site The Blaze. ""Haley, a Republican, will make the call and is no doubt familiar with Colbert\'s bombastic, faux-conservative stage personality."" \n \n But it\'s not entirely implausible that Colbert could make a strong run for the seat in the 2014 election. He\'s ""made no secret of his desire to hold higher office,"" having staged mostly satirical runs for the White House in 2008 and 2012, notes Andy Kroll at Mother Jones. Plus, he has a real-life, bona fide super PAC, Americans for a Better Tomorrow, Tomorrow, which he transformed into a dark-money nonprofit, Colbert Super-PAC SHH! ""Colbert would have had a tough road in the primaries,"" both Democratic and Republican, says David Graham at The Atlantic. But a Senator Colbert isn\'t impossible, and it would certainly shake up Washington. ""Consider it, Governor Haley."" \n \n Colbert is a comedian, but he does dabble in real politics — he appeared before Congress to testify about campaign finance, and he\'s appeared at a fake rally in South Carolina with real presidential hopeful Herman Cain. And he has up to $900,000 left in super PAC money that would go a long way in a ""run for national office as a senator from the state that calls him its \'favorite son,\'"" says Ross Luippold at The Huffington Post. ""There\'s one problem, though: Colbert can\'t actually serve in the Senate."" His contract with Comedy Central isn\'t up until 2014, after the special election. Oh well, ""we certainly hope he has some fun in the meantime.""', 'Stephen Colbert has launched a Twitter campaign to get South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley to appoint him to replace Sen. Jim DeMint, who announced he was quitting Thursday. And the problem is not that Colbert isn\'t qualified. It\'s that he\'s too qualified. \n \n ""Let\'s see, you need someone young, someone conservative, someone from South Carolina, maybe someone who had a super PAC?"" Colbert said on The Colbert Report Thursday night, as his left hand tried to smother his right. Sure. But let\'s be real. What you need to be a senator these days is the ability to ""say words good on the TV."" Colbert says words too good. Instead of displaying talking points-style discipline during interviews, he engages in spontaneous riffing. Worse, Colbert has a skill set that is way to broad for the Senate. He appears to speaks Latin nearly fluently. He studied philosophy in college. His favorite book is not nearly down-to-earth or biblical enough — it\'s Lord of the Rings. He believes that science is real, at least given the number of scientists he books on his show. He told New York magazine in 2007 that he loves Richard Nixon — but not for the appropriate reasons, like that Nixon got really good at winning presidential elections. Instead, Colbert loves Nixon\'s policy: ""He started the EPA. He opened China. He gave 18-year-olds the vote. His issues were education, drugs, women, minorities, youth involvement, ending the draft, and improving the environment. John Kerry couldn’t have run on this! What would I give for a Nixon?"" \n \n Think about the man Colbert would be replacing. Jim DeMint might be quitting to run a think tank, but he\'s no thinker, according to The Washington Post\'s Jennifer Rubin, a conservative blogger. Rubin writes: \n \n Even DeMint would not claim to be a serious scholar. He is a pol. He’s a pol whose entire style of conservatism – all or nothing, no compromise, no accounting for changes in public habits and opinions — is not true to the tradition of Edmund Burke, Russell Kirk and others... Every individual who works [at Heritage] should take pause and consider whether the reputation of that institution is elevated or diminished by this move. And I would say the same, frankly, if any other non-scholarly pol took that spot. \n \n Colbert is a nerd. We can\'t waste his brains in the Senate. \n \n Looks like it\'s still Tim Scott\'s seat to lose after all. \n \n Want to add to this story?

Tim Scott, but another South Carolinian has thrown his rather high-profile hat into the ring: one Stephen Colbert, reports the New York Post.

Nikki Haley to pick him, noting, ""I wouldn't just block legislation, I'd bodycheck it!"" “Stephen is honored by the groundswell of support from the Palmetto State and looks forward to Governor Haley’s call,” says a Colbert publicist. Sure, Colbert would face a lot of resistance from more, uh, enthusiastic Republicans—Madeleine Morgenstern, for example, called Colbert a ""bombastic, faux-conservative,"" notes the Week. But Colbert is a strong Catholic who loves Richard Nixon, says the Atlantic, which proclaims him ""vastly overqualified."" Even so, he shouldn't hold his breath: Nikki Haley swung back via Facebook today, reports CNN: ""Stephen, thank you for your interest in South Carolina's US Senate seat and for the thousands of tweets you and your fans sent me,"" she said.

""We understand this may be seen as an extraordinary step, but believe it was the best option to avoid taking focus away from the game on such an important night for our franchise,"" the Spirit said in a statement, referencing its last regular-season home game that could help earn it a first-place slot.

Rapinoe, for her part, said after the game she was ""saddened"" by the song subterfuge and called it ""f---ing unbelievable"" and ""incredibly distasteful, four days before [the anniversary of] one of the worst tragedies in our country, to say I tried to hijack this event."" One other person not aware in advance of the Spirit's plans, per the Post: National Women's Soccer League Commissioner Jeff Plush, who says he was ""disappointed"" by Lynch's move.

39,"['Katharine Brown was one of David O. Selznick’s most trusted employees. Her job—and it was a 24-hour-a-day one—was to scour New York’s publishing circles and sniff out unproduced properties that her hard-driving boss could spin into box-office gold. As the mercurial, 34-year-old movie mogul’s official East Coast story editor and unofficial gal Friday/arbiter of good taste, Brown needed to have lightning-quick instincts and the thick hide of an elephant. After all, Selznick was notoriously demanding and infamous for his short-fused three a.m. phone calls. It wasn’t easy keeping pace with a mind that whirred as feverishly as Selznick’s. But Brown was one of the few movie executives who could keep up. \n \n On the afternoon of May 20, 1936, she fired off an urgent Teletype to her employer. The message read: “ . . . have just airmailed detailed synopsis of Gone with the Wind by Margaret Mitchell, also a copy of the book . . . This is an absolutely magnificent story . . . a great literary property and we must have it . . . The book is 1,000 pages long and I have only gotten through half of it, it is one of the most lush things I have ever read . . . I am absolutely off my nut about this book . . . I beg, urge, coax and plead with you to read it at once . . . I know that after you do you will drop everything and buy it.” \n \n In fact, Selznick did not drop everything after reading Gone with the Wind. He didn’t even crack its imposing spine. Instead, he relied on the 150-page synopsis that Brown had given him, poring over it while on vacation in Honolulu. Selznick knew that the success of adapting Mitchell’s novel would depend on casting. Even though he was a compulsive gambler who lived to place exorbitantly large bets—whether in the boardroom or at the horse track—he balked at the book’s rich $50,000 price tag. But like all gamblers, he lived in a constant state of fear that someone else might rake in a pot that he felt rightfully belonged to him. He wasn’t sure he wanted Gone with the Wind, but he was certain that he didn’t want anyone else to have it. \n \n So after several weeks of hemming and hawing, on July 6, 1936, Selznick finally relented to Brown’s impassioned pleas, opened his checkbook and paid a king’s ransom for the movie rights. It would be the easiest decision and the most incident-free moment of the next three years.', 'A City banker died as a result of neglect following a heart operation at a leading private hospital, an inquest ruled. \n \n Robert Entenman, 57, died when the humidifier was turned off for 18 hours at London Bridge Hospital by a nurse who believed it would help cool him down, the hearing was told. \n \n The humidifier was switched off by nurse Priyan Bastian after Mr Entenman complained about the heat in his room at the hospital because the air conditioning had broken. \n \n Southwark Coroner\'s Court heard the piece of equipment, which prevents the build up of mucus in the ventilator pipe, was switched off for 18 hours. \n \n Coroner Henrietta Hill QC concluded at the end of the five-day hearing that the failure to provide Mr Entenman with the humidifier amounted to neglect. \n \n She also found delays by medical staff in identifying the tube had been blocked played a causative role in his death. \n \n American-born Mr Entenman, who had lived in Britain for more than 30 years, had successfully come through the operation on May 15 last year. \n \n He was global head of e-commerce for Uni-Credit Bank in the City, but suffered from mitral valve disease, type 2 diabetes, arthritis in the hip and back and had a BMI of 42. \n \n The inquest heard his recovery was making progress in the private hospital\'s intensive care unit, and was on a ventilator for almost the entire time. \n \n But eight days after his operation he went into respiratory cardiac arrest after one of the ventilator pipes, the endotracheal tube (ET tube), became blocked by a ""dark brown solid mucus plug"" preventing oxygen from getting to the lungs.']",2,"– It's been 75 years since Gone With the Wind was released—and given the many hurdles to its production, it's kind of amazing that it ever was. In Entertainment Weekly, Chris Nashawaty tells the story of the film's making, which centered on producer David Selznick. He was at first reluctant to make the film, despite a glowing review of the book by one of his employees. ""I am absolutely off my nut about this book,"" Katharine Brown wrote, finally convincing him to take action. But plenty got in the way. Among the challenges: The first writer dropped out after spending months on the script. After a number of other writers tried their hand, including Selznick himself, writer Ben Hecht took it on, but there was no time for him to read Margaret Mitchell's book. So Selznick and director Victor Fleming ""stayed up all night acting out the story for him."" Clark Gable was under contract to Selznick's father-in-law, who finally ""loaned"" him to Selznick, with plenty of strings attached—and Gable wasn't thrilled about it. Original director George Cukor didn't get along with Gable and was eventually replaced by Fleming, who didn't get along with Vivien Leigh. ""Leigh hated Fleming. With a passion. Fleming hated her. Clark Gable hated David … Everybody hated David,"" an assistant said. Fleming quit before returning. Ultimately, the film required ""125 days of photography, 37 months of preparation, half a million feet of film and a budget of $4.25 million (at a time when the average feature cost less than $1 million),"" Nashawaty writes. And the trouble was far from over: Racism plagued the various premieres, with black cast members in many cases banned from attending, the Los Angeles Times reports. That prompted anger from Selznick, the AP reports; Gable, meanwhile, had already stood against segregated toilets on set, threatening to bail on the film, according to a Life magazine book cited by the Times. Ultimately, however, ""Selznick kept that film together,"" says a film scholar, and it still holds the record for domestic box-office gross, adjusted for inflation, the Times notes (and you can bet it's a lot better than the current crop of big-grossing films)."

More problematically, what does it mean for a corporation to assert ownership of a language that has at least one native speaker (who may or may not have rated this amazing crib) and many more who speak it daily as a second conversational language, hosting learned workshops on their chosen language. \n \n Paramount also asserts a copyright in the designs of Klingon ships and ""spacedocks,"" citing a controversial 2015 ruling that held that the Batmobile was a ""character"" and subject to copyright restrictions. \n \n However, Paramount and CBS disagree (bIlughbe’*). In their reply the rightsholders call the argument absurd and among other things, they point out that the language system is not very useful if there are no real Klingons to communicate with. “This argument is absurd, since a language is only useful if it can be used to communicate with people, and there are no Klingons with whom to communicate,” they write (full filing: pdf). “Defendants’ use of the Klingon language in their works is simply further evidence of their infringement of Plaintiffs’ characters, since speaking this fictitious language is an aspect of their characters.” \n \n PARAMOUNT: WE OWN THE KLINGON LANGUAGE [Ernesto/Torrentfreak] \n \n report this ad', 'Cookies on Pottermore \n \n We use cookies to give you the very best experience on the Pottermore website and to allow you to make use of all our site features.

Thus Paramount Pictures hopes to prosper as it wages a legal battle with the makers of popular Kickstarter crowdfunded Star Trek fan film Prelude to Axanar. Paramount claims the film's use of the fictional language Klingon adds up to copyright infringement; the filmmakers contend that attempting to copyright Klingon is absurd given the language is an ""idea or a system."" For legal precedent, they cite the system of bookkeeping: ""Although copyright protects the author’s expression of the system, it does not prevent others from using the system."" But there's doesn't appear to be a quick and easy answer. The US Copyright Office doesn't specifically ""deal with the copyrightability of constructed or fictional languages, let alone Klingon,"" observes Consumerist, which was unable to dig up much in the way of case law on the matter. Paramount, which claims exclusive ownership over many Star Trek features, including characters, themes, plots, dialogue, settings, props, character makeup, costumes, sets, fictional language, and so forth, has responded to the filmmakers' plea by noting that ""a language is only useful if it can be used to communicate with people, and there are no Klingons with whom to communicate,"" reports TorrentFreak. By allowing the characters in Prelude to speak Klingon, they assert, the film is infringing on Paramount's characters because speaking the language ""is an aspect of their characters."" The jury's still out, but Boing Boing goes so far as to call this Paramount's attempt to ""kill"" the film, and it frames Paramount's claims as ""dubious,"" in part because it borrows phonemes (from Hindi, Arabic, etc.) as well as grammar (from Japanese, Turkish, etc.)—not to mention it's spoken by many fans around the world.

""I know I\'m more in touch with what she needs now...She takes one sort of thing and she clumps it [and says] that\'s what happens all the time in our relationship. It\'s not really true."" \n \n As the chat progressed, Arquette got even more frank (and despairing) with Cox: ""I think you\'re over it, baby. You just need to admit it and we just need to figure out next steps."" \n \n PHOTOS: Heartbreaking Hollywood splits \n \n ""Wow, that\'s heavy,"" she said. ""You can\'t count [Disney World] as the place where you know I\'m not into you. I had just woken up. I don\'t think [sexual attraction] is the issue.

Actually, that’s an exaggeration. One of you might know that Shia LaBeouf still makes films. \n \n Man Down, LaBeouf’s new film, opened in the UK last week, and its opening weekend theatrical gross was £7. Not £7m. Not even £700. But a mere £7. Given that an adult ticket in my non-London cinema costs £12.60, it is safe to assume that the only person who saw Man Down last weekend was a solitary toddler with an NUS card who somehow qualifies for a state pension. Admittedly, the film was only shown in one cinema, in Burnley, before it was given a wider VOD release. Still, it probably took less than the projectionist at the cinema earned while it was on. \n \n Shia LaBeouf's new film makes £7 at UK box office, as Beauty and the Beast holds sway Read more \n \n If you can afford Man Down the luxury of not adjusting for inflation, its opening weekend gross puts it level with the 2004 Polish drama My Nikifor, which also made only £7. But LaBeouf should take heart: some of the world’s biggest stars (and Danny Dyer) have had to endure at swing and a miss at the UK box office. Here are some others. \n \n Run for Your Wife (2013): £602 \n \n Run for Your Wife begins with a Rolf Harris cameo and goes downhill from there. It has a tedious plot, a bad cast, is ineptly filmed and contains a theme tune so abject you have to assume it was recorded by a sociopath. It is – and this is saying something – the worst film Danny Dyer has made. It only scraped £602 on its opening weekend, but my guess is that the few dozen people who paid to see it left the cinema disappointed. \n \n Dark Tide (2012): £90 \n \n Dark Tide is a bad Halle Berry film. It isn’t the bad Halle Berry film where she plays a limp leisurewear superhero. Or the bad Halle Berry film where she plays an office temp who is also a vigilante super-detective. It isn’t the bad Halle Berry movie where she murders scores of innocent people in pursuit of an abducted child. Or the bad Halle Berry film where she does something extremely NSFW with a turkey baster full of hot sauce. No, this is the bad Halle Berry movie where she plays a shark whisperer, who develops a phobia of sharks but still leads a pack of shark hunters to a place called Shark Alley. You could say it did badly (the BFI lists its opening weekend gross at just £90) – but I’d argue it didn’t do badly enough. \n \n Motherhood (2010): £88 \n \n Motherhood was a $5m-movie starring Uma Thurman, who at that point was an A-list actor, albeit one on the wane. It made less than £100, causing the film critic Barry Norman to exclaim: “Good God. I have never heard of anything like this before.” There are plenty of possible explanations for why Motherhood failed so catastrophically – lack of promotion, the distributor’s lack of confidence – but the most likely reason is that it’s an insufferably middle-class whine stuffed into the clothing of a weak romcom. \n \n The Colony (2016): £47 \n \n Hands up who wants to see Emma Watson play a German lady from 1973 battling against a preacher and possible child molester who indirectly works for Augusto Pinochet? No? What if I told you that, despite all this, Watson keeps her plummy British accent? Still no? Well, what if I told you that Empire called it a “grotesque miscalculation that disrespects the memory of those who perished in one of the darkest episodes in recent history”? Nope? Never mind. The Colony opened for one daily matinee screening in Hull, Widnes and Burnley, and even then nobody bothered to watch it. \n \n The Chumscrubber (2005): £36 \n \n Even though it starred Ralph Fiennes, Glenn Close, Jamie Bell and Allison Janney – and cost $10m to make – only a handful of British viewers saw The Chumscrubber in a cinema. Maybe that’s because people just weren’t in the mood for a comedy-drama about suicide that particular weekend. Or maybe it’s because nobody wanted to say the word ‘chumscrubber’ out loud. Either way, nobody remembers that the film was ever made.""]",2,"– Things to look forward to in 2011: all-natural Frito-Lay chips, a bunch of truly unnecessary movie sequels, and … the world’s 7 billionth living person. That lucky baby will arrive sometime next year, according to the UN Population Reference Bureau, writes Bryan Walsh for Time. The world’s 6 billionth living person was born just 11 years ago in Bosnia, and the population is expected to exceed 9 billion by the middle of the century. Can the planet really handle that? Robert Kunzig attempts to take on that question in a very lengthy National Geographic cover story (worth a read). Walsh picks out a few highlights: Kunzig calls out attention to the fact that it took nearly all of human history to get us to the 1 billion mark, but we're set to explode from 3 billion to 7 billion in about 50 years. By 2050, we'll be somewhere between 8 billion and 10.5 billion, according to the UN. Space isn't the issue. Kunzig notes that if 9 billion people were spread throughout Earth's habitable regions, the population density would be half of that in France. The potential problems: Not enough food, water, energy. And a lot of aging people. Writes Kunzig, ""Fixating on population numbers is not the best way to confront the future. The number of people does matter, of course. But how people consume resources matters a lot more ... It’s too late to keep the new middle class of 2030 from being born; it’s not too late to change how they and the rest of us will produce and consume food and energy."""
46,"['The producer Dino De Laurentiis, a loopy genius who knew a thing or two about big-screen great apes, once said of his own 1976 King Kong star, ""When the monkey die, people gonna cry."" Fortunately, the monkey in Jordan Vogt-Roberts\' exhilarating and pleasingly strange fantasy-adventure Kong: Skull Island doesn\'t suffer the same fate. Instead, this Kong looms large as a protector of the weak and a steward of the natural world. He\'s the king of all he surveys. As in the original, that\'s a mysterious, lost-in-time island, one that an ambitious explorer--played by John Goodman, in full wheeling-dealing mode--is hell-bent on exposing to the world. \n \n Tagging along are valiant combat photographer Mason Weaver (Brie Larson , radiant in that 1970s Bonne Bell no-makeup way) and studly-but-elegant soldier of fortune James Conrad (played by studly-but-elegant Tom Hiddleston ). There\'s also a military escort, led by an army officer spoiling for a fight, played by Samuel L. Jackson--it\'s 1973, in the waning days of the Vietnam conflict, and he\'s still smarting from the effects of a war that couldn\'t be won. His bad attitude spells trouble, especially when he crosses a certain beast of distinction. \n \n MORE 5 Photos That Show How King Kong Revolutionized Movie Special Effects \n \n Kong: Skull Island isn\'t a remake of an earlier King Kong movie, but more of a reimagining. If this Kong has one problem, it\'s this: there are too many humans. The sprawling ensemble includes a duo of science types (Corey Hawkins and Jing Tian) and a gaggle of soldiers, the most distinctive among them played by Toby Kebbell. (Kebbell portrayed a motion-capture primate in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes --he contributed a few facial expressions to Kong\'s repertoire in this film, but the character is played chiefly by movement coach Terry Notary.) \n \n Kong: Skull Island is still great fun, if occasionally in a slightly sadistic way. Some scenes, featuring prehistoric-type critters chomping on humans, may be too intense for really little kids. But for big kids, why not? Vogt-Roberts--who has worked extensively in TV, on shows like You\'re the Worst and Single Dads --has both a sense of humor and an understanding of what we want from a creature feature. The picture is grand and nutty and visually splendid: Vogt-Roberts knows he\'s gotta go big or go home, so he treads boldly, even channeling an Apocalypse Now vibe when military choppers whirl, with ill intent, over Kong\'s tropical paradise. \n \n Vogt-Roberts knows what to do with actors too. John C. Reilly is wonderful as Hank Marlow, a World War II pilot who\'s been stranded on the island for years, living contentedly but somewhat forlornly among its natives, a tribe of sober, generous, silent people. (Vogt-Roberts gives them a resplendent entrance: their painted faces and bodies emerge, trompe l\'oeil--style, from a formation of similarly decorated rocks.) Marlow is only slightly off his rocker; mostly he\'s a whiskery, mellow charmer. When he gets a gander at pretty photographer Mason, he tells her, solemnly, ""You are more beautiful than a hot dog and a can of beer at Wrigley Field on opening day,"" his eyes glowing like state-fair pinwheels. \n \n But there can be only one king of Kong: Skull Island , and you already know who that is. This Kong protects the humans of his island--the deserving ones, that is--from its many dangers. Striding through this neverland\'s lush dream-world foliage, he\'s the principal dancer in his own primeval ballet, leathery of chest and furry of butt. His brow is broad, flat and noble. His eyes hold both the warmth and sadness of a million suns, or maybe just the memory of the giant banana he may have eaten for breakfast--but no matter what, he\'s the movie\'s soulful center. Kong lives. But he still might make you cry.', '‘Kong: Skull Island’ a fun return to the ape’s stomping ground \n \n We just won’t leave Kong enough alone, will we? \n \n For some 80 years now, through movie after movie after movie, the giant ape has been minding his own giant ape business on Skull Island. But then some pesky humans show up and try to capture him or tame him or kill him or otherwise mess with him, and the next thing you know the big guy is swatting away aircraft, roaring up a storm and defending his turf while developing a real resentment for the little pests in clothes — with the exception of the occasional sympathetic blonde who catches his eye, of course. \n \n “Kong: Skull Island” plays like a mash-up of “Apocalypse Now,” “Hamburger Hill,” “Congo,” “Jurassic Park,” even “The African Queen” — with a couple of elements so ridiculous they could have been borrowed from a “Gilligan’s Island” episode. \n \n It’s wildly entertaining and it has a sense of humor about itself — and it doesn’t hurt when a great big monster movie features an A-list cast including John Goodman, Samuel L. Jackson, Brie Larson, Tom Hiddleston and John C. Reilly. They’re all in a really expensive B-movie and it seems like they’re having a heckuva time fighting the good green-screen fight against all manner of lethal creatures on Skull Island. \n \n Director Jordan Vogt-Roberts and the team of screenwriters set this version of “Kong” in the summer of 1973, just as direct U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War is coming to end. This isn’t just some arbitrary device; the war and how it affected those who fought it (and those who fought against it) is a constant theme in “Skull Island.” \n \n The opening half hour or so feels like more like a Vietnam film than a monster movie, with the soundtrack blasting classic rock staples such as “White Rabbit,” “Run Through the Jungle,” “Long Cool Woman in a Black Dress” and “Paranoid,” as the main characters are introduced and the mission to Skull Island is set in motion. \n \n John Goodman’s Bill Randa is an old-school secret ops conspiracy theorist near the end of his career. With anti-war protests raging in the streets of the capital, Randa remarks to an associate, “Mark my words, there’ll never be a more screwed-up time in Washington,” and yes, that line is destined to elicit big-time laughs. \n \n Randa secures funding for a fact-finding mission to the mysterious Skull Island. The team includes a military escort led by Lt. Colonel Packard (Samuel L. Jackson), who is still seething with anger over the U.S. pulling out of Vietnam; Capt. Conrad (Tom Hiddleston), the obligatory former black ops legend now working for himself, and combat photographer Mason Weaver (Brie Larson), who is along for the ride because, hey, we need Brie Larson along for this ride. \n \n Director Vogt-Roberts, cinematographer Larry Fong and the special-effects wizards produce some remarkable visuals during the arrival at Skull Island, with helicopters swooping in formation, attention-grabbing slow-motion moments, and perfectly timed moments of comedic relief followed by the shocking (and pretty rough for PG-13) violence. It’s great stuff. \n \n Oddly enough, once we settle in for the Kong part of the movie, “Skull Island” isn’t quite as entertaining or edgy. It turns into a full-fledged monster movie, as the exploration team quickly learns the enormous monkey is just one of the astonishing and deadly creatures inhabiting the island. Relax for a second, and you could be consumed or crushed by a huge spider or a gigantic lizard thingy or a squid the size of a ship — or maybe you’ll be plucked off the ground and torn apart by a flock of prehistoric-looking birds! \n \n As Col. Packard starts going full Col. Kurtz, obsessed with his mission against all odds and logic, Capt. Conrad and Mason the Photographer and a few others stumble upon one Hank Marlow (John C. Reilly), a World War II pilot from Chicago who has been stranded on Skull Island for nearly 30 years. (“Have the Cubs won the World Series yet?” asks Hank.) \n \n The stuff with Hank is beyond goofy — but Reilly plays the comic relief role to the hilt, firing off a few terrific one-liners. By that point, “Skull Island” has lost its sense of menace and has gone a little soft, even as a few supporting characters meet some pretty grisly deaths. (As usual, the MPAA’s ratings board is much more forgiving about multiple gruesome killings than language or nudity when it comes to handing out a PG-13.) \n \n Hiddleston is solid as an old-fashioned, dashing leading man. Larson is wonderful as the plucky Mason. Jackson and Goodman are as reliable as Jackson and Goodman always are, in just about any genre. \n \n As for King Kong: he might have to look for another address, because for being so mysterious and secretive and elusive, Skull Island sure brings in a lot of nosy tourists. \n \n ★★★ \n \n Warner Brothers presents a film directed by Jordan Vogt-Roberts and written by Dan Gilroy, Max Borenstein and Derek Connolly. Rated PG-13 (for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action, and for brief strong language). Running time: 118 minutes. Opens Friday at local theaters.', 'Kong: Skull Island is, reportedly, a reboot of the original King Kong from 1933. At the same time, it features a ton of dinosaurs and prehistoric creepy-crawlies in a not-so-subtle nod to Jurassic Park (1993). The presence of helicopters, napalm, psychedelic rock and two characters named Conrad and Marlow mean you might equally consider it a remix of Apocalypse Now (1979) or its source material, Heart of Darkness. I also caught trace elements of Flight of the Phoenix (2004) and Tora! Tora! Tora! (1970). The resulting film bears some relation to the menu at my local Chinese restaurant, which lists “soup with sweetcorn,” “soup with noodles” and “soup with egg drop"" before reaching—with an air of summary exasperation or exhaustion—“soup with everything.” That’s pretty much what we get here: soup with everything. \n \n We start in Washington, D.C., where a bearish conspiracy nut (John Goodman, naturally) is petitioning his senator for money to explore an island in the South Pacific with his team of geologists. He is granted the protection of a full Army helicopter squadron, loaded to the gills with napalm and machine guns, led by an irascible lieutenant (Samuel L. Jackson) fresh from the fields of Vietnam. The whole movie is set in 1973, quite possibly because the filmmakers judged it to be the one period so whacked-out on drugs that nobody would raise any objection to the plot. Also along for the ride are a British Special Air Service officer and jungle survival expert (Tom Hiddleston) and a magazine photographer (Brie Larson). “Isn’t this a little small for a Time photographer?” Hiddleston asks her. “How did British special forces get dragged into this?” Larson asks him. When half your characters devote most of their screen time to exploring the motivations of the other half, you know something is amiss. \n \n How difficult can it be to get people to go to explore an island? But then the film, which was directed by Jordan Vogt-Roberts from a script by Dan Gilroy and Max Borenstein, is driven less by curiosity about exploring the great unknown than by an urgent need to have everyone arrive at the threshold of the great unknown, guns drawn, and start blasting. The film begins where most Kong movies end: with the giant ape swatting aircraft from the skies as if they were flies. \n \n And so the team is stranded, as Goodman puts it, on Skull Island, “a place where myth and science meet.” Or as I came to think of it, the land where backstory goes to die. Everyone has to fight through great thickets of prehistory, and not just the dinosaurs. Equally Jurassic is the wild-eyed, shaggy-bearded pilot (John C. Reilly) whom the team discovers in the jungle, where he’s been lurking since World War II . Then there is Kong himself, orphaned at a young age after giant lizards eat his parents, engaged ever since in a prolonged but unsuccessful battle with his rage issues. What he should really do is book himself a ticket to New York, head for the Upper West Side and find himself a good therapist, but as its title suggests, Kong: Skull Island is as hung up on Kong’s island as on the great ape himself. We get a full flora and fauna report, including ants, spiders, lizards and squid. It’s like a version of Superman that can’t work up the puff to get out of Smallville. \n \n The original was a fable about American colonialism, as well as a Beauty and the Beast love story about the ultimate romantic martyr, but Larson snatches just one brief, swoony moment with Kong. This is a combat picture, pure and simple, led from the front by Jackson, who glimpses his nemesis through great plumes of fire, clenches his teeth and vows, “This is one war we’re not going to lose.” The visuals have a high ick factor (intestines pulled through mouths, vomited skulls) but sometimes attain a nutty pop grandeur: I loved the sight of Hiddleston wearing a gas mask, using a samurai sword to slice his way through a flock of pterodactyls in a purple haze. Far out. Jimi Hendrix would dig it. \n \n It’s the usual story: a lopsided mixture of mega-blast effects and a script that hasn\'t worked out what opposable thumbs are for. “This is beyond us,” says Reilly, stealing every scene in sight with daffy riffs about gods and monsters, like Dennis Hopper’s gadfly photographer in Apocalypse Now. You’d say he was the comic relief, except Kong: Skull Island can’t seem to manage seriousness in the first place. Quit monkeying around.']",3,"– A team sets out to explore a mysterious island in the aftermath of the Vietnam War and soon discovers the fist of a massive monkey in Kong: Skull Island. It might be a familiar story, but critics are mostly applauding Jordan Vogt-Roberts' telling. Here's what they’re saying: Richard Roeper calls it a ""wildly entertaining"" B-movie with an A-list cast. Among its best qualities are ""remarkable visuals"" and ""perfectly timed moments of comedic relief,"" he writes at the Chicago Sun-Times. For those who want it, there's ""shocking violence,"" too, yet the film also ""has a sense of humor about itself,"" Roeper says. ""It's great stuff."" For a film that takes inspiration from Apocalypse Now, Kong: Skull Island is ""surprisingly fun and fresh,"" writes Katie Walsh at the Tribune News Service. But though ""never boring,"" it also ""never sits still,"" a fault Walsh blames on too many characters. Samuel L. Jackson's Col. Packard isn't one she'd be willing to lose, though. He's ""riveting."" Tom Shone was not on the same page. Here's ""the usual story: a lopsided mixture of mega-blast effects and a script that hasn't worked out what opposable thumbs are for,"" he writes at Newsweek. Thank goodness for John C. Reilly ""stealing every scene,"" he adds. ""You'd say he was the comic relief, except Kong: Skull Island can't seem to manage seriousness in the first place. Quit monkeying around."" Stephanie Zacharek agrees Reilly is ""wonderful,"" but that's not all she has to admire. ""Vogt-Roberts knows he's gotta go big or go home, so he treads boldly."" The result is a film that's ""great fun"" as well as ""grand and nutty and visually splendid,"" she writes at Time. The real star, however, is Kong. ""He's the movie's soulful center"" and might even ""make you cry."""

Media requires JavaScript to play. \n \n Fresh attempts to evacuate two wounded Western journalists from Homs in Syria have failed, the Red Cross says. \n \n Vehicles from the Syrian Red Crescent reached the besieged suburb of Baba Amr, but left without them. \n \n Frenchwoman Edith Bouvier would not board vehicles, reports said, and other evacuees, including UK photographer Paul Conroy, stayed in solidarity. \n \n Earlier, Syrian forces launched fresh attacks on a number of towns, reports say, with dozens more people killed. \n \n The Local Co-ordination Committees (LCC), an activists\' group which organises and documents protests, said a total of 125 people had died across Syria, many of them in a single incident at a checkpoint in Homs - although there has been no independent verification of this. \n \n Broken leg \n \n Reports on Monday evening said the Syrian Red Crescent had managed to regain access to Baba Amr but officials later confirmed they had left without the journalists. \n \n Three Syrians, including a pregnant Syrian woman, her husband, and an elderly female patient, were moved to safety. \n \n Continue reading the main story At the scene The bombardment has started in Binnish, which for the past week has been under the control of the opposition. The Free Syrian Army and the Syrian Liberation Army are based in this town. We know that a government offensive has been taking place in the nearby city of Idlib. The townspeople have become increasingly concerned that the troops would then turn their attention to Binnish. That is what has happened this morning. We were woken to the sound of artillery bombardment. There is gunfire in the distance. We believe they are using anti-aircraft weapons against the town, and also setting up mortar positions. This is a town of about 40,000 people and although there are militiamen belonging to the Free Syrian Army and other groups, this has not been a military situation. From what we can tell, the bombardment is entirely random and is not targeting specific individuals. This seems to be part of a wider government offensive that is taking place in the north of the country, to regain control of opposition areas. \n \n Ms Bouvier suffered a broken leg and Mr Conroy was hit by shrapnel in the leg and stomach in an attack last Wednesday that claimed the lives of American Sunday Times journalist Marie Colvin and French photographer Remi Ochlik. \n \n It had been hoped that the bodies of the two dead journalists would be brought out during the same mission, but this also failed. \n \n The BBC\'s Jim Muir reports from neighbouring Beirut that Ms Bouvier refused to board the Red Crescent vehicles, and the others stayed behind out of solidarity. \n \n Paul Conroy\'s wife said on Sunday that her husband had rejected an earlier opportunity to leave Homs with the Syrian Red Crescent as the photographer had been advised that they were ""not to be trusted"". \n \n And the UK\'s International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell told the BBC there was evidence of people on the ground ""infiltrating the Syrian Red Crescent"" and ""posing an additional danger"" to injured people seeking to leave Homs. \n \n Meanwhile, the LCC said 15 people had been killed in the Idlib area, nine in the Aleppo area, and several in the suburbs of Damascus. \n \n Several towns in Idlib came under army assault for the first time, reports said. \n \n BBC correspondent Ian Pannell, who is in northern Syria, says troops fired artillery, mortars and anti-aircraft guns at Binnish and other towns on Monday. \n \n Binnish has been under the control of the Free Syrian Army and the Syrian Liberation Army for the past week. \n \n Our correspondent says the bombardment, which began in the early morning, appeared to be entirely random, hitting civilian areas rather than targeting rebel positions. \n \n The towns of Sarmin and Maarat al-Numan were also hit, reports said, along with the town of Qusayr, nine miles (15km) outside Homs. \n \n Weapons call \n \n As the crackdown intensified, the European Union imposed further sanctions on Syria. \n \n They include: \n \n a freeze on the European-held assets of the Syrian central bank \n \n travel bans on seven close associates of President Bashar al-Assad \n \n a ban on cargo flights from Syria into the EU \n \n restrictions on the trade in gold and precious metals \n \n UK Foreign Secretary William Hague welcomed the fresh sanctions. \n \n ""We will continue working closely with our EU partners to support the Arab League and its plan to end the violence in Syria and bring about a Syrian-led transition to a peaceful and more open political system,"" he said. \n \n Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. \n \n Qatar Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani said the international community should do ""whatever necessary"" to help the Syrian opposition, ""including giving them weapons to defend themselves"". \n \n ""I think they\'re right to defend themselves with weapons and I think we should help these people by all means,"" he added. \n \n Syrian state television has meanwhile announced the results of a referendum on a new constitution, which was dismissed by opposition activists and the West as a sham. \n \n The poll showed around 89% support for the proposal, the report said, on a turnout of just over 57%.', 'Image caption Paul Conroy was smuggled across the border into Lebanon and is said to be in good spirits. \n \n Injured British journalist Paul Conroy has been rescued from the Syrian city of Homs, but the whereabouts of French reporter Edith Bouvier remain unclear. \n \n French President Nicolas Sarkozy has withdrawn an earlier statement that she was also safely in Lebanon. \n \n The severely-injured Ms Bouvier is believed to have left Homs with Mr Conroy, but there are reports the rescue convoy was shelled. \n \n The UN meanwhile says more than 7,500 people have now died in the crackdown. \n \n UN human rights chief Navi Pillay said atrocities against civilians were being committed, and she had received reports that ""massive campaigns of arrests"" by Syrian troops against rebels had deprived many civilians of food, water and medical supplies. \n \n Her comments came at an emergency meeting of the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) in Geneva, which renewed calls for a humanitarian ceasefire. \n \n Syria\'s representative to the UN, Faysal Khabbaz Hamoui, stormed out of the session, accusing countries of ""inciting sectarianism and providing arms"". \n \n Analysis The confusion surrounding the whereabouts of the wounded French reporter Edith Bouvier - and President Sarkozy\'s embarrassing admission that he had got it wrong in saying she had crossed safely into Lebanon - illustrate both the complications and the extreme dangers surrounding efforts to bring the trapped western journalists to safety. Necessarily, any attempt to extricate them has to be surrounded with secrecy, especially if it involves smuggling them across the Baba Amr battlefront and then the tense and dangerous terrain between Homs and the Lebanese border. From several accounts, the four journalists - Paul Conroy, Edith Bouvier, William Daniels and Javier Espinosa - came under shellfire as they were trying to escape, and the group got broken up. The one certain thing is that Paul Conroy managed to make it across the border, with the help of the activists guiding him. The Avaaz group, which played a role in the operation, said many activists died while escorting the journalists, who will clearly have their own dramatic story to tell. The whereabouts of the missing three journalists remains unclear, though some relatives and other sources believe they may still be trapped in Baba Amr under shellfire. \n \n Reports on Tuesday said Homs had come under some of its heaviest bombardment yet, with the government sending in units of an elite armoured division into rebel-held districts. \n \n President Sarkozy\'s statement on the campaign trail that Ms Bouvier had reached safety came after nearly 24 hours of confusion over the journalist\'s fate. He later withdrew the statement, describing the situation as unclear and complex. \n \n ""It has not been confirmed that she is in safety in Lebanon,"" he told journalists in Montpellier. ""Communications with Homs are very difficult."" \n \n The BBC\'s Jim Muir in Beirut says confusion remains over Ms Bouvier\'s location. \n \n Campaign group Avaaz said it had co-ordinated an operation to free the wounded journalists and two trapped colleagues, and some of the activists involved had died in the process. \n \n Avaaz executive director Ricken Patel said the rescue group had been split in two by shelling after leaving Homs, and only Mr Conroy\'s group had been able to move forward. \n \n Avaaz described the three other journalists - Ms Bouvier, Javier Espinosa from Spain and Frenchman William Daniels - as ""unaccounted for"". \n \n Mr Conroy was apparently able to walk across the border into Lebanon during the night, but our correspondent adds that the more seriously wounded Ms Bouvier would have had to be carried on a stretcher. \n \n Both journalists were hurt in the attack in which journalists Marie Colvin and Remi Ochlik died. There has been no word on what has happened to their bodies. \n \n Mr Conroy\'s brother Alan said the family still did not know where he was. \n \n ""When we\'ve heard him on the phone or he turns up on the doorstep, then we\'ll be very happy,"" he said. ""He\'s a very strong character anyway. He\'ll cope."" \n \n \'War criminal\' \n \n In Washington, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has said that President Bashar al-Assad fits the definition of a war criminal. \n \n Campaign group Avaaz in Syria Says it co-ordinated rescue attempt of Paul Conroy, Edith Bouvier and two other journalists from Homs \n \n Has set up a network of citizen journalists and smuggled in foreign journalists \n \n Claims to have delivered more than $1.8m of medical equipment to the worst-hit areas \n \n Has helped collect and verify information on the scale of the crackdown on dissent \n \n She told a Senate hearing that an argument could be made for declaring the Syrian leader a war criminal. \n \n Mrs Clinton added that such an action would complicate the chances of finding a solution to the violence - and tended to make it harder to persuade a leader to stand down. \n \n As many as 125 people died across Syria on Monday, many of them in a single incident at a checkpoint in Homs, the activists\' network the LCC said. \n \n Sixty-five more were killed on Tuesday, it said. Death tolls remain very hard to verify as media access across the country is tightly restricted. \n \n The emergency session of the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) discussed a confidential report delivered by a UN panel of experts that lists Syrian army officers and government officials who could be investigated for crimes against humanity. \n \n French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe has urged the 47 nations in the council to be prepared to submit a complaint against Syria to the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague. \n \n ""The task of the council is to express the disgust of the entire world at the odious crimes that the Syrian state is committing against its people,"" he said. \n \n But the meeting is unlikely to bring about any change from the government in Damascus which is currently fighting for its survival, says the BBC\'s Jim Muir, in Beirut. \n \n It is more likely to put pressure on countries such as Russia and China, which have opposed any international action against Syria, he adds.']",2,"– At least 144 people were killed yesterday in the latest Syrian violence, including some 64 slaughtered in a ""horrifying massacre"" at a single checkpoint in Homs province, according to witnesses. But the government has no plans to end its attacks on citizens. Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moallem vowed to ""defend"" his country. ""We are not happy to see brothers killing each other,"" he said. ""This is our country. But we will defend our sovereignty and independence,"" he told reporters. The scores killed at the checkpoint were attempting to flee shelling in the city of Homs. Security forces and thugs kidnapped the women among them, and killed the men, sources told CNN. They were either shot or stabbed to death. The killings occurred as Syrian officials announced that the nation's new draft constitution was overwhelmingly approved by voters, and the European Union imposed new sanctions. US officials dismiss the constitution vote ""as absolutely cynical,"" said State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland. What Basahr al-Assad has done ""is put a piece of paper that he controls to a vote that he controls so that he can try and maintain control."" In other Syrian news, the BBC earlier reported that French reporter Edith Bouvier refused to board a Red Cross vehicle that managed to enter besieged Baba Amr, and UK photographer Paul Conroy stayed behind in solidarity. But the BBC now reports that Conroy has indeed been smuggled out of the country; Bouvier's whereabouts are unknown."

(WANE) The Fort Wayne mother accused of killing her two children in the backseat of a stolen car in late September said she was spurred to action when she heard the Amber Alert issued to find her on the radio. “That’s when I went straight to Elkhart and that’s when I killed my kids,” said Pasztor. When asked why the Amber Alert was the impetus to smother her children Pasztor replied, “because I knew the police was gonna get us. And with me behind bars and my kids out here with all my problems; no. Sorry. No. I’m not that selfish. I’m not a coward.” \n \n Pasztor refused to offer details, but claimed she felt someone was going to harm her kids. She believed the only solution was to usher them on to heaven. She told NewsChannel 15 she didn’t have the heart to shoot them, so she smothered them. \n \n In an exclusive interview with NewsChannel 15’s Brett Thomas over video chat from the Elkhart County Jail on Monday, Amber Pasztor admitted to smothering her two children to death, one by one. Pasztor faces two charges of murder in Elkhart County for the deaths of 6-year-old Rene Pasztor and 7-year-old Liliana Hernandez – charges she said unequivocally she is guilty of. \n \n With a phone to her ear and speaking matter-of-factly, Pasztor told NewsChannel 15 how she pushed in the door of the home of her father, the legal guardian of the children, grabbed the children and put them into a stolen car, and just started driving. Pasztor said she was driving aimlessley when she received word that an Amber Alert had been issued. \n \n “They were in good hands but I don’t think they were safe,” Pasztor said. “My kids are in a better place … they’re in heaven now. They don’t have no worries no more.” \n \n Pasztor also admitted to fatally shooting her neighbor, 66-year-old Frank Macomber, in a ditch off Wallen Road in Fort Wayne. Pasztor has not been charged with Macomber’s death. \n \n Pasztor said she made the plan days beforehand, when she arranged to go camping with him and have sex with him. In a wooded area off Wallen Road, then, Pasztor said she shot Macomber with his own gun once, killing him, then took his car.

The events of the past several days have been deeply troubling for me, and I\'ve heard from many people at Apple who are saddened, outraged or confused. What occurred in Charlottesville has no place in our country. Hate is a cancer, and left unchecked it destroys everything in its path. Its scars last generations. History has taught us this time and time again, both in the United States and countries around the world. We must not witness or permit such hate and bigotry in our country, and we must be unequivocal about it. This is not about the left or the right, conservative or liberal. It is about human decency and morality. I disagree with the president and others who believe that there is a moral equivalence between white supremacists and Nazis, and those who oppose them by standing up for human rights. Equating the two runs counter to our ideals as Americans. Regardless of your political views, we must all stand together on this one point — that we are all equal. As a company, through our actions, our products and our voice, we will always work to ensure that everyone is treated equally and with respect. I believe Apple has led by example, and we\'re going to keep doing that. We have always welcomed people from every walk of life to our stores around the world and showed them that Apple is inclusive of everyone. We empower people to share their views and express themselves through our products. In the wake of the tragic and repulsive events in Charlottesville, we are stepping up to help organizations who work to rid our country of hate.

These stories get to the heart of the matter.', 'We cannot imagine Llewyn Davis happy. The self-defeating Sisyphus of the new film written, directed, and edited by Joel and Ethan Coen is the first person the viewer lays eyes on in the movie. Bearded, his unkempt hair falling in his eyes, he picks out some steely, blue notes on a guitar as he sings ""Hang Me, Oh Hang Me,"" not to be confused with ""Dang Me."" ""Wouldn\'t mind the hangin\', except for layin\' in the grave so long,"" he sings, with a good amount of sincerity. The time is 1961, the place is New York City, and the venue where Llewyn—portrayed with haunting conviction by Oscar Isaac, who, like everyone else in the cast, does his own singing and playing—is picking and not grinning is the Gaslight, a soon-to-be-legendary landmark in the ""folk revival."" \n \n Advertisement \n \n Llewyn, as talented as he is, does not look to be one of that revival\'s future success stories. Why? For one thing, he\'s the protagonist of a Coen brothers movie. For another, after he finishes his song, the place\'s glib, slick, runty owner Pappi, directs Llewyn outside to see a ""friend"" who\'s been asking for him. Outside Llewyn finds no friend, but instead a suited, fedora-sporting stranger who exchanges a few words with the singer before calmly kicking and punching the daylights out of him. \n \n And then Llewyn wakes up. And there\'s just the most adorable orange cat staring him in the face. \n \n ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" is the most satisfyingly diabolical cinematic structure that the Coens have ever contrived, and that\'s just one reason that I suspect it may be their best movie yet. How Llewyn inadvertently inherits, loses, then re-finds, and kind of adopts, the aforementioned cat is one of the more involved traps of the movie\'s plot, which may make the wary viewer, or the all-around anti-Coenite, suspect that this is some kind of exercise in auteurial sadism, a charge the brothers themselves laid themselves open to when they admitted that in concocting 2009\'s great ""A Serious Man"" they thoroughly enjoyed torturing their lead character. \n \n This movie—which can reasonably be described as feeling like a \'70s Wim Wenders picture scripted by Billy Wilder and/or Preston Sturges from a story by Terry Southern—is different. Yes, Llewyn is an incorrigible screw-up, having, among other things, impregnated a friend who also happens to be the wife of another friend, two halves of the very palatable-to-the-mainstream female/male singing duo Jean and Jim (Carey Mulligan and Justin Timberlake). He\'s kind of hard to like, given his surly defensiveness. \n \n Advertisement \n \n But this movie doesn\'t give the impression that he\'s someone his creators like to push around. Indeed, there\'s a sense of not-quite-grudging empathy going on here. There\'s a scene early on in which Llewyn\'s at the Gaslight watching a new act, a not-bad but pretty vanilla folkie named Troy Nelson (Stark Sands). Besides being an army guy, he\'s also taking up couch space at Llewyn\'s second-favorite crash pad. After his own song, Troy invites Jean and Jim up to sing with him, and they do a nice version of ""Five Hundred Miles."" Llewyn does his level best to enjoy them, but soon the audience starts singing along, and Llewyn furrows his brow a little and looks behind him with wordless incredulity. The place he thought he understood, the place he thought he was part of, is becoming alien to him. And he doesn\'t understand why. \n \n Well, he understands why a little bit. Like all of his associates in the movie, Llewyn is mourning a loss, a loss that has made him a solo act, a solo act with a box of unsold records and no winter coat as the days grow darker and shorter The chip on his shoulder is part of his new defense (who knows, maybe it\'s not new; the movie is cannily selective about revealing its back story), but he still thinks he\'s got something to prove. After defiantly telling his sister that, no, he won\'t be going back to the Merchant Marine for a stint at sea, he impulsively joins—with cat in tow—a dyspeptic, shambling jazz musician and his doggerel-mumbling beatnik ""valet"" (John Goodman and Garrett Hedlund, respectively) on an ill-fated road trip to Chicago. It\'s a pilgrimage of sorts, to present himself to a reigning folk impresario played by F. Murray Abraham. Dryly noting the title of Llewyn\'s solo record, this man requests, ""Play me something from \'Inside Llewyn Davis.\'"" And so Llewyn does. In both senses of the term. \n \n It\'s a devastating scene in a movie full of devastating scenes. And full of quick, devastating observations. There\'s a whole movie in one shot of Llewyn\'s left foot, which he just inadvertently plunged into an ice puddle, slipping out of its loafer as he sits at a diner counter and tries in vain to squeeze the freezing cold out of his soaked sock. The beautiful, cloud-gray and autumn-leaf ocher cinematography by Bruno Delbonnel doesn\'t just cast a mood, it conjures a mode of existence. Moving, funny (but not frivolous; the characters never turn into cartoons), brilliant, it\'s a rib-sticking movie that represents a new high for its creators.']",2,"– In 2011, Anne Ziegenhorn of Florida began to gain weight inexplicably. Normally healthy, the mother of two soon began suffering from burning pain, vision loss, and cloudy thinking and had sores all over her body. She writes that she was unable to talk for 8 months, instead texting and writing on a dry-erase board. She saw many doctors, certain that their diagnoses of lupus, arthritis, and thyroid problems must be wrong. Then she saw Dr. Susan Kolb, author of The Naked Truth About Breast Implants, who has implants herself and who suggested mold might be an issue. Sure enough, as soon as Ziegenhorn's saline breast implants were removed, her symptoms vanished. Wear TV reports Ziegenhorn keeps a video on her phone that shows what was once in her body: a mold-covered implant. (She believes her implant was leaking ""moldy fluid"" into her system for years.) She and another woman from Kentucky, Paula Blade, have teamed up to spread the word, reports WPSD Local 6. Blade's tale is a similar one, and she says that when her removed implants were tested, the implants' valve was found to be faulty, the ""filling fluid [was] grossly contaminated,"" and there were signs of mold. Dr. Kolb believes the mold can often be traced to defective valves (saline implants are put into the body deflated, and the saline is then inserted via the valve). While an FDA spokesman tells Wear TV that he's not aware of similar complaints being filed by women with moldy implants, he does note that most women will eventually need theirs replaced. Dr. Kolb, however, says she's treated thousands of patients with ""saline biotoxin illness"" and feels strongly that patients should have them changed every eight to 15 years. (This celeb had her saline implants removed due in part to health concerns.)"
56,"['The electrochemical conversion of CO 2 and H 2 O into liquid fuel is ideal for high-density renewable energy storage and could provide an incentive for CO 2 capture. However, efficient electrocatalysts for reducing CO 2 and its derivatives into a desirable fuel1,2,3 are not available at present. Although many catalysts4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11 can reduce CO 2 to carbon monoxide (CO), liquid fuel synthesis requires that CO is reduced further, using H 2 O as a H+ source. Copper (Cu) is the only known material with an appreciable CO electroreduction activity, but in bulk form its efficiency and selectivity for liquid fuel are far too low for practical use. In particular, H 2 O reduction to H 2 outcompetes CO reduction on Cu electrodes unless extreme overpotentials are applied, at which point gaseous hydrocarbons are the major CO reduction products12,13. Here we show that nanocrystalline Cu prepared from Cu 2 O (‘oxide-derived Cu’) produces multi-carbon oxygenates (ethanol, acetate and n-propanol) with up to 57% Faraday efficiency at modest potentials (–0.25 volts to –0.5 volts versus the reversible hydrogen electrode) in CO-saturated alkaline H 2 O. By comparison, when prepared by traditional vapour condensation, Cu nanoparticles with an average crystallite size similar to that of oxide-derived copper produce nearly exclusive H 2 (96% Faraday efficiency) under identical conditions. Our results demonstrate the ability to change the intrinsic catalytic properties of Cu for this notoriously difficult reaction by growing interconnected nanocrystallites from the constrained environment of an oxide lattice. The selectivity for oxygenates, with ethanol as the major product, demonstrates the feasibility of a two-step conversion of CO 2 to liquid fuel that could be powered by renewable electricity.', 'Scientists said on Wednesday they have developed a new way to make liquid ethanol efficiently without using corn or other crops needed in the conventional method for producing the biofuel. \n \n The scientists said their process turns carbon monoxide gas into liquid ethanol with the help of an electrode made of a form of copper.

They also say diverting corn and sugar to make biofuels pushes up food prices. \n \n The United States leads the world in ethanol production, with 13.3 billion gallons in 2013, followed by Brazil\'s 6.3 billion gallons, according to the Washington-based Renewable Fuels Association, which represents the U.S. ethanol industry. \n \n E85 ethanol fuel is pumped into a vehicle at a gas station in the town of Nevada, Iowa, on Dec. 6, 2007. Scientists say they have developed a new way to make liquid ethanol fuel in an efficient process that does not use corn or other crops. JASON REED / Reuters \n \n A group of scientists led by Stanford University chemist Matthew Kanan described the new method in research published in the journal Nature. Kanan said a prototype device could be ready in two to three years, enabling an assessment on whether the process can become commercially viable. \n \n ""I emphasize that these are just laboratory experiments today. We haven\'t built a device,"" Kanan said. ""But it demonstrates the feasibility of using electricity that you could get from a renewable energy source to power fuel synthesis — in this case ethanol. There are some real advantages to doing that relative to using biomass to produce ethanol."" \n \n Ethanol fuel generally is produced at high-temperature fermentation facilities that chemically transform corn, sugarcane and other plants into liquid fuel. \n \n Kanan and his colleagues built an electrochemical cell — a device consisting of two electrodes that were put in water saturated with carbon monoxide gas. One of the electrodes was made of a material they call ""oxide-derived copper."" \n \n When voltage was applied across the electrodes, the carbon monoxide gas was converted into ethanol, they said. \n \n The researchers hope to take carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and convert it to carbon monoxide, which then would be fed into the copper-oxide catalyst. The researchers hope the catalytic cell would be powered by a renewable energy source such as solar or wind. \n \n — Reuters', 'Today, nearly all ethanol fuel is made from corn or sugarcane, which requires vast tracts of land and huge quantities of water and fertilizer. Researchers at Stanford University have now developed an electrochemical process that could be far cheaper and better for the environment. \n \n The work is still experimental, but it’s significant because the group was able to synthesize ethanol and other desired products with so little energy input. “The levels of activity for CO reported here are unprecedented and a large step toward the realization of a practical system for converting CO to ethanol,” says Clifford Kubiak, professor of chemistry and biochemistry at the University of California, San Diego. \n \n The scientists created a copper-based catalyst that is very effective at producing ethanol and other carbon compounds from carbon monoxide and water in a simple chemical reaction. They say the process, described in a paper published in Nature on Wednesday, could be powered by renewable sources of electricity, such as solar and wind, and would be an alternative to traditional biofuel production. \n \n Making ethanol is normally remarkably energy-intensive, involving gathering and treating biomass and then fermenting the sugar found in the plant matter. The Stanford paper shows it’s feasible to produce ethanol directly from water and waste gases using an electric current. \n \n “You get the same fuel, although in principle it could be much more efficient because you are not relying on biomass,” says Matthew Kanan, an associate professor of chemistry at Stanford who co-authored the paper. \n \n The researchers envision a two-step process in which carbon dioxide is first converted into carbon monoxide using either existing processes or more energy-efficient ones currently under development. Then the carbon monoxide would be converted to ethanol or other carbon-based compounds electrochemically. \n \n Existing methods for turning carbon monoxide into fuel are complicated, requiring very large reactors and high pressures. An electrolyzer, which uses an electrical current to drive a chemical reaction, could make the required system much smaller, says Joel Rosenthal, an assistant professor at the University of Delaware. This could allow ethanol production to be miniaturized and distributed. \n \n One could image, for example, having a rooftop solar panel produce liquid fuel stored in a tank the size of a water heater. “The big value of chemical fuels in general, and liquid fuels in particular, is that they have much, much higher energy density than typical battery technologies, so you can store a lot more energy in a smaller amount of space,” Rosenthal says. \n \n Ib Chorkendorff, the director of the Catalysis for Sustainable Energy research center at the Technical University of Denmark, describes the work as “an important step towards the goal of finding an efficient route for storing electricity as chemical energy.” \n \n The key to the new catalyst is preparing the copper in a novel way that changes its molecular structure. Until now, copper catalysts produced a wide range of carbon-based compounds, rather than one desired product, and required a lot of energy. \n \n The Stanford group starts with copper metal and, by heating it in air, grows a layer of copper oxide on top. Then that surface layer is chemically converted back to metallic copper. In the process, the copper takes on a very different surface with more active area for it to act as a catalyst. \n \n It will take years to know whether a device based on this chemistry would be commercially viable. But if perfected, it could provide an economic incentive for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.', 'Facebook is aware of reports of disruption to its service in Egypt but said it had not seen any major changes in traffic from the Middle Eastern country. \n \n Egyptians had complained Facebook and Twitter and other sites were being blocked and mobile networks disrupted.

A group of scientists has published research in Nature detailing a new method of making ethanol out of carbon monoxide gas, instead of corn or sugarcane, Reuters reports. Researchers saturated water with the gas, then zapped it with a novel device featuring two electrodes, one made of what they're calling ""oxide-derived copper,"" to convert it into fuel. ""I emphasize that these are just laboratory experiments today,"" lead researcher Matthew Kanan says. He expects to have a prototype device ready in two to three years. The environmental implications are profound. Critics of ethanol say it drives up food prices and consumes loads of land and water. It can take more than 800 gallons of water to grow enough corn to make 3 gallons of ethanol, Phys.org points out. What's more, researchers envision a two-step process in which the carbon monoxide is derived from carbon dioxide in the air, providing an ""economic incentive"" for scrubbing carbon from the atmosphere, the MIT Technology Review reports. The new process could also work on a far smaller scale than biomass methods; the Review envisions rooftop solar panels generating fuel that's kept in water heater-sized tanks.

CEO Brian Kelley explained in an earnings call yesterday, per the Wall Street Journal. Seeking Alpha sees it as the anti-iPhone scenario: ""People are happy with the original and aren't interested for the most part in fixing what isn't broken."" But at the Washington Post, Fred Barbash lays out a different problem: the ""My K-Cup"" one. The coffee packaged into each K-Cup costs customers dearly: on a per pound basis, they spend up to $60, or roughly five times what they'd pay for a bag of Starbucks coffee. Enter the My K-Cup, a refillable option that freed consumers from the expense and brand limitations of Keurig's K-Cups. The problem? The K-Cups that worked in previous models (both those made by Keurig and its competitors) lack a special ink introduced for the 2.0. Those cups no longer work, and neither do My K-Cups; no new refillable option was introduced. The complaints came in short order. As a one-star Amazon review for the K550 2.0 puts it, ""If you want a machine that brews a good cup of coffee then this will work for you. If you want a machine that puts all sorts of restrictions on what type of k-cups you can use this is also the machine for you."" The Post reports the company's initial line of defense was that the move was born out of safety, as the machine wouldn't know how to properly brew a coffee Keurig didn't package. Other companies introduced hacks (one competitor mailed out a free override device), and yesterday, Kelley ""capitulated,"" as Barbash puts it, saying ""we heard loud and clear from consumers""; the My K-Cup will return.

64,"['No one liked the government shutdown, but apparently, it wasn’t without love. The kind of love that transpires when, say, you and your partner both don’t have to go to work. One week passes. Then two. You’re bored. You’re adults. You share a bed. \n \n And nine months later, there you are at a hospital that seems strangely overcrowded. \n \n “We keep getting asked, ‘What’s going on?’ ” said Sibley Memorial Hospital nurse Yulette Newman. “And we sit back and say, ‘Well, you’re in D.C. What was happening nine months ago?’ ” \n \n According to some local hospitals, one apparent aftereffect of the 16-day October furlough has made its way into maternity wards. At Sibley, for example, an average of 9.2 births occur daily. During the past month, that number has increased by three births, or 32.6 percent, per day. \n \n Newman, who has been a nurse in Sibley’s Family Centered Care Unit for eight years, is credited by her fellow nurses with predicting the so-called baby boom. On the 10th day of the shutdown, she posted a photo of an “Expected Date of Confinement Wheel” on Facebook. The circular calendar is used by obstetricians to predict when a baby will be born, based on the date of conception. \n \n Furlough babies? (Getty) \n \n The caption “Furlough babies????” earned Newman 16 likes, 22 comments and a little boost in hospital fame come June, when the number of births was on the rise. \n \n Nurses at Anne Arundel Medical Center in Annapolis, Md., were making the same jokes this month, when births in the first half of July increased from 265 in 2013 to 385 in 2014. \n \n There were 99 additional births at Virginia Hospital Center in the months of April, May and June, although spokeswoman Maryanne Boster acknowledged that birth rates have been rising at the hospital for a few years. \n \n The fruitful aftermath of shutdown boredom could also be seen in federal offices. Jessica Hernandez, a program analyst for the Food and Drug Administration, was one of three pregnant women in her 150-person office after the shutdown. She traced the conception of her daughter Gabrielle Nadine, who was born June 3, to her time off work, although she admits it was “all kind of hazy.” \n \n “It was definitely stressful not knowing when we would get paid, but I actually had a great time,” Hernandez said. “I got lunch with other feds, hung out with my mom, volunteered at my other daughter’s school, cleaned some closets and then just relaxed.” \n \n Her relaxation contributed to her better mood, she recalled, and her better mood contributed to her choice of activities when her husband came home from his sales consulting job. \n \n Carl Woog, a Pentagon employee whose wife recently gave birth to a baby boy, said they tracked her conception date back to just after the shutdown ended. Although Woog wasn’t furloughed, he and his wife “may have been celebrating congressional action,” he joked. \n \n Of course, with this raft of happy new arrivals come the baby-boom skeptics — those who say that any uptick in Beltway babies is purely coincidental. And there isn’t an increase everywhere. Nationwide, birth rates are still near historic lows. Communications departments at Medstar Washington Hospital Center, Medstar Georgetown University Hospital and Inova Fairfax Hospital balked at the post-shutdown baby-boom claim, saying they have seen no significant rise in births. \n \n Statisticians have also weighed in, noting that claims of baby booms have previously popped up in the news media after severe weather or events. A well-known 1970 study discredited a baby boom reported in the New York Times after the Great Blackout of 1965. \n \n But more recent work has shown tangible increases in fertility after the Oklahoma City bombing and after a string of hurricane advisories on the East Coast. \n \n Newman, the nurse at Sibley Hospital, says there will always be skeptics of the theories that she and many other maternity nurses believe in: that full moons, drops in barometric pressure and bad weather all can affect conception and birth rates. \n \n “But every time [something unusual happens], I think, nine months from now, here we go!” Newman said. “And sure enough, I’m usually right.” \n \n \n \n CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article misstated the sex of one of the children mentioned. Carl Woog’s wife gave birth to a boy', '— For years, the weather has been a scapegoat for allegedly causing cabin-fever induced spikes in births, and now some in the Washington area are pointing to Congress to explain packed maternity wards at several local hospitals. \n \n This July, nine months after Congress failed to pass appropriations legislation _ shutting down much of the government and sending hundreds of thousands of federal workers home for more than two weeks _ some hospitals are reporting higher-than-average numbers of births. Skeptics say the coincidence is probably just another false “baby boom” claim, which have been made after hurricanes, snowstorms and even the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. \n \n “Usually these stories are just romantic hypotheses with nothing to support them,” said Philip Morgan, a professor of sociology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who’s the director of the Carolina Population Center. “A few hospitals will have extra babies, so if you go looking for evidence you can find it.” \n \n In 1970, statistician Richard Udry published an analysis of a supposed baby boom reported by The New York Times nine months after a blackout had hit the city in the fall of 1965. Examining the combined hospital statistics throughout the city compared with averages from several years prior, Udry found no evidence of a real rise in births. \n \n Still, even Udry knew that his evidence would hardly quell the excitement related to reports of such baby booms. \n \n “It is evidently pleasing to many people to fantasy that when people are trapped by some immobile event which deprives them of their usual activities, most will turn to copulation,” Udry wrote. \n \n UNC’s Morgan said such events were unlikely to affect the birthrate because they rarely had an effect on other factors, such as couples using contraception. However, he said some cases had been scientifically corroborated, including a rise in births in metropolitan Oklahoma City after the bombings in 1995 and a decrease following the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court decision in Southern states. \n \n “It’s possible, but I doubt it,” Morgan said. “If anything, the government shutdown would irritate people and make them rethink having a child.” \n \n While it would take years to compare this year’s births with the long-term trend to prove such a boom, the spike in births at at least one hospital has people excited. \n \n “It’s not actually a rumor, it’s real,” said Gary Stephenson, a spokesman for Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington, who said the hospital had averaged three more births per day so far in July compared with the same period last year. In addition, the hospital had eight more babies this June than it did in June 2013. \n \n While Stephenson acknowledged that the increased rate wasn’t beyond the norm, he said similar past events, such as the debunked post-blackout boom in New York, seemed to give such anomalies credit. \n \n “When you see constituent bumps (in births) over time . . . I think it does cause one to think,” Stephenson said, adding that a nurse at Sibley had predicted the recent uptick. \n \n Not all hospitals said they had evidence of a baby boom, however. A spokeswoman for MedStar Washington Hospital Center, the district’s largest, said the maternity ward there hadn’t seen any recent anomalies in the number of births, which was actually down in recent weeks. \n \n Brian Williams, the anchor of “NBC Nightly News,” took the opportunity of the reported boom to offer some on-air humor. \n \n “How long until someone on television points out that during the shutdown the folks in Washington are apparently doing at home what Washington has been accused of doing to the American people?” Williams said last week. \n \n A similar case of an alleged baby boom made news last year, when some hospitals in New Jersey reported a surge in births nine months after Hurricane Sandy hit the region in October 2012. \n \n The phenomenon was also recently referenced in a Hyundai commercial that aired during the FIFA World Cup competition. The ad showed a packed maternity ward before flashing back nine months to victory celebrations in which a young couple lock eyes and begin kissing. \n \n The federal government shutdown, which occurred last Oct. 1 to Oct. 16, sent roughly 800,000 federal workers home during that period. In addition, more than 1 million employees were required to work without pay. Congress later restored pay for all the federal workers. \n \n Email: jmoritz@mcclatchydc.com; Twitter: @JCMoritzTU.']",2,"– As the nation's capital languished during October's 16-day government shutdown, a nurse in Washington, DC, made a Facebook prediction: “Furlough babies????"" Lo and behold nine months later, reps at Sibley Memorial Hospital, where the nurse works, say there’s been a nearly 33% increase in births over the last month, says the Washington Post, while two other area hospitals report similarly notable jumps. Anecdotal evidence seems to support the timeline, with one FDA analyst recalling the time around her new daughter’s conception as ""all kind of hazy,"" while a Pentagon worker cops to ""celebrating congressional action"" with his wife. Similar booms have been positively correlated with other major events—including the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing and a series of East Coast hurricane warnings, notes the Post. But not everyone’s convinced: At least three other DC-area hospitals tell the Post they haven’t seen any ""significant"" increase, and a sociologist who spoke with McClatchy DC says that seemingly burgeoning birth rates after such events are ""usually … just romantic hypotheses with nothing to support them.""

65,"['Northwestern football players win pivotal union case. \n \n Northwestern University football players on scholarship are employees of the school and therefore entitled to hold an election to decide whether to unionize, an official of the National Labor Relations Board ruled Wednesday. \n \n The stunning decision, coming after a push by former quarterback Kain Colter backed by organized labor, has the potential to shake up the world of big-time college sports. \n \n The National Collegiate Athletic Association and universities set the rules and cut the lucrative deals with TV networks and sponsors, exerting near total control over the activities of players known as ""student athletes."" But now those football players, at least at Northwestern, are employees too and may seek collective bargaining status, according to the 24-page ruling by Peter Sung Ohr, the regional director of the NLRB. \n \n Ohr\'s decision is ""revolutionary for college sports,"" said Robert McCormick, a professor emeritus at the Michigan State University College of Law who focuses on sports and labor law. \n \n Experts said the ruling could have wide impact beyond Northwestern\'s locker room, potentially influencing other players, schools, and state and federal agencies. For example, McCormick said that if college players demand compensation for injuries suffered during training or a game, Ohr\'s opinion could raise the question of whether they should be treated as employees under the state Workers\' Compensation Act. \n \n The decision also opens the door for athletes with scholarships at public universities to move more quickly to unionize because state labor boards, which govern public universities, usually follow labor law interpretations issued by the NLRB. \n \n There were many questions left unanswered, including whether a union vote among Northwestern players would succeed, but Ohr\'s decision is preliminary. Northwestern immediately said it will appeal to the NLRB in Washington, and experts anticipate the case ultimately could be heard by the Supreme Court. \n \n ""Northwestern believes strongly that our student-athletes are not employees, but students,"" Northwestern said in a statement. ""Unionization and collective bargaining are not the appropriate methods to address the concerns raised by student-athletes."" \n \n Northwestern\'s football players are the first in college sports to seek union representation. Behind the effort is the College Athletes Players Association, or CAPA, a union funded by Ramogi Huma, a former UCLA linebacker who has become an advocate for players\' rights. CAPA is backed by the United Steelworkers, which is covering the group\'s legal expenses. \n \n ""This is a huge step toward justice for college athletes,"" Huma said. \n \n He said the NCAA invented the term ""student-athletes"" 60 years ago in an attempt to prevent students from unionizing. Wednesday\'s decision, he said, asserts the rights of college athletes under labor law. \n \n The union has said it would seek to negotiate over health and safety issues and does not intend to push for ""pay-for-play"" wages, which are not allowed under regulations issued by the NCAA. \n \n Among its demands, CAPA is seeking financial coverage for former players with sports-related medical expenses, independent concussion experts to be placed on the sidelines during games and the creation of an educational trust fund to help former players graduate. \n \n It also wants players to receive compensation for commercial sponsorships, which it says is consistent with ""evolving"" NCAA regulations. \n \n In siding with the union, Ohr said the football players primarily have an economic relationship with the university, which controls and directs their daily activities and compensates them in the form of scholarships, which are worth about $76,000 per academic year if the player enrolls in summer classes. \n \n ""The record makes clear that the employer\'s scholarship players are identified and recruited in the first instance because of their football prowess and not because of their academic achievement in high school,"" Ohr wrote. \n \n Football players with scholarships, he said, ""fall squarely"" within in the labor law\'s definition of an employee. Ohr said those players spend many more hours on their football duties than on their studies. Furthermore, he said, the players are subject to special rules and policies that do not govern the general student population. \n \n For example, he said, freshmen and sophomore students on scholarships are required to live on campus. Upperclassmen, he added, can live off campus but are required to submit their lease for approval to their coach, Pat Fitzgerald. \n \n ""Even the players\' academic lives are controlled as evidenced by the fact that they are required to attend study hall if they fail to maintain a certain grade-point average (GPA) in their classes,"" Ohr wrote. \n \n Northwestern argued that the term ""student athlete"" is still appropriate. ""We believe that participation in athletic events is part of the overall educational experience for those students, not a separate activity.""', 'CHICAGO (AP) — In a stunning ruling that could revolutionize college sports, a federal agency said Wednesday that football players at Northwestern University can create the nation\'s first union of college athletes. \n \n FILE - In this Jan. 28, 2014, file photo, Northwestern quarterback Kain Colter, right, speaks while College Athletes Players Association President Ramogi Huma listens during a news conference in Chicago.... (Associated Press) \n \n The decision by a regional director of the National Labor Relations Board means it agrees football players at the Big Ten school qualify as employees under federal law and therefore can legally unionize. \n \n ""Based on the entire record in this case, I find that the Employer\'s football players who receive scholarships fall squarely within (federal labor law\'s) broad definition of \'employee,"" Peter Sung Ohr, the NLRB regional director, said in his 24-page decision. \n \n An employee is generally regarded by law as someone who receives compensation for a service and is under the direct control of managers. Players argued that their scholarships are compensation and coaches are their managers. \n \n The Evanston, Ill-based university argued college athletes, as students, don\'t fit in the same category as factory workers, truck drivers and other unionized workers. Immediately after the ruling, the school announced it plans to appeal to labor authorities in Washington, D.C. \n \n Alan Cubbage, Northwestern\'s vice president for university relations, said in a statement that while the school respects ""the NLRB process and the regional director\'s opinion, we disagree with it."" \n \n The specific goals of the College Athletes Players Association, or CAPA, which would take the lead in organizing the players, include guaranteeing coverage of sports-related medical expenses for current and former players, ensuring better procedures to reduce head injuries and potentially letting players pursue commercial sponsorships. \n \n But critics have argued that giving college athletes employee status and allowing them to unionize could hurt college sports in numerous ways, including by raising the prospects of strikes by disgruntled players or lockouts by athletic departments. \n \n For now, the push is to unionize athletes at private schools, such as Northwestern, because the federal labor agency does not have jurisdiction over public universities. \n \n Outgoing Wildcats quarterback Kain Colter took a leading role in establishing CAPA. The United Steelworkers union has been footing the legal bills. \n \n Colter, whose eligibility has been exhausted and who has entered the NFL draft, said nearly all of the 85 scholarship players on the Wildcats roster backed the union bid, though only he expressed his support publicly. \n \n CAPA attorneys argued that college football is, for all practical purposes, a commercial enterprise that relies on players\' labor to generate billions of dollars in profits. That, they contend, makes the relationship of schools to players one of employers to employees. \n \n In its endeavor to have college football players be recognized as essential workers, CAPA likened scholarships to employment pay — too little pay from its point of view. Northwestern balked at that claim, describing scholarship as grants. \n \n The NCAA has been under increasing scrutiny over its amateurism rules and is fighting a class-action federal lawsuit by former players seeking a cut of the billions of dollars earned from live broadcasts, memorabilia sales and video games. Other lawsuits allege the NCAA failed to protect players from debilitating head injuries. \n \n NCAA President Mark Emmert has pushed for a $2,000-per-player stipend to help athletes defray some of expenses. Critics say that isn\'t nearly enough, considering players help bring in millions of dollars to their schools and conferences. \n \n During the NLRB\'s five days of hearings in February, Wildcats coach Pat Fitzgerald took the stand for union opponents, and his testimony sometimes was at odds with Colter\'s. \n \n Colter told the hearing that players\' performance on the field was more important to Northwestern than their in-class performance, saying, ""You fulfill the football requirement and, if you can, you fit in academics."" Asked why Northwestern gave him a scholarship of $75,000 a year, he responded: ""To play football. To perform an athletic service."" \n \n But Fitzgerald said he tells players academics come first, saying, ""We want them to be the best they can be ... to be a champion in life."" \n \n An attorney representing the university, Alex Barbour, noted Northwestern has one of the highest graduation rates for college football players in the nation, around 97 percent. Barbour insisted, ""Northwestern is not a football factory."" \n \n ___ \n \n Follow Michael Tarm at https://twitter.com/mtarm']",2,"– Northwestern football players aren't just student-athletes—they're employees of the university who have the right to form a union, a federal official ruled today. How big of a deal is today's ruling by a regional director of the National Labor Relations Board? ""The stunning decision has the potential to alter dramatically the world of big-time college sports,"" writes Alejandra Cancino in the Chicago Tribune. The AP's Michael Tarm uses similar language, calling it a ""stunning ruling that could revolutionize college sports."" But first things first: The school plans to appeal to the NLRB in Washington, and nothing is expected to change until that decision comes down. Even then, the case could wind up in the Supreme Court. Northwestern's team is the first to seek permission to unionize, and it''s getting help from a players' rights group called the College Athletes Players Association. CAPA, in turn, is getting support from the United Steelworkers union. CAPA's attorneys say that players generate so much money for schools that they are clearly employees, and that they're already getting paid, though not enough, in the form of scholarships. Northwestern's attorneys argued that there's a big distinction between college players and, say, truck drivers, and it called those scholarships not pay but ""grants,"" reports the LA Times. If the NLRB sanctions such unions, expect teams all over to follow suit. Among other things, the unions would likely demand better coverage of medical expenses for current and former players, along with the right to pursue commercial sponsorships."

68,"[""The focus would be helping students become more intelligent science consumers by learning how scientific work is done: how ideas are developed and tested, what counts as strong or weak evidence, and how insights from many disciplines fit together into a coherent picture of the world. \n \n Leaders of the effort said that teachers may well wind up covering fewer subjects, but digging more deeply into the ones they do cover. In some cases, traditional classes like biology and chemistry may disappear entirely from high schools, replaced by courses that use a case-study method to teach science in a more holistic way. \n \n In many respects, the standards are meant to do for science what a separate set of guidelines known as the Common Core is supposed to do for English and mathematics: impose and raise standards, with a focus on critical thinking and primary investigation. To date, 45 states and Washington have adopted the Common Core standards. \n \n “This is a huge deal,” said David L. Evans, the executive director of the National Science Teachers Association. “We depend on science in so many aspects of our lives. There’s a strong feeling that we need to help people understand the nature of science itself, as an intellectual pursuit.” \n \n The climate and evolution standards are just two aspects of a set of guidelines containing hundreds of new ideas on how to teach science. But they have already drawn hostile commentary from conservative groups critical of mainstream scientific thinking. \n \n For instance, as the standards were being drafted, a group called Citizens for Objective Public Education, which lists officers in Florida and Kansas, distributed a nine-page letter attacking them. It warned that the standards ignored evidence against evolution, promoted “secular humanism,” and threatened to “take away the right of parents to direct the religious education of their children.” \n \n In many states, extensive scientific instruction does not begin until high school. The guidelines call for injecting far more science into the middle grades, with climate change being one among many topics. In high school, students would learn in more detail about the human role in generating emissions that are altering the planetary climate. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n While thousands of schools in the United States already teach climate change to some degree, they are usually doing it voluntarily, and often in environmental studies classes. In many more schools, the subject does not come up because students are not offered those specialized courses, and state guidelines typically do not require that the issue be raised in traditional biology or chemistry classes. \n \n Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Inevitably, educators said, some states will do it better than others. \n \n The other states that helped draw up the guidelines were Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont, Washington and West Virginia. The organizations included the National Science Teachers Association, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the National Research Council and Achieve, a nonprofit education group that helped develop the earlier common standards in mathematics and English. Financing was provided by private foundations, including the Carnegie Corporation of New York, the Noyce Foundation and the Cisco Foundation, as well as DuPont. \n \n Outlining how the standards might change science classrooms, educators said they foresaw more use of real-world examples, like taking students to a farm or fish hatchery — perhaps repeatedly, over the course of years — to help them learn principles from biology, chemistry and physics. \n \n Educators want to introduce students to topics that can be made comprehensible only by drawing on the ideas and methods of many scientific disciplines, one of the reasons climate change and other large-scale environmental problems are seen as holding so much potential in the classroom. \n \n Some teachers are already ahead of the curve. \n \n Judith Luber-Narod, a high-school science teacher at the Abby Kelley Foster Charter Public School in Worcester, Mass., has incorporated climate change into her environmental studies classes, even though she teaches in a somewhat conservative area. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n “I hesitated a little bit talking about something controversial,” she said. “But then I thought, how can you teach the environment without talking about it?” \n \n Her students, on the other hand, love topics some deem controversial, she said. She devised an experiment in which she set up two terrariums with thermometers and then increased the level of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, in one of them. \n \n The students watched as that terrarium got several degrees hotter than the other. \n \n “I say to them, ‘I’m here to show you the evidence,’ ” she said. “ ‘If you want to believe the evidence when we’re done, that’s up to you.’ ”"", 'American school children will for the first time receive extensive lessons on climate change following the adoption on Tuesday of new science education guidelines. \n \n However, the final standards were substantially weakened from earlier drafts. \n \n The final guidelines cut by about a third the amount of time devoted to a subject seen as critical to future generations. \n \n They are also less explicit than earlier drafts about the human role as a driver for climate change. ""It\'s buried at best,"" said Mark McCaffrey, policy director for the National Center for Science Education. \n \n The new science teaching standards will introduce climate change as a core aspect of science education for middle and high school students \n \n in up to 40 states – in many for the first time. \n \n The guidelines were unveiled at a time when climate change has become \n \n a flashpoint for conservative groups, similar to the teaching of evolution in classrooms \n \n The Next Generation Science Standards are not mandatory. But scientists and educational experts in 26 states helped to develop them, and they will for the first time bring a degree of cohesion to the teaching of climate change, said Frank Niepold, co-chair of the climate education group at the US Global Change Research Program, \n \n who was involved in the three-year effort. \n \n ""In the current situation the state standards are all over the map. \n \n It\'s a hodgepodge,"" he said. ""We are still in a situation where across \n \n the country basically in every state students can still graduate from \n \n high school and in some cases go through college without learning the \n \n basics."" \n \n The mission of the new standards was to prepare a new generation of \n \n Americans for college and adulthood, said Matt Krehbeil, a consultant \n \n to the process. \n \n ""The NGSS aim to prepare students to be better decision makers about \n \n scientific and technical issues and to apply science to their daily \n \n lives,"" he said in a statement. \n \n However, the standards appeared considerably shorter than draft versions that had circulated in recent months. Unlike earlier drafts, the final standards do not propose teaching climate change until children are in middle school and high school. \n \n Mario Molina, deputy director at the Alliance for Climate Education, said the experts drafting the guidelines had cut 35% from the sections devoted to climate change, in response to public comments. He did not believe it was political, but was response to a need to compress a great deal of material. \n \n However, he said teachers will now need additional materials and clarifications to teach climate change in detail. \n \n Earlier versions had proposed introducing some aspects of climate change as early as kindergarten. \n \n The standards are also much vaguer about the causes of climate change. An earlier version for primary school students had said explicitly that human activity was a driver of climate change. ""It\'s not as explicit in terms of the connection between human activities and climate change,"" Molina said. \n \n McCaffrey agreed. ""They talk about climate just in a very general way,"" he said. ""At the third grade level they are not explicit that they are talking about human activities."" \n \n McCaffrey said the lack of clarity could be an opening for teachers to teach their own opinions in place of science, or resort to DVDs and other materials being pushed into classrooms by conservative groups that deny the existence of climate change. \n \n ""It opens the door for teaching a phony controversy,"" he said. \n \n The new guidelines also offered far less time for teaching about the physics involved in the greenhouse effect. Such knowledge was critical to ensuring students understand that greenhouse gases cause climate change, and that such emissions must be cut to prevent the worst effects of climate change. \n \n ""We are not seeing the students need to understand the greenhouse effect,"" he said. ""It was in the earlier version a year ago."" \n \n A spokesman for the Next Generation Science Standards refused to comment on the new guidelines, and hung up on the phone when asked about climate change. \n \n The new standards were released at a time when conservative groups in America are making a strong push to limit teaching of established climate science or inject fringe ideas on climate change into the curriculum. \n \n Some 18 states have considered ""academic freedom acts"" that would allow teachers to depart from established science and deny the existence of climate change – including seven this year alone. \n \n In Britain, meanwhile, draft guidelines released last month cut climate change off the curriculum for children under the age of 14. \n \n But it was hoped that the broad support from states and the involvement of so many experts from the National Research Council the National Science Teachers Association, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science, would defuse any political controversy attached to the teaching of climate change. \n \n ""Climate change is not a political issue and climate change is not a debate. It is science. It is strongly supported heavily research science, and our hope is that teachers will not see this as a political issue or a political debate,"" Molina said. \n \n He said the new standards will help guide teachers on teaching climate change. However, it was critical that science organisations offer support and resources to teachers who may not be as familiar with climate change as with other areas of science. \n \n ""There are existing materials out there – DVDS and stuff on YouTube and so forth – that are being used in classrooms to perpetuate confusion. A lot of teachers just don\'t have the background in science themselves. They may be hesitant and confused. That is why professional development is so vital,"" he said.']",2,"– For the first time since 1996, educators have released major national guidelines for science in schools. The big news this time: They include a call for climate change education, potentially beginning in middle school, the New York Times reports. They also strongly urge schools to teach evolution. The Next Generation Science Standards, as they're known, are the result of collaboration between educators and 26 states. Though states don't have to follow the rules, 26 are ""seriously considering"" them, the Times notes. ""In the current situation the state standards are all over the map. It's a hodgepodge,"" an expert involved says. ""We are still in a situation where across the country, basically in every state, students can still graduate from high school and in some cases go through college without learning the basics."" Still, the completed guidelines are watered down from earlier drafts, the Guardian notes. The amount of material devoted to climate change has been cut by a third, and the final draft isn't as clear on human involvement in climate change: ""It's buried at best,"" says an education leader."

A grand jury voted in 1999 to indict the parents, John and Patsy Ramsey, but then-District Attorney Alex Hunter declined to file charges, citing a lack of evidence. \n \n In the conclusion of the CBS show that aired on Monday, a panel of experts said it was its opinion that Burke Ramsey, who was 9 at the time of the homicide, struck his sister in the head with a heavy object, perhaps not intending to kill her. \n \n The girl’s parents then staged a crime scene to make it appear that an intruder was the culprit, the group of law enforcement, forensic pathologists and other experts concluded. \n \n Wood called CBS “corporate profit mongers” who aired the program during the September “sweeps” for maximum ratings benefit. \n \n In a recent interview on the “Dr. Phil” talk show, Burke Ramsey, now 29, denied that he harmed his sister, and said he suspected a pedophile who stalked child beauty pageants was the killer. \n \n Wood said a written disclaimer that CBS aired with its show, saying the opinions “represent just some of a number of possible scenarios,” did not go far enough.', 'A tipster who is friends with Scott Brown’s daughter Ayla was nice enough to send us this photo of her and her sister Arianna posing with their now-Senator Dad while clad in sexy bikinis.

That's how a lawyer for the family of JonBenet Ramsey sums up a ""disgusting and revolting"" CBS documentary and its panel's conclusion that Burke Ramsey likely killed his sister in a rage that was covered up by his parents, John and Patsy. ""I will be filing a lawsuit on behalf of Burke Ramsey,"" the lawyer tells Reuters. He isn't the only one taking issue with the airing, though CBS says it ""stands by the broadcast and will do so in court."" Rolling Stone calls it ""a witch hunt"" and ""cruel ratings ploy""; in its view the evidence was ""almost entirely subjective, at times dangerously misleading and dependent on a flawed police investigation."" The investigators ignored the fact that they reached the same conclusion about Patsy's 911 call—in which they say Burke is heard speaking to his parents—as investigators in 1997, instead presenting their findings as new information. They also focused on what is ""appropriate"" human behavior and language in examining the Ramsey family's actions after the murder, which is rarely allowed in court. A lawyer not involved in the case calls the re-investigation ""a complete travesty,"" per the New Zealand Herald. Investigators ""went into this with an agenda—and that was the killer had to be from the family,"" he says.

70,"['Truthfully, if it hadn’t been my paying job as a critic to watch Fede Alvarez’s remake of “Evil Dead’’ all the way to the end, I probably would have headed for the exit door long before the point where somebody cuts off her own arm with an electric carving knife. \n \n Of course, then I’d have missed another character being severed lengthwise with a chain saw while some members of the audience hooted in approval. \n \n Gorehounds will have a field day with the plentiful mutilations, decapitations and other blood-drenched moments in the redo. \n \n It amazingly sports an R rating, though it’s far grislier than Sam Raimi’s 1981 original (which was initially released without a rating but acquired an NC-17 for a 1995 re-release). \n \n The effects are also far more realistic than there were in the bargain-basement original from 32 years ago. \n \n Which means that instead of spoofing the excesses of that era’s slasher films, they’re basically being offered up for the delectation of contemporary moviegoers. \n \n While there were a couple of squeamish walkouts, many young men and women at the promotional screening I attended seemed to enjoy watching victims being shot at with nail guns, whacked on the head with crowbars or cutting off a piece of their face with a jagged piece of glass. \n \n Besides gallons of blood, there’s no small amount of urine, as well as a scene where a woman is raped by a plant. \n \n Acting is sort of besides the point in a movie like this, which has the performers spouting deliberately ridiculous dialogue and constantly risking their lives in ways that no sane person would. \n \n The setting is a remote cabin the woods — conveniently cut off by a flash flood — where a heroin-addicted young woman (Jane Levy) has been brought to try to go cold turkey. \n \n When she starts having delusions and warning everyone they won’t live through the night, they have to wonder if it’s a symptom of withdrawal or because the most dweebish guy (Lou Taylor Pucci) has started reading incantations from a mysterious old book he found. \n \n Also along for the gory, gory night are the junkie’s long-estranged brother (Shiloh Fernandez) and a student nurse (Jessica Lucas) whose skill at suturing wounds with duct tape comes in handy. \n \n Though it tries — with a much too heavy hand — the new “Evil Dead’’ is far less humorous than its predecessor, which catapulted director Raimi and star Bruce Campbell (who produced this one) into long mainstream careers. \n \n Which is not to say this “Evil Dead’’ reboot won’t also beget sequels.', 'The rare remake that likely will be enjoyed most by diehard fans of its predecessor, “Evil Dead” often comes off as the cinematic equivalent of a cover-band concert tribute to a supergroup’s greatest hits — albeit with a lot more gore. First-time feature helmer Fede Alvarez’s blood-soaked reprise of Sam Raimi’s franchise-spawning low-budget shocker, “The Evil Dead,” boasts far better production values than the penny-pinching 1981 original and conceivably could delight genre fans who have never seen the first version or its previous remakes/sequels. But it’s bound to play best with those who catch Alvarez’s many wink-wink allusions to Raimi’s pic. \n \n Working from a script he co-wrote with Rodo Sayagues, Alvarez briskly sets up his recycling of Raimi’s horror premise — five friends visit a secluded cabin in the woods where all hell breaks loose — with an aptly portentous prologue and backstory-heavy opening scenes. But Alvarez goes Raimi one better, by actually offering a logical reason why the characters don’t immediately vamoose once supernatural manifestations begin. \n \n Mia (Jane Levy), a drug-addicted young woman trying to go cold turkey, is undergoing physically and psychologically agonizing withdrawal, and her companions — including prodigal brother David (Shiloh Fernandez) and medically trained buddy Olivia (Jessica Lucas) — are loath to interrupt the recovery process. Besides, all those terrible things Mia claims to see are just hallucinations triggered by withdrawal, right? \n \n Wrong. \n \n Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci), the academically inclined member of the group, finds in the cabin a mysterious Book of the Dead filled with horrific illustrations, mysterious symbols and ample warnings not to read aloud anything that appears in its ancient pages. Unfortunately, Eric does not heed those admonitions, awakening a familiar demon for a new generation of young victims. Mia is the first to be infected by the monstrously malignant and singularly foul-mouthed bogeyman, but it doesn’t stop there, inspiring her cabin mates to damage themselves and each other in creatively gory ways. \n \n Alvarez repeatedly references plot elements and specific shots from Raimi’s original pic. Taking his cue from the original, he makes especially effective use of lenser Aaron Morton’s swooping, swirling camera movements, which suggest the POV of a rampaging poltergeist. But Alvarez’s tone is completely different, as the helmer rarely attempts to emulate the self-mocking, over-the-top campiness that distinguished the original “Evil Dead” from so many other cheapie creepies of the 1980s. \n \n Actor Bruce Campbell (who’s onboard here as a producer) more or less established himself as a cult figure back in the day with his inspired overplaying of Ash, the astonishingly resilient protagonist of Raimi’s original. In Alvarez’s version, Fernandez’s David serves the equivalent role, but he’s deadly serious. \n \n Indeed, the only character who even gets to crack a joke is Pucci’s Eric. Asked if he’s certain that actions described in the Book of the Dead will rid them of the troublesome spirit, the frantic fellow replies, “Am I sure? Of course not! It’s not a science book!” \n \n Levy is believably beastly as the possessed Mia, and manages the heavy lifting when her character must handle some last-act heroics. Other members of the cast do what they can with thinly written parts. For instance, it’s not really Elizabeth Blackmore’s fault that her role as David’s g.f. is so ill-defined and unimportant that some may forget she’s in the pic until she starts to make lethal use of a nail gun. \n \n The bloody mayhem is so graphic and frequent throughout “Evil Dead,” one cannot help suspecting that alternate takes had to be shot to ensure an R rating. The emphasis on dismemberment and disfigurement should make this must-see entertainment for gorehounds, but could literally scare off auds accustomed to less explicit, PG-13 fare. \n \n Ultimately, the new “Evil Dead” will rely heavily on existing fans of this unlikely franchise to make a killing in theatrical and homevid release.

Mia (Jane Levy) is trying to kick a drug habit cold turkey, with the others (Shiloh Fernandez, Jessica Lucas, Lou Taylor Pucci, and Elizabeth Blackmore) along for support. \n \n PHOTOS: Scenes from \'Evil Dead\' \n \n After discovering a mysterious book, bound in human skin, they unleash a demonic force that wants them all dead and pits them against one another. \n \n The new film is produced by Raimi, Rob Tapert and Bruce Campbell (writer-director, producer and star of the 1981 movie, respectively) and nimbly walks the fine line of tribute, update and doing its own thing. \n \n What this ""Evil Dead"" gets most right is its tone, paying homage yet staking its own territory; it\'s scary without being downbeat, fun without being too jokey. Levy in particular is perfectly in sync with Alvarez\'s mix of sincerity, snark and scares. \n \n Alvarez certainly seems to have relished the chance to splatter and spray his cast with all manner of goo. His aesthetic is a few shades lighter than the gloomy grunge of other recent horror reinventions, and he never loses sight of the black comedy lurking in the story\'s corners. \n \n But back to the goo. There is plenty of over-the-top gore, great gushing geysers of it. Yet one of the most squirm-inducing moments — apart from the notorious, still difficult-to-justify ""tree rape"" scene — isn\'t from a Grand Guignol spurt of blood, but rather a relatively minor cut as a machete blade slices across the top of a bent knee. \n \n It\'s a sensation one can actually relate to, as opposed to something like the gruesome slapstick of slipping on a shorn-off piece of someone else\'s face. \n \n Respectfully aware of its origins — including a wait-for-it tag after the end credits — ""Evil Dead"" is something of a forward-looking throwback. It\'s unlikely the movie will gain the same ardent following as Raimi\'s debut, but it offers enough good-time gore, goofiness, scares and screams to leave an audience feeling a certain elated exhaustion. \n \n mark.olsen@latimes.com \n \n \'Evil Dead\' \n \n MPAA rating: R for strong bloody violence and gore, some sexual content and language \n \n Running time: 1 hour, 30 minutes \n \n Playing: In general release', 'The remake of “The Evil Dead,” Sam Raimi’s 1981 horror film about a cabin of cult curiosities, doesn’t have the original’s wooden performances, puffy clothes and hairdos or its amusingly crude special effects, but it does share its blood lust. Torrential and somewhat rust colored, the blood in the remake splish-splashes across the screen, spurts out of bodies, soaks into floors and falls from the sky like a biblical portent. If the rivers of red in Mr. Raimi’s movie flowed more like molasses than water, it’s because they were created with food dye and Karo syrup. \n \n The new “Evil Dead” has none of the first movie’s handmade charm or hilarity, intentional or otherwise. (It also lost its “The.”) The director, Fede Alvarez, approaches the creaky material with a surprisingly straight face and a fair amount of throat clearing. Unlike Mr. Raimi, who scarcely bothered with preliminaries, Mr. Alvarez sets the creepy mood with a sacrificial immolation and a basement strung with desiccated cats. When his five souls roll up to their cabin, he continues to keep his foot on the brake with some back story involving Mia (Jane Levy), her drug addiction and issues with her brother, David (Shiloh Fernandez.) \n \n Finally something wicked does come, racing and smashing through the surrounding forest, and Mr. Alvarez, making his feature directing debut, gets his gore on. Taking his cues as much from the Abstract Expressionists as from Mr. Raimi, Mr. Alvarez opens up the book of the dead (bound in human flesh and tied with barbed wire) and makes handy sport with an electric meat knife and a nail gun, among other convenient and preposterous household items. As the plot thickens and the viscera and limbs fly, his mood appreciably lightens, and at least one scene approaches the macabre comedy of the black knight scene in “Monty Python and the Holy Grail.” \n \n “The Evil Dead” enjoys the reputation of a cult classic, but its more lasting significance is as a cheapie do-it-yourself production that achieved indie success. (New Line Cinema picked it up and squeezed it dry.) The movie made Mr. Raimi’s reputation and set him down a path that led to two “Dead” sequels and eventual blockbuster fame. His star, Bruce Campbell, a puckish presence with a chin as big as an Easter ham, can be seen on the USA Network show “Burn Notice” as well as in an eye-blink fast cameo here. It’s too early to tell if Mr. Alvarez will be able similarly to translate this movie into a lasting career, but one of his stars, Lou Taylor Pucci, deserves a boost.']",4,"– Perhaps unsurprisingly, the remake of 1981's gore-fest Evil Dead is a love-it-or-hate-it affair. The new version has fewer laughs and even more blood and guts than its predecessor, critics say: The new Evil Dead has ""none of the first movie’s handmade charm or hilarity, intentional or otherwise,"" writes Manohla Dargis in the New York Times, noting that the film, directed by Fede Alvarez, ""approaches the creaky material with a surprisingly straight face."" What does it have in common with the first film? ""Blood lust."" Indeed, the ""tone is completely different, as the helmer rarely attempts to emulate the self-mocking, over-the-top campiness that distinguished the original,"" writes Joe Leydon at Variety. Still, with its references to the original, it's ""the rare remake that likely will be enjoyed most by diehard fans of its predecessor."" In the Los Angeles Times, Mark Olsen applauds the film's ""gleeful exuberance of its own analogous to the mad invention of the original."" Its best feature ""is its tone, paying homage yet staking its own territory; it's scary without being downbeat, fun without being too jokey."" ""Gorehounds will have a field day with the plentiful mutilations, decapitations, and other blood-drenched moments in the redo,"" writes Lou Lumenick in the New York Post. Guess he's not a gorehound: He gave it one star."

72,"['Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n WASHINGTON — Around 8 p.m. Thursday, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the minority leader, called Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York into his office with news that would stun Washington the next morning: Mr. Reid planned to retire at the end of his term. \n \n Mr. Reid’s decision to contact Mr. Schumer first, before even President Obama, was another powerful reminder of what Senate Democrats have long known: Mr. Schumer — the flip-phone using, rumpled, relentless son of a Brooklyn exterminator — is the presumptive front-runner to lead the Senate Democrats when Mr. Reid is gone. \n \n In that moment, Mr. Schumer’s possibilities finally caught up with his ambition. \n \n Just hours after Mr. Reid announced his retirement, throwing the future of his caucus into flux, at least one thing was clear: The Democratic leader post that Mr. Schumer has long coveted is his to lose. \n \n Mr. Reid, demonstrating the steely will with which he has ruled his conference, worked aggressively to anoint Mr. Schumer, the No. 3 Democrat, as his successor shortly after beginning to tell people that he would not seek re-election, effectively edging out Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat. Mr. Durbin later said that he, too, would back Mr. Schumer. \n \n “He will be elected to replace me in 22 months,” Mr. Reid told Nevada Public Radio. “I think one reason that will happen is because I want him to be my replacement.” \n \n Mr. Schumer spent most of the day calling lawmakers to lock down their support for his leadership bid, which he officially announced Friday afternoon, saying in statement, “I am honored and humbled to have the support of so many of my colleagues and look forward to our Senate Democratic caucus continuing to fight for the middle class.” \n \n After more than three decades in Congress, Mr. Schumer, 64, has a reputation nationally as an institutional presence in the baroque Senate chamber and the green rooms of the Sunday talk shows. But his potential ascent to the top Democratic post also represents a boon for New York, where Mr. Schumer cut his teeth with his rapacious attention to local issues, one Sunday morning news conference at a time. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n New York has never produced a leader of the Senate, and it has been more than a century since a New Yorker was speaker of the House. \n \n “New York is very fortunate that we will have someone with his abilities and talents to help our state,” said former Senator Alfonse M. D’Amato, a Republican whom Mr. Schumer unseated in a contentious 1998 battle, but who now describes him as “a tiger” on Capitol Hill. “He will do exactly that — use that power and that clout.” \n \n Unlike the frequently endangered Mr. Reid — and the previous Democratic Senate leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota — Mr. Schumer, who was first elected to the House in 1980, has proved seemingly unbeatable on his home turf. He has not faced a competitive campaign since his first election to the Senate, as he has kept the state’s Democratic community united around him. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n That same indefatigable relationship building has also helped him in the Senate. Mr. Durbin and Mr. Schumer, who were once longtime roommates in Washington, have jockeyed for years behind the scenes, at times tensely, over who would replace Mr. Reid. Mr. Durbin plans to run again for the No. 2 position, and has Mr. Reid’s endorsement. \n \n Mr. Schumer, a master tactician and inveterate deal maker, ran the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee in 2006, when Democrats retook control of the Senate, and again in 2008, when they increased their majority. Mr. Schumer also earned the respect and trust of more moderate Democrats, who view him as someone eager to get things done and often call him when they have a concern or problem. \n \n Shortly after the 2014 midterm elections, when Democrats lost their majority, some Democrats who had chafed under Mr. Reid’s leadership urged Mr. Schumer to challenge Mr. Reid for minority leader. But Mr. Schumer quickly quashed the plan, out of “loyalty and friendship” to Mr. Reid, said someone close to Mr. Schumer, speaking anonymously to discuss a sensitive topic. \n \n Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the No. 4 Democrat, is also interested in remaining in her party’s leadership, though she is not actively campaigning for a specific post. \n \n While some progressive groups called for Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts to consider running, Democrats have mentioned Ms. Murray as the most likely senator to pose a possible challenge for Mr. Schumer. She ran the party’s Senate Campaign Committee in 2012, is well liked and respected by her colleagues, and has a natural base of support among her party’s 14 female members. \n \n Though the official vote is nearly two years away, after the 2016 elections, the Democratic leadership was eager for a smooth transition, and at least a tacit understanding of who will replace Mr. Reid. \n \n In New York, where Mr. Schumer’s prowess as a retail politician is often on display, his possible elevation was cause for instant celebration. \n \n “I don’t know when the last time was when we had someone in such a position,” said Representative Joseph Crowley of Queens, adding, “He’s going to be at the head of the table, and I think that’s something that we haven’t necessarily had.” \n \n In contrast with other prominent New York officials, including Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York, Mr. Schumer has never become a divisive figure, focusing insistently on the state’s economic interests and local concerns, rather than on ideological crusades. \n \n Mr. Crowley said Mr. Schumer has attended nearly every meeting of the state’s delegation, both in Washington and back home. When Mr. Crowley sought a House leadership post in 2012, he said he sought advice from Mr. Schumer, who helped rally the delegation behind him. \n \n Mr. Schumer has continued to work the state’s circuit of local parades and association dinners even as he has climbed the ranks of national leadership, making frequent visits to upstate cities, including Syracuse, Rochester and Buffalo. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n “When I get together with him, I can get through a list of 10 issues in 45 seconds,” said Mayor Stephanie A. Miner of Syracuse. “Between talking fast and talking on two or three flip-phones at any one time, he’s always extraordinarily responsive.” \n \n New York City politicians called Mr. Schumer an omnipresent force, regularly seen riding his bike around the city and showing up at swearing-in ceremonies for all manner of state and local officeholders. \n \n “He’s everywhere in the state and has been for a long time now,” said State Senator Daniel L. Squadron, a former aide to Mr. Schumer. \n \n Eric Adams, the Brooklyn borough president, said he encountered Mr. Schumer last week at a Lunar New Year event, where the senator received an omen of good luck: In a traditional ceremony, featuring costumed dancers dressed as lions, scattering vegetables in the crowd, a piece of lettuce landed on New York’s senior senator. \n \n “When he caught a piece, he said: ‘I guess I have good fortune coming my way,’ ” Mr. Adams recalled. “He should thank that lion.”', 'If Mitt Romney loses his run for the White House, a turning point will have been his decision Monday to absolve President Obama of raising taxes on the middle class. He is managing to turn the only possible silver lining in Chief Justice John Roberts\'s ObamaCare salvage operation—that the mandate to buy insurance or pay a penalty is really a tax—into a second political defeat. \n \n Appearing on MSNBC, close Romney adviser Eric Fehrnstrom was asked by host Chuck Todd if Mr. Romney ""agrees with the president"" and ""believes that you shouldn\'t call the tax penalty a tax, you should call it a penalty or a fee or a fine?"" \n \n ""That\'s correct,"" Mr. Fehrnstrom replied, before attempting some hapless spin suggesting that Mr. Obama must be ""held accountable"" for his own ""contradictory"" statements on whether it is a penalty or tax. Predictably, the Obama campaign and the media blew past Mr. Fehrnstrom\'s point, jumped on the tax-policy concession, and declared the health-care tax debate closed. \n \n Assistant editorial page editor James Freeman on the GOP\'s muddled message over whether the individual mandate constitutes a tax. Photo: Associated Press \n \n For conservative optimists who think Mr. Fehrnstrom misspoke or is merely dense, his tax absolution gift to Mr. Obama was confirmed by campaign spokeswoman Andrea Saul, who tried the same lame jujitsu spin. In any event, Mr. Fehrnstrom is part of the Boston coterie who are closest to Mr. Romney, and he wouldn\'t say such a thing without the candidate\'s approval. \n \n In a stroke, the Romney campaign contradicted Republicans throughout the country who had used the Chief Justice\'s opinion to declare accurately that Mr. Obama had raised taxes on the middle class. Three-quarters of those who will pay the mandate tax will make less than $120,000 a year, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The Romney high command has muddied the tax issue in a way that will help Mr. Obama\'s claims that he is merely taxing rich folks like Mr. Romney. And it has made it that much harder for Republicans to again turn ObamaCare into the winning issue it was in 2010. \n \n Why make such an unforced error? Because it fits with Mr. Romney\'s fear of being labeled a flip-flopper, as if that is worse than confusing voters about the tax and health-care issues. Mr. Romney favored the individual mandate as part of his reform in Massachusetts, and as we\'ve said from the beginning of his candidacy his failure to admit that mistake makes him less able to carry the anti-ObamaCare case to voters. \n \n Mr. Romney should use the Supreme Court opinion as an opening to say that now that the mandate is defined as a tax for the purposes of the law, he will work to repeal it. This would let Mr. Romney show voters that Mr. Obama\'s spending ambitions are so vast that they can\'t be financed solely by the wealthy but will inevitably hit the middle class. \n \n Democrats would point to the Massachusetts record, but Mr. Romney could reply that was before the Supreme Court had spoken, that he had promised Bay Staters not to raise taxes, and so now the right policy is to repeal the tax along with the rest of ObamaCare. The tragedy is that for the sake of not abandoning his faulty health-care legacy in Massachusetts, Mr. Romney is jeopardizing his chance at becoming President. \n \n Perhaps Mr. Romney is slowly figuring this out, because in a July 4 interview he stated himself that the penalty now is a ""tax"" after all. But he offered no elaboration, and so the campaign looks confused in addition to being politically dumb. \n \n This latest mistake is of a piece with the campaign\'s insular staff and strategy that are slowly squandering an historic opportunity. Mr. Obama is being hurt by an economic recovery that is weakening for the third time in three years. But Mr. Romney hasn\'t been able to take advantage, and if anything he is losing ground. \n \n The Romney campaign thinks it can play it safe and coast to the White House by saying the economy stinks and it\'s Mr. Obama\'s fault. We\'re on its email list and the main daily message from the campaign is that ""Obama isn\'t working."" Thanks, guys, but Americans already know that. What they want to hear from the challenger is some understanding of why the President\'s policies aren\'t working and how Mr. Romney\'s policies will do better. \n \n Meanwhile, the Obama campaign is assailing Mr. Romney as an out-of-touch rich man, and the rich man obliged by vacationing this week at his lake-side home with a jet-ski cameo. Team Obama is pounding him for Bain Capital, and until a recent ad in Ohio the Romney campaign has been slow to respond. \n \n Team Obama is now opening up a new assault on Mr. Romney as a job outsourcer with foreign bank accounts, and if the Boston boys let that one go unanswered, they ought to be fired for malpractice. \n \n *** \n \n All of these attacks were predictable, in particular because they go to the heart of Mr. Romney\'s main campaign theme—that he can create jobs as President because he is a successful businessman and manager. But candidates who live by biography typically lose by it. See President John Kerry. \n \n The biography that voters care about is their own, and they want to know how a candidate is going to improve their future. That means offering a larger economic narrative and vision than Mr. Romney has so far provided. It means pointing out the differences with specificity on higher taxes, government-run health care, punitive regulation, and the waste of politically-driven government spending. \n \n Mr. Romney promised Republicans he was the best man to make the case against President Obama, whom they desperately want to defeat. So far Mr. Romney is letting them down. \n \n Printed in The Wall Street Journal, page 9']",2,"– The Senate powered through an 18-hour session that ended at 3:28am this morning, giving a yea or nay to more than 50 amendments in a ""vote-a-rama"" marathon and, in a 52-46 vote, approving a budget that looks to pave the way for dumping ObamaCare, Reuters reports. Not one Democrat said yes to the plan, the New York Times reports. The GOP plan for purging deficits by 2025 without raising taxes: slash $5.1 trillion in social ""safety net"" and other programs. What's going to rise amid the deep cuts is military funding, with a proposal to funnel about $38 billion over to a war-funding account. The Senate now begins a spring recess, so come mid-April, the approved Senate budget will need to be reconciled with the House budget that passed Wednesday. The Times notes it would be ""the first common congressional budget in a decade."" While not legally binding or in need of Obama's signature, the legislation informs spending limits for domestic and military programs, per the Times, and lays the groundwork for future bills that seem destined for veto fights with the president, the AP notes. ""Fortunately for the country, the Republican budget will not become law,"" Harry Reid tells the Times. Two GOPers voted ""nay"" to the plan: presidential wannabes Ted Cruz and Rand Paul. As for the dozens of amendments that flew through the approval process, there were some conciliatory overtures from the Republican side: They helped sail through amendments on Social Security and veteran benefits for same-sex couples, and 14 GOPers voted to pass an amendment that calls for American workers to earn paid sick leave, Reuters notes."

74,"['Just an hour or two a week confers life-extension benefits, researcher contends. (HealthDay)—A little jogging is good for your health, researchers say, but too much might not be. \n \n ""In this study, the dose of running that was most favorable for reducing mortality was jogging 1 to 2.4 hours per week, with no more than three running days per week,"" said study researcher Jacob Marott of the Frederiksberg Hospital in Copenhagen, Denmark. The best pace was slow or average—about 5 miles per hour, he added. \n \n Out of a pool of about 5,000 healthy Danish adults, Marott and his colleagues followed nearly 1,100 healthy joggers and 413 sedentary people for more than 12 years. The joggers noted their hours and frequency of jogging, and their perception of their pace. \n \n The strenuous joggers, the investigators found, were as likely to die during that time period as the sedentary non-joggers. Light joggers and moderate joggers fared better, in that order, Marott\'s team found. \n \n The findings were released online Feb. 2 in advance of publication in the Feb. 10 print edition of the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. \n \n What is it about strenuous running that might be harmful? ""We believe that long-term strenuous endurance exercise may induce pathological structural remodeling of the heart and large arteries,"" Marott said. \n \n However, a U.S.-based researcher said the debate about the optimal dose of running for longevity is far from resolved. \n \n The new study has limitations, said D.C. (Duck-chul) Lee, an assistant professor of kinesiology at Iowa State University, who co-authored an editorial accompanying the study. \n \n In Lee\'s own study of 55,000 adults, including more than 13,000 runners, he found a lower risk of death over the follow-up period in joggers with the highest running time and frequency—nearly three hours a week and at least six times a week—compared with non-runners. It was published in 2014, also in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. \n \n In the Copenhagen study, joggers self-reported their pace. Even the slow joggers were getting vigorous exercise, the researchers said. \n \n ""The reported pace was not an absolute pace in miles per hours, but the subjects\' own perception of pace as slow, average or fast,"" Marott said. He said that\'s more appropriate than an absolute scale when the age range is as wide as it was in their study (ages 20 to 95). In general, however, the slow or average pace was about 5 miles per hour or a 12-minute mile, and the fast pace was 7 miles per hour or about an 8-minute mile, he said. \n \n In the United States, about 54 million people run regularly, according to background information with the study. In 2013, more than 540,000 people finished a marathon (26.2 miles), and nearly 2 million completed a half marathon. \n \n One limitation of the current study, Lee said, is that a very small group logged the most jogging time. Just 47 joggers put in more than four hours a week, and only 80 ran more than three times a week. These small numbers could have affected the comparisons and results, Lee said. \n \n Also, the researchers didn\'t look at more than 3,500 active non-joggers who exercised in other ways, Lee said. The researchers looked only at death from all causes, he said, instead of looking to see if high jogging miles and times affected certain causes of death, which could have given more specific information about potential harms. \n \n ""More [running] may be worse only in cardiovascular disease,"" he said. In another assessments on the effects of running and death rates, Lee\'s group found that death from all causes was lower in runners compared with non-runners, regardless of how much they ran, but there was a slight trend for less benefit from higher doses when compared with lower doses. \n \n The study\'s good news, Lee said, is that the researchers found benefit even in jogging less than an hour a week, or even once a week, compared to not jogging at all. Perhaps this will motivate sedentary people to get moving, he said. \n \n Although the study by Marott and colleagues found an association between light jogging and improved survival rates, it did not prove a cause-and-effect relationship. \n \n ""Basically, the study still shows it\'s a much better option to prescribe some form of running as a part of a healthy lifestyle and that sedentary behavior is not a prescription for long-term health and mortality,"" said Dave Watt, executive director of the American Running Association and the American Medical Athletic Association. \n \n Explore further: Regular jogging shows dramatic increase in life expectancy \n \n More information: For tips on starting to exercise, see the American Heart Association.', 'Chances are, you\'ve heard the label of being a ""right-brained"" or ""left-brained"" thinker. Logical, detail-oriented and analytical? That\'s left-brained behavior. Creative, thoughtful and subjective? Your brain\'s right side functions stronger -- or so long-held assumptions suggest. \n \n But newly released research findings from University of Utah neuroscientists assert that there is no evidence within brain imaging that indicates some people are right-brained or left-brained. \n \n For years in popular culture, the terms left-brained and right-brained have come to refer to personality types, with an assumption that some people use the right side of their brain more, while some use the left side more. \n \n Following a two-year study, University of Utah researchers have debunked that myth through identifying specific networks in the left and right brain that process lateralized functions. Lateralization of brain function means that there are certain mental processes that are mainly specialized to one of the brain\'s left or right hemispheres. During the course of the study, researchers analyzed resting brain scans of 1,011 people between the ages of seven and 29. In each person, they studied functional lateralization of the brain measured for thousands of brain regions -- finding no relationship that individuals preferentially use their left -brain network or right- brain network more often. \n \n ""It\'s absolutely true that some brain functions occur in one or the other side of the brain. Language tends to be on the left, attention more on the right. But people don\'t tend to have a stronger left- or right-sided brain network. It seems to be determined more connection by connection, "" said Jeff Anderson, M.D., Ph.D., lead author of the study, which is formally titled ""An Evaluation of the Left-Brain vs. Right-Brain Hypothesis with Resting State Functional Connectivity Magnetic Resonance Imaging."" It is published in the journal PLOS ONE this month. \n \n Researchers obtained brain scans for the population they studied from a database called INDI, the International Neuroimaging Data-Sharing Initiative. The participants\' scans were taken during a functional connectivity MRI analysis, meaning a participant laid in a scanner for 5 to 10 minutes while their resting brain activity was analyzed. \n \n By viewing brain activity, scientists can correlate brain activity in one region of the brain compared to another. In the study, researchers broke up the brain into 7,000 regions and examined which regions of the brain were more lateralized. They looked for connections -- or all of the possible combinations of brain regions -- and added up the number of connections for each brain region that was left- lateralized or right-lateralized. They discovered patterns in brain imaging for why a brain connection might be strongly left- or right-lateralized, said Jared Nielsen, a graduate student in neuroscience who carried out the study as part of his coursework. \n \n ""If you have a connection that is strongly left- lateralized, it relates to other strongly lateralized connection only if both sets of connections have a brain region in common,"" said Nielsen. \n \n Results of the study are groundbreaking, as they may change the way people think about the old right-brain versus left-brain theory, he said. \n \n ""Everyone should understand the personality types associated with the terminology \'left-brained\' and \'right-brained\' and how they relate to him or her personally; however, we just don\'t see patterns where the whole left-brain network is more connected or the whole right-brain network is more connected in some people. It may be that personality types have nothing to do with one hemisphere being more active, stronger, or more connected,"" said Nielsen.']",2,"– It's common knowledge that a healthy person shouldn't sit around all day, but new research on running is emphasizing the opposite danger. Running too much can be just as bad for you as being sedentary, the study suggests. Researchers tracked some 1,100 healthy runners and 413 sedentary folks over a period of more than 12 years, HealthDay reports via Medical Xpress. People ranged in age from 20 to 95. The risk of dying during the study turned out to be approximately the same among heavy runners—those who ran quickly more than three days a week for a total of more than four hours—and sedentary people who rarely exercised, Time reports. The best plan, according to the study, was to run lightly: The group that had the best results ran at a slow-ish pace (about 5mph) less than three times each week, going for an hour to 2.4 hours total. Even a group that ran a bit more often and longer saw a slight increase in death risk, Time notes. The findings could perhaps relate to cardiovascular problems previously observed in the most die-hard runners and cyclists. ""If you want to do something good for yourself, you don’t have to be extreme,"" says a study author. But another researcher points to a number of possible flaws in the findings, including the fact that the hardest-running group was quite small.

clashes rocked a district of the capital near the heart of the embattled regime. \n \n France, meanwhile, pressed the UN Security Council to adopt a statement backing international envoy Kofi Annan\'s mission to end bloodshed that has cost an estimated more than 9,100 lives in the past year. \n \n President Bashar al-Assad\'s security forces launched attacks in several regions, opposition activists said. \n \n Pre-dawn fighting in a heavily guarded area of Damascus, the capital\'s fiercest since the revolt against Assad\'s regime erupted, came as residents still reeled from deadly weekend bombings. \n \n At least three rebels and a member of the security forces were killed in the upscale western neighbourhood of Mazzeh, state television and monitors said. \n \n ""Three terrorists were killed and a fourth was arrested in the fighting between security forces and an armed terrorist gang sheltered in a house of a residential district,"" the TV reported. \n \n Rami Abdel Rahman, head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said four rebels were killed. \n \n Mourtada Rasheed, an activist in Damascus, said blasts and heavy shooting could be heard in Mazzeh and two other districts -- Qaboon and Arbeen. \n \n In Russia, International Committee of the Red Cross chief Jakob Kellenberger met Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, whose country is an ally of Damascus and has some influence on the regime. \n \n ""The two parties call for the Syrian government and armed groups to immediately agree to a daily humanitarian truce to allow the ICRC access to the wounded and to civilians who need to be evacuated,"" the foreign ministry said. \n \n Moscow ""underscored the need to allow the ICRC access to all detained persons in Syria following the protests"" against Assad\'s regime. \n \n An ICRC spokeswoman said the Moscow meeting was part of Kellenberger\'s broader efforts to prompt world powers to secure commitments from the regime and rebels to lay down their arms for a few hours each day. \n \n ""The ICRC hopes to see concrete results of such meetings on the ground in the coming days and weeks,"" Victoria Zotikova told AFP. \n \n Kellenberger expressed fears that much of Syria could soon be engulfed in the type of brutal violence recently seen in the flashpoint city of Homs, where hundreds died in more than a month of shelling and a subsequent army assault. \n \n ""This is absolutely unacceptable to us,"" he told ITAR-TASS. \n \n Meanwhile, a mission sent by former UN secretary general Kofi Annan arrived in Damascus for talks on a monitoring operation to end the conflict. \n \n ""There are five people with expertise in political, peacekeeping and mediation,"" Annan spokesman Ahmad Fawzi told AFP. \n \n ""They will be staying for as long as they are making progress on reaching agreement on practical steps to implement Mr Annan\'s proposals,"" he added. \n \n On Monday, France proposed a UN Security Council statement giving strong backing to Annan\'s efforts. \n \n ""The aim now is to find common ground and send a strong message to the Damascus regime,"" a diplomat in New York said, with French Ambassador Gerard Araud saying Paris hopes for a vote on Tuesday. \n \n The Annan proposal includes a halt to the violence, humanitarian access, the release of detainees held over the past year and withdrawal of security forces from protest cities. \n \n As a condition for ceasefire talks, the Damascus government insisted that the opposition had to lay down its arms, diplomats at the United Nations said. \n \n At the same time, neighbouring countries had to guarantee they would not send weapons to Syrian groups or give political or financial support to the opposition, they told AFP on condition of anonymity. \n \n Separately, technical experts from the UN and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation are taking part in a Syrian government-led mission to assess the impact of the deadly crackdown. \n \n The mission to 15 cities, on the first such assignment in Syria since the violence started, was launched in Homs on Sunday. \n \n Monday\'s clashes in the capital came after twin car bombs ripped through two neighbourhoods of Damascus on Saturday, killing 27 people, according to an interior ministry toll. \n \n An Observatory statement said fresh fighting erupted later on Monday between rebels and security forces in the Qaboon and Barzeh areas of Damascus. \n \n Troops backed by dozens of tanks also raided districts of Deir Ezzor city in eastern Syria, the Observatory said, a day after at least 25 army deserters were killed in seizing its Hamidiyeh district. \n \n Five soldiers, including two officers, were also killed, it said. \n \n And troops bombarded the Bab Sbaa, Khalidiyeh and Karm al-Shami districts of Homs, the

The tax rate for recreational pot is 33 to 38 percent, depending on local regulations, with all state and local taxes included.

78,"['ROME — In his narrowest escape yet, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi barely survived a confidence vote on Friday, saving his government from collapse but leaving it all but incapable of legislating effectively. \n \n With 316 votes for and 301 votes against, Mr. Berlusconi’s center-right coalition won the vote. But it failed to secure a solid majority, making it increasingly difficult for him to pass legislation aimed at protecting Italy from Europe’s sovereign debt crisis. Had he lost, Mr. Berlusconi would have had to resign, marking the end of an 18-year political era in which the billionaire businessman shaped Italian politics in his own image, entwining the country’s fate with his own. \n \n In what the daily Corriere della Sera called “an atmosphere of interminable agony,” analysts said the Berlusconi government was now hanging by a thread and could fall at the next bump in the road — when enough disgruntled lawmakers from within Mr. Berlusconi’s coalition calculate that they would be safer jumping off a sinking ship rather than staying aboard and risking drowning. \n \n Mr. Berlusconi called the confidence vote after failing to pass a routine measure this week. Addressing lawmakers on Thursday, the prime minister said he was the only “credible alternative” able to govern Italy through the economic crisis, and refused to step down. \n \n Since 2009, the European debt crisis has felled governments in Ireland, Portugal and Slovakia, led to early elections in Spain and a cabinet reshuffle in Greece. So far, Mr. Berlusconi has proven to be a tough outlier — not least because the European Central Bank in August agreed to buy Italian debt. But the bank did this in exchange for promised structural changes that the government has not yet carried out, a mix of tax increases and changes to the pension system. The results of Friday’s vote promise to make that even more difficult. \n \n This week, opposition leaders — and the president of Italy, in an unusually strong statement — told Mr. Berlusconi that surviving a confidence vote was not the same as governing. In the statement, President Giorgio Napolitano said the prime minister had to show the “necessary cohesion” to tackle Italy’s budget deficits and to propose “adequate solutions to the urgent problems of the country, including in meeting its European obligations.” \n \n Despite deep divisions over economic policy, the center-left opposition has repeatedly called on Mr. Berlusconi to step down. \n \n “This government will die from confidence,” the leader of the center-left opposition, Pierluigi Bersani, said after Friday’s vote, the ANSA news agency reported. “Starting tomorrow, the political problems will be even more evident,” he added, reiterating his calls for Mr. Berlusconi to step down. Another leading opposition politician, Antonio Di Pietro of the Italy of Values Party, has repeatedly accused Mr. Berlusconi of buying the votes of would-be dissidents within his own center-right coalition. \n \n On Friday, Mr. Berlusconi was saved by loyalists who prefer to have the government limp along rather than fall and potentially be replaced by a group of nonpolitical technocrats with a mandate to carry out the structural changes including tax increases, changes to the pension system and a growth stimulus bill now deadlocked in Parliament. \n \n Foreign investors and many of Italy’s business leaders hope for such a technical government, but lawmakers have resisted out of fears of losing power. \n \n Friday’s vote made clear that Italy had been living with the shadow of Mr. Berlusconi. \n \n “In this interminable twilight, the man who was Berlusconi remains true to his salesman’s essence,” the satirist and political commentator Massimo Gramellini wrote recently in the Turin daily La Stampa. He will continue to survive, Mr. Gramellini added, until his supporters “start to deny that a man like that, capable of selling us nothing for 20 years, ever really existed.”', 'Italian Premier Silvio Berlusconi survived a confidence vote in Parliament on Friday, but his narrow majority raises doubts over his ability to govern effectively when the country needs a steady hand during its economic crisis. \n \n Italian Premier Silvio Berlusconi sits in the lower chamber to attend a confidence vote, in Rome, Friday, Oct. 14, 2011.

After days of tension, the premier\'s allies clapped when the result of the vote was announced. \n \n Berlusconi has been weakened by sex scandals and criticized for his handling of Italy\'s economy. He has been facing repeated calls for his resignation from his political rivals, labor unions and parts of the business community that once considered him their savior. \n \n Even some of his own allies have openly expressed disappointment, with at least two deserting the crucial vote Friday. \n \n Had he lost the vote of confidence, Berlusconi would have been forced to resign _ about 1 1/2 years before the end of his term, in 2013. \n \n Three ratings agencies have downgraded Italy\'s public debt, citing the country\'s political gridlock and low growth prospects as key reasons. The vote Friday appeared to do little to reassure markets. \n \n ""The best signal that Italy could have sent to the markets would have been to boot Mr. Berlusconi out, but it has failed to do so,"" said Sony Kapoor, managing director of Re-Define an Economic Think Tank, shortly after the vote. ""With Mr. Berlusconi still at the helm, there is nothing that Italy can do from within that will restore market confidence."" \n \n The 75-year-old leader has steadfastly hung onto power despite the scandals and four criminal trials in Milan.

He said the vote Friday amounted to an ""ambush"" by the opposition, and moments after the vote, he spoke to reporters about his plan to spur the country\'s moribund economy. \n \n Italy is under pressure to come up with growth-promoting measures to avert being dragged into the widening sovereign debt crisis. \n \n This week, Central Bank chief Mario Draghi, who takes over the helm of the European Central Bank on Nov. 1, urged the government to act more quickly to implement reforms that can spur growth _ beyond the austerity package that put Italy on the path to balance its budget by 2013. \n \n Otherwise, Draghi warned that the rising cost of borrowing to service national debt seen over the last three months will eat up ""no small part"" of the austerity package approved by Parliament last month. \n \n ""The goal of relaunching growth is finally largely shared, but the adoption of the measures necessary so far have banged up against apparently insurmountable difficulties,"" Draghi said.']",2,"– Silvio Berlusconi squeaked through a confidence vote in the Italian parliament today, but the agonizingly close 316-301 vote didn’t exactly inspire, well, confidence. Berlusconi’s majority is so slim that it effectively cannot pass legislation, the New York Times reports, and analysts say that the slightest bump in the road could break the fragile coalition entirely. Berlusconi called the vote himself after failing a routine vote this week and refusing calls to step down. Berlusconi survived thanks to loyalists afraid his government would be replaced by a non-political technocratic one seeking structural changes to Italy’s economy—a government they’d have no place in. Of course, many business leaders were hoping for exactly that. “The best signal that Italy could have sent to the markets would have been to boot Mr. Berlusconi out, but it has failed to do so,” one economic think tank director tells the AP. Opponents, meanwhile, complained that Berlusconi can win confidence votes, but cannot govern. “He only knows how to stay stuck in his seat using tricks,” one opposition leader complained."

A thick crust would be bad news for life because it would mean the ocean could never splash up on Europa’s shores to interact with possible sources of food needed to sustain life. \n \n New research announced Wednesday indicates the crust is thick, but it also shows that there are lakes above the oceans and that they are churning. This is key, because it means possible life forms in Europa’s oceans could make it the surface via the lakes to find food. \n \n ""One opinion in the scientific community has been, \'If the ice shell is thick, that\'s bad for biology — that it might mean the surface isn\'t communicating with the underlying ocean,\' "" according to Britney Schmidt, a postdoctoral fellow at The University of Texas at Austin\'s Institute for Geophysics and the lead author of a new study published in the journal Nature. \n \n ""Now we see evidence that even though the ice shell is thick, it can mix vigorously. That could make Europa and its ocean more habitable,"" she said in a statement. \n \n This is fantastic news for scientists hoping find signs of life on Europa, said Niebur. \n \n The lakes are estimated to be 2 to 3 miles below the crust, while the oceans are estimated to be 30 miles down, Niebur said. “It’s a missing link to understanding to whether it (Europa) could support life.” \n \n Scientists are basing their findings, in part, on what they learned from images taken by the old Galileo spacecraft, which was launched in 1989 to gather data and images from Jupiter and its moons. (It crashed into Jupiter in 2003). Those pictures show round bumps called chaos terrains. Based on the way ice moves around on Earth, the researchers developed a model to explain the bumps. \n \n The only way to confirm the model would be to fly a spacecraft to Europa to investigate. A mission is on the drawing board, but NASA hasn’t approved anything yet, according to Niebur.', 'These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to. That way, as the pages that are referenced are changed or taken from the web, a link to the version that was live when the page was written will be preserved.Then the Internet Archive hopes that references to these archived pages will be put in place of a link that would be otherwise be broken, or a companion link to allow people to see what was originally intended by a page\'s authors.The goal is to fix all broken links on the web . Crawls of supported ""No More 404"" sites.']",2,"– The chances of life existing on Jupiter's ice-covered moon Europa—and of Earthlings being able to find it—are looking a lot stronger, NASA scientists say. A vast ocean is believed to lie beneath as much as 20 miles of ice on Europa, but new research suggests that huge lakes exist a lot closer to the surface. A suspected interchange of water between the lakes and the ocean means that nutrients could be transferred from near the surface to life far below, the BBC reports. The research team examined bumps known as ""chaos terrain"" on Europa's surface and developed models based on the way ice moves around on Earth. If the researchers are right, ""you've moved from a system that checks one of the requirements for life to a system that checks two requirements for life,"" an astrobiologist tells the Christian Science Monitor. The only way to confirm the findings would be to send a spacecraft to Europa to investigate. A mission is on the drawing board but NASA hasn't approved anything yet, CNN notes."

He dressed many a First Lady in his illustrious career, such as Jackie Kennedy, Nancy Reagan, Hillary Clinton, Laura Bush, and Michelle Obama. \n \n During a 2009 interview with Vanity Fair’s John Heilpern, the designer admitted that the “ladies who lunch” were never his target clients. \n \n “Let me tell you, it was never the ladies who lunch. They never lunched! They always wanted to stay thin.” \n \n “You want to know who my customer is?” he asked. “All the women who can afford to buy my clothes! My customers are successful workingwomen. They might be spending less at the moment, but my approach is that fashion must always be optimistic, and that a woman will always be enticed by beautiful clothes.” \n \n In recent years, those working women could quite often be found on awards season red carpets.

""You want to know who my customer is?” he once asked. ""All the women who can afford to buy my clothes!"" He began work in fashion design in the 1950s in Spain, when the wife of the then-US ambassador saw his drawings and sought a dress for her daughter. His career moved him to Paris and eventually the US in 1963. By the 1970s, de la Renta and his first wife, Françoise de Langlade, were ""the Social Lions of New York,"" André Leon Talley writes in Vogue.

The 25-year-old singer is approaching the 54-year-old industry veteran\'s record for the most No. 1 songs on Billboard\'s Dance/Club Play Songs chart. \n \n Rihanna\'s recent hit ""Right Now"" topped the dance chart this week, giving Rih her 20th No. 1 song in the category, according to Billboard. Rih beat out Janet Jackson with this total, who was formerly in second place with 19 entries on the chart. With hits including ""Pon De Replay,"" ""Only Girl (In the World),"" and ""We Found Love,"" Rihanna now holds the number two spot, only falling behind Madonna. \n \n Madonna shouldn\'t be too worried -- the iconic pop star currently holds the title for most No. 1 songs on the dance chart with 43, more than double Rihanna\'s take. While Rihanna nabbed her first No. 1 for the category in 2005, Madonna charted her first dance hit in 1983. \n \n In typical Rihanna-style, the singer could be seen wearing highly risque getups celebrating Crop Over festivities in Barbados.

89,"['Rep. Anthony Weiner rejected Democratic leaders’ private and public calls for his resignation Saturday, choosing instead to take a leave of absence from the House to seek professional treatment amid an online sex scandal that the head of the party called a “sordid affair.” \n \n Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, (D-Fla.), House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Rep. Steve Israel, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, turned on Weiner the day after it was revealed he had contacted a 17-year-old Delaware girl through social media. Though Weiner, Delaware police and the girl’s family say there was nothing indecent in the back-and-forth, the development added intrigue to the New York Democrat’s confession on Monday that he sent sexually charged text messages and photographs to six women over the past three years. \n \n Text Size - \n \n + \n \n reset VIDEO: Weiner’s teary presser POLITICO 44 \n \n For now, his vow to remain in office stands, but he didn’t appear dug in: He left open the possibility, for the first time, of leaving, with a statement that suggested he needs to be in a better mental position to make a decision about his future. \n \n “Congressman Weiner departed this morning to seek professional treatment to focus on becoming a better husband and healthier person,” Weiner’s office said in a statement provided to POLITICO. “In light of that, he will request a short leave of absence from the House of Representatives so that he can get evaluated and map out a course of treatment to make himself well. Congressman Weiner takes the views of his colleagues very seriously and has determined that he needs this time to get healthy and make the best decision possible for himself, his family and his constituents.” \n \n But the mass abandonment from party leaders means Weiner will go it alone if, after reflection and treatment, he believes he can salvage a once-promising career in which he used bombastic floor speeches, frequent cable television appearances and, ironically, an understanding of the power of social media to become an icon for national progressives. The story of Weiner’s political career hasn’t yet reached its conclusion, but the onetime protagonist is now cast as the antagonist. \n \n The decision to seek treatment buys Weiner time, but the statement from his aides suggests he might still quit rather than return to Congress after his leave of absence. \n \n Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), the former DCCC chairman and top Democrat on the House Budget Committee, added his name to the list of Democratic officials who have called on Weiner to resign. “Anthony Weiner’s repeated violation of the public trust is unacceptable,” Van Hollen said. “He can best advance the issues he fought for by resigning immediately.” \n \n In addition to Wasserman Schultz, two former DNC chairmen, Ed Rendell and Tim Kaine, have said Weiner should step down, as have several of Weiner’s rank-and-file congressional colleagues. \n \n However, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), the No. 3 Democrat in the Senate, and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) both approved of Weiner’s decision to seek treatment and did not call for his resignation. \n \n Schumer, Weiner’s former boss, said: “I am heartbroken. For those of us who are longtime friends of Anthony Weiner, his wrongful behavior is distressing and saddening. It’s clear he needs professional help, and I am glad he is seeking it.” \n \n Gillibrand said: “My heart is with Anthony’s wife and family. My office will work to ensure all the constituents of the 9th congressional District are fully served during any leave of absence by Congressman Weiner.” \n \n On Friday, FOX News reported that Wilmington-area police had visited a Delaware teenager to discuss Weiner’s electronic exchange with her. \n \n Though Weiner and the girl’s family have told news outlets that there was no sex-related communication, the revelation that he carried on a discussion of any kind with a 17-year-old girl pumped more life into a scandal that has now spanned three weekends.', 'Associated Press Condoleezza Rice\'s inclusion on the Republican ticket would scramble the race in ways few other candidates could. \n \n A new round of speculation about Mitt Romney\'s running-mate deliberations ensued after a media report mentioned an unconventional choice: former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. \n \n The Drudge Report website set Washington ablaze in another round of the vice-presidential guessing game Thursday night by posting an item attributed to ""sources"" naming her as one of the top contenders to be the presumptive Republican nominee\'s running mate. \n \n The item mentioned a fundraising email Ms. Rice, 57 years old, sent Thursday night on Mr. Romney\'s behalf as part of the campaign\'s ""Meet the VP"" drive, an initiative intended to increase the number of small-dollar donors in which the winners get to meet the candidate and his eventual running mate. \n \n A new round of speculation about Mitt Romney\'s running-mate deliberations ensued after a media report mentioned an unconventional choice: former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. Sara Murray has details on Lunch Break. (Photo: Getty Images) \n \n No one in the Romney camp would confirm or deny the story, in keeping with the campaign\'s tight-lipped approach to the selection process. But it\'s possible the item was a trial balloon from the campaign attempting to gauge the reaction to Ms. Rice as a possible pick. \n \n The report caused outsize fanfare because Romney campaign manager Matt Rhoades has a close working relationship with Matt Drudge, who launched the site in the 1990s and made his preference for the former Massachusetts governor clear during the Republican primary. \n \n Mr. Rhoades sent an email to supporters late Thursday night alerting them to the campaign\'s latest fundraising push, telling the recipients, ""Sometime between now and the Republican convention, Mitt will be announcing his choice for VP."" \n \n Earlier this week, Mr. Romney told a crowd in Grand Junction, Colo., ""I can tell you…the person I choose, you will look at and say, well, that\'s a person who could be president, if that were necessary."" He said, ""And that, for me, is the most important single criteria."" \n \n Ms. Rice\'s assets are obvious: She\'s a woman; she\'s black; she has extensive foreign-policy experience; and her inclusion on the ticket would scramble the race in ways few other candidates could. \n \n Her liabilities are also easy to cite: She has favored abortion rights, a position Mr. Romney has moved away from; she has never run for elected office; she waged frequent battles with former Vice President Dick Cheney; and many conservatives believe she was soft on Iran and North Korea policies during the George W. Bush administration. \n \n Her tenure in that administration would also feed Democratic criticism that Mr. Romney represents another four years of Mr. Bush. \n \n Still, in a CNN poll of Republicans in April, Ms. Rice drew the highest levels of support as a possible running mate. \n \n Twenty-six percent of the respondents picked her, compared with 21% for former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum and 14% for both New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. The poll showed Ms. Rice to have an approval rating of 80%. \n \n Who Might Be a Romney Running Mate?

But he cited her high approval ratings in polls and said, ""As a cold blooded political matter, you look at that kind of number and what she could do for me, and you have to be a little bit tempted if you were Mitt Romney."" \n \n Mr. Romney has offered few clues about whom he will tap—or even when he would make the announcement. The only name he has confirmed is Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, an announcement made to refute news reports that said the first-term senator wasn\'t in the running. \n \n Ms. Rice sparked vice-presidential speculation late last month by delivering a speech to Romney donors at a retreat for his top financial backers in Park City, Utah.

Per a study in the American Journal of Human Genetics, researchers from the UK's Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute sequenced the genomes of five 4,000-year-old Canaanites, as well as 99 people now residing in Lebanon—DNA evidence that enabled the scientists to establish ancestry. The study results show an overwhelming majority of the genetic makeup (93%) of today's Lebanese can be traced back to the Canaanites, per the Times of Israel. Study co-author Chris Tyler-Smith calls that percentage ""quite surprising,"" given the ""enormously complex history of this region,"" per ScienceDaily. The Bible's Book of Deuteronomy lays out what was to happen to the Canaanites: ""Completely destroy them ... as the Lord your God has commanded you. Otherwise, they will teach you to follow all the detestable things they do."" But some Bible verses contradict the story of total annihilation, and the researchers write that ""no archaeological evidence has so far been found to support widespread destruction of Canaanite cities between the Bronze and Iron Ages."" The Canaanites made a major cultural impact during the Bronze Age, including introducing what's believed to have been the first alphabet. This new discovery sheds a bit more light on the rather mysterious group, who didn't leave much in the way of written records. (This find could reveal the truth about Goliath's people.)"

It is not enough to know the strategies; you have to do them to reap the rewards. Using the techniques on a temporary basis can lead to permanent change. Apart from the techniques, the course will also shed light on many parenting misconceptions and ineffective strategies that are routinely used. \n \n Here is a sample of what you will learn \n \n How to Register \n \n The Everyday Parenting: The ABCs of Child Rearing course is now available on Coursera for free*.

The antecedent is the setup, telling a child, specifically, what you want them to do before you want them to do it. Behaviors are where the behavior is defined and shaped, modeled by the parent. And the consequence involves an expression of approval when that behavior is performed, an over-the top Broadway-style belt-it-to-the-back-row expression of praise with an accompanying physical gesture of approval. \n \n So instead of yelling at your kid every night for the shoes strewn across the floor, ask him in the morning if he can put his shoes away when he comes home. Make sure when you come home that you put your own shoes away. And if your child puts his shoes away, or even puts them closer to where they’re supposed to be, tell him that he did a great job and then hug him. \n \n The ABC method of praise is a highly specific technique. You have to be effusive, so you actually have to put a big dumb smile on your face and even wave your hands in the air. Next thing is you have to say, in a very high, cheerful voice, exactly what you’re praising. And then the third part is you have to touch the child and give him some kind of nonverbal praise. The silliness is a feature, not a bug. It makes the kid notice the praise that accompanies correct behavior. And that’s the point. \n \n “We want to build habits,” Dr. Kazdin said. “The practice actually changes the brain, and in the process of that, the behaviors that you want to get rid of, having all kinds of temper tantrums and all the fights, all that just disappears.” Furthermore, he noted, “as a side effect, when you do these things, the parents’ depression and stress in fact go down and family relations pick up.” \n \n If our kids behave better, then we won’t feel like yelling. And if we don’t yell, our kids will behave better.']",2,"– In the 1960s, 94% of parents used physical punishment on their children. In 2010, just 22% of parents did. Parents have figured out that there's a better way than spanking—and now it's time for yelling to experience that same reckoning. Most parents today yell at their kids, and in the New York Times, Stephen Marche calls the practice ""the most widespread parental stupidity around today."" Studies have found that shouting at kids can lead to increases in anxiety, stress, depression, and behavioral problems and decreases in self-esteem. It makes parents look out of control and weak, and all it accomplishes is teaching kids to yell themselves. ""Yelling, even more than spanking, is the response of a person who doesn’t know what else to do,"" Marche writes—before explaining what else you can do. He highlights the ABCs of parenting, a process that does require advance planning: A: antecedents. Instead of yelling at your children every time they leave their shoes strewn around the room, clearly explain to them what you want them to do—before you want them to do it. In this case, talk to them in the morning about putting their shoes away when they come home from school. B: behaviors. Define, shape, and model the behavior you want. Put your own shoes away, and help your kids understand what to do. C: consequences. When your child puts his or her shoes away, or even gets them closer to where they're supposed to go, go over-the-top with praise, both verbal and nonverbal (touching).

93,"['(HealthDay News) -- Babies process and preserve memories during those many naps they take during the day, a new study suggests. ""We discovered that sleeping shortly after learning helps infants to retain memories over extended periods of time,"" said study author Sabine Seehagen, a child and adolescent psychology researcher with Ruhr University Bochum in Germany. ""In both of our experiments, only those infants who took an extended nap for at least half an hour within four hours after learning remembered the information."" The study doesn\'t definitively confirm that the naps themselves help the memories stick, but the researchers believe that is happening. ""While people might assume that infants learn best when they are wide awake, our findings suggest that the time just before infants go down for sleep can be a particularly valuable learning opportunity,"" Seehagen said. Scientists have long linked more sleep to better memory, but it\'s been unclear what happens when babies spend a significant amount of time sleeping. \n \n In the new study, researchers launched two experiments. In each one, babies aged 6 months or 12 months were taught how to remove mittens from animal puppets. Then some of the babies took a nap for a half-hour and some didn\'t. A total of 216 babies were tested. \n \n Then the researchers tested the babies to see if they remembered how to remove the mittens either four or 24 hours later. \n \n The researchers found that only the babies who\'d taken naps after learning actually remembered what they\'d learned, especially after 24 hours. \n \n Study author Seehagen said it\'s ""quite unlikely"" that the babies who didn\'t nap remember less because they were tired. Still, she said more research is needed to confirm the results. \n \n So, how many naps do babies need and how long should they be? \n \n ""The small number of studies makes it difficult to make firm recommendations to parents,"" said Angela Lukowski, an assistant professor of psychology and social behavior at the University of California, Irvine. \n \n However, ""the lesson for parents seems to be that napping after learning may help infants remember information over time,"" she said. She added that naps of at least 30 minutes seem to be helpful, although there hasn\'t been much, if any, research into shorter naps. \n \n As for adults, don\'t worry about napping as a memory aid. ""There are many studies in the literature showing the benefit of naps for adults, but adults do not need to nap to retain new memories,"" said Rebecca Gomez, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Arizona. \n \n The new study is published in this week\'s issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. \n \n More information \n \n Visit Harvard Medical School\'s Healthy Sleep website for more about sleep, learning and memory.', 'Because most babies at those ages are not yet talking, the researchers had to find a nonverbal way to measure how the timing of sleep influenced the strength of a memory. Four furry puppets--two resembling mice and two resembling rabbits, each wearing a detachable felt mitten on one hand--helped researchers infer whether or not a baby had successfully committed his or her experience with the puppets to memory and stored that information for later use.', 'The potential benefits of infant sleep for memory processing are largely unexplored. Here we show evidence that having an extended nap (≥30 min) within 4 h of learning helps 6- and 12-month-old infants to retain their memories for new behaviors across a 4- and 24-h delay. These results suggest that infants rely on frequent naps for the formation of long-term memories. \n \n Abstract \n \n Human infants devote the majority of their time to sleeping. However, very little is known about the role of sleep in early memory processing. Here we test 6- and 12-mo-old infants’ declarative memory for novel actions after a 4-h [Experiment (Exp.) 1] and 24-h delay (Exp. 2). Infants in a nap condition took an extended nap (≥30 min) within 4 h after learning, whereas infants in a no-nap condition did not. A comparison with age-matched control groups revealed that after both delays, only infants who had napped after learning remembered the target actions at the test. Additionally, after the 24-h delay, memory performance of infants in the nap condition was significantly higher than that of infants in the no-nap condition. This is the first experimental evidence to our knowledge for an enhancing role of sleep in the consolidation of declarative memories in the first year of life.']",3,"– It's long been thought that napping is an important part of a baby's growth—both physically and mentally. Now new research in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences suggests that naps help babies form new memories, and that when a nap directly follows a new activity the baby is far likelier to recall it the next day than if that child doesn't nap until four hours after the activity, reports the Los Angeles Times. ""In both of our experiments, only those infants who took an extended nap for at least half an hour within four hours after learning remembered the information,"" the study's lead author tells HealthDay News. To test a baby's recall, researchers studied 216 babies ages 6 months and 12 months. They demonstrated how to remove mittens from animal puppets, and found that those who then took naps at least 30 minutes long (and typically more like 80) were better able to recall how to remove the mittens 24 hours later than those who didn't nap until four hours later. Whether a baby napped just before the experiment made no difference. The authors also hypothesize that because the hippocampal region—key to memory formation—is so small in babies, it may only be able to store smaller chunks of information, hence the need for frequent sleep early in life. (Other research shows a newborn's brain grows 1% a day.)"

95,"['A troubled patient opened fire on a caseworker and psychiatrist in a small office at a unit of Mercy Fitzgerald Hospital in Delaware County on Thursday afternoon, police said, leading the doctor to draw his own weapon and shoot the assailant. \n \n The confrontation left the caseworker, 53-year-old Theresa Hunt, dead and the 52-year-old psychiatrist, a veteran doctor at the hospital whom sources identified as Lee Silverman, with a graze wound to the head. The patient, Richard Plotts, was in critical condition Thursday night from three gunshot wounds. \n \n The violence sent a shock wave through the normally quiet campus of the medical center on the border of Darby Borough and Yeadon. Police vehicles swarmed the scene and armed officers charged through the building - the Sister Marie Lenahan Wellness Center, across Lansdowne Avenue from the main hospital - to evacuate doctors, nurses, and patients waiting for routine appointments. \n \n Authorities said they believed Silverman shot Plotts three times in the torso and arm. Silverman was expected to be released from the hospital Thursday night and recover fully. \n \n Plotts, of Upper Darby, who appeared to have a long criminal record, was undergoing surgery Thursday night at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. If he survives, he will be charged Friday with murder, Delaware County District Attorney Jack Whelan said. \n \n It was not clear why Silverman, a doctor for nearly 25 years, was armed at the office. Bernice Ho, a spokeswoman for Mercy Fitzgerald, said Thursday it was against hospital policy for anyone other than security guards to carry weapons. \n \n Donald Molineux, chief of the Yeadon Police Department, said that if Silverman returned fire and wounded Plotts, he ""without a doubt saved lives."" \n \n Mercy Fitzgerald Hospital called the incident ""a tragic event for our hospital and for our community,"" and said its community was praying for the victims. \n \n ""We are grateful for the efforts of the emergency responders, and we are working with the Delaware County police departments to understand fully the details of the event and to do all we can to assist those affected,"" hospital officials said in a statement. \n \n Founded in 1933 by the Archdiocese of Philadelphia, Mercy Fitzgerald is a 213-bed hospital that serves more than 186,000 patients each year. \n \n Why Plotts was there was unclear. Whelan said Plotts has a history of psychiatric problems. \n \n Court records show that a Delaware County man matching his name and age - authorities said Plotts was in his mid- to late 40s - was sentenced in 1996 to more than seven years in prison for robbing a bank in Wilmington. Other court records show that an Upper Darby man with the same name and age has been arrested numerous times over the last 30 years for assault, drugs, weapons possession, and other offenses. \n \n On Thursday, Whelan described how the meeting among Plotts, Silverman, and Hunt abruptly took a violent turn. \n \n Plotts and Hunt went to Silverman\'s third-floor office shortly before 2:30 p.m., Whelan said. Plotts was apparently armed, Whelan said, and people near the room soon heard shouting. \n \n Concerned, a hospital employee ""actually opened the door, saw him pointing a gun at the doctor,"" Whelan said. The worker shut the door quietly and immediately called 911. \n \n Plotts then opened fire. According to Whelan, he shot Hunt two times in the face. The psychiatrist then ducked under his desk, retrieved his gun, and came up shooting, striking Plotts three times. \n \n Staff members rushed toward the scene. Plotts ended up in the hallway, and another caseworker and a doctor tackled and pinned him, Whelan said. \n \n As police arrived, the building was being evacuated and placed in a lockdown. Patients and doctors streamed onto the lawn and driveways surrounding the building, which contains offices for outpatient services, including pediatrics, cardiology, pulmonary care, and psychiatry. \n \n Allen Williams of Upper Darby was handing over his identification and health card for his X-Ray appointment when police officers rushed into the lobby. \n \n ""They came in with guns drawn,"" he said. ""It was just a shock to me."" \n \n Alfred Williams said he had just left a doctor\'s appointment and was waiting for a ride home when, suddenly, swarms of police officers descended on the scene. \n \n ""They kept coming,"" Williams said. ""Guys with helmets and automatic weapons kept jumping out of their cars. It was total panic. . . . I saw three people come out in stretchers."" \n \n Anna Smith, an ultrasound technician, was on the first floor of the building celebrating a colleague\'s 60th birthday when police burst in and told everyone to leave through the back door, she said. \n \n ""There\'s a sign on the door that says you have to check your weapons at the front,"" she said. ""But you can\'t expect every crazy person to do that."" \n \n Former neighbors at Plotts\' apartment building along West Chester Pike in Upper Darby said Plotts was an uneasy presence in the neighborhood until he moved out sometime in the last year. The tall, solidly built Plotts seemed like he was either ""on drugs or heavily medicated,"" said Bert Garcia. \n \n ""He was a big guy,"" Garcia said. ""He could be intimidating."" \n \n Once, before he moved out, Garcia found that he had removed some ceiling tiles in the hallway and was messing around with the wiring. Another time, he told Garcia he had stabbed himself in the leg - but Garcia saw no blood. \n \n ""You could tell there was something wrong,"" neighbor Cathy Nickel said.

That's the conclusion of a large-scale review by the American Institute for Cancer Research and the World Cancer Research fund that took a closer look at 119 studies involving more than 12 million women globally, and the impact of nutrition, diet, and physical activity on breast cancer risk. Although a typical alcoholic beverage contains 14 grams of alcohol, the report finds that even a small glass of wine, beer, or spirits (one with as little as 10 grams of alcohol) is tied to a 5% increased cancer risk in pre-menopausal women and 9% in post-menopausal women, indicating there may be ""no level of alcohol use that is completely safe"" when it comes to breast cancer, Ann McTiernan, one of the study's lead authors, tells the Post. Some good news: Researchers also found exercise plays a role in one's risk level—specifically, ""vigorous"" exercise on a regular basis cut the risk of breast cancer for both pre-menopausal women (a 17% reduction) and post-menopausal women (a 10% cut). So what if you like to throw one back but also often hit the gym? McTiernan notes alcohol increases estrogen levels, which has been tied to breast cancer risk, and that exercise can tamp those levels down—though that doesn't necessarily mean it will cancel out alcohol's effects. Although a healthy lifestyle doesn't offer complete assurance that cancer will stay away—McTiernan compares it to wearing a seatbelt, per the Post—the AICR estimates that a third of US breast cancer cases could be avoided if women kept to a healthy weight, exercised regularly, and didn't drink. (Alcohol has been tied to at least half a dozen types of cancer.)"
98,"['THC, the main psychoactive ingredient in cannabis, makes rats less willing to exert cognitive effort – lazy – but, you know, that’s just, like, your opinion, man \n \n The main psychoactive ingredient in marijuana makes lab rats lazy, according to University of British Columbia researchers. \n \n The new research, published on Tuesday in the Journal of Psychiatry and Neuroscience, looked at the effects of both THC – the drug’s main active ingredient – and the non-psychoactive compound cannabidiol, or CBD, on the male lab rats’ willingness to exert cognitive effort. \n \n What are the true risks of taking cannabis? Read more \n \n Researchers trained 29 rats on two different challenges: rats which successfully carried out the more difficult task earned two sugar pellets; those which carried out the easier task earned just one. \n \n Rats usually preferred the harder, but more rewarding, task. But after being dosed with THC, the same rats picked the easier task. \n \n CBD, which does not cause a high and is believed to have medicinal benefits such as relieving pain and the symptoms of epilepsy, had no impact on the rats’ cognitive behaviour. It also did not mitigate the cognitive impact of THC in the rats. \n \n \n \n The THC did not make the rats less intelligent – just lazier, said the study’s lead author, Mason Silveira, a PhD candidate in psychology at the University of British Columbia. \n \n \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest UBC researchers test effects of THC on rats \n \n “When rats were given THC – the active ingredient in cannabis or marijuana – we found that they were less likely to exert the mental energy needed to do more difficult tasks,” he said. \n \n \n \n “What’s particularly interesting is though they were less likely to do these more difficult tasks they were still able to. There’s this distinction between THC’s ability to affect your cognition versus your willingness to actually use your cognitive abilities.” \n \n \n \n Silveira said his work underscores the need for more research to determine the impact of THC on the human brain, to explore how any of those potential negative effects could be mitigated, and to look into the effect of other marijuana compounds other than CBD on THC’s impact. \n \n \n \n “Our research highlights that, yes, cannabis itself may be beneficial for a variety of things, but can maybe lead to these impairments in cognition that you might want to consider,” he said. \n \n \n \n A 2012 report by the Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse said there was “sound evidence” from both animal and clinical trials that medicinal marijuana can offer relief of nausea and vomiting and certain types of pain, but warned there was a lack of research documenting the risks associated with the medical use of cannabis.', 'THC makes rats lazy, less willing to try cognitively demanding tasks: UBC study \n \n New research from the University of British Columbia suggests there may be some truth to the belief that marijuana use causes laziness— at least in rats. \n \n The study, published today in the Journal of Psychiatry and Neuroscience, found that tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, makes rats less willing to try a cognitively demanding task. \n \n “Perhaps unsurprisingly, we found that when we gave THC to these rats, they basically became cognitively lazy,” said Mason Silveira, the study’s lead author and a PhD candidate in UBC’s department of psychology. “What’s interesting, however, is that their ability to do the difficult challenge was unaffected by THC. The rats could still do the task— they just didn’t want to.” \n \n For the study, researchers looked at the effects of both THC and cannabidiol (CBD) on rats’ willingness to exert cognitive effort. \n \n They trained 29 rats to perform a behavioural experiment in which the animals had to choose whether they wanted an easy or difficult challenge to earn sugary treats. \n \n Under normal circumstances, most rats preferred the harder challenge to earn a bigger reward. But when the rats were given THC, the animals switched to the easier option, despite earning a smaller reward. \n \n When they looked at the effect of CBD, an ingredient in marijuana that does not result in a high, researchers found the chemical did not have any effect on rats’ decision-making or attention. CBD, which is believed to be beneficial in treating pain, epilepsy and even cancer, also didn’t block the negative effects of THC. \n \n “This was surprising, as it had been suggested that high concentrations of CBD could modulate or reduce the negative effects of THC,” said Catharine Winstanley, senior author of the study and an associate professor in UBC’s department of psychology. “Unfortunately, that did not appear to be the case.” \n \n Given how essential willingness to exert cognitive effort is for people to achieve success, Winstanley said the findings underscore the importance of realizing the possible effect of cannabis use on impairing willingness to engage in harder tasks. \n \n While some people view marijuana as a panacea that can cure all ailments, the findings also highlight a need for more research to determine what THC does to the human brain to alter decision-making. That could eventually allow scientists to block these effects of THC, allowing those who use medical marijuana to enjoy the possible benefits of cannabis without the less desirable cognitive effects. \n \n METHOD \n \n At the beginning of each behavioural experiment, rats chose between two levers to signal whether they wanted an easy or hard challenge. \n \n Choosing the easy challenge resulted in a light turning on for one second, which the rats could easily detect and respond to by poking it with their nose, receiving one sugar pellet as a reward. In the more difficult challenge, the light turned on for only 0.2 seconds, rewarding the rat with two sugar pellets if they responded with a nose poke.']",2,"– Scientists, apparently bored with pert, productive rats, added a little marijuana to the equation and found that, as many a teenager can tell you, laziness ensued. So report researchers at the University of British Columbia in the Journal of Psychiatry and Neuroscience after concluding that male lab rats given TCH experience an observable reduction in their ""willingness to exert cognitive effort."" To test this, researchers trained 29 rats to choose whether they wanted to perform a more difficult task to earn a larger quantity of a sugary treat or perform an easier task but earn less of the treat. Without THC, most of the rats preferred to exert themselves for the greater reward; after the dose of THC, however, they largely chose the easier path and settled for a smaller treat, even though their ability to perform the harder task was not impacted. ""What’s particularly interesting is though they were less likely to do these more difficult tasks they were still able to,"" one researcher tells the Guardian, adding that there's a clear need for more research on how THC impacts the human brain, whether any negative side effects can be reduced, and whether marijuana compounds other than THC play a role. When the researchers gave the rats doses of the non-psychoactive compound cannabidiol, or CBD, which is thought to have medical benefits such as pain relief and doesn't cause a high, they found that it didn't impact the rats' cognitive behavior, but it also didn't help mitigate the effects of THC on motivation.

102,"['Watching President Barack Obama play the race card late last week in the matter of the Zimmerman trial reminded me that the guy from Chicago has truly amazing powers. \n \n He stood in the White House briefing room, and through the magic of his own silky rhetoric and skill with metaphor, he was able animate the body of a slain African-American teenager, Trayvon Martin. \n \n Obama pronounced the killing as racially motivated, though he didn\'t use the words. He didn\'t have to, such is his prowess. It was so smooth that few noticed. He put the killing in a racial context, and that was enough. \n \n ""You know, when Trayvon Martin was first shot, I said that this could have been my son. Another way of saying that is Trayvon Martin could have been me, 35 years ago,"" Obama told reporters at the White House on Friday, addressing last weekend\'s acquittal of Martin\'s shooter, George Zimmerman. \n \n Could Obama have been Trayvon Martin 35 years ago? \n \n Perhaps. If so, then any of us could have been Trayvon Martin. And I could have been Trayvon Martin. Racial motives weren\'t established at trial. And reportedly, the FBI still hasn\'t found racial motives in George Zimmerman, who is Hispanic. \n \n Race was established by the president of the United States, and by other political and media actors. It\'s a cynical business, about money and power, about keeping divisions between American tribes. There are the black tribes that see Martin in the context of the old civil rights struggles and leverage, and white tribes that see Martin being used to pummel them with racial guilt. \n \n The algebra of all of this is as old as some musty textbook in your uncle\'s garage. We\'ve seen it before. We\'ve heard the lines, the formulations, the slogans, and some of us recite them the way we recite phrases from television commercials. We\'re given just enough evidence and we\'re told we must choose a side. \n \n Yet none of this tribalism has anything to do with what happened the night Martin was killed. Politicians don\'t worry about that. They\'re experts at the game of tribes, and a tribal America is what nourishes them. \n \n Americanism should be about something more than tribes and groups. Americanism should instead be about individuals, about individual promise, individual accomplishment. \n \n Only an individual can give another respect. Tribes can\'t. What tribes do is battle other tribes over the spoils of government. This has nothing to do with individual respect. It has everything to do with group leverage. \n \n Clearly, Martin and Zimmerman didn\'t give each other respect. Each one could and should have walked away, and didn\'t. Many homicides happen that way, with bad choices and stupidity and anger. Homicides are never political at the beginning. They become so only after the body is cold, when the political actors approach and heat things up. \n \n The rest of the president\'s commentary was quite touching, describing how young African-American men are followed in department stores, and how he was one of those followed, or how motorists lock their doors, how women clutch their purses when a black man enters an elevator. \n \n It was compelling talk for a president who avoids discussing race almost as much as he avoids discussing all those young African-American men shot down in Chicago every year in the street gang wars. \n \n But first came the sound bite in which he became Trayvon Martin. He knew what he was delivering. It was no accident. The rest of it was the cover. Many will applaud him for initiating sensitive discussion about race in America, and many will miss completely what he did. \n \n He played the race card and they didn\'t see it coming. He attributed racial motive to a homicide even though the race angle was never established in court. And he\'ll be praised. That\'s skill. That\'s power. \n \n Despite Obama\'s assertion that he could have been Martin, the jury did not believe that the teenager was killed because he was black. \n \n Many in the news media clearly believed the race angle, which reinforces American tribalism. Perhaps the worst of many violators was NBC News. That network\'s cynical editing of Zimmerman\'s 911 emergency call should cost them millions in damages. \n \n By saying he could have been Trayvon Martin, President Obama bypassed the evidence and established his own motive. Only a maestro could accomplish this. \n \n ""I think it\'s going to be important for all of us to do some soul searching,"" Obama said, and I hope he included himself in the search. \n \n ""There has been talk about should we convene a conversation on race,"" he continued. ""I haven\'t seen that to be particularly productive. When politicians try to organize conversations they end up being stilted and politicized, when folks are locked into the positions they already have."" \n \n They get locked into positions with help from those who would ostensibly lead them away from ignorance and anger and fear. No one wins the game of tribes but the leaders. \n \n * * * \n \n The Sunday Tribune is full of interesting and compelling stories, but one I certainly hope you read was written by William Lee.

He addressed the racial fault lines in the country by laying bare his personal anguish and experience in an effort to help white Americans understand why African-Americans reacted with frustration and anger to the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting of Trayvon Martin. \n \n Mr. Obama’s comments during a surprise appearance at the White House press briefing crystallized the dissonance around this case. In the narrow confines of the trial, all talk of race was excluded, and the “stand your ground” element in Florida’s self-defense law was not invoked by Mr. Zimmerman’s lawyers. But in the broader, more profound and more troubling context of Mr. Martin’s death, race and Florida’s lax gun laws are inextricably interwoven. \n \n On the first, Mr. Obama said: “The judge conducted the trial in a professional manner. The prosecution and the defense made their arguments.” The jurors, he added, “were properly instructed that in a case such as this reasonable doubt was relevant, and they rendered a verdict.” \n \n But on the broader context, Mr. Obama eloquently rebutted those — like Representative Andy Harris, a Republican, with his dismissive “get over it” remark on Tuesday — who said that the verdict should have ended discussion of the case, especially talk about race and gun laws. \n \n “Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago,” Mr. Obama said, adding that “it’s important to recognize that the African-American community is looking at this issue through a set of experiences and a history that doesn’t go away.” \n \n He said there are “very few African-American men in this country who haven’t had the experience of being followed when they were shopping in a department store” or “the experience of getting on an elevator and a woman clutching her purse nervously and holding her breath until she had a chance to get off.” \n \n “That,” he said, “includes me.” \n \n Mr. Obama said African-Americans are also acutely aware that “there is a history of racial disparities in the application of our criminal laws — everything from the death penalty to enforcement of our drug laws.” \n \n He said it would be naïve not to recognize that young African-American men are “disproportionately both victims and perpetrators of violence.” But using those statistics “to then see sons treated differently causes pain,” he said. \n \n Mr. Obama called on the Justice Department to work with local and state law enforcement to reduce mistrust in the policing system, including ending racial profiling. He also called for an examination of state and local laws to see whether they “are designed in such a way that they may encourage the kinds of altercations and confrontations and tragedies that we saw in the Florida case.” \n \n Mr. Obama raised questions about the message that “stand your ground” laws send, telling a citizen that he “potentially has the right to use those firearms even if there’s a way for them to exit from a situation.” \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Mr. Obama noted that Mr. Zimmerman did not invoke that defense. But he said it was still relevant. In one of the most powerful parts of his remarks, he said: “I’d just ask people to consider, if Trayvon Martin was of age and armed, could he have stood his ground on that sidewalk? And do we actually think that he would have been justified in shooting Mr. Zimmerman, who had followed him in a car, because he felt threatened?” \n \n If the answer is “at least ambiguous,” Mr. Obama said, “we might want to examine those kinds of laws.” \n \n Mr. Obama said Americans needed to give African-American boys “the sense that their country cares about them and values them and is willing to invest in them.” \n \n He said he was not talking about “some grand, new federal program” or even a national “conversation on race,” which he said often ends up being “stilted and politicized” and reaffirms pre-existing positions. \n \n In a way, Mr. Obama began that conversation with these remarks, while speaking directly to African-Americans who have longed to hear him identify with their frustrations and their anger. \n \n It is a great thing for this country to have a president who could do what Mr. Obama did on Friday. It is sad that we still need him to do it.', ""Full transcript of President Obama's remarks on race and the Trayvon Martin case, Friday, July 19, 2013, in the White House press briefing room, as released by the White House: \n \n \n \n THE PRESIDENT: I wanted to come out here, first of all, to tell you that Jay is prepared for all your questions and is very much looking forward to the session. The second thing is I want to let you know that over the next couple of weeks, there's going to obviously be a whole range of issues -- immigration, economics, et cetera -- we'll try to arrange a fuller press conference to address your questions. \n \n The reason I actually wanted to come out today is not to take questions, but to speak to an issue that obviously has gotten a lot of attention over the course of the last week -- the issue of the Trayvon Martin ruling. I gave a preliminary statement right after the ruling on Sunday. But watching the debate over the course of the last week, I thought it might be useful for me to expand on my thoughts a little bit. \n \n First of all, I want to make sure that, once again, I send my thoughts and prayers, as well as Michelle's, to the family of Trayvon Martin, and to remark on the incredible grace and dignity with which they've dealt with the entire situation. I can only imagine what they're going through, and it's remarkable how they've handled it. \n \n The second thing I want to say is to reiterate what I said on Sunday, which is there's going to be a lot of arguments about the legal issues in the case -- I'll let all the legal analysts and talking heads address those issues. The judge conducted the trial in a professional manner. The prosecution and the defense made their arguments. The juries were properly instructed that in a case such as this reasonable doubt was relevant, and they rendered a verdict. And once the jury has spoken, that's how our system works. But I did want to just talk a little bit about context and how people have responded to it and how people are feeling. \n \n You know, when Trayvon Martin was first shot I said that this could have been my son. Another way of saying that is Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago. And when you think about why, in the African American community at least, there's a lot of pain around what happened here, I think it's important to recognize that the African American community is looking at this issue through a set of experiences and a history that doesn't go away. \n \n There are very few African American men in this country who haven't had the experience of being followed when they were shopping in a department store. That includes me. There are very few African American men who haven't had the experience of walking across the street and hearing the locks click on the doors of cars. That happens to me -- at least before I was a senator. There are very few African Americans who haven't had the experience of getting on an elevator and a woman clutching her purse nervously and holding her breath until she had a chance to get off.

103,"[""WASHINGTON — Rep. Ted Poe called today for the removal of a California judge who sentenced a former Stanford athlete convicted of sexual assault to six months in prison. \n \n Poe, a former prosecutor and criminal court judge, took to the House floor and blasted Judge Aaron Persky’s sentence as “pathetic,” saying: “The punishment for rape should be longer than a semester of college.” \n \n Poe, R-Humble, said that Brock Turner — a 20-year-old champion swimmer convicted of assaulting an unconscious woman behind a dumpster in 2015 — should face tougher penalties. \n \n Brock was convicted last week of three counts of sexual assault and, in addition to six months in prison and three years’ probation, will have to register as a sex offender. \n \n Turner was not convicted of rape because, under California law, rape is defined as someone using “physical force, intimidation, duress, or threats to persuade the victim to engage in intercourse.” \n \n Witnesses and testimony determined that Turner penetrated his victim with a foreign object, not a sexual organ. \n \n The case has ignited a fierce debate about victims’ rights and how the court system treats upper-middle-class white men. \n \n “This judge got it wrong. There is an archaic philosophy in some courts that sin ain’t sin as long as good folk do it,” said Poe. “The judge should be removed. The rapist should do more time for the dastardly deed he did that night.” \n \n Poe has no authority to remove Persky from the bench but urged an appeals court to overturn Turner’s sentence and for California voters to petition for his ouster. \n \n Turner will be serving an even shorter sentence than what Persky gave him, Mic reports. The Santa Clara County’s Department of Corrections website lists Turner’s release as Sept. 2 — three months after his booking date, June 2. \n \n In addition to being outraged by the judge’s sentence, many have expressed frustration over comments from Turner’s father, who called prison “a steep price to pay for 20 minutes of action.” \n \n “The judge said: ‘A prison sentence would have a severe impact on him.’ Isn’t that the point?” Poe said. \n \n At Turner’s sentencing, his unnamed victim read him a letter. \n \n Poe on Thursday read portions of the victim’s 7,000-plus word letter, which explained in graphic detail the impact of the assault on her life. The assault was reportedly halted by two students passing by on bicycles while the woman was still unconscious. \n \n A rape victim’s message to a former Stanford swimmer | @DMNOpinion https://t.co/ElLVkVhB84 pic.twitter.com/5kkovNakiu — Dallas Morning News (@dallasnews) June 8, 2016 \n \n In an interview with The Dallas Morning News, Poe called the woman’s missive “the Bible on what happens to sexual assault victims.” \n \n “For many victims, rape is a fate worse than death,” Poe said. “Because rape victims say after being raped, they die emotionally many times. And with homicide, one dies only once.” \n \n Vice President Joe Biden issued his own open letter to the victim Thursday afternoon which began: \n \n “I do not know your name — but your words are forever seared on my soul. Words that should be required reading for men and women of all ages. Words that I wish with all of my heart you never had to write.” \n \n Poe, co-chairman of the Congressional Victims Rights Caucus, said he felt compelled to speak out after becoming incensed at the lenient sentence. \n \n “The judge excused [Turner's] conduct, even saying he was concerned about the defendant’s future,” Poe said. “That’s nothing. Auto thieves in Texas get more for stealing cars.” \n \n The congressman ended his speech Thursday morning by with a personal note as he asked for the victim’s entire letter into the official Congressional record. \n \n “As a grandfather, I want to know that my granddaughters are growing up in a society that has zero tolerance for this criminal conduct,” he continued. “No means no.” \n \n Staff writer Hannah Wise contributed to this report."", 'Tom Williams/Getty Images Rep.

An attorney for the public defender’s office said Persky and his family have been receiving threatening phone calls. A recall effort has also been launched against the judge. \n \n ALSO READ: \n \n The case gained worldwide attention after the victim’s emotional court statement addressing her attacker was posted online. \n \n Outrage over the case was also stoked by statements issued in Turner’s defense by his father and one of his childhood friends. \n \n KPIX 5 was in Persky’s courtroom on Thursday when the judge asked 17 potential jurors if they could be impartial in the case, and they all said yes. A short time later, Persky empaneled 12 of them, plus two alternates. \n \n Dr. Kulsoom Khan was excused for unknown reasons. She had no idea about the Turner case at all, and said it wasn’t brought up in her jury pool.

But Mr. Turner is, in fact, going to go to jail, said O’Neal. He’s a convicted felon. He will have to register as a sex offender for the rest of his life.” \n \n But even one of Persky’s most outspoken critics, prosecutor Alaleh Kianerci, believes that is taking things too far. \n \n “He was absolutely neutral during the trial,” said Kianerci. “We just don’t agree with his sentence. But I don’t thing being a Stanford grad or a former athlete has anything to do with it.” \n \n While enormous attention has been focused on how much time turner will spend behind bars — likely three months of a six-month sentence — O’Neal said the judge almost certainly considered the implications of having to register as a sex offender. \n \n “I think Judge Persky heard all the testimony — weighed all of the considerations he’s required to by law — and arrived at a sentence through a fair process,” said O’Neal.', ""Image copyright AFP Image caption Mexican troops have been guarding the location where the bodies were found \n \n Investigators in Mexico are working to identify 28 bodies retrieved from a grave near the southern town of Iguala. \n \n The grave is located in an area where 43 protesting students went missing after clashing with police last month. \n \n Inaky Blanco, the chief prosecutor of Guerrero state, said identification could take two weeks. \n \n The students disappeared after taking part in a protest over teachers' rights.

104,"['U.S. Fast-Tracks Missile Defense System To South Korea, Drawing China\'s Ire \n \n Enlarge this image toggle caption U.S. Force Korea via AP U.S. Force Korea via AP \n \n North Korea again tested ballistic missiles this week, firing four of them into the waters near Japan. Just days later, the U.S. military announced that part of a controversial missile defense system arrived at Osan Air Base in South Korea for deployment as early as April. \n \n The system, called THAAD, an acronym for Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, has been the source of much controversy in South Korea. Critics say the approval process to install it was rushed, and neighboring China is furious about the deployment. Here\'s what you need to know: \n \n What\'s THAAD? \n \n It\'s an American missile defense system designed to shoot down short and intermediate range missiles in the terminal phase — often described as like shooting a bullet with a bullet. There\'s currently a system installed on Guam. As North Korea tested ballistic missiles last year, the United States argued that THAAD was increasingly necessary in South Korea. \n \n Seoul\'s current conservative administration approved it after months of consternation and public hand wringing. It was supposed to be deployed before the end of this year in southern South Korea, on land that is currently a golf course. \n \n \n \n But the Chinese are expressing unhappiness. What does it have to do with the Chinese? \n \n \n \n The Chinese seem more worried about THAAD\'s radar system than its missiles. This system has the capability, the Chinese say, to track where China\'s missile systems are located, giving the U.S. a strategic advantage. China is also questioning if THAAD would be effective against North Korea\'s short-range missiles, raising the question whether THAAD\'s primary goal is to contain China. The U.S. has maintained the system is merely defensive. \n \n \n \n What is China doing about it? \n \n China\'s first target has been to hit South Korea economically, putting restrictions on business and shutting down stores owned by the Lotte conglomerate, which agreed to allow THAAD to be built on its golf course. Chinese travel agencies are stopping ticket sales and tour packages to South Korea, and there are calls to boycott South Korean products like K-dramas and K-pop concerts. \n \n Some of this may sound trivial, but China is South Korea\'s largest trading partner, so this could have a damaging economic impact. Then, earlier this week after THAAD batteries arrived near Seoul, China\'s foreign ministry said China would take ""necessary measures"" against it. It\'s unclear what this means, but according to some military experts, China may be developing technology to blind THAAD\'s control system, essentially jamming it. \n \n \n \n What has the reaction been in South Korea to these measures? \n \n China\'s retaliation, as South Korea sees it, brought widespread condemnation in the media, and created anxiety among policymakers. Some even called for the country to file a complaint with the World Trade Organization. Others are calling for more restraint. But it\'s important to remember that there\'s been little evidence of a slowdown in trade of manufactured goods between the two countries, which makes up a huge chunk of bilateral commerce. \n \n \n \n And South Korea is in a leadership vacuum. The president\'s already been impeached and could be removed as early as tomorrow. Could this have an impact on the deployment of THAAD? \n \n \n \n It might play into why the U.S. abruptly announced this week that it started setting up the THAAD system several months sooner than expected. There\'s a case to be made that the deployment is being fast-tracked ahead of a new South Korean administration, which could be less accepting of the system. The left-leaning Democratic Party (which is currently out of power) has more members opposed to or skeptical about THAAD deployment. It\'s also possible the effort is going faster than expected because the defense ministry recently reached a land deal for the system\'s location — and because North Korea has stepped up its missile tests in recent weeks.', 'OSAN AIR BASE, South Korea — With the stakes on the Korean peninsula as high as they have ever been, life for the men and women here with the U.S. Air Force\'s 51st Fighter Wing is lived in a state of constant alert. \n \n South Korea has no nuclear weapons, so it relies on the United States\' nuclear umbrella to deter North Korea and its erratic leader, Kim Jong Un. \n \n That makes Osan — less than 50 miles from the Demilitarized Zone separating the mortal enemies and home to a large proportion of the 28,500 U.S. military personnel in South Korea — the leading edge of the shield that protects the South from the North. \n \n Hence the base\'s slogan: ""Ready to Fight Tonight."" \n \n Play Facebook \n \n Twitter \n \n Embed U.S. Military in North Korea: \'Ready to Fight Tonight\' 3:08 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog \n \n NBC Nightly News Exclusive: Lester Holt anchors from South Korea on Monday and Tuesday, April 3 and 4, at 6:30pm ET. \n \n Patriot missile batteries are poised to defend the base from North Korean ballistic missiles.

However, hunger’s influence extends beyond food consumption to the acquisition of nonfood items that cannot satisfy the underlying need (e.g., binder clips), suggesting that domain-specific motives can influence behavior in unrelated domains that are irrelevant to the motive. This is likely to occur when the domain-specific response includes concepts and behaviors that can also guide decisions in other domains. \n \n Abstract \n \n Hunger motivates people to consume food, for which finding and acquiring food is a prerequisite. We test whether the acquisition component spills over to nonfood objects: Are hungry people more likely to acquire objects that cannot satisfy their hunger? Five laboratory and field studies show that hunger increases the accessibility of acquisition-related concepts and the intention to acquire not only food but also nonfood objects. Moreover, people act on this intention and acquire more nonfood objects (e.g., binder clips) when they are hungry, both when these items are freely available and when they must be paid for. However, hunger does not influence how much they like nonfood objects. We conclude that a basic biologically based motivation can affect substantively unrelated behaviors that cannot satisfy the motivation. This presumably occurs because hunger renders acquisition-related concepts and behaviors more accessible, which influences decisions in situations to which they can be applied.']",3,"– Osan Air Base may not be a name you're familiar with, but it's a US Air Force base that sits in a prime location: fewer than 50 miles from the Demilitarized Zone that separates North and South Korea.

105,"['Remember the California couple who found $10 million in gold coins on their property? They’re probably going to end up with NOTHING in the final analysis, as breaking news from San Francisco reveals that the source of the mystery gold has been discovered: \n \n A story that describes a gold heist from the San Francisco Mint at the turn of the century could explain the source of the gold coins worth $10 million that were found last month in California’s Mother Lode country. The published news item was discovered in the Haithi Trust Digital Library and was provided by Northern California fishing guide Jack Trout, who doubles as a historian and collector of rare coins. \n \n The details of the 1899 heist — $30,000 face value of uncirculated gold coins stolen from the San Francisco Mint in 1899 — matches every known fact about the gold coins found recently in the Sierra foothills, which were nearly $30,000 in face value of uncirculated mint condition coins mostly made at the San Francisco Mint in the late 1800s. \n \n If, as is almost certainly the case, this explains the origin of the found coins, then the couple who found them will not merely have to pay taxes on them — they’ll have to turn them over entirely back to the federal government, since the coins’ status has changed from “treasure trove” to “stolen goods”: \n \n Treasure trove is any gold or silver in coin, plate, or bullion that is hidden by an unknown owner in the earth or other private place for an extended period. The property is not considered treasure trove unless the identity of the owner cannot be determined. Under early common law, the finder of a treasure trove took title to it against everyone but the true owner. The U.S. law governing treasure trove has been merged, for the most part, into the law governing lost property. In the absence of a contrary statutory provision, the title to treasure trove belongs to the finder against all others with the exception of the true owner. \n \n It was a nice story while it lasted. \n \n UPDATE \n \n Just to clarify: \n \n The finders will EITHER have to hand over all the coins back to the government, OR pay taxes on them (on the off-chance they win the legal battle to retain ownership of the coins). Under no circumstance (of which I am aware) would they have to pay taxes AND return the coins. \n \n UPDATE II \n \n A few of the coins in the hoard were from different U.S. Mints and from earlier in the 19th century. It could be the case that the Federal Government might only be able to prove that the coins amongst the hoard which can be confirmed as coming from the San Francisco Mint in 1899 must be returned, while the finders could contest that the remaining coins were not part of that robbery and thus not necessarily stolen property. It’s entirely possible that the person who originally buried the hoard mixed in coins from more than one different sources (or crimes). In this case, the finders and the government would split ownership. \n \n UPDATE III \n \n According to the 1906 edition of the official Hearings Before the Subcommittee of the House Committee on Appropriations, a mint clerk named W.N. Dimmick was caught and convicted of stealing $30,000 in gold coins from the San Francisco Mint — although in the description of the case no mention is made of whether Dimmick ever revealed the location of the stolen coins, or whether they were ever recovered. \n \n Here is the full text of the relevant minutes from the House Hearings: \n \n \n \n \n \n Note that there is a discrepancy in the date of the supposed crime: Was it 1899, or 1901? A few pages later in the same minutes is this passage revealing that there may have been many other thefts from the mint as well, due to a plague of dishonest mint employees: \n \n Also note that one of the coins found in the hoard was an ultra-rare 1866 Liberty $20 gold piece missing the phrase “In God We Trust” — a coin which was never released to the public and which must have been produced and kept within the mint itself. \n \n This link to an article in the July 9, 1901 edition of the San Francisco Chronicle has more details about the Dimmick theft.', 'A California couple who found a stash of buried gold coins valued at $10 million may not be so lucky after all. The coins may have been stolen from the U.S. Mint in 1900 and thus be the property of the government, according to a published report. \n \n The San Francisco Chronicle\'s website reported that a search of the Haithi Trust Digital Library provided by Northern California fishing guide Jack Trout, who is also a historian and collector of rare coins, turned up the news of the theft. \n \n WATCH: $10M Gold Coins May Be Linked to Heist \n \n Play \n \n The California couple, who have not been identified, spotted the edge of an old can on a path they had hiked many times before several months ago. Poking at the can was the first step in uncovering a buried treasure of rare coins estimated to be worth $10 million. \n \n ""It was like finding a hot potato,"" the couple told coin expert Don Kagin from Kagin\'s, Inc. The couple hired the president of Kagin\'s, Inc. and Holabird-Kagin Americana, a western Americana dealer and auctioneer, to represent them. \n \n The coins are mostly uncirculated and in mint condition, and they add up in face value to $27,000. ""Those two facts are a match of the gold heist in 1900 from the San Francisco Mint,"" the newspaper reported. \n \n Jack Trout told the paper that an 1866 Liberty $20 gold piece without the words ""In God We Trust"" was part of the buried stash, and the coin may fetch over $1 million at auction because it\'s so rare. \n \n ""This was someone\'s private coin, created by the mint manager or someone with access to the inner workings of the Old Granite Lady (San Francisco Mint),"" Trout told the newspaper. ""It was likely created in revenge for the assassination of Lincoln the previous year (April 14, 1865). I don\'t believe that coin ever left The Mint until the robbery. For it to show up as part of the treasure find links it directly to that inside job at the turn of the century at the San Francisco Mint."" \n \n Mint spokesman Adam Stump issued this statement when contacted today by ABC News: ""We do not have any information linking the Saddle Ridge Hoard coins to any thefts at any United States Mint facility. Surviving agency records from the San Francisco Mint have been retired to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), under Record Group 104. Access to the records is under NARA\'s jurisdiction: http://www.archives.gov/."" \n \n Last week, when news of the stash first broke, coin dealer Kagin spoke about the rarity of such a find. \n \n ""Since 1981, people have been coming to us with one or two coins they find worth a few thousand dollars, but this is the first time we get someone with a whole cache of buried coins... It is a million to one chance, even harder than winning the lottery,"" Kagin told ABCNews.com. \n \n The couple is trying to remain anonymous after finding the five cans of coins last spring on their Tiburon property in northern California and conducted an interview with Kagin. \n \n WATCH: $10M Gold-Coin Surprise Uncovered in Calif. \n \n ""I never would have thought we would have found something like this. However, in a weird way I feel like I have been preparing my whole life for it,"" the couple said. \n \n ""I saw an old can sticking out of the ground on a trail that we had walked almost every day for many, many years. I was looking down in the right spot and saw the side of the can. I bent over to scrape some moss off and noticed that it had both ends on it,"" they said. \n \n It was the first of five cans to be unearthed, each packed with gold coins. \n \n ""Nearly all of the 1,427 coins, dating from 1847 to 1894, are in uncirculated, mint condition,"" said Kagin told ABCNews.com. \n \n He said that the couple plan to sell most of the coins, but before they do, they are ""loaning some to the American Numismatic Association for its National Money Show, which opens Thursday in Atlanta."" \n \n ""Some of the rarest coins could fetch as much as $1 million apiece,"" said Kagin. He also said that they wish to sell 90 percent of the collection through Amazon.com and on the company\'s website. \n \n ""We\'d like to help other people with some of this money. There are people in our community who are hungry and don\'t have enough to eat. We\'ll also donate to the arts and other overlooked causes. In a way it has been good to have time between finding the coins and being able to sell them in order to prepare and adjust. It\'s given us an opportunity to think about how to give back,"" said the couple. \n \n Kagin and his colleague David McCarthy, senior numismatist and researcher at Kagin\'s, met with the couple last April, two months after the hoard was found. \n \n When McCarthy and Kagin told the couple that their bonanza will be in the annals of numismatic stories for quite some time, the couple said, ""It would have been quite a pity not to share the magnitude of our find. We want to keep the story of these coins intact for posterity.""']",2,"– The only thing more mysterious than the identity of the couple who stumbled upon an estimated $10 million in US gold coins while walking their dog on their California property: Where did the gold come from? The San Francisco Chronicle floats a theory with all the intrigue and illegality you could hope for: Historian/coin collector/fishing guide Jack Trout provided the paper with a passage from the Bulletin of American Iron and Steel Association that references a $30,000 turn-of-the-century gold heist from the San Francisco Mint that he believes is linked to the coins. Lending credence to the theory: The unearthed 1,427 gold coins, dated 1847 to 1894, were mostly uncirculated and in chronological order, suggesting they hadn't entered the public realm. And though they are worth millions today, their face value is $27,000, which roughly syncs with what was taken from the mint. Trout also points to the buried stash's 1866 Liberty $20 gold piece not emblazoned with ""In God We Trust""; he suspects it was a private coin created by a mint manager that never left the mint. ""For it to show up as part of the treasure find links it directly"" to the mint heist, he says. But the couple's coin broker is no fan of the mint robbery theory, telling the Chronicle he'd expect the haul would have included coins dated closer to the heist date. But a former SF Mint detective sees it as plausible: ""Downstairs, we had vaults where we kept old coins that hadn't been put into circulation."" PJMedia further digs up a 1906 congressional report that indicates mint clerk W.N. Dimmick was convicted of the mint theft, but the document doesn't state whether Dimmick revealed the coins' location, or if they had been recovered. ABC News notes that if the coins are indeed purloined government property, the couple may owe Uncle Sam more than a heck of a lot in taxes: They may have to turn over the entire haul, and get a finder's fee in return."

Any changes would apply only to the United States. \n \n The Community of Christ, formerly formerly known as the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, is based in Independence and has about 250,000 members.', 'INDEPENDENCE, Mo. — A worldwide church based in Independence, Mo., could soon change its policies on same-sex issues. \n \n Delegates with Community of Christ met at their headquarters over the weekend and have recommended to allow same-sex marriages where they are legal. \n \n “I think it will really open the doors wide in our congregations,” church member Jane Gardner said. \n \n During its national conference, more than 1,500 delegates also voted that the church should offer “commitment services” for same-sex couples in places where marriage is not legal. \n \n Gardner was one of the delegates who voted in favor of the proposed changes. She and her 27-year-old son, who’s gay, have been members of Community of Christ for a number of years. \n \n “I’m thrilled for the fact he could be ordained or he could be married in the church now,” she said. \n \n By almost a 70 percent majority, delegates also voted to ordain people regardless of sexual orientation. \n \n “It’s a journey we are all in together and we don’t necessarily all agree, but I think we want to include everybody in our faith journey,” church member Art Smith said. \n \n Church members say that journey has led to a discussion over the last several years that has led them to discussing and praying about same-sex issues. Members say they are also well aware that many believe marriage is a sacred union between a man and a woman — and with the proposed changes comes criticism at the least. \n \n “We are people that believe this is the direction that God has taken us,” said Linda Booth, Director of Communications for Community of Christ. \n \n The church has nearly 250,000 members in more than 50 nations. If the changes are approved by church leaders, it would only affect Community of Christ churches in the United States.', 'Speaking at the sentencing, Ballinger said, ""My daughter Akaila is without a father, his mother is without a son.

I\'ll never forget what Mayor de Blasio said to me that night — that Akai was innocent and should still be alive.""']",3,"– Another church is poised to change its thinking on gay marriage, this one with Mormon roots. Delegates from the Community of Christ have recommended allowing same-sex marriages in states where they are legal and providing ""commitment services"" in states where they are not, reports the Kansas City Star.

The church is based in Missouri and has about 250,000 members worldwide, reports Fox4kc.com.

His opponents wasted no time in sharing their thoughts with the public: \n \n Still high on his petty scheduling victory, John Boehner allowed that the plan ""merits consideration"": “It’s my hope that we can work together to end the uncertainty facing families and small businesses and create a better environment for long-term economic growth and private-sector job creation."" \n \n Michele Bachmann went a little rogue and offered an ""unsanctioned"" televised rebuttal in which she took issue with the president\'s use of the phrase ""political circus"": “It was interesting to me that if you look at the president’s remarks, almost out of the gate, the president began by insulting members of Congress ...

These days, the best — or at any rate the alleged wise men and women who are supposed to be looking after the nation’s welfare — lack all conviction, while the worst, as represented by much of the G.O.P., are filled with a passionate intensity. So the unemployed are being abandoned. \n \n Photo \n \n O.K., about the Obama plan: It calls for about $200 billion in new spending — much of it on things we need in any case, like school repair, transportation networks, and avoiding teacher layoffs — and $240 billion in tax cuts. That may sound like a lot, but it actually isn’t. The lingering effects of the housing bust and the overhang of household debt from the bubble years are creating a roughly $1 trillion per year hole in the U.S. economy, and this plan — which wouldn’t deliver all its benefits in the first year — would fill only part of that hole. And it’s unclear, in particular, how effective the tax cuts would be at boosting spending. \n \n Still, the plan would be a lot better than nothing, and some of its measures, which are specifically aimed at providing incentives for hiring, might produce relatively a large employment bang for the buck. As I said, it’s much bolder and better than I expected. President Obama ’s hair may not be on fire, but it’s definitely smoking; clearly and gratifyingly, he does grasp how desperate the jobs situation is. \n \n But his plan isn’t likely to become law, thanks to Republican opposition.

First, they argued that we should rely on monetary policy rather than fiscal policy — that is, that the job of fighting unemployment should be left to the Fed. Second, they argued that fiscal actions should take the form of tax cuts rather than temporary spending. \n \n Now, however, leading Republicans are against tax cuts — at least if they benefit working Americans rather than rich people and corporations. \n \n And they’re against monetary policy, too. In Wednesday night’s Republican presidential debate , Mitt Romney declared that he would seek a replacement for Ben Bernanke , the Fed chairman, essentially because Mr. Bernanke has tried to do something (though not enough) about unemployment. And that makes Mr. Romney a moderate by G.O.P. standards, since Rick Perry , his main rival for the presidential nomination, has suggested that Mr. Bernanke should be treated “pretty ugly.” \n \n So, at this point, leading Republicans are basically against anything that might help the unemployed. Yes, Mr. Romney has issued a glossy, well-produced “jobs plan,” but it might best be described as 59 bullet points with nothing there — and certainly nothing to justify his assertion, bordering on megalomania, that he would create no fewer than 11 million jobs in four years. \n \n The good news in all this is that by going bigger and bolder than expected, Mr. Obama may finally have set the stage for a political debate about job creation. For, in the end, nothing will be done until the American people demand action."", 'First reactions to the president’s big jobs speech: \n \n 1) Qua speech, it was excellent – clear, focused, unrhetorical. \n \n The core concept – stressing past Republican approval of the major elements of the proposal – ingeniously put Republicans into an awkward spot. And in fact, the maneuver has had some immediate effect. Speaker Boehner and Leader Cantor told Politico tonight that they would approve important elements of the bill. \n \n The speech was tricked out with items cleverly intended to catch the ears of people who might not normally support the president: the promise to pay federal contractors faster, for example, and payroll tax cuts for smaller businesses worth up to $80,000. \n \n 2) Qua economics, the proposal looks a lot better than the 2009 stimulus. This new measure is not larded up with the Democratic wish lists and obsolete campaign promises that made such a mess of Stimulus 1. There are no tax rebates here, no Pell grants, only the basic material of a counter-cyclical program: investment tax credits, continuing payroll tax relief, and infrastructure spending. \n \n 3) Qua politics? Obama’s re-election proposition remains pretty bad, but it’s marginally less bad tonight than it was this morning. No, he has not restored the country to prosperity. But he does again at least look like he’s trying and like he’s defending Medicare and Social Security in the process. If Obama cannot run as the recovery and prosperity candidate, he will try to run as the stability and security candidate against opponents whom he will seek to depict as radical and reckless. Many of his opponents are enthusiastically cooperating with that strategy, including the current Republican presidential front-runner.', 'The former bassist in the all-female teenage rock group has described being drugged and raped at an aftershow party in 1975 \n \n Jackie Fuchs, formerly the bassist in all-female rock band the Runaways, has spoken for the first time about an incident in which she was allegedly raped by the group’s then manager, Kim Fowley. \n \n In a report published in the Huffington Post titled The Lost Girls, Fuchs describes a New Year’s Eve gig in Orange County, California, in 1975, when she was aged 16. \n \n According to the bassist, who performed under the name Jackie Fox, Fowley took the band to a hotel near the club after the show, where they started celebrating with friends. Witnesses claim she was given a number of Quaalude sedatives, before Fowley allegedly asked if one of the roadies at the party would like to have sex with Fuchs. \n \n “You don’t know what terror is until you realise something bad is about to happen to you and you can’t move a muscle,” Fuchs is reported as saying. “I can’t move. I can’t speak. All I can do is look him in the eye and do the best I can do to communicate: please say no ... I don’t know what it looked like from the outside. But I know what was going on inside and it was horror”. \n \n The roadie declined Fowley’s offer, but Fuchs says she then started to slip in and out of consciousness. \n \n “I remember opening my eyes, Kim Fowley was raping me, and there were people watching me,” said Fuchs. \n \n According to the article, Fuchs said she was unwilling to make her alleged rape public until the recent number of high-profile sexual assault cases involving prominent individuals such as Bill Cosby and Kesha’s producer Dr Luke. Kesha has accused Dr Luke of drugging and assaulting her, while he has countersued, accusing her of lying to get out of her contract. Meanwhile, it emerged on 6 July that Cosby obtained Quaaludes with the intent of giving them to young women he wanted to have sex with. \n \n Fowley, who died in January, had previously denied any sexual impropriety with members of the band. The Huffington Post cites a passage in the Runaways’ 2013 band biography: “They can talk about it until the cows come home but, in my mind, I didn’t make love to anybody in the Runaways nor did they make love to me.” \n \n Fuchs left the group in 1977. In the same year, Fowley and the group parted ways amid disagreements about money.']",4,"– Pundits handed out good grades aplenty for President Obama's new jobs proposal last night, with generally positive feedback from liberals like Paul Krugman—but also from conservatives like David Frum and Andrew Sullivan. Krugman writes in the New York Times that he was ""favorably surprised by the new Obama jobs plan, which is significantly bolder and better than I expected."" Still, ""it's not nearly as bold as the plan I’d want in an ideal world. But if it actually became law, it would probably make a significant dent in unemployment."" Of course, Krugman holds out little hope that the GOP will let it pass. It was a ""cunning speech,"" muses David Frum on FrumForum. Economically, it's better than the 2009 stimulus, and, politically, it helps Obama's re-election chances, he adds. But the strongest aspect was using proposals Republicans had previously advocated, which ""ingeniously put Republicans into an awkward spot,"" Frum writes. ""This was a blunt, potent, confident attempt to win back the hearts of a disillusioned base, while appealing to the center in ways Republicans may feel a little leery of rejecting,"" writes Andrew Sullivan. ""Game on, in other words."" No love, though, from the Wall Street Journal.

This would be one of the very, very few times that somebody as radical as Dorothy Day was mentioned."" \n \n Pope Francis says Abraham Lincoln, Martin Luther King Jr., Dorothy Day and Thomas Merton embody the spirit of America. (AP) \n \n Day was arguably the least famous of the four Americans Francis cited in the speech, but she was a vital and controversial figure on the American left. Like Martin Luther King -- also cited by Francis -- she had a thick FBI file, compiled by agents tracking her support for democratic socialism and opposition to foreign wars. ""We need to change the system,"" Day wrote in 1956.

Someone from the other side of the political spectrum is gushing about the pontiff's speech, too, but for different reasons. Ted Cruz told reporters after Francis' appearance that the pope offered a ""powerful voice for life at a time when life is profoundly threatened in America,"" reports Bloomberg (Cruz was speaking specifically about religious liberty, traditional marriage, and abortion).

She was one of the last four remaining members of the doomed species, and the park decided to euthanize her on Sunday because of an infection and other chronic age-related health problems, reports the New York Times. ""It's tough. It's like having your 90-year-old aunt get sick, and there is nothing you can do except give her basic care and keep her comfortable,"" the lead zookeeper told the San Diego Union-Tribune last month. Another female died at a Czech zoo in July, and the final three survivors are all at a conservancy in Kenya. ""Let this be a warning of what is happening to wildlife everywhere,"" the park wrote in a Facebook post. But hope for the species lives on: The zoo's ""frozen"" section now has genetic material from at least a dozen northern whites, and scientists hope to bring back the species with embryos that can be carried by southern white rhinos, six of which recently arrived at the park, the Union-Tribune reports. ""The white rhinos represent the wild places and prehistoric animals that are still with us,"" a park curator tells the Union-Tribune. ""It is devastating to think that in just a few hundred years, we can wipe that out. That is just wrong, and we need to do something about it.""

Just because Obama has House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) in agreement, the vote on the plan, scheduled for Monday, is not necessarily a done deal. \n \n Not only will Boehner have to convince more than half of the House’s 240 Republican members to vote in favor of the bill, but problems lurk within the chamber’s blue seats as well. \n \n House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said that she would have to speak to her members and look at the deal more closely before assuring votes. \n \n “We all may not be able to support it — or none of us may be able to support it,” she told Bloomberg. \n \n The Progressive Caucus and the Black Caucus have scheduled a press conference for Monday to outline why they are opposed to the deal, which would raise the debt ceiling and cut around $1 trillion in spending over the next decade. \n \n “This deal does not even attempt to strike a balance between more cuts for the working people of America and a fairer contribution from millionaires and corporations,” Progressive Caucus leader Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-AZ) said in a statement Sunday night. “I will not be a part of it.” \n \n The Black Caucus Sunday released a letter urging Obama to invoke the 14th Amendment and take the debt crisis into his own hands, something the president had said he was unwilling to do. \n \n In a floor speech Sunday prior to the deal announcement, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) encouraged the same. \n \n Trouble also lurks, more familiarly, to Obama’s right. \n \n “This isn’t the greatest deal in the world,” Boehner said in a statement Sunday night, urging a vote as soon as possible. “But it shows how much we’ve changed the terms of the debate in this town.” \n \n Boehner and other conservatives have faced resistance from those Republicans who represent tea party ideals.

Ron Johnson (R-TX), who was elected by tea party constituents. \n \n Obama, for one, realized that the vote has not happened yet, and encouraged Americans to continue to contact their members of Congress to express support for the plan. \n \n “We’re not done yet,” he said Sunday night.', ""Mystery solved. \n \n The “angel priest” who appeared at the scene of a Missouri car crash, anointed and prayed with the teenage victim, then vanished has been identified as Rev.

Researchers looked at 40 volunteers, all back pain sufferers, and found that brain scans could predict with 85% accuracy whether their pain would become chronic. At issue is the emotional response to injury and the relationship between two brain regions, the nucleus accumbens and the frontal cortex, the Telegraph reports. When these brain regions—related to motivational and emotional behavior—get to talking, the odds increase that pain will become chronic, explains PsychCentral. ''The injury itself is not enough to explain the ongoing pain,” says the study's lead researcher. ""It has to do with the injury combined with the state of the brain.''

A listing as endangered would likely lead to federal protection of areas rich in oil and gas. \n \n Andrew Wetzler of the Natural Resources Defense Council questioned the administration\'s logic, saying: ""I guess if a wrecking ball is barreling down on your house, you are just \'threatened.\'"" \n \n The decision left in place a 2008 ruling under president George W.

The study in question is completely nonsensical, procedurally generated by iOS’s autocomplete function. Why, then, did a conference for “leading academic scientists” select it for presentation? \n \n On Thursday, Dr. Bartneck received an invitation to submit research for an upcoming conference on nuclear physics. With virtually no background in the subject, he decided to use autocomplete to help write his facetious submission. \n \n “I started a sentence with ‘atomic’ or ‘nuclear’ and then randomly hit the autocomplete suggestions,” Bartneck wrote in a blog post. “The text really does not make any sense.” \n \n Aside from a sprinkling of scientific buzzwords, Bartneck’s abstract is both off-topic and unreadable. One passage reads: \n \n Nuclear energy is not a nuclear nuclear power to the nuclear nuclear program he added and the nuclear nuclear program is a good united state of the nuclear nuclear power program and the united way nuclear nuclear program nuclear. \n \n And yet, Bartneck received a follow-up email just three hours later – his abstract had been accepted. From there, he could pay $1,099 to register as an academic speaker at the Atlanta, Ga. convention. \n \n “I did not complete this step since my university would certainly object to me wasting money this way,” Bartneck told the Guardian Australia. “My impression is that this is not a particularly good conference.” \n \n Bartneck’s study calls to mind other prominent hoaxes, such as the so-called “Sokal affair.” In 1996, the humanities journal Social Text published a study titled, ""Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity"" by New York University physics professor Alan Sokal, whose paper was actually an experiment designed to test the journal’s political biases and intellectual rigor. Using logical fallacies and pseudoscientific gibberish, it argued that quantum gravity is a social construct. \n \n New research suggests that many journals are slacking on peer review. In a kind of meta-study, Harvard biologist and science journalist John Bohannon submitted false studies to 304 open-access journals. More than half accepted his paper, which featured fake names and several basic chemistry errors. \n \n But the acceptance of Bartneck’s fake study may be less surprising. Between its poorly designed website, open calls for abstracts, and vague location, the conference smacks of a scam. \n \n It wouldn’t be the first organization that tried to capitalize on scientists’ need to publish. In 2014, the International Journal of Advanced Computer Technology accepted a submission titled “Get Me Off Your [expletive] Mailing List."" The “study,” which simply repeats the titular phrase for several pages, was submitted by Peter Vamplew, a lecturer of computer science at Federation University in Victoria after receiving unsolicited requests from the journal. \n \n “They’re predatory journals, preying on young, inexperienced researchers who unwittingly don’t realise they’re of questionable quality,” Vamplew told the Guardian.']",3,"– Not everybody's heaping praise on the Obama administration this week: Environmentalists are fuming that the Fish and Wildlife Service decided not to ramp up protection of polar bears by changing their status from ""threatened"" to ""endangered.""

(You can find the 2016 World Fame 100 here.) We also sought input from ESPN journalists around the world, including colleagues in our bureaus in Australia, South Africa, Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Mexico and the United Kingdom. \n \n The data for each athlete in the pool was then fed into a formula created by ESPN director of sports analytics Ben Alamar that weighs athletes' endorsements, their following on the social media Big Three (Facebook, Twitter and Instagram) and Google search popularity, producing a comparative ranking system. The analysis includes five categories: endorsement money, Twitter followers, Instagram followers, Facebook followers and Google Trends score. For special situations (esports and China) we used two additional categories: other social media -- for when the athlete was more relevant on a platform outside the Big Three (Twitch, for example, although no gamers made the top 100) -- and, in China's case, Baidu search score, because Google is blocked there. \n \n Salary is not used as a factor because of differences among sports. For example, players in a league with a salary cap would be at an unfair disadvantage when measured against players in uncapped leagues. Endorsement dollars, however, reflect the ability to draw attention -- which is a good way to define fame. \n \n Endorsement amounts cover 2016 and were compiled by ESPN researchers. All currency figures were converted to U.S. dollars using March 27 rates. The social media followings and Google Trend scores (which show relative popularity based on how often names are searched on a scale of 0 to 100) were as of April 19. (Note: Where categories in the profiles are marked as NA, the athlete either doesn't have an official account for that social media site or an accurate endorsement figure could not be confirmed.) \n \n Retired athletes are not included. Therefore, popular stars such as Tony Romo (No. 70 in 2016) and Floyd Mayweather (No. 26 in 2016) are absent. We have also excluded amateur athletes -- Deshaun Watson, Lonzo Ball and Katie Ledecky, for example -- due to lack of salary and endorsements. \n \n Contributors: Primary research by Sachin Dave Chandan and Charlotte Gibson.

The agency has acknowledged that agents improperly singled out tea party and other conservative groups for extra scrutiny when they applied for tax-exempt status from 2010 to 2012. \n \n ""We think there\'s reason to believe that laws were broken, that constitutional rights were violated,"" said committee chairman Dave Camp, R-Mich.

Wednesday\'s vote to refer the matter to the Justice Department was 23-14, with all Republicans voting in favor and all Democrats voting against. \n \n Democratic leaders said the vote was a political stunt designed to fire up the Republican base in an election year. They noted that the Justice Department is already investigating whether any crimes have been committed. \n \n ""It now seems clear that Republican members of the Ways and Means Committee have decided that they do not want to be left behind in the Republican campaign to declare this a scandal and keep it going until November,"" said Rep.

""I think it\'s important that the public has an understanding of what went on, and I think if I sent a secret letter to the Department of Justice, I think that would be doing a disservice to the Americans whose constitutional rights are on the line."" \n \n Lerner first publicly disclosed the issue at a lawyers\' conference in May 2013. At the time, she apologized on behalf of the IRS. \n \n Soon afterward, President Barack Obama forced the acting IRS commissioner to resign, and much of the agency\'s top leadership has been replaced. \n \n Lerner has emerged as a central figure in investigations by congressional committees. The House Oversight Committee has scheduled a vote for Thursday on whether to hold Lerner in contempt of Congress for refusing to answer questions at two congressional hearings. \n \n At both hearings, Lerner invoked her constitutional right against self-incrimination. House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa, R-Calif., said Lerner had effectively waived her Fifth Amendment right not to answer questions by providing an opening statement at a hearing last year. \n \n Taylor and Democrats on the oversight committee disagree. \n \n Lerner is an attorney who joined the IRS in 2001.

Its nonprofit arm spent about $70 million.', 'The House Ways and Means Committee on Wednesday accused former IRS official Lois Lerner of targeting the prominent GOP group Crossroads GPS and urged the Justice Department to take a fresh look at whether she should be prosecuted. \n \n The rare step by the tax-writing panel comes as congressional Republicans are turning up the heat on the IRS, and a day before Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) and the House Oversight Committee are expected to vote to hold Lerner in contempt of Congress. \n \n In a referral to Attorney General Eric Holder, Republicans make the case that Lerner took an “aggressive and improper” interest in Crossroads GPS, the group co-founded by Karl Rove that spent tens of millions of dollars in the 2010 and 2012 election cycles. \n \n The committee voted to send that referral to Holder after a session conducted mainly behind closed doors and on a 23-14, party-line vote. \n \n Lerner, who headed an IRS division overseeing exempt organizations, pushed to deny Crossroads GPS’s application for tax-exempt status and to audit the group, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp (R-Mich.) says in his letter to Holder. \n \n Lerner showed no such interest in liberal groups, the letter adds, despite concerns by campaign finance reform groups. Ways and Means also alleges that Lerner misled federal investigators about when she first became aware of the IRS’s improper scrutiny of Tea Party groups, and that she recklessly handled confidential taxpayer information. \n \n [READ THE LETTER.] \n \n Camp told reporters after Wednesday’s vote that the committee and Congress needed to stand up to an immensely powerful agency that “can strike the fear of God” into average taxpayers. \n \n “We have to make sure that the signal goes out that this can’t happen again,” Camp told reporters. “If we don’t stand up for people’s constitutional rights on behalf of the American people, who else will?” \n \n The Ways and Means vote was the latest wrinkle in the controversy, now 11 months old, that erupted when Lerner apologized in May 2013 for the IRS’s treatment of Tea Party groups seeking tax-exempt status. The referral could also broaden the congressional investigations, which have largely focused on more grassroots organizations. \n \n Lerner, who has since retired from the IRS, is expected to face another legal headache on Thursday, when Issa begins contempt proceedings. House GOP leaders who said Wednesday that they supported the Ways and Means referral are also on record backing contempt charges. \n \n Issa has said that Lerner, who has twice refused to answer questions in front of the Oversight panel, is the most important figure in his IRS investigation. \n \n Ways and Means Democrats accused Camp and their GOP colleagues of taking a page out of Issa’s playbook and playing politics by releasing taxpayer information. \n \n Rep. Sandy Levin (Mich.), the panel’s top Democrat, said Camp was undermining the panel by making it into “an arm of any campaign committee.” Democrats later said Republicans merely wanted to “promote and protect” GOP moneymen like Rove. \n \n “The way it should have been handled was to simply forward any documentation over there and indicate the full cooperation of the committee,” said Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas). \n \n Lerner’s attorney, Bill Taylor of Zuckerman Spaeder, called the timing of Wednesday’s vote “odd,” and said he had not heard from the Ways and Means Committee about its referral. \n \n “The committee’s referral affects nothing. The Department of Justice is already investigating the IRS. This is just another attempt by Republicans to vilify Ms. Lerner for political gain,” Taylor said in a statement to reporters. \n \n But Steven Law, Crossroads GPS’s chief executive, said the Ways and Means referral “confirms that there was an organized high-level effort within the IRS to subvert the agency’s own standards and procedures in order to harass law-abiding conservative advocacy groups like Crossroads GPS.” \n \n Law said in a separate statement that the group was still waiting for a final decision from the IRS on its application, which it first asked for in 2010. \n \n The group can continue to operate as tax-exempt until that IRS ruling. Under the current IRS rules, 501(c)(4) groups need to make promoting social welfare their primary purpose. The law says those groups should be exclusively concentrating on social welfare, a difference campaign finance reform organizations believe has been part of the problem. \n \n “It is now apparent that Ms. Lerner was directly and improperly involved in targeting our application, which may explain why we are still awaiting final action on our 501(c)(4) certification,” Law said. \n \n Camp also defended his decision to bring the charges against Lerner public. “If I sent a secret letter to the Department of Justice, I think that would be doing a disservice to the Americans whose constitutional rights are on the line,” he said. \n \n In the documents Ways and Means released Wednesday, Lerner also discusses going after a job at Organizing for Action, the offshoot of Obama’s campaign operation. \n \n “Oh — maybe I can get the DC office job!” she told colleagues in an email, though it’s unclear whether she was joking. \n \n The Ways and Means referral also accuses Lerner of targeting conservative groups outside of Crossroads. In January 2013, Lerner circulated a news article on five groups whose status she wanted to discuss. Three of those groups were eventually audited. \n \n Republicans also suggest Lerner tried to influence the appeals process for exempt organizations whose application was denied, an area outside her jurisdiction. \n \n Plus, GOP lawmakers say that Lerner gave Treasury’s inspector general for tax administration a “half-truth” by not revealing she knew that Tea Party cases were being flagged as far back as 2010. \n \n In all, Ways and Means says the laws that Lerner might have violated are punishable by up to 11 years in prison. But the final decision on whether to prosecute lies with Holder, who has also been held in contempt by House Republicans and has a generally toxic relationship with GOP lawmakers. \n \n Emily Pierce, a Justice Department spokeswoman, would only say Wednesday that “there is already an active, ongoing investigation into the IRS’s handling of applications by tax-exempt organizations.” \n \n “It remains a high priority of the department,” she added. \n \n — Updated at 8:37 p.m.']",3,"– Last year's IRS scandal is back in the headlines.

118,"['Abstract and Introduction \n \n Abstract \n \n In 1994 the National Football League (NFL) initiated a comprehensive clinical and biomechanical research study of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI), a study that is ongoing. Data on mild TBIs sustained between 1996 and 2001 were collected and submitted by NFL team physicians and athletic trainers, and these data were analyzed by the NFL\'s Committee on Mild Traumatic Brain Injury. At the same time, analysis of game videos was performed for on-field mild TBIs to quantify the biomechanics involved and to develop means to improve the understanding of these injuries so that manufacturers could systematically improve and update their head protective equipment. The findings and analysis of the Committee have been presented in a series of articles in Neurosurgery. \n \n Introduction \n \n In 1992 Al Toon, who was a wide receiver for the New York Jets, was the first NFL player known to have retired because of postconcussion syndrome.[2] The year after Mr. Toon\'s retirement, another player, Merrill Hoge of the Chicago Bears, retired because of the same problem. Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, team physicians, and many others raised questions: was this a new problem or a misdiagnosed or unrecognized one? Was this a statistical anomaly or the beginning of an epidemic? \n \n It was decided that a rigorous, scientific approach was necessary to gather the data to answer these questions for this high-profile professional sports league. In 1994, Commissioner Tagliabue approved the creation of the NFL\'s Committee on Mild Traumatic Brain Injury.[12] The Committee was composed of experts inside and outside the NFL. It was decided by the Committee that protection against in jury as well as collection and analysis of injury data would be critical to the success of their mission. For the study, a reportable mild TBI was defined as a traumatically induced alteration in brain function manifested by an alteration of awareness and consciousness, including but not limited to an LOC, a ""ding,"" a sensation of being dazed or stunned, a sensation of ""wooziness"" or ""fogginess,"" a seizure or amnesic period, and by symptoms commonly associated with postconcussion syndrome, including persistent headaches, vertigo, lightheadedness, loss of balance, unsteadiness, syncope, near-syncope, cognitive dysfunction, memory disturbances, hearing loss, tinnitus, blurred vision, diplopia, visual loss, personality change, drowsiness, lethargy, fatigue, and inability to perform usual daily activities.[10] The research summarized here was developed, supervised, and completed in response to the stated goals of the NFL\'s Committee on Mild Traumatic Brain Injury.', ""INTRODUCTION: \n \n This study aimed to use video analysis techniques to determine the velocity, impact force, angle of impact, and impulse to fracture involved in a video-recorded bicycle accident resulting in facial fractures. Computed tomographic images of the resulting facial injury are presented for correlation with data and calculations. To our knowledge, such an analysis of an actual recorded trauma has not been reported in the literature. \n \n MATERIALS AND METHODS: \n \n A video recording of the accident was split into frames and analyzed using an image editing program. Measurements of velocity and angle of impact were obtained from this analysis, and the force of impact and impulse were calculated using the inverse dynamic method with connected rigid body segments. These results were then correlated with the actual fracture pattern found on computed tomographic imaging of the subject's face. \n \n RESULTS: \n \n There was an impact velocity of 6.25 m/s, impact angles of 14 and 6.3 degrees of neck extension and axial rotation, respectively, an impact force of 1910.4 N, and an impulse to fracture of 47.8 Ns. These physical parameters resulted in clinically significant bilateral mid-facial Le Fort II and III pattern fractures. \n \n DISCUSSION: \n \n These data confer further understanding of the biomechanics of bicycle-related accidents by correlating an actual clinical outcome with the kinematic and dynamic parameters involved in the accident itself and yielding a concrete evidence of the velocity, force, and impulse necessary to cause clinically significant facial trauma. These findings can aid in the design of protective equipment for bicycle riders to help avoid this type of injury.""]",2,"– Kids have a word for it when you land face-first: ""fail."" As an Internet meme, it's called faceplanting. But what really happens when people use their face for brakes? At BoingBoing, Maggie Koerth-Baker looks at the physical results—which aren't pretty—and takes a glimpse at the related field of injury biomechanics. She starts with a paper by a mechanical engineer about a classic faceplant: young man tries to ride bike along a board from shoreline to dock, misses board, lands face-first. (See the video here.) He endured Le Fort II and III fractures, his face cracking in a triangle shape starting at the top of the nose and going down both sides to the upper jaw. Sadly, other researchers say this particular video won't advance the field because the frame-rate is poor; real experiments analyze the 10-20 milliseconds in which injuries occur. So Koerth-Baker delves deeper into injury biomechanics, starting with John Stapp, an Air Force flight surgeon who endured a sudden stop in a rocket sled at 46.2 g's of force in 1954. He broke nearly all the capillaries in his eyes, Ejection Site reports, but his work helped the Air Force design pilot ejector-seats. More recently, studies on NFL concussions have shown that hits from the side or back cause more concussions than hits on the crown of the helmet. Which leaves faceplanters where, exactly? Well, getting seriously injured as we laugh and learn. At least this one, at SBNation, faceplanted on purpose in an effort to help his team. (Click to check out some less painful memes.)"

Despite weeks of ferocious criticism from other nations and from independent scholars, Mr. Duda’s right-wing Law and Justice Party pressed ahead with the bill. \n \n Mr. Duda said in a speech broadcast on Polish television and radio that he would sign the measure, while asking the Constitutional Court to determine whether the law violated free-speech protections and to make clear specifically what kinds of speech could be prosecuted. He said that the government wanted to be sure that survivors of war crimes felt free to tell their stories without fear. \n \n But a judicial review is unlikely to placate those who have accused the Law and Justice Party of dangerous revisionism. It is unclear when the high court, which is controlled by judges appointed by Mr. Duda’s party, might act; the law would remain in effect at least until then.', 'Columnist \n \n The Streisand effect is one of the curious byproducts of the Internet age. Named for the singer — who tried to suppress a photograph of her Malibu mansion, only to have the picture seen far more widely as a result — it occurs when an attempt to hide, remove or censor something from public view backfires badly. \n \n The Streisand effect is now in full swing in Poland, where a simultaneously incompetent and malevolent government has passed a law — rapidly, in the middle of the night — intended among other things to criminalize the term ""Polish death camps"" and other expressions implying that the Polish nation was responsible for Auschwitz and other camps built by German Nazis. The national dislike of this term goes back many years and is shared widely by all political groups, for understandable reasons. Millions of Polish citizens, including many who were not Jewish, died in these camps, among them university professors and Catholic priests, both groups deliberately targeted for extinction. Unlike in France, Belgium, Italy and most other European countries, there was no fascist, pro-German or collaborationist government in Poland during the war, and no Polish SS formation. The Nazi occupiers intended to destroy Poland as a nation, to Germanize a large chunk of the country and to turn the rest of it into a German agricultural colony. \n \n Nevertheless there were individual Poles who did terrible things to Jews during the war and afterward, just as there were individual Poles who did heroic things. The debate about how much Poland, as a nation, bears responsibility for these individual crimes has gone on for a long time and has had depressing as well as uplifting aspects. At times the conversation has been ill-tempered. But for a quarter century, dedicated Polish historians, diplomats, politicians and curators have also tried to reconcile different memories and heal wounds; one of the results was Poland\'s superb museum of Jewish history, jointly built by the international Jewish community and the Polish state. Another result was the hitherto excellent Polish-Israeli relationship, which has had big cultural as well as political benefits. Every summer, for example, a Jewish festival in Warsaw (there are others in other cities too) brings Israeli pop singers to a square near my apartment, and the concerts are always packed. \n \n The imposition, now, of a three-year prison penalty for anyone who participates in the conversation about the past in ways that irritate the current ruling party is simply ludicrous, even laughable. Will the long arm of the Polish state reach out to academic conferences in Tokyo or Buenos Aires if someone uses an incorrect phrase? Will people be punished for politically incorrect memoirs? In a pompous speech the Polish prime minister gave supporting the law, an automatic translation service made it appear as if he himself said that ""camps where millions of Jews were murdered were Polish."" Should he go to prison, too? Should Google Translate? The very stupidity and unenforceability of this law is what has brought on the Streisand effect: Beginning in Israel but moving quickly across all forms of social media around the world, the use of the phrase ""Polish death camps"" has suddenly spiked and has now been used many more times than ever before in history. \n \n To Poland\'s anti-pluralist ruling party that doesn\'t matter, because the real purpose of the law was never Poland\'s international image. In a sharp break with all previous democratic governments of the left, right and center, going back to 1989, this government does not care how isolated or ridiculous the country becomes. On the contrary, foreign criticism offers another chance to solidify the support of ""patriots"" who oppose the ""slander"" of the country, against ""traitors"" who do not. One pro-government journalist gave the game away when he declared that the criticism of the law in Israel was an element in an international conspiracy against the Polish government. On cue, Polish social media has been saturated with the howls of anti-Semites defending their country against this terrible attack. \n \n I have no doubt that the Israeli government is also using this nasty little controversy for its own purposes. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not been disturbed by the Hungarian government\'s long-standing and well-funded campaign — on billboards, in the noisy state and pro-government media — against billionaire George Soros, with its clear anti-Semitic overtones, since he dislikes Soros\'s philanthropic support for liberal causes. His decision to make an issue of this absurd Polish law instead no doubt gives him a chance to solidify his domestic support as well. Taking a stand on the past is so much easier than dealing with the complex present. \n \n The irony is that none of the protagonists of this story can actually remember World War II, or the terror that it brought to the Jews and to Poland. But that is part of the explanation: As genuine memories of the horror recede, cartoon versions of history, easily manipulated, have come to replace them. This illiterate ""debate"" is one of the more sordid results. \n \n Read more from Anne Applebaum\'s archive, follow her on Twitter or subscribe to her updates on Facebook.', 'Polish President Andrzej Duda ratified a law making it illegal to blame his country for any part in the German Nazis’ systematic murder of millions of Jews during World War II, bowing to pressure from his ruling allies and amid rallies by far-right protesters. \n \n Despite mounting international criticism, ruling Law & Justice party leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski urged Duda to sign the legislation. The president complied Tuesday, a day after dozens of activists chanted anti-Semitic slogans at a rally in front of his presidential palace in central Warsaw, with one banner reading: “Take off your yarmulke and sign the bill.” \n \n Andrzej Duda on Feb. 6. Photographer: Janek Skarzynski/AFP via Getty Images \n \n Both Israel and the U.S. have called on Poland to halt the so-called Holocaust bill, which they say curbs free speech and may be an attempt to rewrite history. Duda said that while he approved the legislation, he’s also sending it to be vetted by the Constitutional Tribunal, a court that may ask lawmakers to change part or all of the legislation. \n \n “This guarantees Polish interests, such as our dignity and the historical truth -- that we will be fairly evaluated in the world,” Duda told reporters in Warsaw, taking no questions. “On the other hand, my decision takes into account the sensitivity of people for whom the historical truth and the truth about the Holocaust is extremely important.” \n \n ‘Rewritten Narrative’ \n \n Israel’s Foreign Ministry said that it hopes the tribunal’s pending review will allow it to work on amendments with Polish authorities. \n \n The controversy represents the latest conflict for the Law & Justice party, which over two years in power has battled its partners in the European Union over allegations that it’s backtracking on democratic values. Once seen as a model of transformation from communism, Poland is “squandering the great gains” it has achieved since 1989, according to Judy Dempsey, a Berlin-based fellow at Carnegie Europe, a think-tank. \n \n Poland’s main political objective since embracing democracy was to anchor itself in the EU and NATO, helped by “rapprochement and reconciliation” with Germany, Ukraine and Israel, Dempsey wrote on Tuesday. “But now, because of this legislation, the Polish narrative is being rewritten in a way that it is becoming seeped in patriotism, victimhood, and revenge.” \n \n ‘A Single Jew’ \n \n Poles say they’re unfairly held complicit in German Nazi war crimes during a period when their country was occupied and an estimated 2.7 million non-Jewish civilians were killed, including a large number of resistance fighters. Only 380,000 of Poland’s 3 million Jews -- Europe’s largest pre-war Jewish community -- survived the Holocaust, according to Israel’s Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial. \n \n While some Polish civilians participated in the murder of Jews or turned them over to Nazis to avoid being executed for hiding them, others resisted. Yad Vashem has commemorated 6,700 Poles for rescuing Jews, the largest number of “Righteous Gentiles” in any country. \n \n The law would impose fines or up to three years in jail for public claims that Poland or the Polish nation bears responsibility for crimes against humanity committed on its soil. Works of art and science are exempt. \n \n “We don’t have any intention to prosecute someone who says that somewhere a single Jew or a family were murdered,” Kaczynski told public radio on Feb. 3. “Such events took place and we never denied this.” \n \n Ukrainian Objection \n \n Last week, Israeli legislators drew up a bill defining any attempt to deny or minimize the crimes of Nazi collaborators as Holocaust denial, which carries a five-year prison sentence in the Jewish state. It would provide state backing for any Holocaust survivor or educator prosecuted under the Polish bill. \n \n Neighboring Ukraine also criticized the Polish law, which widened the government’s mandate to prosecute crimes committed by “Ukrainian nationalists and members of Ukrainian formations collaborating with the Third Reich” from 1925 to 1950. Lawmakers in Kiev passed a resolution Tuesday saying they were “deeply concerned” the law could pave the way for “the strengthening of anti-Ukrainian tendencies.” \n \n — With assistance by Konrad Krasuski, Daryna Krasnolutska, and Alisa Odenheimer']",3,"– The US and Israel pitched a fit, but it ultimately wasn't enough to fully stop Poland from moving ahead with its controversial Holocaust law. Polish President Andrzej Duda on Tuesday announced he would sign a bill that prohibits speech that states or suggests his nation was complicit in Nazi Germany's crimes. In a concession to critics, though, Duda will have the Constitutional Tribunal examine the law; Bloomberg reports the court has the power to force lawmakers to alter the law's language in whole or part. The New York Times quotes Duda as saying he's adding that step because the ""very painful, delicate issue"" needs to be handled thoughtfully, though the Times sees the move as doing little to assuage those who say it could curtail free speech and whitewash the role some Poles played in the killing of Jews during World War II. Duda said that should the court clear the law, he'd like to see it specify exactly what type of speech is subject to prosecution. As it stands now, using the phrase ""Polish death camp"" to refer to Auschwitz and other Nazi-constructed concentration camps within the country can result in a prison term; claiming the Polish nation ""is responsible or co-responsible for Nazi crimes"" is punishable by up to three years. In a Washington Post column, Anne Applebaum writes of the law's ""ludicrous"" potential: ""Will the long arm of the Polish state reach out to academic conferences in Tokyo or Buenos Aires if someone uses an incorrect phrase? ... In a pompous speech the Polish prime minister gave supporting the law, an automatic translation service made it appear as if he himself said that 'camps where millions of Jews were murdered were Polish.'

Also released was a letter that he wrote describing the shooting. \n \n At first the teenagers turned down the music in their car, as he had asked, but then he wrote that he could hear one of the passengers in the back seat shouting that he should kill Dunn. \n \n ""He bends forward and picked something up with both hands,"" Dunn wrote. ""As he\'s doing this, he says \'yeah-I\'m going to f****** kill you!"" and now I can tell what he\'s picked up, as he just laid a gun barrel against the window sill.

""Between fear, adrenaline and muscle-memory, I grabbed my pistol from the glove box. As I was doing so, I shouted, ""You\'re not going to kill me you son of a b****!"" \n \n Dunn, who is white, testified that he fired in self-defense. \n \n \n \n But no weapon was found in the SUV and Davis\' friends said they did not hear him threaten Dunn. The state\'s medical examiner testified that the trajectory of Dunn\'s bullets into Davis\' body showed that Davis was sitting down when he was shot. \n \n Authorities said that Dunn became enraged about the music and the argument. One person walking out of the store said he heard Dunn say, ""You are not going to talk to me like that."" \n \n The state attorney, Angela Corey, has said her office will seek a retrial of Dunn on the first-degree murder charge. \n \n Dunn\'s defense attorney, Cory Strolla, has said he plans to appeal. \n \n In another telephone call, Dunn\'s father told him of the shooting, ""This thing is viral.

Jurors found Dunn guilty on four of five charges for shooting at Davis\' friends, who were also in the car, as well as firing a gun into a car in the 2012 incident. However, jurors could not agree on the first-degree murder charge for shooting Davis, prompting a mistrial on that count. \n \n The recordings mirror statements Dunn made in trial in which he stated that he believed his life was in danger, thus leaving him little choice but to shoot.

Dunn said he believed Davis had a weapon, leaving him little choice but to defend himself. However, a gun was never recovered at the scene. \n \n In one of the nine calls released today, Dunn reads a letter that he planned on sending to the judge presiding over his case in an effort to make bail. Repeatedly both he and his fiancé say that the legal system is stacked against them, however Dunn says the law is on his side. \n \n ""I\'m super confident if they take this to trial it will be a short deliberation,"" said Dunn. \n \n Dunn who placed the calls while in isolation also made repeated efforts to distance himself from fellow inmates, ""Being in a room by myself really sucks, but better than being in a room with them animals."" \n \n He will spend at least 60 years behind bars for the attempted murder charges.

123,"['Research suggests that the ratio of the lengths of the index finger and the ring finger in males may be predictive of a variety of disorders related to disturbed hormonal balance. When the index finger is shorter than the ring finger, this results in a small 2D:4D ratio, pointing to a high exposure to testosterone in the uterus. \n \n In a new study of 103 male patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and 100 matched healthy male individuals, investigators found that the 2D:4D ratio may be an effective predictor of schizophrenia--there were significant differences between schizophrenia and control groups concerning the ratio of the lengths of the second digit to the fourth digit, as well as its asymmetry, in both hands. \n \n ""Asymmetry index showed moderate discriminatory power and, therefore asymmetry index has a potential utility as a diagnostic test in determining the presence of schizophrenia,"" said Dr. Taner Oznur, co-author of the Clinical Anatomy study. \n \n ###', 'The production of androgens (mostly testosterone) during the early fetal stage is essential for the differentiation of the male brain. Some authors have suggested a relationship between androgen exposure during the prenatal period and schizophrenia. These two separate relationships suggest that digit length ratios are associated with schizophrenia in males. The study was performed in a university hospital between October 2012 and May 2013. One hundred and three male patients diagnosed with schizophrenia according to DSM‐IV using SCID‐I, and 100 matched healthy males, were admitted to the study. Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS), Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) and Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) were used to assess schizophrenia symptoms. The second digit (2D) and fourth digit (4D) asymmetry index (AI), and the right‐ and left‐hand 2D:4D ratios were calculated. All parametric data in the groups were compared using an independent t‐test. The predictive power of the AI was estimated by receiver operating characteristics analysis. The 2D:4D AI was statistically significantly lower in the patient group than the healthy control comparison group. There were significant differences between the schizophrenia and the control groups in respect of left 2D:4D and right 2D:4D. There was no correlation between AI, left, or right 2D:4D, BPRS, or SAPS in the schizophrenia group. However, there was a negative correlation between left 2nd digit (L2D):4D and the SANS score. Our findings support the view that the 2D:4D AI can be used as a moderate indicator of schizophrenia. Even more simply, the right or left 2D:4D can be used as an indicator.

The idea is that finger lengths change depending on exposure to testosterone in utero, and it's known as the ""2D:4D"" ratio. A lower ratio—where the second digit is shorter than the fourth—indicates ""greater androgen exposure."" In the journal Clinical Anatomy, researchers write that others have previously suggested a link between androgen exposure in the womb and schizophrenia; they take that one step further, hypothesizing the ratio could be predictive of schizophrenia in males. Then they set out to test that hypothesis: In their small study, researchers analyzed the finger lengths of 103 Turkish male patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and 100 healthy male controls. They found ""significant differences between schizophrenia and control groups concerning the ratio ... in both hands,"" the researchers report in a press release. The findings occupy opposite ends of the spectrum: The right-hand 2D:4D ratio was ""significantly higher"" among the schizophrenia group and the left-hand ratio was ""significantly lower""—suggesting the two are opposites, perhaps because testosterone ""affects finger ratios differently as it acts in different ways on the left and right hemispheres of the brain,"" per the study. As for those ratios, the researchers found the size of the ratio in the left hand could indicate the severity of negative symptoms in patients.

Her critics simply don’t understand the medium, she said. \n \n In an e-mail Monday to Mayor Tim Flaherty announcing her resignation, effective immediately, she wrote, “This has been an atrocious, incredibly depressing and mind-numbingly inane experience I would not wish on anyone. I wish the city the best of luck in finding some schmuck eager to transcribe every last misogynistic joke, self-indulgent anecdote and pathetic pandering attempt by council, and every tinfoil hat conspiracy theory, racist aside, and NIMBY asshattery from the lovely council meeting frequent flyers, without which, surely our democracy could not flourish.” \n \n Lehmkul had been the subject of a recall effort after city officials said she had failed to provide minutes for up to a year. She later produced minutes for some of those meetings. \n \n She had been known for Tweeting during council meetings, with posts that included personal observations. \n \n Lehmkuhl took a job in Washington, D.C., with Working America, an affiliate of the AFL-CIO that represents non-union workers, according to her Twitter account. The Twitter account she had used as city clerk has been taken down.', 'There is a lot of relief in Pleasant Hill after city clerk Kim Lehmkuhl resigned after accusations that she failed to do the most basic part of her job. She wrote a scathing resignation letter.""I\'m paraphrasing our former President Gerald Ford in saying \'Our long municipal nightmare is now over.\' Our city clerk has resigned,"" Pleasant Hill Mayor Tim Flaherty said.City leaders say Monday was a good day for Pleasant Hill, now that Lehmkuhl resigned. Lehmkuhl was elected in 2012 and for most of her time in office failed to produce minutes of city council meetings.In her resignation letter, Lehmkuhl wrote, ""This has been an atrocious, incredibly depressing, and mind-numbingly inane experience I would not wish on anyone.""""It\'s been long awaited. The problem with our city clerk and her performance has just been a distraction to the city staff and to the city council focusing on our work of the policy-making body that we are,"" Flaherty said.It\'s unclear why Lehmkuhl failed to do her job. City leaders say they never got a straight answer. Lehmkuhl was, however, a prolific tweeter during council meetings. In an interview with ABC7 News in January, she defended her actions.""I really take issue with the sort of idea that it\'s very easy to sort of contemporaneously record all of these minutes if I weren\'t screwing around on Twitter. Unfortunately, I think that\'s really a misunderstanding of the medium,"" said Lehmkuhl on January 8, 2014.City leaders say Lehmkuhl\'s resignation saves the city more than $20,000 for a recall. As for Lehmkuhl, ABC7 News was unable to get a hold of her, but in her resignation letter she says she\'s leaving Pleasant Hill for a job in Washington D.C.', 'This article is over 9 months old \n \n Prosecutor says woman took off obligatory hijab in Tehran street to ‘encourage corruption’ \n \n An Iranian woman who publicly removed her veil in protest against Iran’s compulsory headscarf law has been sentenced to two years in prison, the judiciary said on Wednesday. \n \n \n \n Tehran’s chief prosecutor, Abbas Jafari Dolatabadi, who announced the sentence, did not give the woman’s identity but said she intended to appeal against the verdict, the judiciary’s Mizan Online news agency reported. \n \n Dolatabadi said the unidentified woman took off her headscarf in Tehran’s Enghelab Street to “encourage corruption through the removal of the hijab in public”. \n \n The woman will be eligible for parole after three months, but Dolatabadi criticised what he said was a “light” sentence and said he would push for the full two-year penalty. \n \n More than 30 Iranian women have been arrested since the end of December for publically removing their veils in defiance of the law. \n \n Most have been released, but many are being prosecuted. \n \n Women showing their hair in public in Iran are usually sentenced to far shorter terms of two months or less, and fined $25. \n \n Iranian law, in place since the Islamic Revolution of 1979, stipulates that all women, Iranian or foreign, Muslim or non-Muslim, must be fully veiled in public at all times. \n \n \n \n But the zeal of the country’s morality police has declined in the past two decades, and a growing number of Iranian women in Tehran and other large cities often wear loose veils that reveal their hair. \n \n In some areas of the capital, women are regularly seen driving cars with veils draped over their shoulders. \n \n Dolatabadi said he would no longer accept such behaviour, and had ordered the impound of vehicles driven by socially rebellious women. \n \n The prosecutor said some “tolerance” was possible when it came to women who wear the veil loosely, “but we must act with force against people who deliberately question the rules on the Islamic veil”, according to Mizan Online.']",3,"– The resignation of a Northern California town's city clerk generally wouldn't garner much in the way of press, but the drama surrounding Kim Lehmkuhl's exit from her Pleasant Hill post is just a wee bit outside the norm. Lehmkuhl was elected to the position in 2012, but things have since grown frosty between the city official and the town, with the Contra Costa Times reporting that the 34-year-old was accused of taking no minutes during city council meetings in her entire first year, and instead tweeting her way through them—under a city account, and in a very opinionated way, the city charged. Some residents called for her to step down (she refused, and the San Francisco Chronicle notes that she did later produce minutes for some meetings), and the council in March announced a November ballot item would seek to change the position to an appointed one, reports the AP. The moves, as it turns out, were unnecessary: Lehmkuhl quit on Monday, in fiery fashion, to take a job in Washington, DC. In an email to the mayor and city manager, she wrote that ""this has been an atrocious, incredibly depressing, and mind-numbingly inane experience I would not wish on anyone. I wish the City the best of luck in finding some schmuck eager to transcribe every last misogynistic joke, self-indulgent anecdote, and pathetic pandering attempt by Council."" She also wished the city manager ""best of luck with your imminent unfunded pensions scandal, that is going to be a rough one."" But Lehmkuhl wasn't the only one with blistering words. Said Pleasant Hill Mayor Tim Flaherty at Monday night's council meeting, per ABC7, ""I'm paraphrasing our former President Gerald Ford in saying 'Our long municipal nightmare is now over.'

Martin Short (also not a member of the club) was forced to work as a mistreated waiter. \n \n When Chevy Chase appeared next to Short and Martin, Timberlake was thrilled to realize he was standing next to the three amigos.

Hanks and Baldwin congratulated him and said he deserved a beer. Shortly after, Candice Bergen appeared to demand the other members put the toilet seat down after using it. \n \n In its cold open SNL took on the death of Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez. Timberlake played Elton John, who tailored “Candle in the Wind"" to fit the late president. Among the salient Chavez moments highlighted included the socialist leader calling President George W. Bush the devil during a United Nations speech and blaming capitalism for destroying life on Mars. “He really said that,” Timberlake insisted. \n \n The star power continued as Andy Samberg and Timberlake appeared as their “Dick in a Box” characters during a dating sketch.

Better yet, the message delivered by the patient was a great one: I'm not in pain. The Canadian Press and the BBC explain that doctors studied the patient's brain waves as they voiced a command: he should think about playing tennis if he were not in pain or about walking around the house if he were. The activities trigger different parts of the brain—motor skills vs. visual associations—and the man's brain waves suggested he was pain-free. ""Scott has been able to show he has a conscious, thinking mind,"" says a British neuroscientist, referring to 39-year-old Scott Routley.

126,"['Kellyanne Conway appeared on Fox News Sunday this morning with more of her patented alternative facts. This time, the White House aide was discussing video the administration shared of the interaction between CNN reporter Jim Acosta and a White House press intern who tried to take a mic away from him during a combative exchange with the president, footage experts have confirmed was altered to speed up the motion of Acosta’s arm. \n \n Host Chris Wallace broached the subject of the now-infamous confrontation first: “I want to ask you about two responses by the White House. First, to tweet a video that was clearly altered to make it look like it was more of a physical confrontation that it really was… And second, to pull Acosta’s pass to get into the White House and to threaten to do that to other reporters.” \n \n “Well, Chris, first of all,” Conway responded, “What do you mean by edited, or as others are saying, ‘doctored video?’ He either put his hands on her and grabbed the mic back or he did not, and he clearly did.” \n \n “The video was altered, and there are experts who have looked at it,” Wallace said. \n \n This is where Conway went into ultimate spin mode. \n \n “By that do you mean sped up? Oh, well that’s not altered, that’s sped up,” she said. “They do it all the time in sports to see if there’s actually a first down or a touchdown, so I have to disagree with the, I think, overwrought description of this video being doctored as if we put somebody else’s arm in there.” \n \n There’s a lot to unpack here. First, let’s consult the dictionary for a definition of “altered.” To alter something means “to make different in some particular, as size, style, course, or the like; modify.” Speeding up a video sure seems to fall under that definition. \n \n Second, sports. It’s blatantly untrue that sports broadcasters speed up footage to show where the ball should be marked or a touchdown. If anything they slow the footage to see it more clearly. But, apparently, in Kellyanne’s world, where up is down, black is white and cats and dogs are besties, sports broadcasts actually speed up plays that they are trying to analyze. \n \n Third, no one is saying they “put somebody else’s arm” in the video. It’s a strawman argument, one of Conway’s favorite tactics. \n \n The exchange between Acosta and the intern, fueled by the White Houses’s mischaracterization of the interaction, has become such a cultural talking point it was parodied on Saturday Night Live, with Cecily Strong playing the determined intern trying to take the mic from Weekend Update host Colin Jost.', 'Play Facebook \n \n Twitter \n \n Embed Underwater Skeleton Party Found By Sheriff\'s Department 1:30 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog \n \n The scene is more ""Weekend at Bernie\'s"" and less Ouija board seance, but two fake skeletons relaxing in armchairs on the bed of the Colorado River initially had Arizona authorities diving to find human remains. \n \n A snorkeler first spotted the skeletons near a boat launch in Cienaga Springs and alerted authorities of possible human remains around 10:00 a.m. on Monday.

128,"['The building in Accra, Ghana, where an organized crime ring flew an American flag, hung a photo of President Obama and claimed it was the real U.S. Embassy. (Courtesy of the State Department) \n \n For a decade, an American flag flew outside a battered pink building in Ghana’s capital city, welcoming out-of-town visitors who, once inside, found a photo of President Obama hanging on the wall. Signs confirmed to travelers — who had been bused in from the most remote parts of West Africa — that they had arrived at the U.S. Embassy in Accra. \n \n The “consular officers” working there were not Americans, but they spoke English and Dutch and issued official-looking visas and identification papers. They charged their customers $6,000. \n \n Billboards and fliers advertised the official services. \n \n But there was nothing official about them. The real U.S. Embassy in Accra is white, not pink, and it sits on a large piece of land inside security fences in one of the city’s wealthiest neighborhoods. \n \n The battered building with the flag and Obama picture was a fake — ran by Ghanaian and Turkish organized crime rings and a Ghanaian lawyer practicing immigration and criminal law, the State Department said in a statement. \n \n “For about a decade it operated unhindered,” the statement said. “The criminals running the operation were able to pay off corrupt officials to look the other way, as well as obtain legitimate blank documents to be doctored.” \n \n Officials said they shut down the fraudulent operation during the summer after an informant tipped off the assistant investigator for the Regional Security Office. The investigation in Ghana stemmed from a larger State Department initiative, Operation Spartan Vanguard, which was created by the RSO to “address trafficking and fraud plaguing the U.S. Embassy and the region,” according to the statement. \n \n \n \n The real U.S. Embassy in Ghana. (Courtesy of the State Department) \n \n The State Department released information about the investigation Nov. 2, but the news is being widely reported only now. The story seems to have been first reported by Ghanaian media last week, and it cites the statement from one month ago on the State Department website. The information was not contained in a news release from the State Department or its Bureau of Diplomatic Security, but in a “behind the scenes” article written by diplomatic security staff. \n \n In it, officials did not say how many people, if any, may have entered the United States illegally with documentation from the fake embassy or how the crime ring got hold of what the state department called “fraudulently obtained, legitimate U.S. visas.” \n \n State Department officials in Ghana deferred questions to the media office in Washington, which did not immediately respond to a request for more information. \n \n The sham embassy, authorities said, did not allow walk-in appointments but instead recruited customers from remote parts of West Africa and even targeted people in the neighboring countries of Ivory Coast and Togo with billboards and fliers. They would shuttle customers to Accra, rent them rooms in a nearby hotel and then shuttle them to the fake embassy, which only operated on Monday, Tuesday and Friday, from 7:30 a.m. to noon. \n \n The Turkish citizens posing as “consulate officers,” officials said, issued U.S. work visas, counterfeit visas and false Ghanaian identification papers, such as bank and education records and birth certificates. \n \n \n \n Fake passports and documentation obtained in the raids. (Courtesy of the U.S. State Department) \n \n The RSO investigator, with officers from the Ghana Police Force, verified the initial informant tip and then formed an international task force that included the Ghana Detective Bureau, Ghana SWAT and Canadian Embassy officials. \n \n They exposed the shabby pink building as the crime ring’s central hub and discovered two other locations — a dress shop and an apartment building — that were satellite operators. \n \n A raid at the dress shop derailed the investigation when the “corrupt Ghanaian attorney” lied to local police, officials said, telling law enforcement they could not enter the shop because it was involved in a different court case. \n \n That court case, though, did not exist — it was a decoy meant to buy time for “corrupt officials” to find money and bail out of jail members of the crime ring, officials said. The group then moved the document-production facility — including a purported industrial sewing machine that bound the fake passports — outside Accra and exported the fraudulent documents from the dress shop to Europe and other parts of Africa. \n \n “Several suspects” were arrested during the raids, State Department officials said, but they did not specify how many. Warrants have been issued for the suspects who escaped and Ghanaian police plan to pursue them. Officials said the investigation is ongoing. \n \n Evidence collected during the raids included a laptop computer, smartphones, counterfeit-identity documents, 150 passports from 10 countries, and legitimate and counterfeit visas from the United States, the Schengen area of Europe, India and South Africa. \n \n The creation of fraudulent documents has decreased by 70 percent since Operation Spartan Vanguard commenced, officials said, but called this “only the beginning.” \n \n In Africa, many people seek visas for Western countries such as the United States, making production of fake documents at steep prices a profitable business model for crime rings, Reuters reported. \n \n Similar operations have been busted in Accra, including one in January that had been making and selling fake documents for 13 years. In that investigation, authorities found 190 passports, three printers, one camera, 75 different rubber stamps, two lamination machines and a laptop, Modern Ghana reported. Three men were arrested. \n \n More from Morning Mix: \n \n ‘All we could do was stand there’: She watched Oakland’s inferno consume the one she loved the most \n \n Canadian policeman offers heartfelt apology for threatening to punish drunk drivers with Nickelback \n \n Harper Lee would surely disapprove of the plans afoot for her Alabama home town', 'By Jennifer Froetschel, DS Public Affairs \n \n When you stepped inside a building in Accra, Ghana, you were greeted by an American flag and a photo of President Obama. It wasn’t the U.S. Embassy, however. \n \n It was not operated by the United States government, but by figures from both Ghanaian and Turkish organized crime rings and a Ghanaian attorney practicing immigration and criminal law. The ""consular officers"" were Turkish citizens who spoke English and Dutch. \n \n \n \n One of several buildings used by the disrupted fraud ring in Accra, Ghana. (U.S. Department of State photo) \n \n For about a decade it operated unhindered; the criminals running the operation were able to pay off corrupt officials to look the other way, as well as obtain legitimate blank local documents to be doctored or counterfeited. \n \n This past summer the assistant regional security officer investigator (ARSO-I) at the real U.S. Embassy in Accra, in cooperation with the Ghana Police Force, Ghana Detectives Bureau, and other international partners, shut down this “fake embassy.” \n \n \n \n Exterior of the legitimate U.S. Embassy in Accra, Ghana (U.S. Department of State photo) \n \n This investigation is a small part of the broader “Operation Spartan Vanguard"" initiative. ""Operation Spartan Vanguard"" was developed by Diplomatic Security agents in the Regional Security Office (RSO) at U.S. Embassy Ghana in order to address trafficking and fraud plaguing the U.S. Embassy and the region. \n \n During the course of another fraud investigation in ""Operation Spartan Vanguard"" an informant tipped off the ARSO-I about the fraudulent document operation, as well as a fake Netherlands embassy operating in Accra. \n \n After receiving the tip, the ARSO-I, who is the point person in the RSO shop for ""Operation Spartan Vanguard"" investigations, verified the information with partners within the Ghanaian Police Force. The ARSO-I then created an international task force composed of the aforementioned Ghana Police Force, as well as the Ghana Detective Bureau, Ghana SWAT, and officials from the Canadian Embassy to investigate further. \n \n The investigation identified the main architects of the criminal operation and several satellite locations (including a dress shop and an apartment building) used for operations. The “fake embassy” did not accept walk-in visa appointments; instead, they drove to the most remote parts of West Africa to find customers, advertising their services through flyers and billboards to cultivate customers from Ghana, Cote d\'Ivoire, and Togo. They would shuttle the customers to Accra, and rent them a room at a hotel nearby. The Ghanaian organized crime ring would shuttle the victims to and from the fake embassies. Locating the document vendor within the group led investigators to uncover the satellite locations and key players. \n \n When the task force conducted raids, they arrested several suspects and collected evidence that included a laptop computer; cell smart phones; counterfeit identity documents; and 150 lost, stolen, or purchased passports from 10 countries. A small number of these passports contained expired U.S. visas. The criminals would either chemically wash and doctor expired visas or use them as a blueprint in an attempt to create counterfeit visa foils. The fraud ring sold these expired and counterfeit visas and other false identification documents (including bank records, education records, birth certificates, and others) for a cost of $6,000. \n \n The dress shop acted as both a front for the operation—it was open to the general public for alterations and the purchase of dresses—as well as housing some of the document production. It was purported to house an industrial sewing machine they would use to re-create the binding on the fake passports. \n \n During the raid on the dress shop the corrupt Ghanaian attorney lied to Ghanaian detectives by telling them they were not allowed to access the shop because it was involved in an additional court case. \n \n The ""additional court case"" was determined to be fallacious, but it bought enough time for corrupt officials to arrange for bail for members of the organized crime group so that they could move the document production facility outside of Accra. Many of the documents also were exported elsewhere in Africa and to Europe through the dress shop. \n \n Several suspects remain at large, but Ghanaian police have warrants for their arrest and plan to pursue them. The investigation and search for the Turkish organized crime group is ongoing. \n \n After the operation was complete, both Interpol and the Bureau of Consular Affairs were sent the information collected to enter into their databases. At the request of the Ghana Police, DS Computer Forensic Lab will be assisting with forensic evaluation of the computer equipment seized in the operation. \n \n Successful interagency operations like this are an essential part of investigating and stopping the well-connected criminal networks perpetrating passport and visa fraud. The regional security officer in Ghana reports that as a result of this and other raids in “Operation Spartan Vanguard,” the export of fraudulent documents have decreased by 70 percent in West Africa, criminal leaders no longer have the political cover they once had, and multiple other investigative avenues have opened to DS and other law enforcement partners, and this is only the beginning.']",2,"– All it takes to convince people you're a US Embassy is an American flag, a picture of President Obama, and a whole lot of visas—at least in Ghana, where a ramshackle building in Accra housed a phony embassy really run by organized crime members from Ghana and Turkey, the Guardian reports. What wasn't fake: the US visas they got their hands on and doled out for the past decade. ""The criminals running the operation were able to pay off corrupt officials to look the other way, as well as obtain legitimate blank documents to be doctored,"" the US State Department said in a Nov. 2 statement (per the Washington Post, the news is only being widely reported now). A visa could be had for $6,000 from ""consular officers"" who were really Turkish citizens speaking English and Dutch; customers could also get other documents, including phony birth certificates and bank statements. The ""embassy,"" only open three days a week, advertised itself on billboards and in fliers in Ghana and other West African countries. The process of obtaining a visa legally in Ghana is a ""dreadful experience,"" per the Ghana Business News, which is how these con operations flourish. This initiative was discovered after an informant tipped off an investigator involved in a larger trafficking and fraud probe in the area; the fraudulent business was shuttered over the summer. Officials aren't saying how workers acquired the real US visas, or how many people were actually able to enter the US using them or other fake paperwork. ""Several suspects"" were busted during the raid, per the State Department, with ""several"" still on the loose. Also unearthed during the investigation: a fake Dutch operation.

129,"[""Fifteen-year-old Kenneth Shinozuka of New York City won the $50,000 Scientific American Science in Action Award in August for his invention of a wearable sensor for Alzheimer's patients. The prize, part of the Google Science Fair, recognizes a teen for an innovation that can make a practical difference by addressing an environmental, health or resources challenge. \n \n Shinozuka's creation—a small pressure sensor that can be attached to a foot or a sock—notifies caregivers via their smartphones if a patient who should be sleeping gets out of bed. His grandfather, who has Alzheimer's disease, served as inspiration. “I don't think I will ever forget my shock at seeing Grandfather in his pajamas, accompanied by a policeman who found him wandering on a nearby freeway in the middle of the night,” Shinozuka says. He designed the sensor to keep his grandfather safe and to provide much needed relief to his aunt, the primary caregiver. Shinozuka recently demonstrated the technology at a local chapter of the Alzheimer's Association and a number of care facilities. He has obtained a U.S. patent for his invention."", 'Existing technologies did not provide a solution to my problem. For instance, widely used GPS tracking devices do not work indoors. More recent real-time locating systems based on radio-frequency (RF) ID tags are neither accurate nor quick enough to detect patients’ leaving bed. Initially, I considered attaching pressure sensors to the legs of a bed, but the system would be expensive and could trigger a false alarm from my grandmother, who was sleeping on the same bed as my grandfather. \n \n One night, I was looking after my grandfather and saw him step out of bed. The moment his foot landed on the floor, a light bulb flashed in my head. Why don’t I put a pressure sensor on the heel of his foot? The moment he steps onto the floor, the sensor would detect the pressure caused by his body weight, and the signal could wirelessly trigger an audible alert in my aunt’s Smartphone. This would enable my aunt to sleep much better at night without worrying about Grandfather. \n \n I immediately put down my thoughts in a sketch (Fig. 1) and started research. First, I had to find a pressure sensor that was thin and flexible enough not to affect the comfort of walking. An extensive literature search led me to a film sensor printed with pressure-sensitive ink. When pressure is applied, the ink becomes more electrically conductive. The pressure can thus be calculated by measuring the conductivity. I also thought about creating a sensor out of conductive rubber, but found it difficult to make such a sensor thin enough after testing material samples. \n \n My second challenge was designing a wearable circuit to acquire signal from the pressure sensor and wirelessly trigger an alert in a remote Smartphone when the pressure exceeds a certain threshold. The circuit needed to be compact, lightweight and human-friendly. However, the energy-consuming wireless transmission requires large, heavy batteries. A search of state-of-the-art wireless systems led me to Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), a rapidly-evolving, revolutionary wireless technology that has recently enabled the creation of many novel wearable systems. Implementing BLE required a significant amount of expertise, which I had to acquire through extensive studying and testing of BLE modules. After months of research, I was able to design a circuit that would integrate such a module with my film sensor and be powered by a coin battery. \n \n In addition, I needed to design apps to transform a Smartphone into a caretaker’s monitor. I took online courses and tutorials to learn coding for the most widely-used Android and iOS phones. With the help of a mentor, I deepened my knowledge about the core Bluetooth framework, which enabled me to establish communications between the BLE circuit and Smartphone while minimizing energy consumption. \n \n This research convinced me of the feasibility of my proposed wearable sensor system, thanks to the recent advances in Smartphones and BLE wireless technologies. I made a one-year project plan with five major tasks to realize my proposed sensor system (Table 1).', 'Ο χρήστης Donald J.

The device is a pressure sensor that can be worn as a sock or attached to the foot of a patient. If that patient gets out of bed, his or her caretaker is alerted via smartphone, Scientific American reports. Shinozuka has won the magazine's $50,000 Science in Action Award for the device via Google's Science Fair. ""My grandfather is one of the 5.2 million Alzheimer’s patients in the U.S., 65% of whom wander,"" the teen writes at the Science Fair's site. His research shows the invention works: ""A six-month trial on my grandfather validated my hypothesis: the systems detected 100% of the 437 known cases of his wandering and issued alerts within one second of his stepping out of bed."" As for future plans, he's been testing the device on other patients, and he tells NBC News that he hopes it ""will ultimately reach out to the tens of millions of wandering patients around the world and also relieve the burdens on their caregivers.""

131,"['Image copyright Science Photo Library Image caption Malaria parasites - seen here infecting red blood cells - and mosquitoes do not like cold temperatures \n \n Warmer temperatures are causing malaria to spread to higher altitudes, a study suggests. \n \n Researchers have found that people living in the highlands of Africa and South America are at an increased risk of catching the mosquito-borne disease during hotter years. \n \n They believe that temperature rises in the future could result in millions of additional cases in some areas. \n \n The research is published in the journal Science. \n \n Prof Mercedes Pascual, from the University of Michigan in the US, who carried out the research, said: ""The impact in terms of increasing the risk of exposure to disease is very large."" \n \n Vulnerable to disease \n \n Areas at higher altitudes have traditionally provided a haven from this devastating disease. \n \n This expansion could in a sense account for a substantial part of the increase of cases we have already observed in these areas Professor Mercedes Pascual, University of Michigan \n \n Both the malaria parasite and the mosquito that carries it struggle to cope with the cooler air. \n \n Prof Pascual said: ""The risk of the disease decreases with altitude and this is why historically people have settled in these higher regions."" \n \n But the scientists say the disease is entering new regions that had previously been malaria-free. \n \n To investigate, scientists looked at densely populated areas in the highlands of Colombia and Ethiopia, where there are detailed records of both temperature and malaria cases from the 1990s to 2005. \n \n They found that in warmer years, malaria shifted higher into the mountains, while in cooler years it was limited to lower elevations. \n \n ""This expansion could in a sense account for a substantial part of the increase of cases we have already observed in these areas,"" said Prof Pascual. \n \n Image copyright Science Photo Library Image caption The highlands of Ethiopia could be more vulnerable to malaria if temperatures rise \n \n The team believes that rising temperatures could cause a further spread. \n \n In Ethiopia, where nearly half of the population live at an altitude of between 1,600m (5,250ft) and 2,400m, the scientists believe there could be many more cases. \n \n ""We have estimated that, based on the distribution of malaria with altitude, a 1C rise in temperature could lead to an additional three million cases in under-15-year-olds per year,"" said Prof Pascual. \n \n The team believes that because people living in areas that have never been exposed to malaria are particularly vulnerable to the disease, attempts to stop the spread should be focused on areas at the edge of the spread. The disease is easier to control there than at lower altitudes where it has already established. \n \n According to the latest estimates from the World Health Organization, there were about 207 million cases of malaria in 2012 and an estimated 627,000 deaths. Most deaths occur among children living in Africa.', 'Malaria is one of the most common—and deadly—infectious diseases in the world, sickening more than 300 million people a year and killing over 600,000 people . But because it\'s a mosquito-borne disease—the parasite that causes malaria is passed to human beings by mosquito bites—its range has been limited to warmer tropical areas, the so-called ""malaria belt."" And even within tropical countries, altitude matters: the disease is much less common in tropical highlands, where colder temperatures slow down both the mosquito and the development of the parasite within it. It\'s not for nothing that 19th century British colonists would build hill stations in malaria-prone countries like India, to escape both heat and disease. \n \n So it\'s not surprising either that scientists have been trying to find out for years whether climate change might expand the range of malaria, putting millions of people who live in tropical highlands at risk. Warmer temperatures should mean more malaria, but in recent years the number of cases has actually fallen dramatically , largely because of renewed efforts to fight the disease. But now a new study in Science makes a strong case that as the climate warms, malaria will indeed be on the march, expanding its range to previously safe high-altitude territory, putting even more pressure on prevention campaigns—and if those fail, leading to more deaths. \n \n Researchers from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and the University of Michigan sifted through regional records in Ethiopia and Colombia, two tropical countries with highland territory, looking at malaria cases from 1990 to 2005 in Colombia and 1993 to 2005 in Ethiopia. They corrected for other factors that might influence malaria cases—mosquito control programs, for example, which lead to fewer of the insects; and rainfall, which leads to more—and found that the median altitude of malaria cases moved higher in warm years, and lower during cooler yields. All else being equal, as the planet warms, it seems likely that malaria will become more dangerous to more people. \n \n ""This is indisputable evidence of a climate effect,"" said Mercedes Pascual, a disease ecologist at Michigan and one of authors of the Science paper. ""Our findings here underscore the size of the problem and emphasize the need for sustained intervention efforts in these regions, especially in Africa."" \n \n One thing that will make the problem worse is that people who live in tropical highlands tend to be much more vulnerable to malaria parasites to begin with because they\'ve never been infected before. In an earlier paper, the Science researchers estimated that a 1° C (1.8° F) temperature increase could lead to an additional 3 million malaria cases in Ethiopian children, assuming control methods weren\'t strengthened. And that\'s the key point. While global warming will put more people around the world at risk for malaria and other tropical diseases, climate is far from the only factor at work. Developed cities like Singapore are well within the malaria belt, but the disease has been virtually eradicated there thanks to stringent control methods. Malaria was rampant in U.S. states like Georgia as late as the 1920s, but it\'s long gone now , eliminated by control efforts that led to the creation of the Centers for Disease Control. And even in Africa, malaria incidences have fallen by 31% since 2000— as the climate has warmed—and globally 3.3 million malaria deaths have been avoided thanks to the work of institutions like the Gates Foundation . Malaria, like many infectious diseases, is first and foremost a problem of development and poverty—and when those are addressed, infections fall. \n \n But by expanding the range of malaria, climate change will make a tough challenge all the more difficult. It\'s just one more way carbon can kill.']",2,"– Efforts to eradicate malaria are going to be hit hard by rising temperatures that open up new altitudes to the mosquitoes that carry the disease, researchers warn. Both mosquitoes and the malaria parasite struggle in chillier temperatures, and a new study has found that the disease climbs to higher elevations in warmer years, the BBC reports. In areas like the highlands of Colombia and Ethiopia, people have never been exposed to malaria, making them especially vulnerable to the spread of the disease. ""We have estimated that, based on the distribution of malaria with altitude, a 1C rise in temperature could lead to an additional three million cases in under-15-year-olds per year,"" one of the researchers warns. Malaria infects more than 200 million people per year and kills around 600,000 of them, mainly children in Africa. But climate isn't the only factor at work in its spread, with the biggest advances in malaria control coming alongside efforts to combat poverty, Time notes."
132,"['UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The State Department said on Monday it was ending U.S. funding for the United Nations Population Fund, the international body’s agency focused on family planning as well as maternal and child health in more than 150 countries. \n \n In a letter to U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, the State Department said it was dropping the funding because the U.N. Population Fund (UNFPA) “supports, or participates in the management of, a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization.” \n \n The cut marks U.S. President Donald Trump’s first move to curtail funding for the United Nations and is likely to raise further questions about how deep those cuts will eventually go throughout the organization, where the United States is the top donor. \n \n It comes after Trump in January reinstated the so-called Mexico City Policy that withholds U.S. funding for international organizations that perform abortions or provide information about abortion. \n \n Known by critics as the “global gag” rule, Trump broadened its scope to include all global health assistance in his Jan. 23 executive order that withholds at least half a billion dollars in U.S. funds. A lack of clarity around the rule, however, has left aid groups scrambling and both Republican and Democratic U.S. lawmakers seeking clarity. \n \n In a statement on its website, UNFPA said it regrets the U.S. decision to end funding, which it said is based on an “erroneous claim” that the agency supports coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization in China. \n \n UNFPA said its mission is “to ensure that every pregnancy is wanted, every childbirth is safe and every young person’s potential is fulfilled.” \n \n “The support we received over the years from the government and people of the United States has saved tens of thousands of mothers from preventable deaths and disabilities, and especially now in the rapidly developing global humanitarian crises,” the statement said. \n \n The cut follows Trump’s proposed 28 percent budget reduction for diplomacy and foreign aid, including an unspecified reduction in financial support for the United Nations and its agencies, announced last month. \n \n U.N. agencies such as the UNFPA are funded by governments voluntarily. The United States was the fourth-largest voluntary donor to UNFPA in 2015, giving $75 million in core budget and earmarked contributions. \n \n U.N. officials have warned that abrupt funding cuts could trigger more global instability and argued that dollars for diplomacy are more effective than military spending in combating terrorism.', 'The designations employed and the presentation of material on the map do not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of UNFPA concerning the legal status of any country, territory, city or area or its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries.

During the 30-year space shuttle program, 355 astronauts traveled aboard the shuttle. The program’s five shuttles (Columbia, Challenger, Discovery, Atlantis, Endeavour) flew more than 542 million miles. \n \n Cameras focused on the launch sequence revealed the foam collision but engineers could not pinpoint the location and extent of the damage. \n \n Although similar incidents had occurred on three prior shuttle launches without causing critical damage, some engineers at the space agency believed that damage to a wing could cause a catastrophic failure. \n \n Their concerns were not addressed in the two weeks that Columbia spent in orbit because NASA management believed that even if major damage had been caused, there was little that could be done to remedy the situation.']",3,"– Just days after he took office in January, President Trump put back in place the ""Mexico City policy"" that keeps federal funds from being funneled to international aid organizations that provide abortions, or even info about them. Now the United States has officially yanked US donations from the United Nations Population Fund (aka UNFPA), the arm of the UN that offers family-planning services in more than 150 nations, Reuters reports. The BBC notes that $32.5 million that was set to be allotted for 2017 will be rescinded, with a Monday letter from the State Department saying the withdrawal of the funds is because UNFPA ""supports, or participates in the management of, a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization"" in China. The US is one of UNFPA's largest benefactors, coming in fourth for 2015 with just over $75,000 in combined core and earmarked contributions. UNFPA—which relies on voluntary donations from global governments to provide its services, which include those for maternal and child health—put out a Tuesday statement noting the US decision was based on an ""erroneous claim"" about the group's work, which it says lets ""individuals and couples ... make their own decisions, free of coercion or discrimination."" The State Department letter says the money will be reallocated to the Global Health Programs account, where it will reportedly be put toward family planning, maternal health, and reproductive health in developing countries. The AP notes the UNFPA fund has traditionally seen the ax whenever the GOP is in the White House; Dems reinstate it when they take back control."

They can\'t release the girls\' cause or manner of death at this time. \n \n Police said they do not have any suspects in custody at this time, but they do not believe there is a threat to the community. \n \n ""There is someone out there that did this crime and we’re going to track them down,"" Sheriff Tobe Leazenby said. “Folks should continue with business as usual but be more mindful and watch your surroundings a little closer.” \n \n Officials believe this is the first double homicide investigation in Carroll County. \n \n Sgt. Kim Riley said parents should keep a close eye on their children. ""I think people need to be cautious and careful,"" Riley said. ""Parents should make sure they know where their children are and what their children are doing, and if nothing else, know what\'s going on in their lives. That\'s the most important thing I can say at this point in time."" \n \n The bodies were discovered along the edge of Deer Creek in Delphi which is about a half-mile away from the Monon High Bridge, the last place the two girls were seen Monday afternoon. They were supposed to meet with family members later Monday evening, but when the teens didn’t show up, and that’s when their family called police. \n \n Their disappearance led to a large search involving numerous volunteers and several law enforcement agencies. Riley said police all the way from Lowell, Indiana to Fort Wayne, Indiana have helped with the investigation. \n \n Officers are asking anyone who may have taken pictures in the area or was just on the trail to contact authorities immediately. You can call the Carroll County Sheriff\'s Department at 765-564-2413 or Indiana State Police at 765-567-2125. \n \n Delphi Community Schools Superintendent Gregory Briles said counselors will be available for students and staff Wednesday. All after school activities have been canceled for the remainder of the week at Delphi Community Middle School. \n \n “It is a small community and the community is going to wrap its arms around these families and is going to take very good care of them,” Briles said. \n \n Administrators also plan to step up security until police release more details about the investigation.']",2,"– Before you get off the plane, always check the seat-back pocket for your headphones, any magazines you might want, and those super-sensitive Homeland Security documents outlining how to protect Super Bowl attendees from an anthrax attack. One government scientist apparently didn't do so, as a CNN employee found out on a recent commercial flight, the network reports. The DHS paperwork, which was found along with a boarding pass and travel itinerary linked to a microbiologist and ex-CIA worker named Michael V. Walter, was marked ""for official use only"" and ""important for national security"" and detailed two exercises (one held last July, one in November) designed to gauge response from health and emergency management officials, as well as law enforcement, to a potential biological attack in Minneapolis on the day of the big game. Noteworthy in the report were calls for improvements in certain areas, which is the point of the exercises so that officials can fix any issues beforehand, per Juliette Kayyem, a CNN national security analyst who used to work for the DHS. Still, Kayyem notes leaving the documents on the plane was a ""really stupid thing,"" adding: ""Who knows who else could have picked this up."" It's not clear if Walter, who has headed up the agency's BioWatch program fighting bioterrorism for nearly a decade, was the one who left the documents on the plane. For national security reasons, government officials asked CNN to withhold certain details in the documents, as well as not to publish the story of the document gaffe until after the Super Bowl, which the network complied with. A DHS official would only say the incident is under ""operational review."""

136,"['At the Florida Lottery headquarters, Timothy Poole, 43, posed for a photo with an oversized check after claiming his $3 million Scratch-Off prize. But when the image hit the Internet, others recognized the 450-pound man as a registered sexual predator. \n \n In 2001, the Orange County Sheriff\'s Office arrested Poole on charges of sexual battery on a victim under 12, records show. Before that, he was arrested in 1991 for stealing almost $20,000 in food stamps from Safeco Inc. of Ocala, where he worked as a guard. \n \n In all, Poole has been arrested 12 times in Florida on charges ranging from grand theft to forging a check, records show. Poole served three months in prison in 1996 and did a second stint from 2003 to 2006, according to the Florida Department of Corrections. \n \n This week, Poole claimed his winnings from the Florida Lottery in a one-time lump-sum payment of $2,219,807.90. He played the Super Millions scratch-off game which costs $20 a ticket. The game offers 12 top prizes of $3 million and, with Poole\'s winner, five remain, spokeswoman Keri Gero said. \n \n A call to Poole\'s workplace, Triangle Cabs, was not returned. He did not answer the door of his Mount Dora home where a ""No Trespassing"" sign was posted on a fence. \n \n The Florida Lottery took down a photo of Poole from its website after learning from media about his past. \n \n Florida Lottery Timothy Poole Timothy Poole (Florida Lottery) \n \n ""We chose to not draw additional attention to this particular winner,"" said Shelly Gerteisen, communications manager for the Florida Lottery. \n \n This is not the first time a registered sex offender has struck it rich. \n \n In 2007, a Jensen Beach man arrested for lewd and lascivious or indecent assault upon a child snagged a $14 million lottery jackpot prize. \n \n This year, Massachusetts legislators are considering a bill to prevent registered sex offenders from collecting lottery earnings after a $10 million winner used the money to buy expensive gifts for a new victim, police said. \n \n If you win the Mega Millions jackpot, here are some ideas to help you spend it. \n \n In Florida, there are no laws that prohibit registered sexual predators from playing the numbers and collecting winnings. The Florida Lottery cannot withhold earnings based on someone\'s criminal record. \n \n ""There are no registration laws that would prevent that, but if that offender was under supervision or on probation there could be additional sanctions imposed by the judge,"" said Samantha Andrews of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. \n \n Restrictions depend on the nature of the crime, Andrews said. For example, some sexual predators cannot dress up on Halloween because it attracts attention from children, she said. City or county ordinances may also prevent sexual predators from living within 1,000 feet of a school, day care or park. \n \n Poole pleaded guilty in 2002 to sexual battery of two boys. \n \n The incidents occurred in the late 1990s in both Tavares and Orlando, where he sometimes stayed with the boys\' parents, according to an Orange County sheriff\'s report. Poole, then 28, denied the allegations to sheriff\'s detectives, saying he would never hurt the boys because he felt as if they were his own. \n \n He was sentenced to five years in prison by Circuit Judge Alan S.

The center says it has received almost 300 exposure reports so far this year. \n \n ""With young children, any household product is likely to end up in their mouth,"" said Dr. Cynthia Lewis-Younger, the center\'s medical director. Most exposures in Florida involved children tasting or licking the concentrated liquid packets, which don\'t cause children to become seriously ill. \n \n ""Parents know that things in the house can be dangerous and they call for advice. And (in) many of those cases we can reassure parents,"" she said. \n \n The American Association of Poison Control Centers said national data for this year had not yet been compiled, but that this kind of poisoning death had not been reported in prior years. \n \n The boy was taken from a shelter for abused women to the hospital Friday afternoon ""in some distress"" and pronounced dead about an hour later, said Kissimmee Police spokesman Capt. Warren Shepard. \n \n Police declined to release further information, citing the ongoing investigation. No charges had been filed. \n \n The Florida Department of Children and Families said it had prior history with the family of the boy, Michael Williams, but officials declined comment. \n \n ""While we have the cause of death, we just don\'t know if it was as a result of abuse or neglect, which prevents us at this point in the investigation from opening the records or giving out any detailed information about our involvement with the family,"" DCF said in a statement Thursday. \n \n Police and child welfare officials have not identified the mother, citing privacy concerns. \n \n ""We continue to work with law enforcement as the investigation moves forward into the circumstances surrounding the poisoning,"" the DCF statement said. ""The death of little Michael is a tragedy. It reminds all of us as parents of the dangers of leaving household cleaning supplies around our little ones."" \n \n More than 5,700 children under the age of 5 were exposed to the chemicals in the concentrated packets so far this year, according to the American Association of Poison Control Centers. There were no reported deaths before 2012, the most recent records available and when the bright blue-and-red packets first came on the market. \n \n ""People are not listening to the warnings,"" said Bruce Ruck with the New Jersey Poison Center. ""Last year at about this time, there were quite a few issues relating to this,"" he said of children swallowing the single-dose packs, with many of them ending up on ventilators and in intensive care units. \n \n Hundreds of children across the U.S. have required hospitalization for ingesting the chemicals in the packets _ suffering loss of consciousness, excessive vomiting, drowsiness, throat swelling, and difficulty breathing. \n \n The Procter & Gamble Co., makers of the orange-and-purple Tide Pods, has a Safe Home campaign to help ""educate consumers on the correct use and storage of household cleaning and fabric care products."" The company also rolled out redesigned packaging this year, including an opaque container and double-latch lid that is child-resistant. \n \n ""We are seeing more consistent warning labels and some companies move to opaque packaging,"" said Scott Wolfson, spokesman for the Consumer Product Safety Commission which ""has been working on this issue for quite some time."" Commission Chairman Inez Moore Tenenbaum has called on the industry to take steps to make the packets safer _ and less appealing to children _ and to develop a comprehensive safety standard.']",2,"– Lottery officials in Florida pulled a photo of the latest jackpot winner from their website after learning that he is a convicted sex offender. Timothy Poole, 43, served time in prison after being accused of sexually battering a 9-year-old boy in 2001 and has been arrested more than 10 other times for offenses including grand theft and forgery, reports the Orlando Sentinel. He won $3 million on a Super Millions scratch-off ticket and took home a lump sum payment of $2,219,807 this week. ""We chose to not draw additional attention to this particular winner"" after learning of his past, a lottery spokeswoman says. Poole—who now works as a driver for a taxi firm his mother owns—served 13 months on a plea deal for the 2001 offense and was later sent back to jail for three years after failing to attend mandatory sex offender counseling sessions. He was required to register as a sexual predator but continues to maintain his innocence and has had no legal problems since his release from prison in 2006, reports WKMG, which notes that Florida doesn't allow the lottery to withhold payments from winners based on their criminal records. (In Alaska a few years ago, a convicted sex offender won a lottery that benefited sex-assault victims and suffered a severe beating in the street a few days later.)"

138,"['Story highlights The CIA officially acknowledges Area 51, long a fixation for conspiracy theorists, in documents \n \n The area, 125 northwest of Las Vegas, was a testing ground for Cold War aerial surveillance \n \n Document release could be just the beginning of Area 51 information, expert says \n \n Area 51 has long been a topic of fascination for conspiracy theorists and paranormal enthusiasts, but newly released CIA documents officially acknowledge the site and suggest that the area served a far less remarkable purpose than many had supposed. \n \n According to these reports, which include a map of the base\'s location in Nevada, Area 51 was merely a testing site for the government\'s U-2 and OXCART aerial surveillance programs. The U-2 program conducted surveillance around the world, including over the Soviet Union during the Cold War. \n \n Area 51, about 125 miles northwest of Las Vegas, is synonymous in popular culture with government secrecy, and many have theorized that it holds the answer to one of the greatest questions plaguing mankind: Are we really alone in the universe? \n \n But the newly released documents make no mention of alien autopsy rooms or spaceship parking lots. \n \n This information will be disappointing to some, who have come to view the area as a mecca of sorts for alien encounters. \n \n For these true believers, the existence of alien spacecraft at Area 51, and the government\'s attempts to cover up their trace, is irrefutable and has been since reports of Unidentified Flying Objects -- or UFOs -- began to emerge from the Nevada desert in the middle part of the 20th century. \n \n The map and other documents were released in response to a Freedom of Information Act request submitted by Jeffrey T. Richelson, a senior fellow at the National Security Archives, in 2005. \n \n The map and other documents were released in response to a Freedom of Information Act request submitted by Jeffrey T. Richelson, a senior fellow at the National Security Archives. \n \n Richelson submitted the request as part of his continuing study of aerial surveillance programs and told CNN that he was not given an explanation of why the new documents were less redacted than previous versions declassified by the agency. \n \n JUST WATCHED Area 51 Revealed Replay More Videos ...

Its location appears in books on aerial surveillance and is widely referenced in popular culture. \n \n In fact, the map that was released in the CIA documents mirrors the one that appears after a simple Google Maps search for ""Area 51."" \n \n Area 51 has also been referenced in government documents in the past, though this newest release is the first that acknowledges its existence and location in a purposeful way. \n \n Richelson told CNN he believes this could signal a dramatic change in the government\'s willingness to declassify information about the famed base, meaning even more information could come out about Area 51 in the future. \n \n The release of these reports seem to put the theories about aliens and flying saucers to rest for the time being, although they may not be enough to silence the true believers. \n \n At least they still have Roswell, right?', 'WASHINGTON — Newly declassified government documents made public Thursday are shedding some of the official mystery surrounding Nevada’s role in developing spy planes of the Cold War. \n \n A history of the U-2 reconnaissance program written by CIA officials in 1992 and released this summer to a national security institute contains official acknowledgement and several mentions of Area 51, the remote desert base 90 miles north of Las Vegas that the government once denied even existed. \n \n It includes the story of when CIA project director Richard Bissell and Air Force officer Col. Osmund Ritland in April 1955 first flew over an old airstrip by the salt flat named Groom Lake. The Beechcraft plane was piloted by Tony LeVier, Lockheed’s chief test pilot. \n \n On closer inspection they agreed it “would make an ideal site for testing the U-2 and training its pilots,” according to the history. The lightweight aircraft was being built by Lockheed at its highly secure “Skunk Works” plant in Burbank, Calif. \n \n Allen Dulles, the director of Central Intelligence, and Adm. Lewis Strauss, the chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, got President Dwight Eisnenhower to sign off on adding the strip, “known by its map designation as Area 51,” to what was then called the Nevada Test Site. \n \n “To make the facility in the middle of nowhere sound more attractive to his workers, (Skunk Works founder) Kelly Johnson called it the Paradise Ranch, which was soon shortened to the Ranch,” according to the document. \n \n Three months later, by July 1955, “the base was ready and Agency, Air Force and Lockheed personnel began moving in.” \n \n On July 25, the first prototype was delivered, wrapped in tarpaulins, “its long slender wings and tail assembly removed.” It was flown to Groom Lake aboard a C-124, and mechanics spent six days readying the craft for its first flight on Aug. 4. \n \n Subsequent high-altitude testing of the U-2 soon led to an unexpected side effect, “a tremendous increase in reports of unidentified flying objects” that added much to Area 51 lore. \n \n That the Nevada installation was a development and staging area for the high-altitude spy plane and other aircraft that flew secret missions over the Soviet Union, China and other U.S. targets now is commonly known, having previously been revealed in several histories of the era. \n \n But up to now, mentions of the base in officially released documents were rare and “probably inadvertent,” said Jeffrey Richelson, senior fellow of the National Security Archive, a research institute that contains a major library of declassified U.S. documents. \n \n Releasing information on Area 51 now “is clearly a conscious decision to acknowledge the name, the location rather than play pretend about the secrecy,” Richelson said. \n \n The 407-page history, “The Central Intelligence Agency and Overhead Reconnaissance,” was released to Richelson in June in response to a Freedom of Information Act request he filed in 2005. A heavily redacted version was published in 1998. \n \n The history also discusses the site’s role in Oxcart, the CIA code-named program that produced the Lockheed A-12 spy plane, the nation’s first stealth aircraft. \n \n T.D. Barnes, 75, of Henderson and Roger Andersen, 83, of Las Vegas, both worked on development of the A-12 at Area 51 in the 1960s. \n \n “There’s not much really new here but they are officially confirming what has been previously speculated,” said Barnes, who worked on a radar project in Beatty that measured the velocity of the record-breaking, rocket-powered X-15 in 1964. \n \n “We would secretly track the flights for the CIA,” he said. \n \n A CIA contractor, Barnes arrived at Area 51 in 1968 as a radar expert to put the finishing touches on the A-12. He said most of the CIA’s “black operations” in Nevada used code names for the projects but not the facility. \n \n He said other unofficial names used for the facility include Dreamland, Home Base, Watertown Strip, Groom Lake and Homey Airport. \n \n “The U-2 guys called it Watertown because that was the hometown of the CIA director at the time,” Barnes said, referring to Dulles. \n \n Barnes said Area 51 is part of the Nellis Air Force range operations area. The restricted airspace around it is known by military pilots as “the box” or “the container.” \n \n Andersen, an Air Force captain recruited by the CIA, said the stories behind Area 51 “generally were known by those of us who worked there but not to the rest of the world.” \n \n While the CIA had been protective of Area 51 information for so long, Andersen said he sensed a shift within the past five to seven years. As a result, he and former Area 51 personnel were invited to a CIA “family day” at headquarters in Langley, Va. \n \n Richelson, the National Security Archive senior fellow, said he had no idea why the CIA decided to open up on Area 51 at this time. Researchers hope it is a sign the agency might be forthcoming about details of other once-secret Nevada programs, such as development of the F-117 Stealth jet and the use of captured Soviet MiGs to train U.S. pilots in air-to-air combat.']",2,"– It's a milestone of sorts for conspiracy theorists: The CIA has for the first time declassified documents that detail the existence of Area 51 in Nevada, reports the Las Vegas Review-Journal. The documents, obtained in a Freedom of Information Act request by a national security institute at George Washington University, explain that Area 51 got its start in 1955 because the government needed a place to test U-2 spy planes. Aliens in crashed spaceships are nowhere to be found in the documents. But here's one weird detail that is: The government initially called it ""Paradise Ranch"" to make the ""facility in the middle of nowhere"" sound more alluring to workers. The documents include a CIA map of the site, which is pretty much the same one that has long been available in a Google Maps search for ""Area 51,"" notes CNN. So what's the big deal here? It's ""clearly a conscious decision to acknowledge the name, the location rather than play pretend about the secrecy,” says the researcher who filed the FOIA request, Jeffrey Richelson. It should pave the way for the release of even more information about the site, he adds. You can dig into the 400 pages of documents here."
139,"['It’s a cold snap life for penguins up in Alberta, Canada. \n \n Not only did the Calgary Zoo have to cancel its Zoo Lights holiday event on Dec. 30 and Dec. 31 due to frigid temperatures, but the staff also decided to bring its penguin flock inside rather than subject the Antarctic and Sub-Antarctic birds to the -28 C (feels like -40 C with the wind chill!) weather. The zoo follows a guideline whereby zookeepers bring the birds inside when the temp falls below -25 C. \n \n According to CTVNews, the zoo has 51 members in its flock, which represents a variety of species. In the wild, king penguins often dwell in sub-Antarctic regions, but they are more accustomed to milder climates than their Antarctic cousins, the emperor penguins. \n \n “We just don’t want to expose them to too much,” Malu Celli, the zoo’s curator, told CTVNews on Sunday. “To keep them safe, we decided to pick a limit to let them out.” \n \n Celli went on to say that “It’s not necessarily that it’s too cold for them … I believe that physiologically, they can withstand colder weather than what we have here, but these are not wild birds.” \n \n In fact, the king penguins have a chick among the flock (see “Cleopatra,” below) who is still maturing, so the zookeepers decided to err on the side of safety. \n \n All species of penguins have a layer of insulating fat, as well as down feathers that help them keep warm. Plus, the tuxedoed birds tend to huddle together to create warmth while conserving heat by keeping their flippers close at their sides. That said, the Calgary Zoo’s penguins, who hail from several regions of the world, would probably be more than happy to waddle around in the frigid cold open air. \n \n “It’s kind of like you can bundle up your kid, but then there’s a point you’re going to say, ‘I know you’re good, but I’d rather you stay inside now,’ ” Celli told CTVNews. \n \n (Below, see the penguins roaming outside during the summer months at the zoo.) \n \n Luckily, there’s good news for the fresh air-loving members of the Calgary Zoo penguin flock in 2018: A media representative at the zoo tells PEOPLE that although “the king penguins moved indoors when the temps plummeted … the weather has since become much milder … so this is no longer an issue.” \n \n The recent frigid weather also resulted in cancellations of New Year polar bear dips and plunges throughout Canada.', 'DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi authorities fired a senior education official and other supervisors after a school textbook was found that included a photo-shopped image of the late King Faisal seated next to “Star Wars” movie character Yoda, Saudi media reported on Tuesday. \n \n The dismissal was also prompted by other errors in various textbooks, including history, chemistry, English language and religious education. \n \n The Education Ministry recalled textbooks with a cover photo showing Yoda seated next to King Faisal as he signed the United Nations Charter in 1945, Saudi media said. \n \n The Arabic-language Okaz daily said the education minister ended the contract of the undersecretary of the Curriculum and Educational Programs Department, Mohammed bin Attiyah al-Harthi, as well as all officials in charge of reviewing and approving the textbooks. \n \n The online newspaper sabq.org and al-Madinah Arabic daily carried similar reports on their websites. \n \n The reports appeared after Harthi rejected charges that a social science textbook contained errors.

Although he has not been apprehended, the Strasbourg-born gunman was known to authorities before the shooting, which French officials have said is “probably” terrorism-related. \n \n Trump met Tuesday with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi over his $5 billion request for funding to build the border wall, a sit-down that quickly deteriorated into a partisan brawl on live television, culminating with Trump’s declaration that he would be “proud” to force a partial government shutdown if his demands were not met. \n \n Playbook PM Sign up for our must-read newsletter on what's driving the afternoon in Washington.

Trump has upped his request to $5 billion for his long-promised wall and is not backing down, boasting Tuesday that “I don’t mind owning that issue.” \n \n Though the legislative and executive branches of the government are under Republican control, any spending bill will need 60 votes in the Senate, meaning some Democratic support is required. \n \n Schumer and Pelosi said Tuesday they had pitched the president either a yearlong stopgap for the Department of Homeland Security, freezing its funding at current levels, or a yearlong continuing resolution for the remaining spending bills Congress has yet to consider. Either option would deny Trump a proposed $300 million boost for border security but would keep the government open as negotiations continued. \n \n Trump also sought to tie his demands for border security to the Obama administration’s Iran nuclear deal, a pact his administration withdrew from earlier this year, falsely claiming in another tweet that “the Democrats and President Obama gave Iran 150 Billion Dollars and got nothing, but they can’t give 5 Billion Dollars for National Security and a Wall?” \n \n The president appears to refer to dubious claims by opponents of the deal that lifting sanctions on Iran in exchange for curbing its nuclear weapons programs freed up $150 billion in frozen assets for the country, a far cry from the $56 billion estimated by then-Treasury Secretary Jack Lew and the $25 billion to $50 billion estimated by some experts. That money is in a separate category because it never belonged to U.S. taxpayers, unlike border wall funding appropriated by Congress."", 'Tweet with a location \n \n You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

Trump took to Twitter to continue his push for border-wall funding, this time trying to bolster his argument by citing a mass shooting Tuesday at a Christmas market in Strasbourg, France. Politico notes the attack was located near the France-Germany border. Trump tweeted, ""Another very bad terror attack in France. We are going to strengthen our borders even more. Chuck and Nancy must give us the votes to get additional Border Security!"" Then, in a second tweet, ""The Democrats and President Obama gave Iran 150 Billion Dollars and got nothing, but they can’t give 5 Billion Dollars for National Security and a Wall?"" Senators are currently willing to approve $1.6 billion in funding for border security, though that money couldn't be put toward wall construction. As for Trump's $150 billion figure, it's a reference to the amount of frozen assets Iran got access to when sanctions were lifted as part of the nuclear deal; Politico reports then-Treasury Secretary Jack Lew calculated a lower impact of $56 billion.

It was filed on behalf of four unnamed plaintiffs by lawyers Roberta Kaplan and Andrew Celli, both donors to Democrat Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign, and is being funded by Tesseract Research Center, a progressive group led by Morris Pearl, a former managing director of investment giant BlackRock. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n “This case is about four working-class Americans, and thousands more just like them, who were deliberately defrauded by Donald J.

""The Message was materially false. The Investments did not — and could not — offer a reasonable probability of success,"" the lawsuit states. \n \n In one example, between 2005 and at least 2015, Trump claimed that an investment in a multi-level-marketing company called American Communications Network, or ACN, was “without any of the risks most entrepreneurs have to take” and that its flagship product was doing $500 million in annual sales, even though those claims were false, the lawsuit states. \n \n At the same time Trump was endorsing ACN, he also secretly received “millions of dollars in secret payments” from the company in the form of speaking fees and appearances, according to the complaint. Trump featured prominently in the company’s magazine and blog and attended at least 14 events in the U.S. and overseas, the lawsuit states. \n \n “Trump spent years cultivating a brand for himself based on the impression that he was a successful entrepreneur,” the suit claims. “Defendants conducted the affairs of their enterprise as a fraudulent scheme to leverage that brand, and use a series of false and misleading statements and omissions, to ensnare vulnerable consumers.” \n \n Plaintiffs include the pseudonymous Jane Doe, a hospice caregiver from California who the lawsuit says invested in ACN after seeing clips of Trump praising the company on his reality television show. The complaint says she paid $499 to register with ACN and spent thousands of dollars to attend events and motivational rallies, but she earned a total of $38 after two years. \n \n The other three plaintiffs saw no return from their investments, according to the complaint. \n \n Trump and his companies have been accused of fraud in the past. In November 2016, he agreed to pay $25 million to settle lawsuits against Trump University. \n \n The new case, Jane Doe v.

In a press release, plaintiffs' lawyers say California State Polytechnic University put both Fitbits and ECG sensors on 43 separate subjects tested for 65 minutes of moderate to high-intensity exercise, and found that the PurePulse technology in the Fitbits had an ""extremely weak correlation"" with the heart rate recorded by the ECGs. The researchers say the Fitbit measurement was up to 20 beats per minute off during exercise.

That compares with a loss of $110.8 million, or $1.05 a share, in the same period last year. \n \n “Headlines of fire are never good from a marketing perspective,” Levy said. \n \n He noted that all three incidents were triggered by accidents rather than an internal issue with the vehicles. Levy said that once an automaker starts to have thousands of cars on the road – Tesla has sold almost 17,000 cars in the U.S. this year – fires and other incidents are bound to happen. \n \n Levy still believes that Tesla is an innovative automaker that is carving out a strong brand and that it makes sense to value the company more like a technology company and growth story rather than a mature automaker. \n \n “But if there are more fires the stock won’t be so hot,” Levy said. \n \n Follow me on Twitter (@LATimesJerry), Facebook and Google+. \n \n ALSO: \n \n Consumer Reports cuts Camry from picks list \n \n White is the new white.

The suit says the vehicle “suffered from material defects which caused the battery pack to ignite and erupt in flames under certain driving conditions.” It seeks to cover anyone who bought stock from May 10 through Wednesday. In that span, Tesla stock went from $77 to a peak of $193 in September to its close of $138 on Friday.

147,"['A berm holding the flooded Missouri River back from a Nebraska nuclear power station collapsed early Sunday, but federal regulators said they were monitoring the situation and there was no danger. \n \n The Fort Calhoun Nuclear Station shut down in early April for refueling, and there is no water inside the plant, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission said. Also, the river is not expected to rise higher than the level the plant was designed to handle. NRC spokesman Victor Dricks said the plant remains safe. \n \n The federal commission had inspectors at the plant 20 miles (32 kilometers) north of Omaha when the 2,000-foot (610-meter) berm collapsed about 1:30 a.m. Sunday. Water surrounded the auxiliary and containment buildings at the plant, it said in a statement. \n \n The Omaha Public Power District has said the complex will not be reactivated until the flooding subsides. Its spokesman, Jeff Hanson, said the berm wasn\'t critical to protecting the plant but a crew will look at whether it can be patched. \n \n ""That was an additional layer of protection we put in,"" Hanson said. \n \n The berm\'s collapse didn\'t affect the reactor shutdown cooling or the spent fuel pool cooling, but the power supply was cut after water surrounded the main electrical transformers, the NRC said. Emergency generators powered the plant until an off-site power supply was connected Sunday afternoon, according to OPPD. \n \n NRC Chairman Gregory Jaczko said the loss of the berm at Fort Calhoun nuclear plant doesn\'t threaten the safety of the plant. \n \n ""There are other structures and systems in place that can ensure they will continue operating safely,"" Jaczko said. \n \n Jaczko will tour the Fort Calhoun plant Monday. His visit was scheduled last week. On Sunday, he toured Nebraska\'s other nuclear power plant, which sits along the Missouri River near Brownville. Cooper nuclear power plant is about 75 miles (120 kilometers) south of Omaha and run by the Nebraska Public Power District. \n \n Jaczko said he can\'t predict what the river will do this summer but that NPPD and OPPD seem to be taking appropriate steps to defend against flooding. \n \n Jaczko spent much of his tour of Cooper asking NPPD officials and the NRC\'s local inspectors questions about the plant and this year\'s flooding. He said his visit was designed to gather information. \n \n NPPD officials have been monitoring river levels closely during the flooding, and they have already brought in more than 5,000 tons of sand to build barricades protecting the Cooper plant, the onsite power substations and the plant\'s access roads. \n \n Accessing critical parts of the plant requires visitors to use ladders or steel stairs to climb over sandbag barriers both outside and inside the doors. When the Jaczko saw one of Cooper\'s two back-up diesel generators, he had to climb over three different sandbag barriers to get there. \n \n The Cooper plant remains dry because it sits at an elevation above the river level. The base of Cooper and its storage area for used nuclear fuel is 903 feet (275.23 meters) above sea level while on Sunday the river was just above 899 feet. \n \n Cooper would be shut down if the river rose to 902 feet (274.93 meters) above sea level, but officials say that is unlikely. \n \n ""This plant is designed to deal with a flood much higher than we are seeing _ 906 feet,"" Jaczko said. \n \n Both nuclear plants issued flooding alerts earlier this month, although they were routine as the river\'s rise has been expected. Cooper has been operating at full capacity. \n \n Flooding remains a concern all along the Missouri because of massive amounts of water the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has released from upstream reservoirs. The river is expected to rise as much as 7 feet (2 meters) above flood stage in much of Nebraska and Iowa and as much as 10 feet (3 meters) over flood stage in parts of Missouri. \n \n The corps expects the river to remain high at least into August because of heavy spring rains in the upper Plains and substantial Rocky Mountain snowpack melting into the river basin. \n \n ___ \n \n Josh Funk Associated Press Writer Timberly Ross contributed to this report from Omaha and can be reached at http://twitter.com/timberlysross.', 'The head of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has been dispatched to a nuclear power plant in Fort Calhoun, Neb., where a berm collapsed Sunday, but the public is in no danger, officials said. \n \n The breach allowed Missouri River flood waters to reach containment buildings and transformers and forcing the shutdown of electrical power. \n \n Backup generators are cooling the nuclear material at the Fort Calhoun Nuclear Station. \n \n The plant has not operated since April, and officials say there is no danger to the public. \n \n Jeff Hanson, a spokesman for the Omaha Public Power District, told The Associated Press that the breached berm wasn\'t critical to protecting the plant, although a crew will look at whether it can be patched. \n \n ""That was an additional layer of protection we put in,"" Hanson said. \n \n Nevertheless, federal inspectors are on the scene. \n \n Meanwhile, there was no protecting thousands of homes in Minot, N.D., where flooding of the Souris River hit its peak today, flooding more than 4,000 homes, including Leslie Dull\'s. \n \n ""When you actually see your house,"" Dull said, ""and you know it\'s not just your basement, it\'s your whole house, it\'s ... \n \n ""I\'m sorry,"" she said, as she broke down crying. \n \n There is some good news: The river in Minot peaked two feet lower than expected.

149,"['Stephen A. Smith explains why it makes sense for Cowboys owner Jerry Jones to be in favor of the NFL dropping the ban on marijuana. (1:55) \n \n Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones and some other NFL owners want to change the way the league punishes players for marijuana. So do the players. But if the talk is about doing away with marijuana testing completely, it may surprise you to learn that the players\' position is ""not so fast."" \n \n Yes, the players would like to change the league\'s policy on marijuana, but they don\'t want to do away with it entirely, because they think the policy can be helpful to them if done the right way. \n \n Jones and his fellow owners see this as a valuable potential bargaining chip in the next collective bargaining agreement negotiations, which could be coming sooner than you think. \n \n The location of the common ground these two sides end up finding could have a major impact on the health of the game and its players. And the process of finding that common ground could begin within the next few weeks. But before we can predict what may or may not happen, it\'s important to examine the motivations of the people on both sides of the issue. \n \n What the owners want \n \n The league -- defined here as Jones and his 31 fellow team owners -- has made it clear that it wants to extend the current CBA, which runs through 2020. Sources on both sides expect the league to approach the National Football League Players Association within the coming weeks about opening collective bargaining talks aimed at such an extension. \n \n From Jones\' perspective, the marijuana issue has two key prongs: He doesn\'t want to lose his players for long stretches at a time because of drug suspensions, and he views marijuana as an issue around which the players would be willing to negotiate. Surely, Jones\' fellow owners share the former sentiment and the latter hope. \n \n What the players want \n \n According to sources, this topic was discussed extensively at the NFLPA\'s rep meeting in Arizona last month, and union leaders prepared a proposal for a revised marijuana policy and submitted it to the player reps for review. At this time, the player reps and their teammates are reviewing the policy before submitting it to the league for discussion. \n \n Sources with knowledge of what was discussed at the rep meeting say the players\' new proposal is focused on counseling, treatment and pain management. The players don\'t necessarily want to do away with marijuana testing; they just want to reduce or eliminate the punitive aspect of the testing process. \n \n Under the union\'s plan, the purpose of a marijuana testing program would be to identify players in need of help. Their position is that it\'s easy to tell the difference, based on the number of nanograms per milliliter (ng/ml) that show up in a test, whether the player is using the drug for recreational use or using it excessively. \n \n Jerry Jones and his fellow NFL owners see the marijuana policy as a valuable potential bargaining chip in the next CBA negotiations. Ross D. Franklin/AP Photo \n \n Right now, the NFL standard for a positive marijuana test is 35 ng/ml, which is higher than the 15 it was before the drug policy was renegotiated three years ago but still lower than Major League Baseball\'s 50 and far lower than the Olympics\' 150. So a player could test positive at 35 ng/ml and still get the same level of punishment as one who tests positive at 100 ng/ml. \n \n The union\'s position is that those cases need to be handled differently in substantive ways. For example: Should someone test positive above 100 ng/ml, that could be a red flag for an addiction situation or a player who\'s dealing with some sort of chronic pain that he hasn\'t previously reported. In a case like that, testing could lead the team and/or league to provide some sort of treatment for the addiction or the pain. \n \n The important takeaway here is that NFL players don\'t necessarily want the league to stop testing them for marijuana. The union\'s proposal basically says, ""Let\'s still test for it, but let\'s do it in a constructive and less punitive way."" \n \n So, what happens now? \n \n There are a lot of hurdles yet to be cleared. The drug still isn\'t legal in every state, and it\'s against the law to transport it across state lines. The NFL itself doesn\'t have a defined position on this, and when asked about it, commissioner Roger Goodell usually says something about deferring to medical experts. \n \n As mentioned earlier, players are currently reviewing the proposal that union leadership drafted last month. The union will not submit the proposal to the league until it\'s been vetted by its membership. Depending on the timing of that submission, the marijuana discussion could be its own separate thing or part of a larger CBA negotiation. \n \n Regardless, it\'s highly unlikely the union will agree to a relaxation of the marijuana policy in exchange for some financial-based CBA concession like stadium credits. Union officials have made it clear for months that they have no interest in granting financial concessions in exchange for nonfinancial ones in any upcoming CBA talks. So if the only reason owners want to talk marijuana is because they think it\'s important enough to the players to give back some money, they may not find that door wide open to them. \n \n What\'s clear is that this is an issue that\'s not leaving the spotlight anytime soon. But it\'s not an issue that breaks down along lines as simple as you -- or even Jerry Jones -- might expect.', 'Death rates for female pigs in the US are rising fast, sending alarm bells ringing throughout the farming industry. \n \n The mortality rate rose from 5.8% to 10.2% on farms owning more than 125 sows between 2013-2016, according to one organisation that collects data across 800 companies. \n \n The numbers have been linked to a troubling rise in prolapse – the collapse of the animal’s rectum, vagina, or uterus. In some cases the prolapse itself is fatal. In others the pig is euthanised as a result. Some farms have seen no rise, or much smaller rises, but a separate report last year found that some farms were seeing prolapse causing as many as 25%-50% of sow deaths. \n \n The American Association of Swine Veterinarians has created a sow prolapse working group, but their findings so far have been inconclusive. In April, the National Pork Board announced a multi-year research collaboration with Iowa State University’s Iowa Pork Industry Center designed to get a broad overview of the problem. Iowa is the nation’s top pork producer. The study, which is still under way, aims to collect detailed data from 400,000 sows – or about 13% of the nation’s 3 million working sows – on more than 100 farms across 16 states. \n \n A number of possible causes have been suggested, including vitamin deficiency, mycotoxins in the feed, high density diets or abdominal issues. Some experts blame confinement systems in intensive farming – sows will spend a large percentage of their lives in gestation and farrowing crates that don’t allow them to move around. Modern breeding practices have also been suggested as a causal factor. \n \n Industry figures largely declined to comment but some acknowledged that they are grappling with the issue. “It’s a topic in our meetings, both in the hallways and the meeting spaces,” said Dr Tom Burkgren, executive director of American Association of Swine Veterinarians, a group that educates vets around the country. \n \n A brutal business: alleged beatings and abuse on UK pig farms | Harriet Grant Read more \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest After piglets are born, the sows are kept in farrowing crates where the young can feed. Photograph: Jo-Anne McArthur/We Animals \n \n An estimated 97% of the US’s 73 million hogs are raised in closed barns or confined feeding operations. In these systems sows often live the majority of their lives in gestation or farrowing crates that don’t allow them to get up or turn around. In this system the average sow produces 23.5 piglets per year – or ten per litter at a rate of 2.35 litters annually. After two to four litters, most sows tend to be replaced by younger gilts who can produce piglets at a higher rate. \n \n Mary Temple Grandin – professor of animal science at Colorado State University and consultant on the design of livestock-handling facilities – told the Guardian that highly focused breeding across the industry has led to unintended consequences. She said that one side effect of selecting for animals that are more fecund is an increased tendency toward lameness. \n \n In the late 1980s, Grandin added, pigs were bred with three traits in mind: rapid weight gain, thin back fat, and a big loin. Now, she added, “They’re breeding the sows to produce a lot of babies. Well, there’s a point where you’ve gone too far.” \n \n “We’ve bred a contradiction into these animals,” says Leah Garces, outgoing executive director of the US branch of Compassion in World Farming. “Over the last few decades, sows to have been bred to have less back-fat – because people don’t want to eat as much fat – but we also want them to produce more and more babies. And that’s not biologically possible; their bones are weak and they don’t have enough fat to support the reproductive process. We’ve bred them to their limit and the animals are telling us that.” \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest Pigs at a Niman Ranch farm in the US, a network that focuses on sustainable agriculture. Photograph: Courtesy Niman Ranch \n \n Alternatives \n \n The high incidence of animal loss in confinement systems is one of the main reasons that Paul Willis, co-founder of Niman Ranch (now a subsidiary of Perdue Farms) spent years building an alternative to modern hog farming. “I have a neighbour that has been raising pigs [in a confinement system] … and they have a dumpster, and I can go by there almost any time of the day or week and it’s full of dead hogs,” said Willis. \n \n When he was raising hogs at a smaller scale, perhaps 200 to 300 at a time, and allowing them to spend time outside, engaging in behaviours that are typical for hogs, such as wallowing and building nests out of straw, Willis said he’d lose just “a few animals a year”. Under this system, pigs only produce about half as many offspring a year as they do in industrial systems. \n \n The key in most livestock production is finding a balance between productivity and the health of the animals, said Grandin. “You have to figure out the optimal number of piglets these sows should have. One thing people have trouble with is asking what is optimal – not maximal, but optimal – when it comes to breeding.” \n \n For those pursuing a maximal approach, there are new products like the Hercules Arm, a $7,000 (£5,330) piece of machinery that went on the market in 2017. It is marketed as “a unique and revolutionary way to effortlessly remove … heavy dead pigs from stalls”. \n \n Contact us with your stories and thoughts at animalsfarmed@theguardian.com']",2,"– With European countries fuming over NSA surveillance, the White House is reconsidering its spying activities.

In this study, we found that, upon amputation, the moon jellyfish Aurelia aurita rearranges existing body parts and recovers radial symmetry within a few days. This unique strategy of self-repair, which we call symmetrization, requires mechanical forces generated by the muscle-based propulsion machinery. We observed a similar strategy in a number of other jellyfish species. This finding may contribute to understanding the evolutionary pressures governing biological self-repair strategies. Beyond biology, this finding may inspire a mechanically driven, self-organizing machinery that recovers essential geometry without regenerating precise forms. \n \n Abstract \n \n What happens when an animal is injured and loses important structures? Some animals simply heal the wound, whereas others are able to regenerate lost parts. In this study, we report a previously unidentified strategy of self-repair, where moon jellyfish respond to injuries by reorganizing existing parts, and rebuilding essential body symmetry, without regenerating what is lost. Specifically, in response to arm amputation, the young jellyfish of Aurelia aurita rearrange their remaining arms, recenter their manubria, and rebuild their muscular networks, all completed within 12 hours to 4 days. We call this process symmetrization. We find that symmetrization is not driven by external cues, cell proliferation, cell death, and proceeded even when foreign arms were grafted on. Instead, we find that forces generated by the muscular network are essential. Inhibiting pulsation using muscle relaxants completely, and reversibly, blocked symmetrization. Furthermore, we observed that decreasing pulse frequency using muscle relaxants slowed symmetrization, whereas increasing pulse frequency by lowering the magnesium concentration in seawater accelerated symmetrization. A mathematical model that describes the compressive forces from the muscle contraction, within the context of the elastic response from the mesoglea and the ephyra geometry, can recapitulate the recovery of global symmetry. Thus, self-repair in Aurelia proceeds through the reorganization of existing parts, and is driven by forces generated by its own propulsion machinery. We find evidence for symmetrization across species of jellyfish (Chrysaora pacifica, Mastigias sp., and Cotylorhiza tuberculata).']",3,"– Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy is standing by his widely condemned remarks on slavery even as most of his conservative allies hastily back away from him.

""We work every day to insure that the cases we bring are appropriately brought and that\'s all I can answer is for what we do now."" \n \n The couple was convicted in 1992 of sexually assaulting a 3-year-old after children at the day care the Kellers operated out of their Austin home told investigators of dismembered babies, tortured pets and other fantastic tales. They were each sentenced to 48 years in prison. \n \n The Kellers were freed in 2013 after the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals found a doctor was mistaken in determining there was physical evidence of assault. The appeals court ruled deemed the doctor\'s testimony to be false, and the doctor himself also recanted it. \n \n Further bolstering the Kellers\' case was an interview the alleged victim provided in 2013 in which she acknowledged having no memory of being abused, Moore said in June. \n \n The determination of outright innocence made Dan Keller, 75, and Fran Keller, 67, each eligible for $80,000 in compensation for every year they were wrongfully imprisoned.

In the couple’s case, they were in prison for 23 years, which means each person will receive approximately $1.84 million for their time served. The Tim Cole Act states half of the money will be paid as a lump sum and the other half will be paid out over their lifetime as an annuity. \n \n “They are now compensated and no longer must fear homelessness or lack of health insurance,” said Hampton in an email. “They are buying a home and can live out their lives in peace and quiet.

Due to misaligned immigration policies during a time of economic acceleration and the lack of those that are willing and able to work, firms are about to enter a period of rapid integration of technology as a substitute for labor to avoid growing bottlenecks in production and the provision of services. In a rational world, this would be a major inflection point stimulating profound public debate, Congressional hearings and a Presidential commission to map out possible policy paths in an age of Artificial Intelligence. Instead all we get is an already tired juvenile discussion around who gets political credit for the secular improvement in job creation and the economy.""']",4,"– If you want to get people to stop boozing it up, don't show them images of glasses of healthy, sparkling water instead of beer—show them an ad that illustrates how too many cocktails can cause cancer to course through their bodies, the Guardian reports. That's the finding of a new study published in the BMJ Open journal that examined English-language alcohol ads to identify which ones proved best at inspiring drinkers to cut down. Researchers tapped a pool of 2,174 Australian adults ages 18 to 64 who drink alcohol at least one or two days a week. A total of 83 ads were shown, and the subjects were instructed to note after viewing each one how motivated they were to reduce their drinking on a scale from one to five, with ""one"" counting as an unmotivated ""Nah, I'm good,"" and ""five"" as ""Take the key to my liquor cabinet and bury it, please."" The most effective ad: ""Spread,"" a 30-second video created by the Western Australian government a few years ago that shows the cancerous mutations wrought after alcohol gets into one's bloodstream. The dud: that ad pushing water over beer. Cancer Council Victoria CEO Todd Harper tells the Guardian that ""Spread"" may have made an impact because folks simply don't know alcohol is a Group 1 carcinogen, the most dangerous category. Even though Fergus Taylor, the director of Alcohol Beverages Australia, calls the ""Spread"" ad ""scaremongering,"" Harper notes ""every drink"" ups one's chance of getting cancer, including that of the mouth, liver, and bowel. What these findings should do is spur campaigns that maximize the public's awareness of alcohol so they can cut their cancer risk, Harper says, per Mumbrella.

He remembers the drink he bought her—a cup of tea—and her name, Linh Hoa. He also remembers some of the last words she spoke to him before he shipped out in 1970 at age 21: ""She told me she was pregnant,"" he tells the Washington Post. Reischl, now 67, had been warned by his Air Force superiors that it could be a trap to get him to take the sex worker back to America with him, and he never found out if it was just a line, though he's returned to Vietnam four times searching for an answer. Now in his golden years, he's one of several vets hoping to reunite with the women—and perhaps the children—they left behind in Vietnam, sometimes after lengthy relationships, with help from volunteer website FatherFounded.org. The website connected Reischl with a translator so he could place ads in local papers. He tried to find the apartment he shared with Linh Hoa and even underwent hypnosis in an attempt to remember the mailing address he threw away when she didn't respond to his letter. So far, he has no leads and only a faded old photograph he snapped from a cab. But ""I will never stop looking,"" Reischl says. ""I want her to tell me whether it’s true or not.

156,"['An Irish drugmaker has jacked up the price of a painkiller to nearly $3,000 a bottle. The drug is 22 times more expensive than when the company acquired it in late 2013. \n \n The sticker shock for Horizon Pharma\'s Vimovo drug is magnified by the fact that the painkiller\'s two main ingredients can be purchased separately -- for just $36. \n \n Although patients typically pay just a fraction of the price for Vimovo, the dramatic price increase underlines what critics describe as a murky and wasteful system that ultimately leads to higher health care costs for all Americans. \n \n A spokesman for Dublin-based Horizon said that the $2,979 wholesale price does not reflect ""the cost to patients or the cost to the system."" The company said it has programs to ensure that commercially-insured patients have access ""at an affordable price"" -- even if the patient\'s insurance refuses to cover the cost. Horizon estimates that 98% of all insured Vimovo patients pay $10 or less out of pocket. \n \n The drug industry has come under increasing pressure from a series of scandals in recent years, including extreme price hikes on an AIDS drug by ""pharma bro"" Martin Shkreli and on lifesaving allergy treatment EpiPen by Mylan (MYL). \n \n President Trump has repeatedly vowed to bring drug prices down. Just last month, Trump promised in during his State of the Union Address that his administration will work to fix the ""injustice of high drug prices."" \n \n The day after Trump\'s speech, Horizon (HZNP) raised the average wholesale price on Vimovo by 9.9% to $2,979 per bottle. Horizon confirmed to CNNMoney the price increase, which was first reported by The Financial Times. \n \n It\'s the latest in a series of about a dozen price hikes for Vimovo, which was listed at just $138 per 60-pill bottle in November 2013. That\'s when Horizon acquired the drug from AstraZeneca (AZN) and began raising prices. Today, the painkiller accounts for just over 10% of Horizon\'s annual sales, providing cash the company uses to develop treatments for rare diseases. \n \n Related: How Trump plans to cut prescription drug prices \n \n Vimovo is especially controversial because it was created by combining naproxen, which is sold under the brand name Aleve, and esomeprazole, a medicine that lowers the risk of stomach problems caused by pain relievers. Those ingredients can be purchased by patients very cheaply separately. \n \n However, Horizon said that Vimovo is a special formulation that\'s not the same as simply combining the two main ingredients. \n \n A Horizon spokesman noted there are no FDA-approved generic, over-the-counter or clinically ""equivalent"" medicines to Vimovo. \n \n Still, Horizon warned investors in an SEC filing in November that the ""higher cost"" of Vimovo compared with generic or branded forms of their active ingredients ""may limit adoption by physicians, patients and healthcare payers."" The company said ""we have faced challenges due to pharmacists increasingly switching a patient\'s intended prescription"" from Vimovo to a generic or over-the-counter brand of its active ingredient. \n \n The sticker shock led at least two large pharmacy benefit managers, which negotiate with drug makers on behalf of employers and health insurers, to balk. Express Scripts (ESRX) and CVS Caremark put Vimovo on their exclusion lists until last year. \n \n To counter the pricing concerns, Horizon has entered into rebate agreements with pharmacy benefit managers that lower the cost. \n \n An Express Scripts spokeswoman said that Vimovo is currently on its non-preferred list. ""This simply means it is not excluded from coverage, but also is not preferred,"" she said. \n \n CVS Caremark (CVS) did not respond to a request for comment. \n \n Related: These states want to import cheaper drugs from Canada \n \n Pricing in the pharmaceutical supply chain is notoriously-murky, despite the enormous consequences on the nation\'s bloated health care costs. \n \n Confidential rebates and side deals between drug makers, PBMs and insurers make it almost impossible to determine who is really cashing in when drug prices go up. \n \n ""There is no transparency. It\'s a big black box,"" said Annabel Samimy, an analyst at Stifel Financial who covers Horizon. \n \n Consider how Vimovo\'s net price -- the amount that Horizon makes after rebates -- has recently gone down. Horizon\'s filings indicate that Vimovo sales tumbled 54% through the first three quarters of 2017 due mostly to ""lower net pricing."" \n \n ""What you see between the gross price and net price is a big bubble -- and we don\'t know where the savings are passed on to,"" Samimy said. ""You need to understand who\'s in the middle between the manufacturers and the patient."" \n \n Samimy noted that pharmacy benefit managers and insurers are extremely profitable even as patients grapple with higher premiums and some drug makers deal with lower net pricing. \n \n ""The system in the U.S. has created warped pricing. Everyone points fingers at each other and nothing gets fixed,"" said Samimy. \n \n — Editor\'s note: The headline on this story has been updated.', 'Name: Drunk Mary Poppins. \n \n Age: The east wind first blew her into 17 Cherry Tree Lane in 1934. \n \n Appearance: Magical/sozzled. \n \n No!

Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever (RMSF) is a disease caused by the bacteria Rickettsia rickettsii (R. rickettsii). In Oklahoma, the tick most closely associated with RMSF is the American dog tick (Dermacentor variabilis). The other known tick vectors of R. rickettsii include the Rocky Mountain wood tick (Dermacentor andersoni), brown dog tick (Rhipicephalus sanguineus), and the cayenne tick (Amblyomma cajennense). Humans nearly always become infected with the bacteria following the bite of an infected tick. Tick bites due to the American dog tick are common in Oklahoma, but fortunately only 1–3% of the tick population is infected with R. rickettsii and capable of transmitting RMSF. \n \n At least 4–6 hours of tick attachment and feeding are usually required to pass on the infection to humans. The symptoms of RMSF usually begin 3–14 days following the infected tick bite. There is usually a sudden onset of fever, fatigue, headache, and muscle soreness. A fine, bumpy red rash often appears on the extremities about 3–5 days after the fever, which may quickly spread to the palms, soles and trunk. However, not all persons with RMSF develop a rash. Other common symptoms of RMSF include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and red eyes. \n \n Diagnosis is based upon clinical signs and symptoms, but laboratory testing can also be used to help diagnose RMSF. Blood samples taken in the early stage of illness (acute phase) and follow up samples taken 2–4 weeks later (convalescent phase) are used to confirm cases of RMSF through serologic testing. However laboratory testing can take days to weeks for results to become available, so treatment should never be delayed while awaiting laboratory confirmation. \n \n The first line treatment for all cases of RMSF is antibiotics (doxycyline). Treatment should be started immediately whenever RMSF is suspected because it can be a very serious disease; overall, 3–5% of all persons with RMSF die, but death is uncommon with prompt diagnosis and treatment. Factors associated with worse outcomes include delayed antibiotic therapy and age over 40 years.

Soon after their return, Keith tells ABC News, Jo didn't feel well and suspected the flu. But as Jo got sicker and so lethargic that Keith says ""she wasn't making any sense,"" he took her to the ER about a week after they came home—and things continued to worsen. ""She was shaking her hands because they hurt, her feet hurt,"" her cousin, Lisa Morgan, tells KOCO. Then her organs began shutting down, and ""by Saturday morning, her arms and feet were turning dark blue and black. It was crawling up her limbs,"" Morgan says. The diagnosis: a tick bite that infected Jo with Rocky Mountain spotted fever. The course of treatment: to amputate all four of her already-gangrenous limbs to give her a chance at life. ""They had to cut off her right leg just above the knee, her left leg just below the knee and both her arms about mid-forearm,"" her husband tells ABC, noting Jo has also been contending with other complications from the disease, including blood clots in her lungs that called for a tracheotomy. Up to 5% people who contract RMSF end up dying, the state Department of Health notes, but death isn't common in patients who receive rapid diagnosis and treatment. Keith Rogers doesn't know how long his wife will be in the hospital receiving treatment and rehab, he tells ABC. ""Every day is a new challenge. I go in there, sit and talk to her and show her pictures of how our two boys [ages 12 and 17, per a GoFundMe page for the family] are doing,"" he tells ABC. ""I show her videos of her two dogs back at home. I try to keep it normal, but it gets very hard because she'll want me not to leave, and it's so hard because I can't take her with me.""

I recall landing on my neck and the back of my head as well.” \n \n However Judge Heather Baucher QC threw out her civil claim and instead accused her of not taking due care, referencing her 18-stone frame and platform heels. \n \n “Mrs Hussein, at 115kg, must have taken up much of the width of the stairway. But for some inexplicable reason, she did not use the handrail,” Judge Baucher said. \n \n “In her inebriated, obese state on three-inch platforms, that would be an obvious, simple step for anyone presented with what they saw as a hazard,” she said. \n \n The 53-year-old company director had been at a birthday party with her pregnant daughter-in-law when the incident occurred in March 2012. \n \n The court heard how Mrs Hussein, who has since lost five stones, walked down the left side of the stairs, despite the banister being on the right. \n \n However Judge Baucher said that she could still have used the rail on the right, given her size at the time. \n \n Mrs Hussein denied she had been drunk, claiming she drank no more than a glass and a half of champagne and a glass of red wine. \n \n However, Ronnie Scott’s barrister Catherine Foster said medical records from her arrival at hospital described her as “obviously drunk” and “intoxicated”. \n \n Judge Baucher also visited the scene of the fall and found nothing wrong with lighting, and ruled Ronnie Scott’s was not to blame for the accident. \n \n She said: “In ordinary circumstances, she, like countless others, would have descended the staircase and gone home. \n \n “However, on that evening, whether due to one or more of the factors – painkillers, weight, shoes, drink – she simply missed her footing. \n \n “I find she did so through no fault on the part of Ronnie Scott’s.”', 'The seed for this crawl was a list of every host in the Wayback Machine \n \n This crawl was run at a level 1 (URLs including their embeds, plus the URLs of all outbound links including their embeds) \n \n The WARC files associated with this crawl are not currently available to the general public.']",2,"– In an effort to reach a compromise in one of the two year-end battles facing Congress, Democrats have decided to drop their demand for a surtax on millionaires to finance payroll tax cuts.

News of the celestial upheaval came Tuesday morning via the ladies of The View, and Marvel now confirms that a woman will wield the hammer Mjölnir in a brand-new series starting in October. “This is not She-Thor,” says writer Jason Aaron in Marvel’s press release, published by the Mary Sue. “This is not Lady Thor. This is not Thorita. This is THOR. This is the THOR of the Marvel Universe. But it’s unlike any Thor we’ve ever seen before.” \n \n I’m not sure there is much thmor to be said here in the way of gender analysis, although perhaps the character’s makeover has something to do with sublimated love for superhero Ruth Bader Ginsburg? (Hammer equals gavel.) But it is fun to chant that evocatively solid syllable in the new Avenger’s honor. While a lot of superheroines—including Marvel’s own Storm, Black Widow, and Captain Marvel—rely on lithe acrobatics to fight evil, Thor favors the brute smashing of things. Thor is mighty and unsubtle and loud. She doesn’t shoot dinky little arrows, like Hawkeye, or bat-shaped boomerangs. As Walter White might say, she is the one who knocks. \n \n Advertisement \n \n \n \n Plus, we have delicious logistical questions to consider, now that Asgard has decided to lean in. For instance, Marvel Studios has committed to at least two more Avengers movies, one in 2018 and one (we think) in 2021. Will the comic book Thor diverge from the film Thor until the mainstream catches up with Aaron and his team? Or will Chris Hemsworth hand off the flowing blond locks to a female actor? (If so, we’ll miss your arms, Chris!) \n \n Either way, as Whoopi Goldberg said this morning, “It’s a huge day in the Marvel universe.” And on Twitter, Marvel executive editor had a thunderous response to skeptical fans:', ""Marvel is excited to announce an all-new era for the God of Thunder in brand new series, THOR, written by Jason Aaron complimented with art from Russell Dauterman. \n \n This October, Marvel Comics evolves once again in one of the most shocking and exciting changes ever to shake one of the “big three” of Captain America, Iron Man and Thor. No longer is the classic Thunder God able to hold the mighty hammer, Mjölnir, and a brand new female hero will emerge worthy of the name THOR. \n \n Who is she? Where did she come from and what is her connection to Asgard and the Marvel Universe? \n \n “The inscription on Thor's hammer reads ‘Whosoever holds this hammer, if HE be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor.’ Well it's time to update that inscription,” says Marvel editor Wil Moss. “The new Thor continues Marvel's proud tradition of strong female characters like Captain Marvel, Storm, Black Widow and more. And this new Thor isn't a temporary female substitute - she's now the one and only Thor, and she is worthy!” \n \n Series writer Jason Aaron emphasizes, “This is not She-Thor. This is not Lady Thor. This is not Thorita. This is THOR. This is the THOR of the Marvel Universe. But it’s unlike any Thor we’ve ever seen before.” \n \n THOR is the latest in the ever-growing and long list of female-centric titles that continues to invite new readers into the Marvel Universe. THOR will be the 8th title to feature a lead female protagonist and aims to speak directly to an audience that long was not the target for super hero comic books in America: women and girls. \n \n Join the conversation on Twitter and don’t forget to follow us at @Marvel.""]",2,"– We have seen the future Thor, and she is female: In a rather startling change, Marvel revealed today (to The View, naturally?) what it calls ""one of the most shocking and exciting changes"" to rattle the ranks of its biggest heroes—it seems our ""classic Thunder God"" is no longer worthy of the mighty hammer, Mjölnir, and so Marvel is rolling out a new female character to take it up. But careful: ""This is not She-Thor,"" says writer Jason Aaron. ""This is not Lady Thor. This is not Thorita. This is THOR."" It's an interesting change, notes Katy Waldman at Slate, because ""while a lot of superheroines—including Marvel’s own Storm, Black Widow, and Captain Marvel—rely on lithe acrobatics to fight evil, Thor favors the brute smashing of things. Thor is mighty and unsubtle and loud."" But while Marvel editor Wil Moss notes the inscription on Thor's hammer reads, ""Whosoever holds this hammer, if HE be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor,"" he says that nevertheless, ""it's time to update that inscription.""

An officer went to the man\'s home and entered his apartment with the building manager. The man, identified by relatives as Thomas Sancomb, had collapsed at the end of his bed, according to the heavily redacted report from the Milwaukee County Medical Examiner. The officer called 911. \n \n Paramedics from the Milwaukee Fire Department said Sancomb was ""cold to the touch and in rigor,"" and they did not attempt to resuscitate him, the report said. \n \n Sancomb was pronounced dead at 2:10 p.m. at the apartment, forensic investigator Genevieve M. Penn wrote in the report. Penn then called Sancomb\'s brother, John Sancomb, to inform him of the death and the brother requested an autopsy to determine the cause of death. \n \n A transport team arrived to take the body to the morgue, but at about 3 p.m., Thomas Sancomb had ""spontaneous respirations"" and began moving his left arm and right leg, but no pulse was evident, Penn wrote. She summoned paramedics back to the apartment and called the family. \n \n Sancomb\'s pulse returned and he was rushed to Columbia St. Mary\'s Hospital in Milwaukee. His diagnosis at the hospital was redacted from the report. Hospital spokesman Evan Solochek said no information could be disclosed because of federal privacy laws. \n \n John Sancomb told the medical examiner that his brother had a drink and a cigar every once in a while, but did not use street drugs. Sancomb said he last saw his brother two weeks ago and was concerned that he wasn\'t walking well, the report said. \n \n He told The Associated Press that his brother is improving every day. \n \n ""Thomas\' health is the most important thing we\'re focusing on right now,"" he said, declining to talk further about the incident. \n \n The medical examiner\'s office declined to comment on the case.

Paul Allen tweeted photos on Monday of the Musashi, sunk by US warplanes in 1944. Allen says he found the remains in the Philippines while exploring on his yacht, the M/Y Octopus, and describes it as the culmination of an eight-year search that relied on historical documents from four countries, a ""hypsometric bathymetric survey"" of the ocean floor, and his yacht's robust technology. After surveying the area, Allen and his team of researchers deployed an autonomous underwater vehicle to pinpoint the ship's location, according to a press release via CNBC that calls the Musashi ""one of the two largest and most technologically advanced battleships in naval history."" ""The Musashi is truly an engineering marvel, and as an engineer at heart, I have a deep appreciation for the technology and effort that went into its construction,"" Allen says. Underwater photos show a giant chrysanthemum on the ship's bow, symbolizing Japan's royal family; an image of one of the ship's valves reveals it bears Japanese writing. A Japanese museum director says he's ""90% sure"" that it is indeed the Musashi, CNN reports. More than 1,000 people died in the ship's sinking.

In addition, President Obama’s public statements contradict other witness statements, specifically those made by labor union official and Senate Candidate B,” the motion said. The motion is here. Several parts are redacted, but you can easily copy and paste the entire motion into a text file and view all the redacted material. Oops on somebody’s part. * All of the most explosive allegations in the motion were redacted. Blagojevich’s lawyers allege that Tony Rezko admitted to violating the law by personally contributing “a large sum of cash” to a public official’s campaign, which the Blagojevich people say is Obama. The lawyers claim that Obama may not have been telling the truth when he said Rezko never relayed a request from a lobbyist to hold a fundraiser for Obama in exchange for favorable legislative action (Obama, however, refused to agree to the offer, Rezko allegedly says). They also claim that Obama allegedly lied when he said he didn’t have any conversations with Rezko about a casino license… In a recent in camera proceeding, the government tendered a three paragraph letter indicating that Rezko “has stated in interviews with the government that he engaged in election law violations by personally contributing a large sum of cash to the campaign of a public official who is not Rod Blagojevich. … Further, the public official denies being aware of cash contributions to his campaign by Rezko or others and denies having conversations with Rezko related to cash contributions. Rezko has also stated in interviews with the government that he believed he transmitted a quid pro quo offer from a lobbyist to the public official, whereby the lobbyist would hold a fundraiser for the official in exchange for favorable official action, but that the public official rejected the offer. The public official denies any such conversation. In addition, Rezko has stated to the government that he and the public official had certain conversations about gaming legislation and administration, which the public official denies having had. President Obama is the only one who can testify as to the veracity of Mr. Rezko’s allegations above. A redacted footnote offers further explanation… The defense has a good faith belief that this public official is Barack Obama. As its proof, the Blagojevich people reference a 2006 Sun-Times story… Senator Barack Obama was asked: “Did Rezko or his companies ever solicit your support on any matter involving state or federal government? Did Al Johnson, who was trying to get a casino license along with Tony Rezko, or Rezko himself ever discuss casino matters with you?” Senator Obama answered: “No, I have never been asked to do anything to advance his business interest. In 1999, when I was a State Senator, I opposed legislation to bring a casino to Rosemont and allow casino gambling at docked riverboats which news reports said Al Johnson and Tony Rezko were interested in being part of. I never discussed a casino license with either of them. I was a vocal opponent of the legislation.” * The rest of the redacted stuff mostly involves claims by the Blagojevich team that Barack Obama was not totally truthful during FBI questioning. “Senate Candidate B” is Valerie Jarrett, who is now one of three senior advisers to the president… 9. Yet, despite President Obama stating that no representatives of his had any part of any deals, labor union president told the FBI and the United States Attorneys that he \n \n spoke to labor union official on November 3, 2008 who received a phone message from Obama that evening. After labor union official listened to the message labor union official told labor union president “I’m the one”. Labor union president took that to mean that labor union official was to be the one to deliver the message on behalf of Obama that Senate Candidate B was his pick. 10. Labor union official told the FBI and the United States Attorneys “Obama expressed his belief that [Senate Candidate B] would be a good Senator for the people of Illinois and would be a candidate who could win re-election. [Labor union official] advised Obama that [labor union official] would reach out to Governor Blagojevich and advocate for [Senate Candidate B].. . . [Labor union official] called [labor union president] and told [labor union president] that Obama was aware that [labor union official] would be reaching out to Blagojevich.” (Labor union official 302, February 3, 2009 p. 3). 11. According to Senate Candidate B, on November, 4 2008, Senate Candidate B spoke with labor union official about the Senate seat. Labor union official said he spoke to Obama. Labor union official said he was going to meet with Blagojevich and said “he was going to push Blagojevich hard on this. * There is also an allegation of an attempted quid pro quo on the Jarrett Senate appointment… Supporter of Presidential Candidate Obama is mentioned in a phone call on November 3, 2008, having offered “fundraising” in exchange for Senate Candidate B for senator (Blagojevich Home Phone Call # 149). …Adding… Obama allegedly shot down former Senate President Emil Jones’ name when it was floated by the Blagojevich team as a possible Senate appointment. And Rahm Emanuel floated Cheryle Jackson’s name… President’s Chief of Staff told the FBI that he had a conversation discussing the Senate seat with Obama on December 7, 2008 in Obama’s car. President’s Chief of Staff told the FBI “Obama expressed concern about Senate Candidate D being appointed as Senator. “[President’s Chief of Staff] suggested they might need an expanded list to possibly include names of African Americans that came out of the business world. [President’s Chief of Staff] thought he suggested Senate Candidate E who was the head of the Urban League and with President’s Chief of Staff’s suggestion.” *** UPDATE *** The New York Times hasn’t figured out that the redactions can be seen… Judging from what can be seen of the motion, which is full of blacked-out sentences and words (to comply with rules about sealed information), Mr. Blagojevich’s lawyers are hoping the president himself will point up contradictions in the prosecution case and testify about whether he had sent “emissaries” to Mr. Blagojevich with regard to who the White House would prefer fill the Senate seat. - posted by Rich Miller \n \n 89 Comments Sorry, comments for this post are now closed.']",2,"– Rod Blagojevich's defense team asked the judge to subpoena Barack Obama yesterday with a motion that was supposed to be heavily redacted. But whoever redacted it did a lousy job; the blacked out text could be easily read just by copying and pasting it, as Capital Fax revealed. Here's what Blago's lawyers allege in the redacted portions: Obama lied about his conversations with Tony Rezko. The lawyers say Obama turned down a fundraiser Rezko offered him in exchange for favorable legislative action. Obama has denied even having such a conversation. Obama directly recommended Valerie Jarrett for his old Senate seat, and gave Blagojevich a list of four candidates he considered acceptable. One of Obama's supporters offered to raise money for Blagojevich if he picked Jarrett. Obama had a secret phone call with Blagojevich in December—though the document doesn't say what was discussed.

167,"['?We need people who will help to Make America Great Again!,"" President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter. | Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images Trump: \'We cannot allow all of these people to invade our country\' \n \n President Donald Trump on Sunday continued escalating his rhetoric about migrants, tweeting, “We cannot allow all of these people to invade our country.” \n \n The president wrote on Twitter: ""When somebody comes in, we must immediately, with no Judges or Court Cases, bring them back from where they came,” presumably confusing “bring” with “send” in that instance. “Our system is a mockery to good immigration policy and Law and Order.” \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n Trump and allies have increasingly used dehumanizing terms to describe immigration, including language like ""infest."" At times, his harsh words have been reserved for MS-13 gang members, but in other instances he is not specific as to what he is talking about and conflates migrants coming across the border with the brutal gang. \n \n “Immigration must be based on merit — we need people who will help to Make America Great Again!” he said in his next tweet. \n \n The president and his administration have been under intense criticism since the new ""zero tolerance"" immigration policy led to the separation of families apprehended after crossing the border illegally. Trump signed an executive order Wednesday that he said would end the practice, but former homeland security adviser Tom Bossert said Sunday that order will likely be overturned by the courts. \n \n As he did last week, Trump complained about the role of judges and the court system in the U.S. immigration process. Since illegal immigration is a federal crime — a misdemeanor for a first instance of illegal border crossing and a felony for someone who has been deported who illegally enters the United States again — the process is handled at the federal level by immigration judges. \n \n The U.S. has an expedited removal process that allows for relatively fast deportation proceedings for people who enter the country illegally, but only if they are citizens of Canada or Mexico. Trump wants to change that. \n \n But the president seemed to call Sunday for denying due process to people apprehended after crossing the border illegally, and he did not seem to draw a distinction for people who arrive at ports of entry seeking asylum, as are many of those now coming from violence-plagued Central American nations. America is party to treaties that govern the treatment of asylum seekers and non-asylum seekers. \n \n An American Civil Liberties Union official blasted Trump\'s statement, saying the president was suggesting an ""illegal and unconstitutional"" policy change. \n \n ""Any official who has sworn an oath to uphold the Constitution and laws should disavow it unequivocally,"" said Omar Jadwat, director of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project. \n \n Josh Gerstein contributed to this report.', 'TORONTO (AP) — Chris Brown tweeted Tuesday that he\'s been denied entry into Canada and that his concerts in Montreal and Toronto have been canceled. \n \n FILE - In this Feb. 16, 2015 file photo, singer Chris Brown performs at the Barclays Center in New York.

I\'ll be back this summer and will hopefully see all my Canadian fans!"" \n \n Brown was jailed for nearly three months last year for violating his probation by getting into an altercation outside a Washington hotel the previous year. He was on probation after he attacked pop singer Rihanna, his then-girlfriend, before the 2009 Grammy Awards. \n \n Nicole Perna, a spokeswoman for Brown, confirmed Canadian immigration officials denied him entry. Perna said Brown can apply to return at a later date and plans to do so. Live Nation, the promoter, said in a statement that ""due to immigration issues"" the shows have been canceled and refunds are available at the point of purchase. \n \n In 2010, the United Kingdom denied Brown entry into the country, forcing him to miss four shows. The British government\'s Home Office said then that Brown had been refused a visa because of his past criminal record. \n \n Stephane Malepart, a spokesman for Canada Border Services, said the country\'s privacy act prevents him from commenting on any individual case, but said several factors are used in determining admissibility, including involvement in criminal activity.']",2,"– After a week of outrage over child separation at the southern border and a subsequent executive order that claims to stop it, President Trump is again using pointed rhetoric to describe the immigration crisis in America. In a Sunday string of tweets, Trump blasted Democrats, telling them to ""fix the laws"" while praising his own administration for being better than those of Bush or Obama at handing the complex issue. In that same tweet, Trump connected illegal immigration with crime on this side of the border. ""Cannot accept all of the people trying to break into our Country. Strong Borders, No Crime!"" he tweeted. As Politico notes, Trump and his supporters have frequently used controversial language when describing undocumented immigrants, specifically when invoking the MS-13 gang. The president did not mention the street gang in Sunday's tweets. However, Trump did say that ""We cannot allow all of these people to invade our Country ... we must immediately, with no Judges or Court Cases, bring them back from where they came."" As of May, federal immigration courts had a backlog of over 700,000 cases and some courts were scheduling hearings after 2021. Per AP, Republican apprehension over Trump's habit of sending off fiery and unpredictable tweets about the hot button issue and their fear of riling conservative voters are undermining GOP leaders' election-year struggle to shove an immigration bill through the House this week. Party leaders are trying to finally secure the votes they need for their wide-ranging bill with tweaks they hope will goose support from the GOP's dueling conservative and moderate wings."

The good news is that the video shows the women after US and Chinese troops arrived to free them in China's Yunnan province in 1944. A research team from Seoul National University found the footage in the US National Archives after a two-year search, reports Reuters. An American soldier is believed to have filmed the scene, in which a Chinese officer talks to the women lined up in front of a building used as a brothel. Japan forced an estimated 200,000 women to work as sex slaves for its soldiers during World War II. (Earlier this year, South Korea angered Japan with a statue honoring the women.)"
169,"['It’s amazing. You strap on some gear, and then you’re inside whatever world you want. It showed up in books, it showed up in movies, and everyone dreamed about it. Problem was, it kinda sucked. I tried Dactyl Nightmare at an amusement park, and it kinda sucked. Huge wires, unconvincing tracking, horrible visual fidelity. VR kept sucking for a long time, and people kinda gave up on it. \n \n But then something happened. Or, well, it had already happened, but nobody realized. The technology was finally here to do proper virtual reality. The team behind Oculus Rift realized this, and built the first prototype of VR that was finally just good enough to be usable, and it was only going to get better and better. They set up a kickstarter to fund their enthusiasm, and a lot of people got excited. They made about ten times the money they asked for, and I was one of the top-level backers. \n \n I got my oculus rift dev kit, and played around with it. It was convincing. It presented a lot of design problems. It made me nauseous. It was signed by the entire Oculus Rift team. I got super excited and worked on a couple of prototypes before moving on to other things. Perhaps I would pick it up again closer to the consumer version release. \n \n A couple of weeks ago, they reminded me that I still hadn’t visited their office, one of the rewards from the kickstarter. John Carmack would be there. The combined opportunity of seeing their latest tech and getting to talk about vr (and doom) with John was overwhelming, so I took the 12+ hour flight there. What I saw was every bit as impressive as you could imagine. They had fixed all the major issues, and all that remained was huge design and software implementation challenges. \n \n As someone who always felt like they were born five or ten years too late, I felt like we were on the cusp of a new paradigm that I might be able to play around with. I could be part of the early efforts to work out best practices, and while I have no doubt that in ten years we’ll look back at the problems with early VR applications in the same we look back at GUI problems with early PC games, it still felt exciting to me. My head started spinning with potential applications and how to deal with all the issues (how do you do gui? how do you deal with locomotion? what input do you use? what happens if the player leans far enough forward to clip into a wall? how do you prevent vr induced existential crisis?) \n \n Of course, they wanted Minecraft. I said that it doesn’t really fit the platform, since it’s very motion based, runs on java (that has a hard time delivering rock solid 90 fps, especially since the players build their own potentially hugely complex levels), and relies a lot on GUI. But perhaps it would be cool to do a slimmed down version of Minecraft for the Oculus. Something free, similar to the Minecraft PI Edition, perhaps? So I suggested that, and our people started talking to their people to see if something could be done. \n \n And then, not two weeks later, Facebook buys them. \n \n Facebook is not a company of grass-roots tech enthusiasts. Facebook is not a game tech company. Facebook has a history of caring about building user numbers, and nothing but building user numbers. People have made games for Facebook platforms before, and while it worked great for a while, they were stuck in a very unfortunate position when Facebook eventually changed the platform to better fit the social experience they were trying to build. \n \n Don’t get me wrong, VR is not bad for social. In fact, I think social could become one of the biggest applications of VR. Being able to sit in a virtual living room and see your friend’s avatar? Business meetings? Virtual cinemas where you feel like you’re actually watching the movie with your friend who is seven time zones away? \n \n But I don’t want to work with social, I want to work with games. \n \n Fortunately, the rise of Oculus coincided with competitors emerging. None of them are perfect, but competition is a very good thing. If this means there will be more competition, and VR keeps getting better, I am going to be a very happy boy. I definitely want to be a part of VR, but I will not work with Facebook. Their motives are too unclear and shifting, and they haven’t historically been a stable platform. There’s nothing about their history that makes me trust them, and that makes them seem creepy to me. \n \n And I did not chip in ten grand to seed a first investment round to build value for a Facebook acquisition. \n \n I have the greatest respect for the talented engineers and developers at Oculus. It’s been a long time since I met a more dedicated and talented group of people. I understand this is purely a business deal, and I’d like to congratulate both Facebook and the Oculus owners. But this is where we part ways. \n \n If you want to experience Minecraft in VR, there’s an excellent mod that does this. It’s called Minecrift, and you can find it here.', 'Demonstrators hold a Palestinian flag as they stage a protest against U.S. President Donald Trump\'s decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel in Paris, France, Sunday, Dec. 17, 2017.

An... (Associated Press) \n \n UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The United States on Monday vetoed a resolution supported by the 14 other U.N. Security Council members that would have required President Donald Trump to rescind his declaration of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, a vote that showed the depth of global opposition to the U.S. move. \n \n The United States was certain to veto the Egyptian-drafted resolution, but its Arab supporters wanted the vote to demonstrate that countries everywhere and even many U.S. allies such as Britain, France and Japan are against Trump\'s action. \n \n U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley called the resolution ""an insult"" that won\'t be forgotten, saying the United Nations forced the U.S. to cast a veto simply because of its right to decide where to put its embassy. \n \n The resolution that was vetoed would have called on ""all states to refrain from the establishment of diplomatic missions in the holy city of Jerusalem,"" citing a 1980 council resolution. \n \n Without naming any country, it would have expressed ""deep regret at recent decisions concerning the status of Jerusalem."" \n \n And it would have demanded that all countries comply with 10 resolutions on Jerusalem, dating back to 1967, including requirements that the city\'s final status be decided in direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. \n \n The vetoed resolution would also have affirmed that ""any decisions and actions which purport to have altered, the character, status or demographic composition of the holy city of Jerusalem have no legal effect, are null and void and must be rescinded."" \n \n Trump shattered decades of unwavering U.S. neutrality on Jerusalem on Dec. 6 when he declared that the United States recognizes the divided holy city as Israel\'s capital and will move its embassy there. Trump insisted that after repeated peace failures it was past time for a new approach, saying his decision was merely based on reality. \n \n The status of Jerusalem has been a central issue in the decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and Trump\'s announcement was widely perceived as taking the side of Israel. It countered an international consensus that Jerusalem\'s status should be decided in negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, who claim east Jerusalem as the capital of their future state. \n \n Trump\'s announcement triggered denunciations and demonstrations around the world. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas\' Fatah movement and other groups organized mass protests while its rival, the Gaza-based Islamic militant group Hamas, has called for a third violent uprising against Israel. \n \n Trump has been working on a new Mideast peace plan and says he remains committed to brokering a deal, despite the Jerusalem move. However, Abbas said after the announcement that the U.S. has effectively removed itself from any role as a Mideast broker, and those close to him say it\'s time to look for alternatives. \n \n Haley stressed that Trump ""took great care not to prejudge final status negotiations"" — and reiterated that the United States remains committed to Mideast peace. \n \n The vetoed resolution would also have reiterated a call to reverse ""the negative trends on the ground that are imperiling the two-state solution"" that would see the states of Israel and the Palestine living side-by-side in peace. And it would have called for intensified and accelerated international and regional efforts to achieve Middle East peace.']",2,"– Facebook has bought pioneering virtual-reality headset maker Oculus for $2 billion, and Mark Zuckerberg is pretty excited about it. The startup's immersive headset for video game developers has been a big hit, but Facebook appears ready to take virtual reality beyond gaming, Business Insider finds.

They have built a database with 500 million people, places and things, and there are 3.5 billion defining attributes and connections, which include those related searches and other information. \n \n Google says you\'ll start seeing the Knowledge Graph box as often as you see Google Maps, making it its largest search launch ever. It says it has surpassed the launch of Google Image and Google News in terms of the data available on its first day.

Now the Knowledge Graph box, located to the right of the results, will give you those options. When you click one it will take to you the search results for that specific ""Kings"" search term, and you\'ll get another Knowledge Graph box -- this time with information about the specific ""Kings"" search. \n \n While Google\'s Knowledge Graph tries to focus on reliable sources of information, the company continues to make search more social.

We have to have a team tracking us.” \n \n Bradley and Tiukhtyaev’s balloon – dubbed Two Eagles – is outfitted with a high-tech navigation system, basic necessities such as a first-aid kit, and communications equipment. It is 140 tall, 90 feet wide and filled with 350,000 cubic feet of gas. \n \n It will fly at an altitude of at least 15,000 feet. The pilots will have oxygen masks and will be bundled up. The temperature inside their capsule will be about 50 degrees. \n \n The balloon was flying over Japan at 19,000 feet Saturday evening. In just under four hours, the balloon had traveled about 120 miles, according to the team’s website. \n \n The pilots have to be physically fit to endure several days inside the capsule, with little sleep and limited oxygen. In addition to the record attempts, the flight is being monitored by researchers at Arizona State University who are studying the effects of fatigue on cognitive ability. \n \n Track the balloon \n \n The Two Eagles website, The Two Eagles website, twoeaglesballoonteam.com , includes live tracking of the balloon’s position and regular updates from Mission Control. \n \n It’s possible the pilots could be aloft for 10 days, which is the outer limit of the balloon’s capabilities, the team said. \n \n Once the hatch is closed and the pilots are inside, it’s much like a video game, monitoring the GPS and other systems for updates on weather conditions, speed and altitude, Bradley told The Associated Press in October. \n \n Bradley and his wife, Tami, live in Albuquerque and have two children. Bradley regularly flies hot-air balloons in the Duke City and owns and operates a hot-air balloon company. He has set records before in gas, hot-air and gas and hot-air combination Roziére balloons.']",2,"– Riding in a 140-foot tall balloon filled with 350,000 cubic feet of gas, an American and a Russian have set off from Japan in the hopes of setting two balloon ride records at once. First, Troy Bradley, 50, and Leonid Tiukhtyaev, 58, hope to reach North America and break the current distance record of 5,208 miles, which was set between Japan and the US in 1981. And second, they hope to reach the West Coast in 5.5 days and then head inland another day or two, breaking the duration record of 137 hours (5.7 days) set in 1978, reports the AP. ""Everything went just like a textbook,"" said team social media director Letitia Hill just after takeoff early yesterday. (Bad weather delayed two previous attempts earlier this month.) Mission Control, situated in a small room at a balloon museum in Albuquerque, includes balloonists, a meteorologist, a physician, and a search-and-rescue expert, who are staying in touch with the pilots via satellite phones, reports the Albuquerque Journal. The balloon, called Two Eagles, is equipped with several types of radios, a high-tech navigation system, and basics like food and a first-aid kit. The men will wear oxygen masks and stay bundled up in the 50-degree cabin as they fly at an expected altitude of at least 15,000 feet. It's possible the pilots could be in flight for as many as 10 days, the balloon's apparent outer limits, and it's not clear where they'll come down. ""That’s going to keep us on the edge of our seats for this mission,"" says Hill. Bradley and Tiukhtyaev are also being monitored by Arizona State University researchers studying fatigue's effects on cognition. (Check out this recent balloon ride that didn't go as planned.)"

176,"['Leader appears on state TV briefly to signal defiance in the face of mounting revolt against his 41-year rule. \n \n There have been widespread reports that Libyan soldiers have used live ammunition on protesters [Reuters] Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi has appeared on state television to signal his defiance in the face of a mounting revolt against his 41-year rule. \n \n \n \n ""I am in Tripoli and not in Venezuela. Do not believe the channels belonging to stray dogs,"" Gaddafi told Libyan state TV, which said he was speaking outside his house on Tuesday. LIVE BLOG On Monday, William Hague, the British foreign minister, had suggested that Gaddafi had fled to Venezuela, a report that the government of that country denied. Gaddafi, in his first televised appearance since protests to topple him began last week, was holding an umbrella in the rain and leaning out of a van. \n \n \n \n ""I wanted to say something to the youths at the Green Square (in Tripoli) and stay up late with them but it started raining. Thank God, it\'s a good thing,"" Gaddafi said in a 22-second appearance. \n \n \n \n State TV reported earlier that pro-government demonstrations were taking place in Green Square in the capital. \n \n \n \n Libyan forces loyal to Gaddafi have fought an increasingly bloody battle to keep the veteran leader in power with residents reporting gunfire in parts of the capital Tripoli and warplanes reportedly bombing protesters. Scores of people have been reported killed in continuing violence in Tripoli amid escalating protests across the north African nation. ""In a sense this is a pariah regime that will not have any chance of governing anymore and the international community could come to terms on whether this is a genocide and whether there should be international intervention to protect the Libyan people from the militias of the regime,"" said Marwan Bishara, Al Jazeera\'s senior political analyst. \n \n \n \n ""We\'ve heard even a NATO spokesman saying that the Libyan regime should stop committing war crimes against its people so I think there is momentum out there but certainly it\'s not quick enough."" Deep cracks were showing and Gaddafi seemed to be losing vital support, as Libyan government officials at home and abroad resigned, air force pilots defected and major government buildings were targeted during clashes in the capital. At least 61 people were killed in the capital city on Monday, witnesses told Al Jazeera. Protesters called for another night of defiance against the Arab world\'s longest-serving leader, despite a crackdown by authorities \'Unacceptable bloodshed\' Libya\'s deputy ambassador to the United Nations, Ibrahim Dabbashi, spoke to Al Jazeera Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, has said it is ""time to stop this unnacceptable bloodshed"" in Libya. \n \n \n \n A group of army officers issued a statement urging fellow soldiers to ""join the people"" and help remove Gaddafi. \n \n \n \n The justice minister resigned in protest at the ""excessive use of violence"" against protesters and diplomats at Libya\'s mission to the United Nations called on the Libyan army to help overthrow ""the tyrant Muammar Gaddafi"". \n \n \n \n Both Libya and Venezuela denied reports that Gaddafi had fled to the South American country. Two Libyan fighter jets landed in Malta, their pilots defecting after they said they had been ordered to bomb protesters, Maltese government officials said. Libyan authorities have cut all landline and wireless communication in the country, making it impossible to verify many reports. With reports of large-scale military operations under way in Tripoli, a spokesperson for Ban Ki-moon said the UN chief held extensive discussions with Gaddafi on Monday, condemned the escalating violence in Libya and told him that it ""must stop immediately”. UN, Arab League meetings The UN Security Council will hold a closed-door meeting on Tuesday to discuss the crisis in Libya, diplomats said. \n \n \n \n They said the meeting, referred to as ""consultations"", had been requested by Ibrahim Dabbashi, the Libyan deputy ambassador, and would start at 1400 GMT. \n \n \n \n Dabbashi and other diplomats at Libya\'s mission to the UN on Monday said they sided with protesters in Libya. \n \n \n \n Earlier, Hamad Bin Jassim Bin Jabr Al-Thani, Qatar\'s prime minister and foreign minister, called for an extraordinary meeting of the Arab League to take place on Tuesday. \n \n \n \n The aim is to discuss the current crisis in Libya and to put additional ""pressure"" on the government, Al-Thani told Al Jazeera. He said the international community must act now. ""I feel a big sympathy for the Libyan people. We don\'t accept using force in this way or any way against the people or against any nation from their governments,"" he said. The comments came just hours after Ahmed Elgazir, a human-rights researcher at the Libyan News Centre (LNC) in Geneva, Switzerland, told Al Jazeera that security forces were ""massacring"" protesters in Tripoli. Speaking to Al Jazeera, Ahmad Jibreel, a Libyan diplomat, confirmed that the justice minister, Mustapha Abdul Jalil, had sided with the protesters. Jibreel further said that key cities near Libya\'s border with Egypt were now in the hands of protesters, which he said would enable the foreign media to enter the country. Meanwhile, the Egyptian military on Tuesday said it was reinforcing the border with Libya, but that it would leave it open throughout the day for those who require medical or other assistance. The army says it has set up two field hospitals and camps to receive Egyptians and Libyans who cross the border into Egypt.', 'SeaWorld trainers Mark Galan, right, and Laura Surovik embrace as friends and colleagues of Dawn Brancheau, who was dragged to her death by a killer whale, gather to watch first whale show after her death... (Associated Press) \n \n Employees wept and audience members grew silent Saturday at SeaWorld as the theme park\'s popular killer whale show resumed with a photo montage memorial for a trainer who was killed by one of the orcas in front of horrified spectators three days ago. \n \n The show had been shut down since veteran trainer Dawn Brancheau, 40, died Wednesday after rubbing a 22-foot, 12,000-pound orca named Tilikum. The animal grabbed her ponytail and pulled her into the water in front of about 20 spectators. The medical examiner says she likely died of traumatic injuries and drowning. \n \n More than 2,000 people packed the park\'s stadium Saturday for the first show since Brancheau\'s death. \n \n The audience seemed thrilled, applauding and cheering as the whales zipped around their tank and splashed spectators during the show _ with the theme of ""believe,"" about a young boy who sees an orca and dreams of one day becoming a whale trainer. It was a fitting tribute to Brancheau, whose family said she always wanted work with the giant whales. \n \n At one point during the show, a young girl was brought on stage and given a whale tail necklace. \n \n ""I just wanted to be here for this show. It\'s so special,"" said Russell Thomphsen, 65, who said he is a season-ticket holder for SeaWorld. ""This touches so many lives."" \n \n Spectators packed the enormous outdoor amphitheater despite chilly, rainy weather, with the orca pool registering at 52 degrees. The whale trainers received a standing ovation as they approached the platform before the show, part of the multimillion-dollar enterprise centered around ""Shamu"" _ the stage name given to all the performing orcas. \n \n Several SeaWorld employees wept as the photo montage set to music was shown. \n \n ""It was very moving,"" said Molly Geislinger, 33, who came from Minneapolis with her husband and 21-month-old child. \n \n However, she noticed a difference in how the trainers acted. \n \n ""They looked like they were being very careful,"" she said. ""They looked very cautious today."" \n \n Indeed, the trainers weren\'t allowed in the water, meaning the whales\' handlers did not surf on top of the marine mammals or fly into the air. Instead, the trainers _ wearing orca-like black-and-white wetsuits _ directed the whales from outside the huge tank\'s acrylic walls. They coached the creatures to splash the front-and-center rows a few times, much to the delight of onlookers. \n \n SeaWorld officials have said trainers won\'t swim with the orcas until they finish reviewing what happened to Brancheau. \n \n Jeff Steward, who came to the show with his wife, called the memorial ""a very emotional start."" \n \n He said they enjoyed the show, adding: ""It\'s a tragedy, but these things happen when you\'re dealing with wild animals."" \n \n SeaWorld Parks and Entertainment President Jim Atchison said Friday that Tilikum will remain an ""active, contributing member of the team,"" in part because the killer whale show is big business at SeaWorld. The company owns more killer whales than anyone else in the world and builds the orca image into its multimillion-dollar brand. Tilikum did not perform Saturday. \n \n The timing of the killer whales\' return to performances reflects just what the sleek black-and-white mammals mean to SeaWorld, which the private equity firm The Blackstone Group bought last fall for around $2.7 billion from Anheuser-Busch InBev in a deal that included two Busch Gardens theme parks and several other attractions. \n \n There are two other SeaWorld parks _ one in San Antonio, and one in San Diego. \n \n No animal is more valuable to that operation than Tilikum, the largest orca in captivity. Captured nearly 30 years ago off Iceland, Tilikum has grown into the alpha male of captive killer whales, his value as a stud impossible to pin down. He now has been involved in the deaths of two trainers and requires a special set of handling rules, which Atchison wouldn\'t specify. \n \n John Galloway, of Palm Coast, Fla., said he didn\'t want to see the killer whale shows end because of the tragedy. \n \n ""I think they know what they\'re doing,"" he said of the trainers. ""Me, myself, I wouldn\'t be down there doing that.""']",2,"– The rumors of Moammar Gadhafi's Venezuelan vacation are greatly exaggerated: The embattled Libyan leader made a bizarre, minute-long appearance on state TV at 2am local time, declaring, ""I am in Tripoli and not in Venezuela.

My mind and my way of expressing myself are not as clear as they used to be.” \n \n Photo \n \n Joseph Zwilling, a spokesman for the Archdiocese of New York, denounced the comments as “terribly wrong.” But he said the church was unlikely to discipline Father Groeschel, in part because as a member of a religious order, he was not officially a priest of the diocese. \n \n For the past 38 years, Father Groeschel has counseled priests at the Trinity Retreat House in the New York suburb of Larchmont; he founded the retreat at the direction of the archbishop at the time, Cardinal Terence J. Cooke. The retreat is a place of treatment and reflection, and the archdiocese has sent priests credibly accused of sexual abuse to live there, but not since 2006, Mr. Zwilling said. \n \n More recently, priests struggling with problems like alcoholism have been sent there for counseling. Father Groeschel, who has a doctorate in psychology from Teachers College at Columbia University, has also taught pastoral counseling for more than 40 years at the archdiocesan seminary, St. Joseph’s Seminary in Yonkers. \n \n Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The Rev. Glenn Sudano, another founder of the Friars of the Renewal, whose adherents take vows of poverty and work extensively with the poor, said the remarks might have been the result of Father Groeschel’s advancing age and failing health, as well as the aftereffect of a near-fatal 2004 car accident in Orlando, Fla. \n \n “Poor Father Benedict,” he said. “It is painful for us, seeing someone who was so much an advocate and a defender for the underdog, say that.” \n \n In the interview, Father Groeschel said that he continued to counsel priests and that he worked some 12 hours a day. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Asked if he counseled priests who were abusers, he said yes, and then offered a sympathetic portrait. “People have this picture in their minds of a person planning to — a psychopath, but that’s not the case,” he said. Asked why a child might act as a seducer, he said: “A kid looking for a father and didn’t have his own — and they won’t be planning to get into heavy-duty sex, but almost romantic, embracing, kissing, perhaps sleeping but not having intercourse or anything like that.” \n \n He also expressed sympathy for Jerry Sandusky, the retired Penn State football coach who was recently convicted of serial child molesting, calling him “this poor guy.” \n \n Many New York priests and others — including advocates for victims of child sexual abuse — reacted with anger at the remarks. “Blaming the abused for their abuse is indefensible,” said the Rev.

So bad that if the American people got a mulligan on the 2012 election, there's a good shot we'd be looking at a President Romney. A Washington Post-ABC News poll reveals that if the election were held today, Obama would lose the popular vote 45% to 49%. While the Post reminds us that the Electoral College, not the popular vote, is the ultimate decider, it notes that spread roughly mirrors the 4 points Obama actually won by, and reflects plummeting support from his key demographics: Obama won women by 11 points; now, his edge is down to one point. He won voters aged 18-39 by 18 points; that's down to two. He won voters earning less than $50,000 by 22 points; it's down to three. He's now nine points in the hole with voters without a college degree, after winning them by four points. While he'd still win 59% of liberals, that's down from 75%—and 20% now say they'd vote for Romney. Obama's approval rating has fallen 13 points this year to 42%, tying its lowest mark ever in the poll.

178,"['Judge Neil Gorsuch was on the list of judges that President Donald Trump promised he would choose from during the campaign. | AP Photo Trump picks Gorsuch for Supreme Court The 49-year-old federal appeals court judge would be the court\'s first conservative addition in a decade. \n \n President Donald Trump on Tuesday tapped Judge Neil Gorsuch for the Supreme Court, elevating a 49-year-old judge who has served on a federal appeals court for more than a decade to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia. \n \n “When Justice Scalia passed away suddenly last February, I made a promise to the American people: If I were elected president, I would find the very best judge in the country for the Supreme Court,” Trump said. “I promised to select someone who respects our laws and is representative of our Constitution and who loves our Constitution and someone who will interpret them as written.” \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n Trump used his characteristic superlatives to introduce Gorsuch, calling him the “best” judge for the job and praising his credentials without expounding on the specifics of his legal philosophy. Trump even touted Gorsuch’s Ivy League pedigree — the kind of affiliations Trump has sometimes denigrated as breeding grounds for the out-of-touch elite. \n \n ""Mr. President, I am honored and I am humbled,"" Gorsuch said after being introduced. \n \n Trump’s sons Donald Jr. and Eric sat in the front row during the announcement. Vice President Mike Pence and his wife, Karen, were also in attendance, as were a number of congressional leaders. Scalia’s widow, Maureen, was also in the audience. \n \n Gorsuch pledged that, if confirmed, he would serve as “a faithful servant of the constitution and laws of this great country.” \n \n “The Supreme Court’s work is vital not just to a region of the country, but to the whole, vital to the protections of the people’s liberties under law and to the continuity of our constitution — the greatest charter of human liberty the world has ever known,” Gorsuch said. \n \n In his remarks, Gorsuch praised Scalia. “Justice Scalia was a lion of the law. Agree or disagree with him, all of his colleagues on the bench cherished his wisdom and his humor. And like them, I miss him,” he said. \n \n Gorsuch was on the list of judges that Trump promised he would choose from during the campaign, and his selection to the high court is expected to rally conservative activists who successfully pushed Republicans to block hearings for Judge Merrick Garland, former President Barack Obama’s pick, after Scalia’s death in February 2016. \n \n Gorsuch was appointed to the circuit court in 2006 by George W. Bush. He was confirmed by a Senate voice vote, meaning there were no objections to his confirmation but individual senators\' votes were not recorded. Trump touted Gorsuch as having been confirmed ""unanimously."" \n \n Gorsuch said he cherishes the traits he considers essential to a judge — “impartiality and independence, collegiality and courage” — and said he looks forward to his hearing before the Senate, which he called the “greatest deliberative body in the world.” \n \n Gorsuch’s statement provided some hints that he’s what legal scholars call an ""originalist"" or ""textualist,"" favoring a literal meaning of statutes and the Constitution. \n \n “I respect, too, the fact that in our legal order it is for Congress, and not the courts, to write new laws,” Gorsuch said. “It is the role of judges to apply, not alter, the work of the people’s representatives. A judge who likes every outcome you reach is very likely a bad judge — stretching for results he prefers rather than those the law demands.” \n \n View Who is Judge Neil Gorsuch? President Donald Trump nominated Judge Neil Gorsuch from the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals to fill the vacant seat of the late Justice Antonin Scalia. \n \n And he made a nod to his religion: “I am so thankful tonight for my family, my friends and my faith,” he said. “These are the things that keep me grounded at life’s peaks and that sustain me in its valleys.” \n \n If confirmed, Gorsuch is unlikely to swing the ideological balance on the court. Legal experts see him as largely falling in line with the conservative bloc, as did Scalia. But, at 49, he would be the youngest justice on the court and represent an infusion of new blood into conservative ranks that have not seen an addition for a decade. \n \n Democrats have threatened to filibuster Trump\'s nominee, and the Senate\'s top Democrat criticized Gorsuch\'s record on Tuesday night. \n \n “The burden is on Judge Neil Gorsuch to prove himself to be within the legal mainstream and, in this new era, willing to vigorously defend the Constitution from abuses of the executive branch and protect the constitutionally enshrined rights of all Americans,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said. “Given his record, I have very serious doubts about Judge Gorsuch’s ability to meet this standard.” \n \n Democratic Sens. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Ron Wyden of Oregon, Jeff Merkley of Oregon, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Ed Markey of Massachusetts have all indicated they\'ll vote against the nominee. \n \n Senate Republicans praised Trump\'s pick and noted that Democrats had not blocked him from joining the appeals court. ""Eleven years ago, the Senate was so confident in Judge Gorsuch’s abilities that it confirmed him by voice vote,"" said Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas). ""In the time since, he has shown himself worthy of that distinction, and I would hope that my Senate colleagues give him the respect he deserves this time around, as well, and support his confirmation.” \n \n Gorsuch has the typical pedigree of a high court justice. He graduated from Columbia, Harvard and Oxford, clerked for two Supreme Court justices and did a stint at the Department of Justice. \n \n He attended Harvard Law with Obama. On Tuesday afternoon, Obama\'s former ethics czar, Norm Eisen, another classmate, tweeted: ""Hearing rumors Trump\'s likely Supreme Court pick is Neil Gorsuch, my (and President Obama\'s!) 1991 Harvard Law classmate.If so, a great guy!"" \n \n Since 2006, he has served on the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, and he is praised by conservative scholars for the clarity and force of his writing. \n \n “Neil Gorsuch is one of the most respected conservative originalist legal intellectuals of his generation,” said Jeffrey Rosen of the National Constitution Center. “He’s unusual for his memorable writing style, the depth of his reading and his willingness to rethink constitutional principles from the ground up. Like Justice Scalia, he sometimes reaches results that favor liberals when he thinks the history or text of the Constitution or the law require it, especially in areas like criminal law or the rights of religious minorities, but unlike Scalia he’s less willing to defer to regulations and might be more willing to second-guess Trump’s regulatory decisions.” \n \n Gorsuch is a favorite of legal conservatives because he has sharply questioned a three-decade-old legal precedent that many on the right believe has given too much power to the regulatory state. The landmark 1984 Supreme Court ruling involving the Chevron oil company held that courts should defer to federal agencies’ reasonable interpretations of ambiguous federal laws. \n \n In a ruling last August in an immigration case, Gorsuch questioned the wisdom of that doctrine, arguing that the meaning of the law is for judges to decide, not federal bureaucrats. \n \n “Where in all this does a court interpret the law and say what it is?” Gorsuch asked in an extended digression on the subject. “When does a court independently decide what the statute means and whether it has or has not vested a legal right in a person? Where Chevron applies that job seems to have gone extinct.” \n \n Other rulings give conservatives confidence that Gorsuch is a strong supporter of religious freedom rights. Last September, he joined a dissent arguing that requirements for contraception coverage in Obamacare ran roughshod over the rights of religious nonprofits. \n \n View Trump picks Gorsuch for Supreme Court President Donald Trump picks Neil Gorsuch for Supreme Court on Tuesday. \n \n Gorsuch also wrote a 2000 law journal article and a 2006 book arguing strongly against assisted-suicide laws. The practice of allowing the terminally ill to end their lives is now legal in six states and is on the verge of being legalized in Washington, D.C. \n \n Gorsuch was confirmed to the Denver-based appeals court by a voice vote. His confirmation to the Supreme Court is expected to be contentious. Republicans hold a 52-48 advantage in the Senate, but Democrats, led by Schumer, are expected to force Republicans to muster 60 votes through a filibuster. \n \n Trump has suggested Republicans should eliminate the filibuster if Democrats use it, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has been more circumspect about that idea, saying it remains up to the Senate, not the White House. \n \n Gorsuch has seen the grinder of Washington, D.C., up close. His mother, Anne Burford Gorsuch, ran the Environmental Protection Agency under President Ronald Reagan but resigned under pressure amid a criminal investigation and a House contempt of Congress citation over records related to alleged political favoritism in toxic-waste cleanups. \n \n She maintained her innocence and was never charged in the matter. \n \n Gorsuch is from Colorado. His supporters note that he is an outdoorsman who fishes, hunts and skies. On the court, conservatives hope he could become the intellectual heir to Scalia, long the outspoken leader of the conservative bloc. \n \n “The real appeal of Gorsuch\'s nomination is he’s likely to be the most effective conservative nominee in terms of winning over Anthony Kennedy and forging conservative decisions on the court,” Rosen said. “He clerked for Justice Kennedy, and they like and trust each other. If any nominee could sway Kennedy to conservative decisions, it would be Gorsuch.”', 'President Trump has announced Judge Neil Gorsuch of Colorado as his pick for the Supreme Court. (Victoria Walker/The Washington Post) \n \n President Trump has announced Judge Neil Gorsuch of Colorado as his pick for the Supreme Court. (Victoria Walker/The Washington Post) \n \n For nearly eight months, President Trump has boasted that appointing Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court ranks high among his signature achievements. \n \n But earlier this year, Trump talked about rescinding Gorsuch’s nomination, venting angrily to advisers after his Supreme Court pick was critical of the president’s escalating attacks on the federal judiciary in private meetings with legislators. \n \n Trump, according to several people with knowledge of the discussions, was upset that Gorsuch had pointedly distanced himself from the president in a private February meeting with Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), telling the senator he found Trump’s repeated attacks on the federal judiciary “disheartening” and “demoralizing.” \n \n The president worried that Gorsuch would not be “loyal,” one of the people said, and told aides that he was tempted to pull Gorsuch’s nomination — and that he knew plenty of other judges who would want the job. \n \n It is unclear whether Trump’s “explosion,” as another administration official described it, truly put Gorsuch’s nomination in jeopardy or whether the president was expressing his frustration aloud, as he often does. But at the time, some in the White House and on Capitol Hill feared that Gorsuch’s confirmation — which had been shaping up to be one of the clearest triumphs of Trump’s tumultuous young presidency — was on the verge of going awry. \n \n Sen.

(Alex Wong/Getty Images) \n \n This account is based on interviews with 11 people familiar with the episode, some of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations. \n \n Trump was especially upset by what he viewed as Gorsuch’s insufficient gratitude for a lifetime appointment to the nation’s highest court, White House officials said. The judge sent the president a handwritten letter dated March 2, thanking him for the nomination and explaining how grateful he was, according to a copy obtained by The Washington Post. \n \n “Your address to Congress was magnificent,” Gorsuch wrote. “And you were so kind to recognize Mrs. Scalia, remember the justice, and mention me. My teenage daughters were cheering the TV!” \n \n The reference to “the justice” was to Antonin Scalia, the late justice whom Gorsuch replaced, and “Mrs. Scalia” is his widow, Maureen. \n \n Aides said Trump did not immediately receive the note, but it was retrieved by legislative affairs director Marc Short and then viewed by Trump on March 10, helping ease his concerns. \n \n “As head of legislative affairs, our team was in charge of his nomination, and never did I view his nomination in jeopardy, nor did the president ever suggest to me that he wanted to pull him,” Short said. “The process obviously caused frustration, but that frustration was compounded by the fact that Gorsuch had sent him a personal letter that he never received.” \n \n Gorsuch, through a spokeswoman, declined to comment. \n \n President Trump watches as Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch hugs his wife, Marie Louise, moments after Supreme Court Justice Anthony M. Kennedy administered the judicial oath in the Rose Garden of the White House on April 10. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) \n \n “The president’s nomination of Neil M. Gorsuch was among his first and most important accomplishments during his first year in office, and delivered on a major campaign promise,” White House spokesman Raj Shah said in a statement. “At no point did the president consider withdrawing Justice Gorsuch’s nomination. He is very proud of the accomplishment.” \n \n Advisers also told Trump that Gorsuch was trying to demonstrate the independence necessary to make it through the confirmation process and that pulling the nomination would have far-reaching repercussions and might infuriate supporters who were enthusiastic about the conservative jurist. \n \n In April, two months after Trump first expressed his ire, the Senate confirmed Gorsuch on a vote of 54 to 45. Trump and his allies promptly began boasting about the appointment as one of the president’s major achievements. \n \n The incident that so angered Trump came shortly after a federal judge had issued a nationwide stop to the president’s travel ban targeting a list of majority-Muslim countries. At the time, the president disparaged the “so-called judge” on Twitter, writing that the ruling “put our country in such peril.” \n \n “If something happens blame him and court system,” Trump wrote. “People pouring in. Bad!” \n \n Trump had additionally said that a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit that held oral arguments to review the judge’s order was “disgraceful” and that the judges cared more about politics than following the law. \n \n Gorsuch, meanwhile, was moving through the confirmation process, doing rounds of courtesy meetings with senators on Capitol Hill — including the one with Blumenthal, which quickly became news after the senator shared their private discussion with reporters. \n \n “I told him how abhorrent Donald Trump’s invective and insults are toward the judiciary,” Blumenthal told The Post in an interview. “And he said to me that he found them ‘disheartening’ and ‘demoralizing’ — his words.” \n \n Ron Bonjean, a member of the group guiding Gorsuch through the confirmation process, confirmed the account at the time. \n \n The remarks angered the president, who attacked Blumenthal on Twitter, saying the senator misrepresented Gorsuch’s comments. But at the time, at least, he also felt that Gorsuch himself was being disloyal. \n \n In a meeting with House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), Trump attacked the judge in sharp terms, surprising his fellow Republicans. \n \n “He’s probably going to end up being a liberal like the rest of them,” Trump told the Republican leaders, according to a person with knowledge of the comments. “You never know with these guys.” \n \n A senior White House official who was in the room during the meeting disputed that characterization, saying the president is concerned about the judicial outlook of all lifetime nominees. \n \n But McConnell was so concerned that he made a point of repeatedly telling Trump to stay the course on Gorsuch — and that he would make sure the judge made it through the confirmation process with as few hiccups as possible. \n \n “It’s clear [Trump] was very upset with the comment” by Gorsuch, said someone familiar with the incident, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive topic. \n \n The person added that he largely faults the White House for failing to adequately prepare Trump for Gorsuch’s comments and to explain that Supreme Court nominees asserting their independence from the president who appointed them was a natural part of a successful confirmation process. \n \n In fact, establishing Gorsuch’s independence from Trump was so important that it was the subject of the first question he was asked by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), a fervent Gorsuch supporter. “Tell us whether you’d have any trouble ruling against the president who appointed you,” Grassley said at the time. \n \n “That’s a softball, Mr. Chairman,” Gorsuch replied. “I have no difficulty ruling against or for any party, other than based on what the law and the facts and the particular case require. And I’m heartened by the support I have received from people who recognize that there’s no such thing as a Republican judge or a Democratic judge. We just have judges in this country.” \n \n Despite Trump’s early concerns, Gorsuch’s young tenure has given the president little reason to question his appointment to the Supreme Court. If anything, the justice — who has emerged as one of the court’s most conservative members — has been criticized for not distancing himself enough from both the president and the Republican Senate leaders who championed his nomination through the highly partisan confirmation process. \n \n Gorsuch traveled to Kentucky with McConnell to lecture at the senator’s two alma maters. One of his first public speeches was to a conservative scholarship organization that held its luncheon meeting at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, the subject of a lawsuit alleging that payments to Trump’s companies violate the Constitution’s emoluments clause. \n \n Gorsuch also was the featured speaker at the annual black-tie gala of the Federalist Society, which had recommended him to Trump for the Supreme Court, telling the cheering crowd that neither originalism nor textualism “is going anywhere on my watch.” \n \n In April, Trump bragged to the National Rifle Association that Gorsuch “is really something very special” and in June told the Faith and Freedom Coalition that no president had accomplished more in their first 100 days, citing Gorsuch as a key achievement. \n \n “I appointed and confirmed a Supreme Court justice in the mold of the late, great Antonin Scalia,” he said, “and now Justice Gorsuch has a seat on the United States Supreme Court.” \n \n In his March note to Trump, Gorsuch was similarly effusive. \n \n “The team you have assembled to assist me in the Senate is remarkable and inspiring,” he wrote. “I see daily their love of country and our Constitution, and know it is a tribute to you and your leadership for policy is always about personnel.” \n \n He concluded, “Congratulations again on such a great start.”']",2,"– Was the bloom at one point off the Neil Gorsuch rose? When President Trump first tapped the Supreme Court justice for the job earlier this year, he praised Gorsuch as being the ""best"" candidate for the job, and by many accounts, Gorsuch has since made good at carrying out the president's conservative agenda. And Trump has publicly touted Gorsuch as one of his main achievements so far—but privately things may have been quite different initially. Sources tell the Washington Post Trump was furious after hearing Gorsuch was slamming him in private meetings with lawmakers (specifically a February one with Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal) in response to the president's attacks on the judiciary. So furious, in fact, that Trump spoke of yanking his nomination of Gorsuch and finding someone else for the job, sources say. ""He's probably going to end up being a liberal like the rest of them,"" Trump reportedly told Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell during a meeting; a source says McConnell had to talk Trump down. Part of what fueled Trump's ""explosion"" was that Gorsuch didn't seem ""loyal"" and appeared ungrateful for the opportunity of a lifetime position on the Supreme Court, other sources note. What appears to have soothed Trump's nerves: a handwritten letter from Gorsuch, dated March 2 and seen by the Post, expressing his gratitude. ""Your address to Congress was magnificent,"" Gorsuch wrote. ""And you were so kind to ... mention me. My teenage daughters were cheering the TV!"" The White House is pushing back on the Post report. ""At no point did the president consider withdrawing Justice Gorsuch's nomination,"" a spokesman said in a statement. ""He is very proud of the accomplishment."""
179,"['“Ah, what a trifle is a heart, \n \n If once into love’s hands it come!” \n \n John Donne, The Broken Heart \n \n That line, and those of thousands of other poems and love songs, may have to be rewritten, according to Professor Alain Carpentier, the inventor of the world’s first fully artificial, self-regulating heart. \n \n His contraption is now beating inside the breast of a 75-year-old Frenchman. Controlled by a computer and made partly from chemically treated animal tissues, it is the culmination of a 30-year quest by Mr Carpentier, 80, for the “holy grail” of transplant surgery. \n \n Asked on Sunday to comment on his discovery, he quoted the celebrated 19th century French scientist Claude Bernard: “Whatever the poets may say, the heart is just a pump.” \n \n Mr Carpentier went on to add, however: “It’s a rather special kind of pump. If your loved one came through the door [and you had a Carpentier artificial heart], it would start to beat faster, just like a real one.” \n \n Other types of artificial heart have been constructed and fitted, with varying degrees of success, such as Robert Jarvik’s device first implanted in 1982. Mr Carpentier’s invention is claimed to be the first to be completely artificial and self-regulating. It was constructed by a French medical engineering company, Carmat, and transplanted into a patient by two surgeons at a Paris hospital in a 10-hour operation last Wednesday. \n \n The operation, leaked to the French press before it was to be officially announced this week, is reported to have gone well. The patient was said to have been “near death, without any other alternative available” but is now responding well. \n \n Mr Carpentier hopes his artificial heart, powered by replaceable batteries carried outside the body, will help to solve the chronic shortage of hearts for transplant surgery. Unlike a real donor heart, it should not provoke rejection by the host. \n \n The Carpentier heart weighs 900g, is roughly the same size as a real heart and imitates its functions exactly. Electrical sensors and microprocessors monitor the demands of the body for blood and adjust the operation of the heart accordingly. \n \n In an interview on Sunday with the Journal du Dimanche, Professor Carpentier said he began his work on artificial hearts three decades ago. “I was confronted with a painful situation,” he said. “I was a doctor with a patient who was about to die from a defective heart when there was no transplant available.” \n \n Mr Carpentier initially developed artificial heart valves made from chemically treated animal tissues. “I then decided to try to create an entire heart with these same materials,” he said. \n \n The cost of a Carpentier artificial heart is estimated at £100,000 to £135,000 – about the same as the overall cost of providing a transplanted heart from an accident victim. The present model is the right size for 70 per cent of men and 25 per cent of women, but Mr Carpentier is developing a smaller version.', 'NEW YORK, NY — Rhode Island’s Department of Health says that sexually transmitted diseases are way up in the state, in part because of the increase of hookup apps like Tinder. \n \n Between 2013 and 2014, cases of syphilis grew by 79%. HIV infections were up 33% and gonorrhea cases increased by 30%. STD cases for young adults are growing at a faster rate than the rest of the population. \n \n Rhode Island says the recent uptick in STD cases follows a national trend. The state’s health department blamed “high-risk behaviors that have become more common in recent years,” including “using social media to arrange casual and often anonymous sexual encounters.” \n \n A spokesman for Tinder did not respond to a request for comment. \n \n Social media and online hookup apps have been blamed for a rise in STDs in the past. \n \n A 2013 New York University study found that Craigslist was responsible for a 16% increase in HIV cases between 1999 and 2008 across 33 states. Grinder, a hookup app for gay men, was associated with more than half of all syphilis cases in New Zealand in 2012, according to Christchurch Sexual Health Clinic. \n \n “These new data underscore the importance of encouraging young people to begin talking to a doctor, nurse, or health educator about sexual health,” said Rosemary Reilly-Chammat, an HIV/AIDS sexuality specialist for the Rhode Island Department of Education, in a press release.']",2,"– Alain Carpentier thinks he has an answer to chronic shortages of organ donors. The French cardiac surgeon—under Carmat, the French company he founded—has invented what the Independent calls the ""world's first fully artificial, self-regulating heart,"" and it apparently works, at least very initially. Carpentier's creation was successfully transplanted into a 75-year-old on Wednesday; he's said to be responding favorably. If you're wondering why it deserves the label ""first,"" especially considering Robert Jarvik's artificial heart was first implanted in 1982, Carpentier, 80, explains that his is the first heart to self-regulate, mimicking an actual heart. ""If your loved one came through the door [and you had a Carpentier artificial heart], it would start to beat faster, just like a real one,"" he says. Further, surfaces that are exposed to human blood are made in part from cow tissue, rather than synthetic material, which can produce blood clots and therefore require the use of anticoagulants; its design also minimizes the chance of rejection, reports the Financial Times. Most importantly, it's designed to sidestep the need for a donor heart: Reuters reports the current model, powered by external lithium batteries, is expected to keep a patient alive for up to five years. The heart was three decades in the making, and the end result is similar in size to a real heart, though it weighs three times more (at nearly 2 pounds) and isn't sized correctly for all—about 86% of men but only 20% of women, reports Reuters (a smaller model is planned). The expected cost is $190,000 to $220,000, on par with the cost of a traditional heart transplant. The Carmat heart has been approved for testing in three more French patients; the initial trial seeks to determine whether the patients can survive at least one month.

182,"['Associated Press Tue Feb 19, 2013 7:44 PM \n \n Arizona took center stage in the national immigration debate Tuesday as Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano toured the state’s border with Mexico and Sen. John McCain defended his proposed immigration overhaul to an angry crowd in suburban Phoenix. \n \n The presence of the top officials is the latest sign that Arizona will play a prominent role in the immigration debate as President Barack Obama looks to make it a signature issue of his second term. \n \n Napolitano toured the border near Nogales with the highest-ranking official at U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the incoming chairman of the Senate’s homeland security committee and an Arizona congressman. Napolitano, Arizona’s former governor, said afterward that comprehensive immigration reform will strengthen the nation’s border against criminals and other threats. \n \n Also Tuesday, McCain hosted two town hall meetings in Arizona, during which he defended his immigration plan to upset residents concerned about border security. A bipartisan group of senators — including Arizona Republicans McCain and Jeff Flake — want assurances on border security as Congress weighs what could be the biggest changes to immigration law in nearly 30 years. Arizona is the only state with both of its senators working on immigration reform in Congress, a sign of the state’s widely debated border security issues. \n \n Immigration activists and elected officials say it’s only natural for Arizona to continue to take the forefront in the national conversation on immigration after years of internal debate on how to handle scores of immigrants. \n \n “No state in this country has had more experience with enforcement-only immigration laws than Arizona,” said Todd Landfried, executive director of Arizona Employers for Immigration Reform, which opposes the state’s tough immigration laws. \n \n During a heated town hall gathering in the Phoenix suburb of Sun Lakes, McCain said the border near Yuma is largely secure, but said smugglers are using the border near Tucson to pump drugs into Phoenix. He said immigration reform should be contingent on better border security that must rely largely on technology able to detect border crossings. \n \n He said a tamper-proof Social Security card would help combat identity fraud, and noted any path to citizenship must require immigrants to learn English, cover back taxes and pay fines for breaking immigration laws. \n \n “There are 11 million people living here illegally,” McCain said. “We are not going to get enough buses to deport them.” \n \n Some audience members shouted out their disapproval. \n \n One man yelled that only guns would discourage illegal immigration. Another man complained that illegal immigrants should never be able to become citizens or vote. A third man said illegal immigrants were illiterate invaders who wanted free government benefits. \n \n McCain urged compassion. “We are a Judeo-Christian nation,” he said. McCain’s other town hall meeting took place in Green Valley, south of Tucson. \n \n Arizona gained international recognition as an epicenter of the U.S. immigration debate when it passed its tough anti-immigrant law in 2010. A handful of other states — including Georgia, Indiana, South Carolina and Utah — have since adopted variations of Arizona’s law. \n \n Arizona has the nation’s eighth-highest population of illegal immigrants, according to the Pew Research Hispanic Center. In 2010, illegal immigrants represented roughly 6 percent of the state’s population. \n \n Activists said Arizona’s anti-immigrant laws inspired many illegal immigrants to demand more rights.

(Associated Press) \n \n The presence of the top officials is the latest sign that Arizona will play a prominent role in the immigration debate as President Barack Obama looks to make it a signature issue of his second term. \n \n Napolitano toured the border near Nogales with the highest-ranking official at U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the incoming chairman of the Senate\'s homeland security committee and an Arizona congressman. Napolitano, a former Arizona governor, said afterward that comprehensive immigration reform will strengthen the U.S. border against criminals and other threats. \n \n Also Tuesday, McCain hosted two town hall meetings in Arizona, during which he defended his immigration plan to angry residents concerned about border security. A bipartisan group of senators _ including Arizona Republicans McCain and Jeff Flake _ want assurances on border security as Congress weighs what could be the biggest changes to immigration law in nearly 30 years. Arizona is the only state with both of its senators working on immigration reform in Congress, a sign of the state\'s widely debated border security issues. \n \n Immigration activists and elected officials say it\'s only natural for Arizona to continue to be in the forefront in the national conversation on immigration after years of internal debate on how to handle the huge influx of illegal immigrants. Arizona gained international recognition as an epicenter of the U.S. immigration debate when it passed its tough anti-immigrant law in 2010. A handful of other states _ including Alabama, Indiana, Georgia, South Carolina and Utah _ have since adopted variations of Arizona\'s law. \n \n ""No state in this country has had more experience with enforcement-only immigration laws than Arizona,"" said Todd Landfried, executive director of Arizona Employers for Immigration Reform, which opposes the state\'s tough immigration laws. \n \n During a heated town hall gathering in the Phoenix suburb of Sun Lakes, McCain said the border near Yuma is largely secure, but said smugglers are using the border near Tucson to pump drugs into Phoenix. He said immigration reform should be contingent on better border security that must rely largely on technology able to detect border crossings. \n \n McCain said a tamper-proof Social Security card would help combat identity fraud, and noted any path to citizenship must require immigrants to learn English, cover back taxes and pay fines for breaking immigration laws. \n \n ""There are 11 million people living here illegally,"" he said. ""We are not going to get enough buses to deport them."" \n \n Some audience members shouted out their disapproval. \n \n One man yelled that only guns would discourage illegal immigration. Another man complained that illegal immigrants should never be able to become citizens or vote. A third man said illegal immigrants were illiterate invaders who wanted free government benefits. \n \n McCain urged compassion. ""We are a Judeo-Christian nation,"" he said. McCain\'s other town hall meeting took place in Green Valley, south of Tucson. \n \n Arizona has the nation\'s eighth-highest population of illegal immigrants, according to the Pew Research Hispanic Center. In 2010, illegal immigrants represented roughly 6 percent of the state\'s population. \n \n Activists said Arizona\'s anti-immigrant laws inspired many illegal immigrants to demand more rights. Last week, some college students rallied outside Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer\'s office for driver\'s licenses for illegal immigrants. \n \n ""They no longer are afraid to come and say, `I am not able to vote, but I can make my voice heard, and they have to listen to me,\'"" said community organizer Abril Gallardo. \n \n A report released in January showed the U.S. Border Patrol\'s Tucson sector remains the busiest along the U.S.-Mexico border.

183,"['More than 2,000 people are currently watching a livestream from a webcam located at a traffic intersection in the small town of Jackson Hole, Wyoming – and nobody knows why, least of all the viewers themselves. \n \n The live feed was set up about six weeks ago as part of a drive to draw more visitors to the town, a popular tourist retreat for outdoorsy types, at the base of the Teton Mountains close to Teton National Park. \n \n The town set up several webcams, but while the scenic vista at Spring Creek had just one viewer – me – at the time of writing, thousands have been tuning in to the town square crossroads since Sunday, for no apparent reason. \n \n Reports suggest the surge in viewer traffic began when a user on the web bulletin board 4chan posted a link to the feed and said he would travel to Jackson Hole to do something in front of the camera. \n \n Users on Reddit spread the now-deleted post, which got hundreds watching the video, at which point it ended up on YouTube’s homepage due to its growing popularity. At this point, many people appear to be watching as part of a collective absurdist joke. \n \n \n \n \n \n The fast-scrolling comments on the video consist mostly of observations as to the vehicles passing through the intersection: bus, coach, truck and so on.

Our research suggests that the flake is the earliest securely-dated artefact from Turkey ever recorded and was dropped on the floodplain by an early hominin well over a million years ago."" \n \n The researchers used high-precision radioisotopic dating and palaeomagnetic measurements from lava flows, which both pre-date and post-date the meander, to establish that early humans were present in the area between approximately 1.24 million and 1.17 million years ago. Previously, the oldest hominin fossils in western Turkey were recovered in 2007 at Koçabas, but the dating of these and other stone tool finds were uncertain. \n \n ""The flake was an incredibly exciting find"", Professor Schreve said. ""I had been studying the sediments in the meander bend and my eye was drawn to a pinkish stone on the surface. When I turned it over for a better look, the features of a humanly-struck artefact were immediately apparent. \n \n ""By working together with geologists and dating specialists, we have been able to put a secure chronology to this find and shed new light on the behaviour of our most distant ancestors."" \n \n ###']",2,"– Could a livestream of a street in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, replace cat videos as the latest online time waste?

184,"[""Russian President Vladimir Putin has just imposed harsh new security measures around the resort town of Sochi, home to the 2014 Winter Olympics Games. The measures, which went largely unnoticed outside of Russia, may be the most extreme ever placed on an Olympic city. But as Putin attempts to present an image of stability, progress and prosperity to the rest of the world, his enemies are now accusing him of planning a gulag-style restricted area in and around Sochi. \n \n Our web monitoring of Russian-language internet traffic revealed that the accusers are anti-Russian Islamic insurgents in the North Caucasus, a restive region not far from Sochi. The rebels, who have a bloody history of terror attacks, have long made clear their intentions to target the Olympics. \n \n unprecedented compared to what? Since the mid-1980s, the Olympics have always been held in democratic countries--save for the 2008 Olympics in China. Those Olympics were previously the most extreme in their implementation of population control and security measures. Our research shows that the Sochi measures will be even more intense. \n \n The Kavkaz Center, a rebel news outlet, is now decrying the presidential decree that Putin signed on Monday, which will institute the stringent new security measures in Sochi beginning Jan. 7 and going until March 21, 2014. It creates a restricted zone of up to 80 miles around the city, and blocks road entry into the area for everyone except registered residents, emergency vehicles, railway passengers and those traveling with special government permission. That leaves train and air travel as the only viable modes of transport, which will allow the security services to strictly scrutinize the belongings and identities of incoming travelers. Since the Olympics take place between Feb. 7 and Feb. 23, that means the city will be on virtual lockdown for months simply for the sake of a two week sporting event. \n \n how we know We continually monitor postings from Kavkaz Center. While the site clearly supports terrorist groups such as the Caucasus Emirate, they often present correct facts, but add in commentary clearly slanted toward sympathy for jihadi causes. Their calling the security situation around Sochi unprecedented-though hyped up to win a propaganda victory against Russia-is actually a valid point. \n \n As part of the new measures, Putin also banned public protests and marches unrelated to the Olympics within the area. So protesting about gay rights certainly seems out of the question. Athletes won’t even be allowed to paint their fingernails in solidarity with their gay and lesbian counterparts. The Sochi protest prohibition comes on the heels of a country-wide law, passed last summer, that introduced fines of up to $10,000 or two years in prison for participating in a spontaneous demonstration. The alternative, applying for permission to assemble, can be rejected for any reason by the government. \n \n Who Runs Kavkaz Center? The site was created by Movladi Udugov, the Deputy Prime Minister and head propagandist for the former Chechen Republic of Ichkeria. Currently, he uses the site as part of information campaign to support the Caucasus Emirate and other pan-Islamic jihadi causes. \n \n The Kavkaz Center’s accusation that Putin is tightening a Stalin-like grip on Sochi (where Stalin famously had a dacha, or vacation home) is sure to stir the pot among the Islamic insurgency’s followers. The Center is considered an influential information source among Islamists, and we used specialized software to examine who follows its social media pages. Besides 8,000 Twitter followers, they have Facebook followers ranging from young women in Macedonia and Austria to men from France and the Republic of Georgia. \n \n To dig deeper about public opinion, we used specialized software to analyze Russian social media posts following the announcement of the restricted zone in Sochi. Here are some results: \n \n Доку Умаров пообещал аллахакбар в 2014 в Сочи. Если что-то взорвут – через год население С. Кавказа будет состоять лишь из российских солдат — Степан Грозный (@faraday_m) August 20, 2013 \n \n “Doku Umarov promised an Allahuakbar in 2014 in Sochi. If they blow something up—in a year the population of the North Caucasus will consist only of Russian soldiers.” \n \n Doku Umarov is the leader of the Caucasus Emirate terrorist group, which has threatened to attack the Games. \n \n Another social media user posts a link to an article about the vast security apparatus that Putin is employing. \n \n 40 тысяч полицейских будут обеспечивать безопасность на зимней Олимпиаде 2014 в Сочи http://t.co/bTrhekhNf7 — Новости Ставрополья (@bzfrmt_stav) August 20, 2013 \n \n “40 thousand policemen will provide security for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi.” \n \n That number is staggering when you consider that during the 2012 London Olympics, the British deployed only 20,000 soldiers and policemen, and the event was located in a much larger city. \n \n While some worry about Olympic terror attacks, the Russian propaganda machine keeps churning out positivity both on Facebook and its Russian equivalent, VKontakte. \n \n Expect nothing less You'll only hear positive news about Sochi coming from official Russian sources, who will continue to paint a rosy picture despite a myriad of shocking abuses that Vocativ has reported on. The international reputation of the Russian government, as well as President Putin's personal prestige, depends on the Games going off without a hitch. \n \n Using the official kids’ outreach Facebook page, “Mascots of the Olympic Games Sochi 2014,” the government published the cuddly image below. \n \n The description explains that the Olympic mascots are the best company for travel to the mountains. Although the new restrictions make this happy, stuffed-animal friendly scenario unlikely. \n \n The official VKontakte page, “Sochi Games 2014,” published the following image. \n \n From the above post, which says “200 days until the Paralympics in Sochi,” it seems that the Russian government is already getting amped about the next event in the sub-tropical city. (The Paralympics will take place in Sochi in March.) Paradise, it seems, can only be preserved by barbed wire."", 'Putin has spent $2 billion to keep the Winter Games safe from terrorist attacks like those in Volgograd last month. But even if Sochi is safe, Russia may not be. \n \n Why the new health-care bill may keep affordable care out of reach for some \n \n Russian President Vladimir Putin takes part in a friendly hockey match at The Bolshoy Ice Dome in Sochi, Russia, on Saturday. With the Olympics Games just a month away, Mr. Putin faces a difficult balancing act of both improving his international reputation and cracking down on terrorism after last month\'s bombings in Volgograd. \n \n With just one month to go before the Sochi Olympics open, Russia is launching the biggest security operation in Olympic history in a tense and largely secret effort to thwart an invisible enemy who has sworn to do everything possible to blight the prestigious international event with acts of mass terror. \n \n President Vladimir Putin traveled to Sochi last week to inspect the Olympic venue\'s $2 billion ""ring of steel"" defenses, which are to go into full operation tomorrow, exactly a month before the Games begin. Earlier he visited Volgograd, where two suicide bombings killed 34 people just before the New Year, and pledged additional measures to fight the terrorists until their ""complete annihilation."" \n \n He has won some support from the international community. In recent days announcements by US Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and British Prime Minister David Cameron have promised unspecified but deeper and more effective security cooperation with Russia in the run-up to the Olympics. ""We both want the Sochi Games to be a safe and secure Games,"" Mr. Cameron told journalists after a telephone conversation with Mr. Putin last Friday. \n \n Sochi\'s ""ring of steel"" is a zone about 60 miles long and 25 miles deep, in which the local population and visitors will be subjected to near total surveillance. The measures, according to security expert Mark Galeotti, include a garrison of about 25,000 special police, 8,000 interior troops, unknown numbers of plainclothes agents, special forces such as the ""Alpha"" anti-terrorist squad of the FSB (the successor to the KGB), and up to 30,000 regular troops to patrol the nearby borders with Georgia and the breakaway Georgian republic of Abkhazia. The skies will be full of Russian Air Force fighters and at least a dozen drones; ultra-modern S-400 and Pantsir-S anti-aircraft missiles capable of taking down any airborne threat will be deployed around the zone; and four of the Russian Navy\'s new Grachonok anti-saboteur patrol boats with teams of divers and special sonar equipment will range up and down the coast. \n \n Putin\'s gamble \n \n The stakes are high for Putin, who has invested Russia\'s prestige and $51 billion of mostly state cash in hosting the Winter Olympics. \n \n ""Putin\'s personal image is closely connected to the outcome of these Games. So I am absolutely sure that whatever can be done, will be done,"" says Gennady Gudkov, a former KGB security expert and ex-Duma deputy. \n \n It\'s not only Putin\'s international reputation that hangs in the balance. His domestic popularity rests largely on his image as a tough and uncompromising slayer of terrorists. \n \n He arrived in power in autumn 1999 amid a wave of deadly apartment bombings that killed hundreds, and used the public panic over the acts to launch a fresh war against Chechen militants, re-impose strong central government, and greatly beef up Russian security services. Since then, as both president and prime minister, Putin has faced intermittent waves of terrorism which he has often turned to his own advantage. For example, he seized upon the horrific 2004 school siege at Beslan to abolish local elections and further ratchet up the powers of security forces. \n \n But a long lull in serious terrorist attacks against Russia\'s heartland has been shattered by the Volgograd bombings, and in the nail-biting tensions of the coming weeks and months, Russians will be expecting him to ensure their security. \n \n ""This is Putin\'s basic promise to Russians, that he will make us safe,"" says Andrei Piontkovsky, a veteran Kremlin critic. \n \n ""If we look back over the past 15 years, we can see that he never really kept that pledge. We\'ve been hit over and over again,"" he says. ""But because of the Olympics, the whole world is watching. It may be that the extraordinary concentration of security resources in Sochi means that city is safe, but what about the rest of the country? Even Moscow? If terrorists strike anywhere, it will seriously undermine faith in Putin."" \n \n Finding balance \n \n Putin has taken several steps to restore world confidence in the Sochi Olympics, especially after President Barack Obama decided last month that neither he nor any other top US official would be attending the Games. Late last month, the Kremlin amnestied thousands of prisoners, including many of those regarded as ""political"" in the West. In Sochi last week, he relaxed a ban on all protests at the Games and designated a special area where demonstrations may be held with official permission. \n \n But keeping the Olympics safe – and without suffocating them in omnipresent security measures – is his greatest challenge, say experts. \n \n ""One of the purposes of terrorists is to sow uncertainty, ill temper, and chaos,"" says Alexei Makarkin, deputy director of the independent Center for Political Technologies in Moscow. \n \n ""The other side of that coin is the excessive tightening of security measures. This can pose big problems for athletes and spectators. How to secure the Games without creating onerous difficulties for fans – to make the event controllable and calm at the same time – is the biggest issue here. If the balance tips either way, the Games risk being a failure,"" he says. \n \n Unseen dangers? \n \n Some experts warn that in Russia, where a seething North Caucasus Islamic insurgency has been marked by shifting allegiances, and security services have been accused of murky dealings with terrorist networks, there may be unseen dangers ahead. \n \n Most reports focus on Chechen Islamist warlord Doku Umarov, who is presumably holed up somewhere in the rugged Caucasus Mountains, as the main threat. But Nikolai Petrov, a leading expert on Russia\'s regional politics and a professor at Moscow\'s Higher School of Economics, suggests that other forces, including members of pro-Moscow Chechen strongman Ramzan Kadyrov\'s retinue and rogue elements of Russia\'s own security services, may have a strong interest in aiding and abetting more acts of terrorism. \n \n ""When we examine these recent Volgograd attacks, it\'s hard not to notice how well planned and well organized they were. They seem to have enjoyed a lot of logistical help,"" he says. ""Kadyrov may have pacified Chechnya, but his funding from Moscow has been falling lately, and he may not expect to be given such a free hand in Chechnya after the Olympics are over. Some officials in the security forces have interests in private companies that provide security for airports and other transport infrastructure, and there are huge profits to be made in this field."" \n \n ""Terrorism has become a big business, and there are people with a real, material interest in keeping it going,"" Mr. Petrov adds. ""I know how strange this may sound. But we have seen such things before in Russia, and nothing should be taken for granted here.""']",2,"– An ominous new report on Vocativ says the Sochi Olympics may be the most extreme, security-wise, in the history of the Games—the site describes ""a gulag-style restricted area"" instituted by Vladimir Putin. The Christian Science Monitor calls the restricted zone the ""ring of steel,"" an area 60 miles wide and 25 miles deep that will be patrolled by tens of thousands of security troops and in which everyone ""will be subjected to near total surveillance."" Air Force fighters, drones, anti-aircraft missiles, and anti-saboteur patrol boats will be deployed. Travel in and out of the city will be restricted; public protests and marches will be banned. But the most ominous part: According to the Monitor, some worry that even these measures may not be enough. The biggest potential threat appears to be the North Caucasus Islamic insurgency and Chechen Islamist warlord Doku Umarov, leader of the Caucasus Emirate terrorist group, who has promised an attack at the Games. But there are others, experts warn, who are similarly interested in terrorizing Sochi. ""When we examine these recent Volgograd attacks, it's hard not to notice how well planned and well organized they were. They seem to have enjoyed a lot of logistical help,"" says one expert. ""Terrorism has become a big business, and there are people with a real, material interest in keeping it going."" A rebel news outlet has been decrying Putin's security measures, Vocativ reports, noting that the lockdown starts today—a month before the Games start—and lasts until March 21, nearly a month after they end."

(AP) — Bernie Sanders and John Kasich picked up the most votes as the first ballots of the first-in-the-nation primary were cast early Tuesday. \n \n Sanders won over all four Democratic voters in the tiny town of Dixville, while Kasich sneaked past Donald Trump, 3-2, among Republicans. \n \n Under New Hampshire state law, communities with fewer than 100 voters can get permission to open their polls at midnight and close them as soon as all registered voters have cast their ballots. While that happened in three locations, Dixville traditionally gets most of the spotlight due to its media-friendly setup at the Balsams Grand Resort Hotel. \n \n Located about 20 miles from the Canadian border, Dixville exists as a town only for voting purposes. Almost all of its nine voters are employees of the hotel, which closed in 2011 but is currently undergoing a major overhaul under new owners. \n \n Former owner Neil Tillotson started the midnight voting tradition in 1960, likely at the suggestion of a news photographer looking for an advantage in getting his pictures out to newspapers ahead of his rivals. For many years, voters cast their ballots in individual booths in the hotel's posh ballot room. Because of the renovations, the nine current residents voted in another building on the property, the Hale House. \n \n In 2012, there was a tie for first place on the Republican side, with Mitt Romney and Jon Huntsman getting two votes apiece. All three Democrats voted for Obama. \n \n Hart's Location, about 80 miles south of Dixville, first hosted midnight voting in 1948 but gave it up after the 1964 election when residents grew weary of the late hours and media frenzy every four years. Energized with new blood, town residents revived the tradition in 1996, and this year, the town has 41 registered voters. \n \n Millsfield is also making a comeback this year, though it's unclear just when the town last voted at midnight or when its tradition started. According to a 1952 article in Time magazine, eight residents voted at midnight during the general election that year.

The confinement was billed as a memorial to victims of totalitarian violence and British colonialism in Australia, notes ABC News Australia, but many assumed it was about local Aboriginal Tasmanian history being buried—particularly the 19th-century Black War in which British settlers nearly wiped out Indigenous Tasmanians.

186,"['James Cook University scientists have helped invent a clever technique to tell black leopards apart - a trick that may end up saving their skins. \n \n Scientists from JCU in Australia and others have been studying the leopards on the Malay Peninsula - where almost all of the big cats are jet black. \n \n Experts have no idea why the leopards are black and, until recently, could not tell them apart, hindering research and conservation efforts. \n \n But researchers have now devised a simple method to solve the problem by manipulating the mechanism of automatic cameras. \n \n ""Most automatic cameras have an infrared flash, but it\'s only activated at night"", said Dr Gopalasamy Reuben Clements from JCU. ""However, by blocking the camera\'s light sensor, we can fool the camera into thinking it\'s night even during the day, so it always flashes."" \n \n With the infrared flash firing, the seemingly black leopards suddenly showed complex patterns of spotting. These spots could be used to distinguish different animals, and help estimate the population size of the species. \n \n The researchers tested this method in the north east of Peninsular Malaysia. ""We found we could accurately identify 94% of the animals,"" said Dr Clements, who also works with a local research institute from Universiti Malaysia Terengganu. ""This will allow us to study and monitor this population over time, which is critical for its conservation."" \n \n The researchers want to use their new method to study black leopards in other parts of Peninsular Malaysia where there is abundant prey but few leopards to be seen. It\'s thought widespread poaching is to blame. \n \n ""Many dead leopards bearing injuries inflicted by wire snares have been discovered in Malaysia,"" said Distinguished Professor William Laurance from James Cook University. He said that leopard skins and body parts are increasingly showing up in wildlife trading markets in places such as on the Myanmar-China border. \n \n At the same time, suitable leopard habitats are disappearing faster in Malaysia than perhaps anywhere else in the world, as forests are felled for timber and replaced with oil palm and rubber plantations. \n \n ""Understanding how leopards are faring in an increasingly human-dominated world is vital,"" said Laurie Hedges from the University of Nottingham - Malaysia, lead author of a study on the cats just published in Journal of Wildlife Management. ""This new approach gives us a novel tool to help save this unique and endangered animal."" \n \n Leopards, found from the frozen forests of Russia to the scorching sands of the Kalahari Desert, are the most widely distributed large cat on earth. Their iconic spotted coat has been admired and coveted by humans for millennia. \n \n The black leopards of Peninsular Malaysia are extremely rare. ""This is perhaps the only known example of a wild mammal with virtually an entire population composed of black individuals,"" said Laurie Hedges. \n \n Black coloration--also known as \'melanism\'--is found in some mammal species, especially big cats, where individuals that normally have patterns or colours in their coat are instead completely black. However, scientists have no idea why it predominates in the Malay Peninsula. \n \n ###', 'A magnitude 4.4 earthquake rattled Southern California on Tuesday night.

The rare leopards, an endangered species living on the Malay Peninsula, have been hard to identify because each one appeared the same—until now. The researchers discovered that the big cats actually have complex designs of spotting when viewed through an infrared flash, according to a press release. ""Most automatic cameras have an infrared flash, but it's only activated at night,"" says a researcher on the project. ""However, by blocking the camera's light sensor, we can fool the camera into thinking it's night even during the day, so it always flashes."" The spots make it easier for humans to identify and track black leopards, which should save more leopard lives. ""Understanding how leopards are faring in an increasingly human-dominated world is vital,"" says lead author Laurie Hedges. Few leopards actually live on the Malay Peninsula, perhaps due to poaching, while wire snares are killing them and wildlife markets are selling leopard body parts and skins. The rapid elimination of Malaysian forests is also depriving leopards of suitable habitats. The black panther—or leopard in Asia and Africa—has long had a ""mythical aura"" dating back to Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book and Stan Lee's creation of the Black Panther superhero, Mongabay.com reports. Another neat fact: The black leopard is ""perhaps the only known example of a wild mammal with virtually an entire population composed of black individuals,"" says Hedges.

188,"['Spider-Man made his way into a Supreme Court decision today. In a case pitting inventor Stephen Kimble against Marvel Entertainment over an expired toy patent, the Court ruled to uphold a 50-year-old patent ruling that let the comics company stop sending royalty payments to Kimble — and they had a little bit of fun in reaching their decision. \n \n In law, with great power must come great responsibility \n \n Kimble v. Marvel Entertainment concerned Kimble\'s webshooter invention, a glove that shot foam string from its palm much like Spider-Man, which he patented in 1991. Marvel purchased the patent in 1997, and agreed to pay Kimble in royalties indefinitely. However, after discovering the 1964 Supreme Court decision Brulotte v. Thys, which determined that royalties need not be paid after a patent expires, the company stopped paying Kimble in 2010. Kimble thus sued Marvel, and brought the case to the Supreme Court late last year. \n \n However, the highest court in the land ruled in favor of Marvel, stating that Kimble\'s arguments to view his patent in light of modern competition law were overall invalid. However, Justice Elena Kagan peppered the Court\'s decision with a few fun references to superpowers, the \'60s Spider-Man animated series, and one of comics\' most famous adages: \n \n Justice Samuel Alito, who offered the dissenting opinion, failed to say ""It\'s Clobberin\' Time"" when arguing to overturn the Brulotte decision.

Kagan, a huge fan of comic books, decided to have some fun with the topic, weaving Spider-Man references throughout her opinion.

But when it uncovered a 1964 Supreme Court decision that found royalties could cease once a patent expired, Marvel in 2010 halted payments. It's a ruling that's perhaps garnering more headlines than usual, thanks to the number of comic-book jokes Elena Kagan incorporated into the opinion she wrote for the court.

190,"['Being bullied as a child can result in long-lasting psychological scars for both boys and girls, according to a U.S. study. \n \n Reviewing more than two decades of data, the researchers found that bullied children, regardless of their sex, face an elevated risk of developing anxiety disorders, depression and suicidal thoughts in later years. \n \n “We were surprised at how profoundly bullying affects a person’s long-term functioning,” the lead researcher, William Copeland, a clinical psychologist and epidemiologist at Duke University in Durham, N.C., said in a statement. \n \n “This psychological damage doesn’t just go away because a person grew up and is no longer bullied. This is something that stays with them. If we can address this now, we can prevent a whole host of problems down the road.” \n \n An earlier study, carried out in Finland, came to slightly different conclusions. Bullied boys seem to suffer few long-term problems, but the girls showed evidence of lasting psychological harm. The Finnish study relied on health-system data, but did not have access to individual case histories. \n \n The U.S. researchers said their new study, published Wednesday in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, is “most definitive to date in establishing the long-term psychological effects of bullying.” \n \n They said they used “a much richer data set” than the Finnish researchers. In particular, the analysis is based on a sample of 1,420 children from North Carolina. At the time of recruitment into the study, the kids were either 9, 11 or 13 years of age. The children and their parents, or caregivers, were interviewed each year until the youngsters turned 16, and then periodically thereafter. At each assessment, they were asked if the kids had been bullied in the preceding months, or had bullied others. \n \n A total of 421 participants reported being bullied at least once. And 198 youngsters admitted bullying others: 112 were bullies only, while 86 were both bullies and victims. \n \n Of the original 1,420 children, about 1,270 were followed into adulthood. \n \n “Those who said they had been bullied, plus those who were both victims and aggressors, were at higher risk for psychiatric disorders compared with those with no history of being bullied. The young people who were only victims had higher levels of depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, generalized anxiety, panic disorder and agoraphobia,” according to the study. \n \n What’s more, the study found that those who had been bullies were at increased risk of antisocial personality disorders.', 'Besides age, the biggest risk factor for developing Alzheimer’s disease is having a parent or other first-degree relative with the condition. A new study adds to growing evidence that inheriting it from your mother is much worse than inheriting it from your father.Researchers at the University of Kansas School of Medicine recruited 21 adult children (age 63 to 83) of Alzheimer’s patients who were still “cognitively intact.” They examined their brains using an MRI scanner on two occasions, two years apart. Then they compared those brain scans with those of 32 other healthy adults in the same age group with no family history of Alzheimer’s. Members of both groups had similar levels of education and cognitive performance.Though none of the subjects exhibited any outward signs of dementia, the brain scans revealed that the 11 people whose mothers had Alzheimer’s had lost significantly more gray matter over the 2-year period than the 10 people whose fathers had the disease and compared with the 32 people with two healthy parents. That cell loss was especially pronounced in two areas of the brain – the left precuneus (which plays a role in episodic memory, among other functions) and the left parahippocampas gyrus (which is involved in encoding and retrieving memories).Other regions that took a hit were “the anterior cingulate, the bilateral middle temporal gyrus, the right hippocampus, right precuneus, and posterior cingulate,” according to a study in the March 1 edition of the journal Neurology The brains of those whose fathers had Alzheimer’s disease were essentially the same as those of subjects with no family history. Only having a mother with the disease appeared to influence the degree of brain atrophy.The researchers said they don’t know why Alzheimer’s appears to be more aggressive when inherited from one’s mother instead of one’s father. Perhaps it’s related to mitochondrial DNA , which is inherited only from one’s mother and which may be responsible for faulty glucose metabolism in brain tissue affected by Alzheimer’s, they wrote.']",2,"– Bullied kids are at greater risk of a range of psychological problems years later, a study suggests.

And that applies to both sexes, the study finds, challenging earlier research that suggested the long-term toll was more pronounced among girls. This study referred to ""a much richer data set,"" researchers say. ""We were actually able to say being a victim of bullying is having an effect a decade later."" Children in North Carolina joined the study at age nine, 11, or 13. Researchers collected data by interviewing the kids and their parents, following 1,270 of them into adulthood, the Globe and Mail reports. Victims had ""higher levels of depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, generalized anxiety, panic disorder, and agoraphobia,"" the study says.

Despite that knowledge, defendants continue to sell the XM15-E52 rifle to the civilian market.” \n \n In making the case against any civilian sales of AR-15s, the plaintiffs say—among other things—“there is not a single state that requires a mental-health examination of a potential purchaser of an AR-15” or to “answer questions about other individuals with whom they intend to share access.” \n \n The reference is unmistakably to Nancy Lanza, who purchased the AR-15 that her son would use to massacre 20 first-grade students and six adults before taking his own life. \n \n Under the title “The Road to Sandy Hook,” the lawsuit painstakingly details the use of the AR-15 in other mass shootings, including those at schools. Yet Bushmaster continued to market the AR-15 as a weapon that would make others “bow down” and kept selling high-capacity magazines with it. \n \n After recounting the individual lives taken by Lanza and his Bushmaster AR-15, the lawsuit says the defendants “knew, or should have known” that the sale of the AR-15 “posed an unreasonable and egregious risk of physical injury to others.” In addition, it should’ve known it would’ve been used in a mass shooting to inflict maximum casualties. \n \n The families created estates in their childrens’ names (with parents as administrators) so they could sue on behalf of the victims.

Some 95 incidents, including fatal and nonfatal assaults, suicides and unintentional shootings have taken place across 33 states since Newtown, according to Everytown for Gun Safety, a group created by the merger of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, founded by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, a group founded after the attack. \n \n ""It\'s astounding,"" said Shannon Watts, who founded the Moms group. ""There is no other developed country that would tolerate this kind of gun violence around school age children."" \n \n Gun-rights advocates note that the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protects the right to bear arms and suggested after the attack that armed guards in schools could avert future violence. \n \n Newtown, located some 78 miles (126 kilometers) northeast of New York City, has razed the school that was site of the attack and recently acquired the home where Lanza lived with his mother, who he shot dead as the first act of his rampage. That building may also be torn down. \n \n Newtown plans no public ceremonies to mark Sunday\'s anniversary of the shootings. \n \n ""The second anniversary, like the first one last year, will be recognized in personal reflection and remembrance,” said Newtown\'s highest elected official, First Selectman Patricia Llodra, and Superintendent of Schools Joseph Erardi, in a statement ... “There are no formal or official ceremonies to be held by the town or school district."" \n \n But a 12-member commission that includes four parents of young victims of the attack is steadily moving ahead to create a permanent memorial to honor the dead. \n \n ""We are meeting monthly, but have taken December off out of respect for the families who lost their loves ones on that tragic day,"" said Kyle Lyddy, chairman of the Sandy Hook Permanent Memorial Commission that is entering its final phase of recommending either a single or multiple memorials. \n \n Lyddy said the panel is considering such proposals as an outdoor park and gardens, and indoor murals and art exhibits.

The Hartford Courant reported earlier this week that parents were discussing a legal action against Bushmaster, the North Carolina-based manufacturer of the AR-15 rifle that was used by Lanza. \n \n Asked whether notice of a lawsuit had been received, an employee in the legal department of Remington Outdoor Company, Bushmaster’s parent firm, referred the inquiry to the company’s public affairs director, who then did not respond to numerous emails, phone calls and voicemails this week seeking comment. \n \n The Guardian has confirmed that action is to be announced on Monday involving Michael Koskoff, a partner in the Connecticut law firm Koskoff, Koskoff & Bieder, who three years ago represented the Jackson family in their unsuccessful lawsuit against AEG Live, the promoter of a planned tour for which Jackson was rehearsing when he died in 2009. \n \n Joining his firm in promoting the action is Karen Hinton, a lobbyist and PR expert who once worked for the Democratic National Committee and is a close ally of Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York, who described her as “my public relations guru” in his 2003 book Crossroads: the Future of American Politics. \n \n \n \n Hinton worked for Cuomo when he was housing secretary to then president Bill Clinton in the 1990s and is married to Howard Glaser, who was until earlier this year one of Cuomo’s most senior aides. \n \n “We are not going to be speaking about that until Monday,” Hinton said of Sandy Hook, declining to confirm what the parents’ plans were. \n \n Hinton, who states in her Twitter biography that she is “taking on big oil, big banks & other big bullies”, has represented clients including Ecuadorian villagers in a long-running multibillion-dollar legal battle with Chevron, the energy corporation, over pollution of the Amazon rainforest. \n \n According to records reviewed by the Guardian at Fairfield county probate court, estates were opened with notifications of wrongful death claims this month for Charlotte Bacon, Daniel Barden, Dylan Hockley, Jesse Lewis, Ana Marquez-Greene, James Mattioli, Grace McDonnell, Emilie Parker, Jack Pinto, Noah Pozner and Jessica Rekos. Estates were also opened for Avielle Richman and Benjamin Wheeler, but the box signifying a wrongful death claim was not checked.']",3,"– Two years ago yesterday, Adam Lanza walked into Sandy Hook Elementary School and fired 154 bullets in less than five minutes, killing 20 small children and six educators. Today, the families of nine of the victims, along with a wounded teacher who survived, have filed suit against the maker of Lanza's ""weapon of choice,"" the Bushmaster AR-15, reports the Daily Beast. ""The number of lives lost in those 264 seconds was made possible"" by the AR-15, which was ""engineered to deliver maximum carnage with extreme efficiency,"" reads the lawsuit; also named are Remington and Riverview Gun Sales, which sold Lanza's weapon. The suit faults the gunmakers for making such rifles available ""to the civilian market"" despite knowing that ""individuals unfit to operate these weapons gain access to them."" Per the suit, Bushmaster's actions caused the plaintiffs ""terror; ante-mortem pain and suffering; destruction of the ability to enjoy life’s activities; destruction of earning capacity, and death."" The families of 13 victims had in recent weeks created estates for their children, a required step in filing suit, reports the Guardian, which notes not all of those families intended to sue. They are represented by the same lawyer who represented Michael Jackson's family against AEG Live. Despite calls for increased gun control in the wake of the Newtown tragedy, Reuters notes that school shootings remain largely unchecked, with 95 fatal and nonfatal incidents over the last two years. Meanwhile, Nicole Hockley, mother of Dylan Hockley and one of the parents who sued, has written a letter to the mother she used to be."

'‘Having said this was going to be a good day, I just looked in the mirror to find my hair doing this!' \n \n \n \n When faced with a 'bad hair day', 13 per cent of girls try to get away with wearing a hat all day, while eight per cent totally over-do their make-up to compensate. \n \n More than one in 20 girls have even been known to call in sick to work when their mop won’t behave. \n \n When it comes to being seen in public with bad hair, a third of British women would most hate their work colleagues to see them. \n \n And while a third of women hate the idea of friends seeing them without their usual sleek and shiny mane, a quarter of ladies don’t want their partners to see them looking anything other than perfect. \n \n Mark Hill added: 'Let’s face it - a bed-head look later in the day isn’t always appreciated. \n \n 'I have found women are more experimental with their hair than ever before which is incredibly exciting and should be great fun. \n \n 'Most hair will allow itself to be teased and tamed - if it is ‘prepped’ and primed using perfect products and styling tools for the hair type and desired look.' \n \n \n \n 'A Great Hair Day is more than the opposite of a bad one. Women feel sexy, confident and ready to take on the world.' \n \n \n \n Bad hair days have led to one in 20 girls being dumped for being so grumpy, and one in five have missed their bus or train to work. \n \n Twelve per cent of women have had huge rows with a partner simply because their barnet made them mad, while 14 per cent have been known to snap at the children. \n \n Eight per cent of unlucky ladies have even received a warning at work following a particularly dire mood.""]",1,"– The daughter of India's richest man is about to say ""I do"" and she's invited some of America's most recognizable names in business, politics, and entertainment to help her celebrate.

The wedding will take place in Mumbai, but the party has already started at pre-wedding events in the city of Udaipur, where Clinton was snapped smiling alongside the bride's billionaire father, Mukesh Ambani.

193,"['President Obama called on Senate Republicans Wednesday to ""fulfill their constitutional duties"" and consider a Supreme Court nominee this year, questioning their reasoning for vowing not to consider his choice to replace Antonin Scalia. \n \n ""I recognize the politics are hard for them because the easier thing to do is to give in to the most extreme voices within their party and stand pat and do nothing,"" he told reporters during a meeting with King Abdullah of Jordan. ""But that\'s not our job. Our job is to fulfill our constitutional duties."" \n \n ""And so my hope and expectation is that once there is an actual nominee, once this is no longer an abstraction, that those on the Judiciary Committee recognize that their job is to give this person a hearing, to show the courtesy of meeting with them,"" he continued. ""They are then free to vote whatever their conscience dictates as to whether this person is qualified or not."" \n \n He added that it\'s up to the American public to decide whether or not his eventual nominee is qualified for the position--and public support for the candidate would make it tougher for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to summarily deny that person a hearing. \n \n ""I think it will be very difficult for Mr. McConnell to explain how, if the public concludes that this person\'s very well-qualified, that the Senate should stand in the way simply for political reasons,"" he said. ""We\'ll see what happens. I think the situation may evolve over time. I don\'t expect Mitch McConnell to say that is the case today. I don\'t expect any member of the Republican caucus to stick their head out at the moment. But let\'s see how the public responds to the nominee that we put forward."" \n \n Obama also said the argument about holding off nominating someone because he\'s a ""lame-duck president"" doesn\'t hold water because he still has a year left in office. \n \n ""There\'s an argument that well, the president shouldn\'t do this because he is a lame duck,"" he said. ""Well, the truth of the matter is that traditionally the term lame duck refers to the two or three months after an election has taken place in which a new president is about to be sworn in. I\'ve got a year to go. I don\'t think they would approve of me abdicating on my duties as commander-in-chief and to stop doing all the other work that I\'ve got to do."" \n \n As for how he\'s going to choose a nominee, the president on Wednesday penned a guest post on SCOTUSblog, a popular Supreme Court analysis website, detailing the qualities he looks for in a nominee and assuring readers that naming a bench appointment is ""a duty that I take seriously."" \n \n For Mr. Obama, the first prerequisite for a justice who would replace the late Antonin Scalia is that the person ""be eminently qualified."" \n \n ""He or she will have an independent mind, rigorous intellect, impeccable credentials, and a record of excellence and integrity,"" the president wrote. ""I\'m looking for a mastery of the law, with an ability to hone in on the key issues before the Court, and provide clear answers to complex legal questions."" \n \n But the president also emphasized a nonpartisan nominee to the court, which has been back in session since Monday. \n \n His chosen appointment would be ""someone who recognizes the limits of the judiciary\'s role; who understands that a judge\'s job is to interpret the law, not make the law."" \n \n The future justice he promised to seek would hand down decisions on court cases ""without any particular ideology or agenda, but rather a commitment to impartial justice, a respect for precedent, and a determination to faithfully apply the law to the facts at hand."" \n \n And Mr. Obama\'s third requirement for the nation\'s highest bench: life experience. \n \n ""I\'m also mindful that there will be cases that reach the Supreme Court in which the law is not clear. There will be cases in which a judge\'s analysis necessarily will be shaped by his or her own perspective, ethics, and judgment,"" the president said. ""That\'s why the third quality I seek in a judge is a keen understanding that justice is not about abstract legal theory, nor some footnote in a dusty casebook."" \n \n ""It\'s the kind of life experience earned outside the classroom and the courtroom,"" he added, ""experience that suggests he or she views the law not only as an intellectual exercise, but also grasps the way it affects the daily reality of people\'s lives in a big, complicated democracy, and in rapidly changing times."" \n \n He also hinted at a potential timetable for when he would officially tap a nominee, saying that he would fulfill that presidential duty ""in the weeks ahead."" \n \n When he does choose to name Scalia\'s successor, Mr. Obama will be fighting an uphill battle to get his nominee confirmed. \n \n On Tuesday, Senate Republicans reached a consensus that they would block all attempts at holding confirmation hearings for the president\'s nominee. \n \n ""I believe the overwhelming view of the Republican conference of the Senate is that this nomination, this vacancy, should not be filled by this lame-duck president,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, told reporters earlier this week after conferring with members of the GOP. Others, including former presidential candidate and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, who sits on the Judiciary committee, had said earlier in the day that there would be ""no hearing, no votes."" \n \n But in his SCOTUSblog post, the president closed with his hope that the Senate would cooperate in the future and ""fulfill their constitutional responsibility"" to consider his nominee. \n \n ""I hope they\'ll move quickly to debate and then confirm this nominee so that the Court can continue to serve the American people at full strength,"" he said.', 'Egypt has been the scene of more than 100 incidents involving the harm or detention of journalists in the past 36 hours, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. \n \n In Egypt, a plainclothes policeman (l.) runs to attack a foreign journalist as others beat a protester during a demonstration on Friday. Journalists have been the target of assault for two days running. \n \n Reports of severe attacks and detentions for journalists working in Egypt paint a dark picture of an orchestrated attempt to shut down the information flow from a country in turmoil. \n \n There have been more than 100 incidents of beatings, detentions, and assaults on journalists in the past 36 hours, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ). While CNN’s Anderson Cooper may be one of the highest-profile incidents involving a member of the US media, journalists from all over the world – including Egypt – have been targeted. \n \n “This is on a scale that is unprecedented,” says Rob Mahoney, deputy director of CPJ. \n \n The crackdown takes place as journalists come under fire more often and with clearer intent than at any time in modern history, he says. ""Most journalists who die are murdered. They don’t step on land mines – and 85 percent of those murders go unpunished,” he adds. \n \n The US State Department would not rule out the possibility that the Egyptian government is behind the crackdown. \n \n ""We condemn in the strongest terms attacks on reporters covering the ongoing situation in Egypt. This is a violation of international norms that guarantee freedom of the press and is unacceptable under any circumstances,"" Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said at a press briefing Thursday. “The Egyptian government must demonstrate its willingness to ensure journalists’ ability to report on these events to the people of Egypt and to the world.” \n \n The US has raised these issues with both the Egyptian ambassador in Washington and ministry officials in Cairo, according to State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley. \n \n The developments raise the question: Why is the press coming under such fire? The logic of attacking reporters amid the Egyptian demonstrations is one that is common in political uprisings, says Barbara DeGorge, academic dean at Northwood University in West Palm Beach, Fla. \n \n “The demonstrators see the journalists as being aligned with the Mubarak government and are angry at them for their support of a repressive regime,” says Ms. DeGorge, who has just returned from six years stationed in Dubai. \n \n At the same time, older, more-conservative Egyptians view the presence of cameras in the midst of an internal dispute as a threat to their country’s stability. “They tend to see Western journalists as reporting news that is beneficial to Western interests, not their own. So they are very suspicious,” she says. \n \n While reporting has always been an inherently messy and potentially dangerous job, “there used to be an intrinsic respect” for the work being done by the fourth estate, says Gene Grabowski, chair of the Crisis and Litigation Practice at Levick Strategic Communications in Washington. \n \n Mr. Grabowski began as an Associated Press reporter in the late 1970s – the dawn of the 24-hour news cycle. These days, the sheer number of people who can set themselves up as some form of journalist has exploded, points out Mr. Mahoney of CPJ. “Today, anyone with a flip-phone camera and access to a blog can call themselves a journalist,” he says. \n \n They can reach more people and do the same job for pennies. Only 25 years ago, a professional would have had to pay thousands of dollars and had access to a pricey satellite uplink to deliver his or her report. \n \n When reporters cover political turmoil in nations that lack the institutions of free speech, it is common to view journalists as threats to the status quo, says Leonard Shyles, an associate professor of communication at Villanova University in Pennsylvania. \n \n “The idea that the public will find out things that are inconvenient to the power holders prompts them to limit access to reporters to avoid scrutiny and preserve anonymity,” Professor Shyles says via e-mail. He adds, “At such times, journalists are at risk and come to be viewed as threats to be thwarted, sometimes at the cost of their lives.” \n \n CBS News correspondent Mark Strassmann is among the many reporters in Cairo who were roughed up and warned to stay away from the political demonstrations. He says he spent Thursday in his hotel. \n \n “I read a poll that said reporters are trusted less than car salesmen,” he said by phone from his hotel in Cairo. However, he notes, the stakes are high in this battle for who will control the information flow. Important decisions are made on the basis of information, and “people have to get their information somewhere,” he says. \n \n Outside media attention provides one of the few pressure points on Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak as protesters demand change. “The thuggery of the last few days is much easier for Mubarak to get away with if nobody is reading about it or seeing it,” he says.']",2,"– President Obama on Wednesday told the Senate to do its job and at least give his eventual Supreme Court nominee a hearing: ""They are then free to vote whatever their conscience dictates,"" he told reporters, per CBS News, but it's clear their ""constitutional duties"" include at least allowing a hearing. A hearing on whom? Well, per multiple sources who spoke to the Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal, the White House is currently vetting Brian Sandoval, the Republican governor of Nevada. He's described as a ""centrist"" by the Post, who says ""some key Democrats"" see him as ""perhaps the only nominee"" Obama might be able to get Republicans to consider. Mitch McConnell and the Judiciary Committee have pledged to take no action on any Supreme Court nominee from Obama. Would that change if the nominee is a member of their own party? Three GOP senators who sit on the Judiciary Committee all said no, but other Republican senators say getting a nominee like Sandoval could be cause to reconsider. Some Democrats believe nominating Sandoval would put some Republicans up for re-election in November in an awkward position, and could ultimately force the Senate to break its blockade. Sandoval, who has a ""bipartisan record"" per the Post and is aligned with Democrats on abortion rights and the environment, met with Harry Reid Monday, and a source says he allowed the vetting process to proceed but said he hadn't decided whether he'd accept a nomination. It's not clear how many potential nominees the White House is considering, but the Journal notes there are likely more."

A mixture of sulfur and pitch combined with fire was the first way humans gassed their enemies, explains Discovery News. It dredges up 2009 findings by British archaeologist Simon James, who asserts that such a poison gas was used during a siege on the Roman-controlled city of Dura-Europos around AD 256. The site was excavated throughout the 20th century, first in 1920; in the next decade, the bodies of 20 armor-clad Roman soldiers were found in one of the counter-mines they dug in order to access the tunnels made by the invading Sasanian Persians. The original theory was that the collapse of the tunnel killed them. But James offered proof that the Romans were actually gassed: A jar near the bodies contained residue composed of pitch and yellow sulfur crystals. National Geographic shares James' explanation: ""I think the Sasanians placed braziers and bellows in their gallery, and when the Romans broke through, added the chemicals and pumped choking clouds into the Roman tunnel."" Death would have come within minutes. There is one bit of archaeology that could predate it: a sulfur and pitch fireball that struck Alexander’s army in 327 BC. But a Stanford research scholar notes that there's no way to determine whether it was purposefully or accidentally ignited.

They also stopped using cell phones and used encrypted e-mail while on the road to avoid detection by law enforcement, according to the indictment. \n \n To publicize their crimes, court documents allege, the pair used publicly available computers to post what the FBI called “communiques” to extreme animal rights websites. \n \n Buddenberg was the target of federal agents at least once before when, in 2009, he was charged with threatening researchers at UC Berkeley and UC Santa Cruz. Those charges were eventually thrown out by a judge who said prosecutors filed a vague indictment that failed to specify any illegal acts. \n \n If convicted, Buddenberg and Kissane could face up to 10 years in prison and $250,000 in fines.

But many of these newly minted doctors can, thanks to one government program, pay just a few hundred dollars a month on their loans—in some cases, far less than the interest that's being tacked on each month. And after 10 years, when the balance has swelled above $200,000, they can have whatever they owe wiped clean. The Wall Street Journal takes a look at this expanding class of borrower: graduate or professional-school students with a six-figure loan who don't expect or intend to pay it back. That attitude isn't a flouting of the rules. As the Journal reports, one 2012 program allows borrowers to pay a max of 10% of their discretionary income (that's any adjusted gross income beyond 1.5 times the poverty line.) And while undergrads are prevented from taking on more than $57,500 in federal loans, as of 2006 grad students stopped being restricted in a similar manner: Once they've borrowed $138,500 in government Stafford loans (that figure includes undergrad debt), the roughly 10-year-old Grad PLUS loans step in, in many cases eliminating the need to fill the gap using private loans. Grad PLUS was actually supposed to help taxpayers, because the interest rates on these loans were higher. But a 2007 measure allows those working full-time for a federal agency or nonprofit to have their balance wiped away if they make 10 years of payments (which, yes, can be capped at the aforementioned 10%) on time—at the taxpayers' expense. The Journal notes that 73% of America's hospitals are nonprofits or government owned, meaning doctors working there qualify."

Debbie Wasserman-Schultz (D-FL) and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC Wednesday evening June 18, 2014. (Photo by Melina Mara/The Washington Post) \n \n This post has been updated. \n \n New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D) has a new book coming out, ""Off the Sidelines,"" and has been making the media rounds to promote it. The New York Post highlighted parts of the book today, in an article titled, ""Gillibrand: Male colleagues called me ‘porky’ after baby."" \n \n As awful as that headline is, things get worse in the book, according to the story. One quote in particular stands out. Gillibrand reveals that one male Senator, after she lost about 50 pounds, came up behind her and gave her waist a squeeze. “Don’t lose too much weight now,"" he told her. ""I like my girls chubby.” She says that he was one of her favorite senators(!). \n \n As Gillibrand\'s title infers, the book goes into detail about the things that women in politics still have to deal with that their male counterparts, well, don\'t. \n \n Yes, there are more women in Congress than ever before, but there are still far fewer women than men serving. There are 20 women in the Senate, and 79 women in the House. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, women make up only 24.2 percent of all state legislators. A 2013 article from the Texas Observer highlights how this is a problem for women legislators across the country. The reporter tells of the stories women politicians told her. \n \n Some told of senators ogling women on the Senate floor or watching porn on iPads and on state-owned computers, of legislators hitting on female staffers or using them to help them meet women, and of hundreds of little comments in public and private that women had to brush off to go about their day. Some said they often felt marginalized and not listened to—that the sexism in the Legislature made their jobs harder and, at times, produced public policy hostile to women. Yet, despite their strong feelings, women in the Capitol rarely talk about, except in the most private discussions, the misogyny they see all the time. It’s just the way the Legislature has always been. \n \n Gillibrand surely isn\'t alone in having to deal with such comments with her male colleagues at the Capitol, although some of her encounters are jaw-droppingly bad/offensive. When she was still in the House, a representative told her, “You know, Kirsten, you’re even pretty when you’re fat."" \n \n The New York Post has a few more examples, and Gillibrand\'s book -- which comes out on September 9 -- is probably teeming with them. \n \n Gillibrand often talks about women in politics -- and the problems she has with how they are treated and portrayed. For example, she has a big problem with ""House of Cards"" for this reason. She told CNN, ""My colleagues are much nicer. Most of the women in the series are portrayed as quite cold and calculating but my experience is I adore the female colleagues I have in the Senate."" She went on the Daily Show in 2012 to talk about why more women need to be elected. \n \n In case you were wondering, you can add Gillibrand as a ""no"" to the 2016 files; she\'s said during interviews she has no interest in entering the presidential race. However, Gillibrand has said repeatedly that Hillary Clinton should run.', 'A detailed report commissioned by two major Republican groups — including one backed by Karl Rove — paints a dismal picture for Republicans, concluding female voters view the party as “intolerant,” “lacking in compassion” and “stuck in the past.” \n \n Women are “barely receptive” to Republicans’ policies, and the party does “especially poorly” with women in the Northeast and Midwest, according to an internal Crossroads GPS and American Action Network report obtained by POLITICO. It was presented to a small number of senior aides this month on Capitol Hill, according to multiple sources. \n \n Text Size - \n \n + \n \n reset \n \n Republicans swore they’d turn around the party’s performance with women after Mitt Romney’s loss in 2012. And while they are in good shape in 2014, poised to pick up seats in the House and possibly take the majority in the Senate, the new report shows they have not improved their standing with women — which could exacerbate their problems if Hillary Clinton is the Democratic nominee in 2016. \n \n (Also on POLITICO: Dems paint GOP as shutdown party) \n \n The report — “Republicans and Women Voters: Huge Challenges, Real Opportunities” — was the product of eight focus groups across the country and a poll of 800 registered female voters this summer. The large-scale project was a major undertaking for the GOP groups. \n \n “The gender gap is hardly a new phenomenon, but nevertheless, it’s important for conservatives to identify what policies best engage women, and our project found multiple opportunities,” said Dan Conston, a spokesman for the American Action Network. “It’s no surprise that conservatives have more work to do with women.” \n \n Republicans in Washington say they recognize the problem. Republicans who have seen or been briefed on the polling were not surprised about the outcome. The poll was conducted by Public Opinion Strategies and Axis Research. \n \n (Also on POLITICO: Jindal sues over Common Core) \n \n Paul Lindsey, the spokesman for Rove-backed Crossroads GPS, said, “There are a number of House policymakers and staff who have been willing to focus on issues important to women, and we think it’s important that they are aware of the policy solutions that are available to help address these concerns.” \n \n The solutions offered include neutralizing Democratic attacks that the GOP doesn’t support “fairness” for women; “deal honestly with any disagreement on abortion, then move to other issues”; and “pursue policy innovations that inspire women voters to give the GOP a ‘fresh look.’” \n \n The report is blunt about the party’s problems. It says 49 percent of women view Republicans unfavorably, while 39 percent view Democrats unfavorably. \n \n (Also on POLITICO: Boehner, donors huddle in Wyoming) \n \n It also found that Republicans “fail to speak to women in the different circumstances in which they live” — as breadwinners, for example. “This lack of understanding and acknowledgment closes many minds to Republican policy solutions,” the report says. The groups urge Republicans to embrace policies that “are not easily framed as driven by a desire to aid employers or ‘the rich.’” \n \n Two policies former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor promoted as a way to make inroads with middle-class women and families — charter schools and flexible work schedules — were actually the least popular policies among female voters. \n \n Republicans have long had a troubled relationship with female voters, but this report, which comes out just months before Election Day, is the most recent detailed illustration of the problem. Republicans have several initiatives to attract female candidates and voters. Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington, the No. 4 House Republican, for example, is spearheading her chamber’s effort. The Republican National Committee is trying to engage women in 25 “targeted counties for the midterm election,” a spokesman said.']",3,"– New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand has a new book, Off the Sidelines, out next month, and it takes a frank look at the reality of being a woman on Capitol Hill. Among the more surprising and perhaps not-so-surprising tidbits: Gillibrand reveals she had lost 50 pounds after giving birth when a male senator squeezed her waist from behind. ""Don't lose too much weight now,"" he said. ""I like my girls chubby."" The Washington Post notes that Gillibrand says ""he was one of her favorite senators(!)."" People picks up another quote from a male colleague, handed out while Gillibrand was exercising at the congressional gym: ""Good thing you're working out, because you wouldn't want to get porky!"" Talking Points Memo notes Gillibrand's acerbic response in the book: ""Thanks, a--hole!"" A Southern congressman even told her once, ""You know, Kirsten, you’re even pretty when you're fat,"" Gillibrand wrote, per the New York Post. ""I believed his intentions were sweet, even if he was being an idiot."" Perhaps all the sexist idiocy helped her bond with Hillary Clinton. ""I will help Hillary get elected,"" she told People while promoting the book. ""In my mind, she's definitely running"" in 2016, Gillibrand adds. ""Anytime I've ever talked to her, I've offered every bit of help in the world and she's never said no."" In other way-out-of-date-politician news: A report from two Republican groups finds 49% of female voters view the GOP ""unfavorably,"" including as ""intolerant,"" ""lacking in compassion,"" and ""stuck in the past."" That isn't likely to help the party if Clinton does indeed decide to run, Politico notes."

Doctors have said Ms. Giffords is severely injured and faces a very long road to recovery. \n \n Friends and family members said Mrs. Giffords sent the message out early Tuesday morning. Recipients forwarded it to others and a copy was later sent to The New York Times. \n \n In one passage, Mrs. Giffords wrote: “They are even now having her move limbs on command. So now comes the ‘true grit’ part... and won’t be a stroll in a park although Mark predicts she’ll be up and walking around in 2 weeks.” The congresswoman is married to Capt. Mark E. Kelly, a naval officer and astronaut. \n \n Pia Carusone, Ms. Giffords’s chief of staff, cautioned that Mr. Kelly was “ever the optimist.” \n \n “As a sign of confidence in her strength — and one day ability to recover — he has whispered half-jokingly that she’s got two weeks from the day of the injury to be up and walking,” she said. \n \n Mrs. Giffords also said in the message that her daughter would be released from the hospital in Tucson on Friday and flown to a rehabilitation center in Houston to begin aggressive physical and occupational therapy. But Ms. Giffords’s staff said no final decision had been made about when or where she would begin rehabilitation. She remains in serious condition. \n \n Ms. Carusone said that Mr. Kelly was looking for the “best possible facility,” for his wife’s recovery which, beyond Houston, could include rehabilitation centers in Washington, D.C., Chicago and New York City. \n \n Officials from the University Medical Center said in a statement Wednesday that no discharge date has been confirmed. \n \n Ms. Giffords’s doctors say they are encouraged but urge caution.

Rick Scott clings to a lead over Bill Nelson during a statewide recount of their nationally relevant U.S. Senate contest. \n \n Attorneys for Scott’s campaign filed emergency motions Sunday requesting that embattled elections supervisors in Palm Beach and Broward counties turn over custody of their vote-tabulation machines and ballots to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and sheriff’s deputies during times when votes aren’t being counted.

SUBSCRIBE NOW \n \n Also on Sunday, Attorney General Pam Bondi told FDLE Commissioner Rick Swearingen in a letter that she was “deeply troubled” by his agency’s decision to decline Scott’s press conference request to investigate elections fraud in the two counties and urged him to reconsider. \n \n Scott has presented no evidence to back up his fraud allegations, and the Department of State has said its elections monitors have uncovered no criminal behavior. But amid a high-stakes battle over each of the 8.3 million votes cast in Tuesday’s midterms, Scott’s campaign is continuing to lean hard on the elections process in a densely populated area of the state that could make or break his 12,562-vote lead. \n \n Letter+to+Swearingen by Dave Wilson on Scribd \n \n “As long as the Supervisor of Elections has unsupervised, unaccountable, and unfettered access to the ballot boxes, she will be able to destroy evidence of any errors, accidents, or unlawful conduct — making it nearly impossible for an aggrieved party to prosecute their claims or discover later what has actually occurred in the electoral process,” attorney Jason Zimmerman wrote in the complaint filed against Broward Supervisor or Elections Brenda Snipes. \n \n SHARE COPY LINK Broward Circuit Judge Carol-Lisa Phillips also held that Brenda Snipes, Broward’s supervisor of elections, was in violation of Florida public-records laws for not turning over the records requested by Gov. Rick Scott’s campaign for U.S. Senate. \n \n Democrats, who’ve accused Scott and Republican attorneys of voter suppression, reacted harshly. Mark Herron, an election lawyer who represented Al Gore in the 2000 presidential recount, called Scott’s push to involve state police an “abuse of power.” Joe Geller, a Miami state representative and election lawyer called it an “extraordinary” and unwarranted request, although courts in New York recently ordered ballots impounded in a congressional race at the request of Democratic frontrunner Anthony Brindisi. \n \n Letter+to+Detzner by on Scribd \n \n Scott’s campaigns filed the lawsuits — including a third that seeks to invalidate any ballots counted in Broward after Saturday’s deadline to submit unofficial results — as elections departments around the state hustled Sunday to try and meet a 3 p.m. Thursday deadline to recount the ballots cast during the state’s midterm elections. Recounts were also ordered in contests for governor and commissioner of agriculture due to a state law that requires a machine recount for any statewide election decided by a half of a percentage point or less. \n \n Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, left, and Republican Gov. Rick Scott. \n \n Starting Saturday, Miami-Dade had employees working 24 hours a day to finish the process. Broward and Palm Beach have struggled. Machine troubles delayed the start of Broward’s recount operations until late Sunday morning. The Palm Beach Post reported that Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections Susan Bucher warned this weekend that Thursday’s deadline will be “impossible” to meet, presenting the possibility that her unofficial results provided to the state on Saturday will stand. \n \n Interjecting state and local police into the mix could complicate the timeline. \n \n “In suing to seize ballots and impound voting machines, Rick Scott is doing his best to impersonate Latin American dictators who have overthrown Democracies in Venezuela and Cuba,” said Florida Democratic Party Executive Director Juan Peñalosa in an emailed statement Sunday evening. “The governor is using his position to consolidate power by cutting at the very core of our democracy.” \n \n But missteps by Bucher and Snipes, at the very least, have opened the door to warranted skepticism. \n \n Scott last week won court orders from judges in both counties after he alleged in lawsuits that Bucher was improperly conducting activities involving ballots in private that should have been performed in front of the canvassing board, the body responsible for overseeing the ballot-counting process and ruling on ballots of questionable validity. \n \n Snipes, who has been repeatedly slapped by judges over gaffes in recent years, was ordered by a judge to provide information related to uncounted ballots and issues after she repeatedly declined to provide basic details about her operations to the press or the candidates. \n \n Snipes’ staff also managed to mix up 22 invalid provisional ballots with 183 valid ones this week, and included the votes deemed illegitimate by the Broward County canvassing board in her unofficial vote total to the state. In a conference call with reporters, Tim Cerio, an elections attorney representing Scott in South Florida, noted that the only reasons the problematic ballots were discovered in the first place is because attorneys observing the canvassing board demanded that Snipes present the ballots to the board. \n \n “We’re going to stand up to those who would violate the law and particularly those with a rampant history of voter fraud,” said U.S. Sen. Cory Gardner, chairman of the Republican Senate campaign committee. \n \n The recounted vote tallies in South Florida could prove crucial in the ongoing recounts. Once recounted vote tallies are submitted to the state Thursday, any races still within one quarter of 1 percent will be subject to an automatic hand recount, during which so-called “under-votes” and “over-votes” — ballots in which voters chose too few or too many candidates — will be reviewed ballot by ballot by canvassing boards. \n \n While former congressman Ron DeSantis is far enough ahead of Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum that a hand recount is unlikely to occur in the race for governor, Scott and Nelson are expecting to continue fighting on into the weekend. Hand recount tallies would be due by Nov. 18. And South Florida, a heavily Democratic region of the state, contains more than 35,000 ballots that are considered under-votes in the Senate race. Nelson’s campaign is also fighting to include ballots rejected over signature mismatches in voting totals. \n \n With so much attention paid to Broward County, protesters have been virtually camped outside Snipes’ Lauderhill office for three days. An angry crowd shouted down Florida Sen. Perry Thurston and Florida Democratic Party attorney Mitchell Berger when they appeared in a make-shift “free speech zone” designated in the parking lot outside to address the media Sunday afternoon. \n \n “Everyone wants these votes counted,” Berger said, arguing that hundreds of mail-in ballots were caught up in an Opa-locka mail center and not counted due to a federal investigation of the Aventura man who sent more than a dozen pipe bombs to Democrats around the state. \n \n \n \n \n \n “Fake news,” someone shouted. “More Democratic lies,” another yelled. \n \n \n \n \n \n Berger said he and a Republican counterpart, lawyer William Scherer representing Scott’s senate campaign, both observed the recount process Sunday morning and decided it was all above board. “We both agree there’s no fraud going on,” he said, to jeers and laughter. \n \n Inside Snipes’ headquarters, Eugene Pettis, attorney for Broward’s Supervisor of Elections office, said there will be a hearing in front of a judge sometime Monday to discuss the issue of ballot and voting machine custody. \n \n “They have control here,” Pettis said, referring to the law enforcement officers watching the process and the elections monitors watching the process for the last few weeks. \n \n Scott on Sunday seemed to soften his allegations of fraud after he was criticized when he asked the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to investigate Snipes and Bucher. That criticism grew in volume when the FDLE declined to investigate, saying it had received no formal request from Scott or evidence of fraud. State elections monitors in Broward County also reported that they had reported no evidence of criminal behavior. \n \n But Republicans remain concerned, and Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi on Sunday wrote a letter urging the head of FDLE to investigate Snipes and Bucher. \n \n “I am deeply troubled by our announcement that you will not pursue any investigation or inquiry into clearly documented irregularities in the conduct of election officials in Broward and Palm Beach counties in the 2018 elections,” Bondi wrote to FDLE Commissioner Rick Swearingen. \n \n Snipes remains adamant that she has done nothing wrong, and defiant in the face of criticism. Critics also note that Scott could have sought to remove her from office during his eight years as governor over the litany of issues with her office cited in his recent lawsuits. \n \n Ironically, another embattled elected Broward Democrat — Sheriff Scott Israel — would have oversight of ballots if the Scott campaign gets its way. \n \n Supervisors have until Thursday to submit machine recount totals. Under Florida law, any hand recount totals would be due Nov. 18. Final results are to be certified on Nov. 20 by Florida’s Elections Canvassing Commission. The board consists of two members of the Florida Cabinet — and Gov. Rick Scott. \n \n This article has been updated to note that ballots have been impounded in the race for the 22nd congressional district of New York. \n \n Miami Herald reporters Glenn Garvin, Maya Kaufman and Carli Teproff contributed to this report.', 'Broward Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes, left, and judge Betsy Benson of the election canvassing board, listen to arguments, Sunday, Nov. 11, 2018, at the Broward Supervisor of Elections office...

(Joe Cavaretta /South Florida Sun-Sentinel via AP) (Associated Press) \n \n FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — Mishaps, protests and litigation are overshadowing the vote recount in Florida\'s pivotal races for governor and Senate, reviving memories of the 2000 presidential fiasco in the premier political battleground state. \n \n All 67 counties are facing a state-ordered deadline of Thursday to complete their recounts and half already had begun. Many other counties were expected to begin the work Monday after a weekend of recount drama in Broward and Palm Beach counties, home to large concentrations of Democratic voters. \n \n The developments added up to a tumultuous political day in Florida. More than half of Florida\'s 67 counties began a recount process that\'s unprecedented even in a state notorious for settling elections by razor-thin margins. State officials said they weren\'t aware of any other time a race for governor or U.S. Senate required a recount, let alone both in the same election. \n \n In Broward County, the recount was delayed for hours Sunday because of a problem with one of the tabulation machines. That prompted the Republican Party to slam Broward\'s supervisor of elections, Brenda Snipes, for ""incompetence and gross mismanagement."" \n \n Broward officials faced further headaches after acknowledging the county mistakenly counted 22 absentee ballots that had been rejected. The problem seemed impossible to fix because dismissed ballots were mixed in with 205 legal ballots and Snipes said it would be unfair to throw out all the votes. \n \n Gov. Rick Scott, the Republican candidate for Senate, filed suit against Snipes. He was seeking a court order for law enforcement agents to impound all voting machines, tallying devices and ballots ""when not in use until such time as any recounts."" The suit accused Snipes of repeatedly failing to account for the number of ballots left to be counted and failing to report results regularly as required by law. \n \n The court didn\'t immediately respond, though the outcry from Democrats was immediate. \n \n Juan Penalosa, executive director of the Florida Democratic Party, accused Scott of ""using his position to consolidate power by cutting at the very core of our democracy."" \n \n Meanwhile, in Palm Beach County, the supervisor of elections said she didn\'t think her department could meet Thursday\'s deadline to complete that recount, throwing into question what would happen to votes there. \n \n The recount in other major population centers, including Miami-Dade and Pinellas and Hillsborough counties in the Tampa Bay area, has been continuing without incident. Smaller counties were expected to begin reviews between Monday and Wednesday. \n \n State officials said they weren\'t aware of any other time a race for governor or U.S. Senate required a recount, let alone both in the same election. The recount process in the two nationally watched midterm races is unprecedented even in a state notorious for settling elections by razor-thin margins. \n \n Unofficial results showed Republican former U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis led Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum by 0.41 percentage points in the governor\'s contest. In the Senate race, Scott\'s lead over Democratic incumbent Bill Nelson was 0.14 percentage points. \n \n State law requires a machine recount in races where the margin is less than 0.5 percentage points. Once completed, if the differences in any of the races are 0.25 percentage points or below, a hand recount will be ordered. \n \n As the recount unfolded, Republicans urged their Democratic opponents to give up and let the state to move on. \n \n Scott said Sunday that Nelson wants fraudulent ballots and those cast by noncitizens to count, pointing to a Nelson lawyer objecting to Palm Beach County\'s rejection of one provisional ballot because it was cast by a noncitizen. \n \n ""He is trying to commit fraud to win this election,"" Scott told Fox News. ""Bill Nelson\'s a sore loser. He\'s been in politics way too long."" \n \n Nelson\'s campaign issued a statement later saying their lawyer wasn\'t authorized to object to the ballot\'s rejection as ""Non-citizens cannot vote in US elections."" \n \n In Fort Lauderdale, Gillum appeared at a predominantly African-American church Sunday evening, warning against vote suppression and declaring voter disenfranchisement isn\'t just about being blocked from the polling booth. He said it also includes absentee ballots not being counted and ballots with mismatched signatures that ""a volunteer may have the option of ... deciding that vote is null and void."" \n \n Gillum and Nelson have argued each vote should be counted and the process should take its course. \n \n Both the state elections division, which Scott runs, and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement have said they have found no evidence of voter fraud. \n \n That didn\'t stop protests outside Snipes\' office, where a crowd of mostly Republicans gathered, holding signs, listening to country music and occasionally chanting ""lock her up,"" referring to Snipes. A massive Trump 2020 flag flew over the parking lot and many members of a Bikers For Trump group wore matching shirts, mingling among a crowd that included a protester wearing a Hillary Clinton mask. \n \n Registered independent Russell Liddick, a 38-year-old Pompano Beach retail worker, carried a sign reading, ""I\'m not here for Trump! I\'m here for fair elections! Fire Snipes!"" He said the office\'s problems ""don\'t make me feel very much like my vote counted."" \n \n Florida is also conducting a recount in a third statewide race. Democrat Nikki Fried had a 0.07 percentage point lead over Republican state Rep. Matt Caldwell for agriculture commissioner, one of Florida\'s three Cabinet seats. \n \n For some, the recounts bring back memories of the 2000 presidential recount, when it took more than five weeks for Florida to declare George W. Bush the victor over Vice President Al Gore by 537 votes, thus giving Bush the presidency. \n \n Much has changed since then. \n \n In 2000, each county had its own voting system. Many used punch cards — voters poked out chads, leaving tiny holes in their ballots representing their candidates. Some voters, however, didn\'t fully punch out the presidential chad or gave it just a little push. Those hanging and dimpled chads had to be examined by the canvassing boards, a lengthy, tiresome and often subjective process that became fodder for late-night comedians. \n \n Now the state requires all Florida counties to use ballots where voters use a pen to mark their candidate\'s name, much like a student taking a multiple-choice test. And how counts proceed is now clearly spelled out. \n \n ___ \n \n AP writers Tamara Lush in St. Petersburg and Brendan Farrington in Tallahassee contributed to this report. \n \n ___ \n \n For AP\'s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics']",2,"– With an unprecedented double recount underway in Florida, Gov. Rick Scott is fighting to get state police involved.

Scott has claimed that ""unethical liberals"" in the two heavily Democratic counties are trying to steal the election, in which he currently has a lead of just 12,562 votes over Nelson, the Miami Herald reports.

Florida Democrats reacted angrily, calling the move to involve police an ""abuse of power,"" the Herald reports. State police and election officials say they have found no evidence of fraud, though protesters, some of them holding pro-Trump signs or chanting ""Lock her up,"" still gathered outside Snipes' office on Sunday, the AP reports. A recount is also happening in the governor's race. (Palm Beach County officials say it will be ""impossible"" to meet the Thursday recount deadline.)"

The presenters had mistakenly been given the wrong category envelope and when discovered, was immediately corrected. We are currently investigating how this could have happened, and deeply regret that this occurred.” \n \n — Best actress Oscar-winner Emma Stone told reporters backstage at the Oscars telecast that “Of course it was an amazing thing to hear ‘La La Land.’ We would have loved to have won best picture. But we are so excited for ‘Moonlight.’ I think it’s one of the best films of all time. I was also holding my ‘best actress in a leading role’ card that entire time. So whatever story, I don’t mean to start stuff, but whatever story that was, I had that card.” \n \n — There are two sets of cards for every award, so there is the likelihood that Beatty and Dunaway were handed the wrong envelope. Host Jimmy Kimmel had come forward to inform the cast that “Moonlight” had indeed won, showing the inside of the envelope as proof. “I knew I would screw this up,” said Kimmel, a first-time host. (A closeup of the envelope Beatty was holding shows it is indeed labled “Actress in a Leading Role”) \n \n — According to the L.A. Times, Beatty “explained that the reason it had taken him so long to read the card was because he was looking at something that said Emma Stone had won. At that point, he showed it to Dunaway, who announced “La La Land.” Beatty assured viewers that the error was unintentional and he wasn’t trying to turn the biggest award into a joke.” \n \n — It’s not the first time the wrong category winner was an issue at the Oscars. In 1964, Sammy Davis Jr. was handed an envelope for the wrong award, according to ABC News. “Representatives from Oscar’s counting unit at Price Waterhouse had to rush onstage to stop him from blurting out a mistake.

(Photo by Matt Sayles/Invision/AP) (Associated Press) \n \n LOS ANGELES (AP) — It was one of the most awkward moments in the history of the Oscars, of television, in entertainment, heck maybe in American history. \n \n And somehow Warren Beatty, Hollywood\'s ultimate smooth leading man, was at the center of it, and the accounting firm that is responsible for the integrity of Oscar voting apologized and was vowing a full investigation. \n \n The producers of ""La La Land"" were nearly done with their acceptance speeches for Best Picture, the Oscar broadcast\'s credits sequence about to roll, when a stir of whispers began on stage. Moments later ""La La Land"" producer Jordan Horowitz returned to the microphone and said ""Moonlight won Best Picture"" and insisting that ""this is not a joke."" \n \n The collective jaw of the crowd at the Dolby Theatre — and of America — remained dropped long after they became convinced it was no joke, but what academy historians later called an apparently unprecedented Oscar error. The accounting firm PwC, formerly Price Waterhouse Coopers, said early Monday that Beatty and Dunaway had been given the wrong envelope. \n \n ""We sincerely apologize to \'Moonlight,\' \'La La Land,\' Warren Beatty, Faye Dunaway, and Oscar viewers for the error that was made during the award announcement for Best Picture,"" a statement from the firm said. ""The presenters had mistakenly been given the wrong category envelope and when discovered, was immediately corrected. We are currently investigating how this could have happened, and deeply regret that this occurred."" \n \n The statement came several hours after the chaotic ending, which featured Beatty returning to the mic to explain that he had opened the envelope and he was confused when it read ""Emma Stone, La La Land."" He had shown it to co-presenter Faye Dunaway briefly, as though he wanted her to read it, which she did, apparently assuming the Emma Stone part was off but the ""La La"" part correct. \n \n ""It\'s one of the strangest things that\'s ever happened to me,"" Beatty said backstage. ""Thank God there were two of us up there,"" Dunaway responded. \n \n The actress then asked Beatty, ""Who else should I tell?"" \n \n ""Everybody,"" he said. \n \n At that point, a security guard tried to take the real envelope and Beatty said, ""Security is not getting this. I\'m giving it to (Moonlight director) Barry Jenkins at a later time."" Beatty also refused to show it to anyone else. \n \n ABC News, tweeting about the ceremony broadcast on its network, said the envelope held by Beatty read, ""Actress in a leading role.""

Booooring. La La Land, the hot favourite, won 7, just as everyone guessed. Any hope of a sneak upset was dashed when Faye Dunaway read out the… \n \n Wait. There’s confusion. Hold up a second. The wrong envelope? What? What just happened? What is Warren Beatty trying to explain just happened? Can this possibly be true? \n \n In a last-ditch twist so universally jaw-dropping that M. Night Shyamalan has already – quite genuinely – taken credit for it on Twitter, the actual winner of Best Picture was not La La Land at all. It was Moonlight. \n \n It took an incredible several minutes for this monumental screw-up to be witnessed, addressed and rectified. In this time, the poor La La Land producers had time to thank their agents, their wives, and everyone else in the room while we sat and yawned. Then one of them stepped in with big, urgent news. “This is not a joke,” he was forced to explain. “Moonlight won.” \n \n In came Beatty again. Suddenly it all made sense. He had stared inside the envelope in such bafflement, groping within in case it contained something he couldn’t initially find. It looked like he was horsing around, but he was clearly just confused. He was holding the one that said “Emma Stone, La La Land” inside it. And Faye Dunaway saw the last three words, and fatefully delivered them to the world. \n \n But Moonlight – truly the year’s *best* picture – was the title inside the envelope they should have been given. Moonlight! For it to win in this fashion was an insane coup, a heaven-sent miracle for the movie’s fans. We will pore over this footage for years, scrutinising every detail. The Oscars have never dealt a surprise like this, in 90 years, not once. Narrative drama in any format may have just peaked. And every jaw in Hollywood is still being scraped off the floor.', '“Moonlight” walked away with best picture honors at the end of Sunday night’s Oscars ceremony in Hollywood. \n \n The presenters for the final award — Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway — were incorrectly given the best actress award envelope. A confused Beatty saw Emma Stone’s name and “La La Land,” and handed the envelope to Dunaway, who then announced the musical as the Best Picture winner. \n \n The “La La Land” cast took the stage and producers began their speeches. But they stopped midway when they realized their error. \n \n “There’s a mistake. ‘Moonlight’ you guys won best picture,” Jordan Horowitz said to the shocked Dolby Theater audience. “This is not a joke, come up here” the producer added. “Moonlight has won best picture.” \n \n \n \n Beatty then returned to the microphone to explain: “I want to tell you what happened. I opened the envelope and it said Emma Stone, ‘La La Land.’ That’s why I took such a long look at Faye and at you. I wasn’t trying to be funny.” \n \n “Moonlight” beat out “La La Land,” “Hidden Figures,” “Manchester by the Sea,” “Arrival,” “Hacksaw Ridge,” “Hell or High Water,” “Lion,” and “Fences.” \n \n RELATED CONTENT: Every Oscar Best Picture Winner [GALLERY] \n \n It was nothing less than a shock for Barry Jenkins’ intimate study of a black youth coming to terms with his homosexuality to walk away with the win: Damien Chazelle’s “La La Land” had been widely tipped as the frontrunner on the strength of a dominant precursor showing and top prizes from the Golden Globes, the Producers Guild, and the Directors Guild. Notably, though, “Moonlight” scored more best film prizes from critics groups around the country, making it a formidable dark horse every step of the way. \n \n Watch the moment unfold below:', 'The spotlight is now on PricewaterhouseCoopers, which has overseen the Academy\'s ballot-counting process for 83 years. \n \n Was it the Bonnie and Clyde presenter team\'s fault? A case of the envelopes getting mixed up backstage? Let the finger-pointing begin. \n \n After a stunning and surreal mistake that may be the worst Academy Awards telecast flub in history, the accounting firm in charge of the ballot-counting process is clarifying its role. \n \n ""We sincerely apologize to Moonlight, La La Land, Warren Beatty, Faye Dunaway, and Oscar viewers for the error that was made during the award announcement for best picture,"" said PricewaterhouseCoopers, which has overseen the Academy\'s ballot-counting process for 83 years. \n \n The statement added: ""The presenters had mistakenly been given the wrong category envelope and when discovered, was immediately corrected. We are currently investigating how this could have happened, and deeply regret that this occurred. We appreciate the grace with which the nominees, the Academy, ABC, and Jimmy Kimmel handled the situation."" \n \n In years past, the firm has provided two sets of winners\' envelopes in briefcases that are sent to the Dolby Theatre, one briefcase for either side of the stage. \n \n In what was was supposed to just be a memorable movie reunion, Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway ended up fumbling the presentation of best picture, as they were apparently holding the best actress envelope instead. \n \n Not only did Dunaway read off La La Land as the best picture winner, the confusion wasn\'t fixed until after several members of the Lionsgate movie\'s team had already spoken. ""I opened the envelope and it said \'Emma Stone, La La Land.\' That\'s why I looked at Faye, and at you. I wasn\'t trying to be funny,"" Beatty clarified, laughing nervously. \n \n ""This is very unfortunate, what happened. Personally, I blame Steve Harvey for this,"" emcee Jimmy Kimmel said, trying to salvage the moment with a joke about how Harvey had announced the wrong winner of the ""Miss Universe"" pageant on live TV in 2015. However, this mistake was far worse. \n \n Moonlight director Barry Jenkins appreciated the surreal nature of the moment right away, saying onstage: ""Very clearly, very clearly, even in my dreams, this could not be true. But to hell with dreams, I’m done with it, ’cause this is true. Oh my goodness."" \n \n At the end of the televised portion, Kimmel added one last jab. ""Well, I don’t know what happened. I blame myself for this,"" he said, referencing his self-effacing joke at the top of the show. ""Let’s remember, it’s just an awards show. I mean, we hate to see people disappointed but the good news is, we got to see some extra speeches. We had some great movies. I knew I would screw this show up, I really did."" \n \n La La Land producer Jordan Horowitz had to take a ballot and show the TV audience that, in fact, it said Moonlight. ""I was ecstatic, it was amazing. I thought we won an Oscar,"" Horowitz recalled to The Hollywood Reporter. ""Some guys in headsets started buzzing around. It became clear that was something wrong. They took the envelope I had. It said \'Emma Stone, La La Land\' on it."" \n \n He added: ""It was clear that there was something wrong. We started looking for the best picture envelope. Nobody knew where it was. Then it appeared, they opened it next to me and it said \'Moonlight.\'"" \n \n PwC has had Brian Cullinan and Martha Ruiz as co-ballot leaders overseeing the process for several years. The company touted that the ballot briefcases had made stops in 11 cities across the U.S. before making its way to Hollywood for the big day. \n \n Backstage, Jenkins was asked to explain the moment. ""No explanation; things just happen,"" he said. ""I will say I saw two cards. I wanted to see the card, and Warren refused to show the card to anybody before he showed it to me. He said, \'Barry Jenkins has to see the card. He needs to know.\'"" \n \n Moonlight breakout star Mahershala Ali, who won in the supporting actor category, was reflective. ""It’s very hard to feel joy in a moment like that,” he said, adding: “I feel very fortunate for all of us to have walked away with the best picture award. It’s pretty remarkable.” \n \n With the top honor yanked away from the frontrunner, La La Land ended the evening with six wins, Moonlight claimed three wins and Hacksaw Ridge and Manchester by the Sea took two awards. \n \n Emma Stone, who claimed best actress, was cordial when asked about the confusion by reporters. ""I f—ing love Moonlight,"" she said. ""Of course it was an amazing thing to hear them say La La Land — we would have loved best picture, but we\'re so happy for Moonlight."" \n \n Meanwhile, at the Governors Ball, Dunaway wasn\'t as gregarious about the moment.

Accounting firm PwC, which oversees the ballot-counting, says Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway were handed the wrong category envelope. ""We are currently investigating how this could have happened, and deeply regret that this occurred,"" the company formerly known as Price Waterhouse Coopers said in a statement to the AP, apologizing to the presenters, both movies, and Oscars viewers for the fiasco. A roundup of coverage: The Guardian has photos showing moment by moment how things went wrong. Beatty can be seen carrying the red envelope for ""Actress in a Leading Role,"" which he opens, then hands to Dunaway. He later said he was confused because it said ""Emma Stone: La La Land."" She reads out the movie title. With the La La Land team on stage, Oscars overseers can be seen examining the envelope. USA Today reports that as the La La Land team went on stage, a PwC accountant backstage shouted ""He took the wrong envelope!"" and ran onstage. ""I was ecstatic, it was amazing. I thought we won an Oscar,"" La La Land producer Jordan Horowitz tells the Hollywood Reporter. But then, ""some guys in headsets started buzzing around. It became clear that something was wrong."" The New York Times has a transcript of the chaotic minutes onstage. ""I'm going to be really proud to hand this to my friends from Moonlight,"" says Horowitz graciously. La La Land star Ryan Gosling could be seen apparently trying not to laugh during the mix-up, though the BBC's Martha Kearney says he had a ""face like thunder"" while waiting for a limo after the ceremony. This has never happened before in any category in Oscars history, Vox reports in a look at how PwC handles the envelopes—and at its procedure for handling mix-ups. ""It was very quick, I can't talk about it. The card read that way. It was a very odd thing,"" Dunaway tells the Telegraph, adding: ""It wasn't Warren's fault."" La La Land star Stone told the media she was excited for Moonlight, which she considers one of the best movies of all time, the Chicago Sun-Times reports. But she added: ""I was also holding my Best Actress in a Leading Role card that entire time. So whatever story, I don’t mean to start stuff, but whatever story that was, I had that card."" Variety notes that it was also a shock to many that Moonlight had won Best Picture at all, though it had won more best film prizes from critics groups than La La Land. It turns out there was a second big fail on Sunday night."

207,"['With the iPhone 5 possibly on its way to Sprint Nextel, could the end of its much-loved unlimited-data plan be far behind? \n \n commentary Once Sprint Nextel gets the iPhone, you can bid farewell to its unlimited-data plan. \n \n Sprint CEO Dan Hesse, as seen in one of the company\'s much-played black-and-white television commercials. (Credit: CBS/Sprint) \n \n If history is any indication, Sprint will have to make some tough decisions, if Apple\'s blockbuster device starts weighing on its network. It\'s something the other carriers have done, and it\'s part of a broader trend of telecommunication companies struggling to keep up with growing bandwidth consumption. \n \n After suffering through years of heavy bandwidth usage from iPhone users, AT&T; relented and switched to a tiered pricing plan last year. It only took Verizon Wireless a few months after launching its version of the iPhone 4 before it opted to apply similar data caps. \n \n Sprint, which The Wall Street Journal reported today will be getting the iPhone 5 at the same time as AT&T; and Verizon in October, will likely follow the same path. \n \n I have no first-hand knowledge of Sprint\'s thinking on its successful--but taxing--offer of an all-you-can-eat data plan for its smartphones. A Sprint representative wasn\'t immediately available to answer my questions. \n \n But I do know that networks aren\'t fundamentally different from each other, despite the marketing jargon and hype that surrounds them. Sprint doesn\'t have any more capacity than Verizon and AT&T.; In fact, it may be in a worse position now because its unlimited-data offer is unique in the market, likely attracting the heaviest of users. \n \n The carriers\' switch to tiered plans doesn\'t include existing unlimited-data customers, who have had the option to be grandfathered into an unlimited plan. You can see the strain the grandfathering is putting on the carriers, with both AT&T; and Verizon switching to language in their service agreements that allow them to throttle, or choke off, the connection speed when a user exceeds a certain threshold of data consumption. \n \n Sprint is in a touchy spot because it has positioned itself as the unlimited carrier. Ads talk about the company\'s truly limitless plans, and Chief Executive Dan Hesse has been featured on commercials deriding competitors\' actions such as throttling. \n \n As I\'ve written, Verizon\'s decision to switch to a capped plan has been a boon for Sprint. The carrier is the only remaining company to offer a truly unlimited-data plan, a rare marketing and competitive edge outside of cheaper prices. Even Sprint\'s prepaid arm, Virgin Mobile, has decided to employ throttling. \n \n But all good things have to come to an end. Speaking to a roundtable of bloggers and reporters last month, Hesse acknowledged that data traffic could eventually be an issue. \n \n ""Nothing\'s a guarantee that it\'s forever,"" he said at the time. \n \n For Sprint, the choice is a trade-off: keep the unlimited-data plan and spur additional customer growth, or cut back on the plans and ease the need to invest in more capital for the network. Its decision may indicate whether it is favoring the consumer or Wall Street. \n \n When I wrote about Sprint eventually dropping the unlimited-data plan, analysts gave it a year to 18 months before a change would happen. But with the iPhone becoming available to Sprint customers, that timetable could be accelerated. Thanks to its more affordable data plans, Sprint has a higher base of smartphone customers than its rivals--roughly half of its total customers. \n \n While it has gotten used to dealing with the bandwidth-intensive Android phone, Sprint may be in for another pounding, once more customers start upgrading their basic phones for the iPhone. \n \n And even if the iPhone isn\'t significantly more data-hungry than its Android counterparts, Sprint may use the iPhone\'s reputation as an excuse to close off the unlimited-data spigot. \n \n So what does that mean for customers? If the iPhone does come out for Sprint, hop on an unlimited-data plan while you can (and thus get grandfathered in). The plan may not be around much longer.', 'Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. \n \n / Updated \n \n U.S. Special Operations Forces killed a senior leader of ISIS overnight Friday during a rare and risky ground raid in Syria and freed a young woman who was enslaved in his compound, the White House announced Saturday. \n \n American Delta Force commandos took off from northern Iraq in Blackhawk helicopters and Osprey aircraft, going deep into ISIS-controlled territory with no allies on the ground. Their target, SIS leader Abu Sayyaf, did not go down quietly. \n \n The preplanned operation near the eastern Syrian city of al-Amr was supposed to be a snatch-and-grab mission to capture Abu Sayyaf alive. Instead, he was killed amid an intense fire fight and hand-to-hand combat between ISIS militants and the Army Delta Force commandos. \n \n Twelve enemy fighters were killed in the operation, while no American forces were hurt, U.S. officials said. \n \n As the Special Operations Forces departed, they took Abu Sayyaf\'s wife, Umm Sayyaf, who is also considered to be an ISIS operative, into custody. As the helicopters departed, they were struck by heavy ground fire but not disabled and were able to depart the area safely. \n \n The mission is the first known American commandos operation inside Syria outside of a failed attempt to rescue hostages held by ISIS last year. \n \n Umm Sayyaf is being held in Iraq and will be secluded from other prisoners, officials told NBC News. She is accused of being ""directly complicit in (ISIS) activities, specifically human trafficking,"" an official said. \n \n The White House\'s National Security Council confirmed Umm Sayyaf is being ""debriefed."" \n \n ""We are also working to determine any information she may have regarding hostages — including American citizens who were held by (ISIS),"" spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan said in a statement. \n \n In addition, Friday\'s operation ""also led to the freeing of a young Yazidi woman who appears to have been held as a slave by the couple,"" the White House said. \n \n Abu Sayyaf was in charge of overseeing ISIS\'s oil and gas operations, which provide crucial revenue for the militant group that has conquered swaths of Syria and neighboring Iraq. Iraqi authorities supported Friday\'s raid. \n \n A U.S. military official described the mission, which was met with heavy resistance from ISIS, as a ""hugely successful operation” and represents a “significant blow” to the terror network operating in Syria and Iraq. \n \n ""Despite the rhetoric, (ISIS) is suffering significant losses in leadership and the ability to conduct operations,"" the official told NBC News. ""Through strikes in Iraq and Syria, the Kurdish offensive in northern Syria and military successes in Iraq, (ISIS) is desperate."" \n \n The United States is leading a coalition in a military campaign to roll back the jihadist group whose self-declared caliphate in Syria and Iraq has reshaped the region. \n \n In the Iraqi city of Ramadi, U.S.-led air strikes forced ISIS to withdraw from a government building over which the group\'s black flag had flown on Friday. Were it to fall, Ramadi would be the first major city to be won by ISIS since an effort by Iraqi security forces and paramilitary groups to push it back began last year. \n \n In Syria, the group fought Syrian government forces for control of the ancient city of Palmyra, an attack that has raised fears its UNESCO World Heritage site could meet the same fate as monuments destroyed by ISIS in Iraq. \n \n While Washington is working closely with Iraq in the fight against ISIS, it has shunned the idea of cooperating with Syrian President Bashar Assad, who it says has lost legitimacy to rule and must leave power. The United States said it did not warn Assad in advance or coordinate with his officials over Friday\'s special forces raid. \n \n IN-DEPTH \n \n SOCIAL \n \n — Kristen Welker, Richard Engel, Jim Miklaszewski and Courtney Kube \n \n Reuters contributed to this report.']",2,"– The iPhone 5 will be available on Sprint's network as well as Verizon's and AT&T's when the new phone is launched, insiders tell the Wall Street Journal.

The iPhone 5 deal will provide a major boost for the nation's third-largest carrier, whose bottom line had suffered without the ability to sell iPhones, analysts say.

Jang was the latest and most significant in a series of personnel reshuffles that Kim has conducted in an apparent effort to bolster his power. \n \n Some analysts see the purge as a sign of Kim Jong Un\'s growing confidence, but there has also been fear in Seoul that the removal of such an important part of the North\'s government _ seen by outsiders as the leading supporter of Chinese-style economic reforms _ could create dangerous instability or lead to a miscalculation or attack on the South. \n \n Tensions are still high on the Korean Peninsula following a torrent of threats in March and April by Kim Jong Un\'s government against Washington, Seoul and Tokyo, including vows of missile and nuclear strikes and warnings that Pyongyang would restart nuclear bomb fuel production. \n \n Jang was married to Kim Jong Un\'s aunt, Kim Kyong Hui, the younger sister of Kim Jong Il.

Lieutenant Clayton Hunt and Lieutenant (junior grade) Nicholas Horton, naval aviators assigned to Patrol Squadron (VP) 16, pilot a P-8A Poseidon during a mission to assist in search and rescue operations for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 in this March 24, 2014 handout photo. \n \n PERTH (Reuters) - An air search of the remote southern Indian Ocean resumed on Friday, seeking to confirm if hundreds of objects spotted by satellites are debris from a Malaysian jetliner presumed to have crashed almost three weeks ago with the loss of all on board. \n \n A Chinese Ilyushin IL-76 took off from Perth before dawn, heading 2,500 km (1,550 miles) southwest into the search area where high winds and icy weather had halted flights on Thursday. \n \n The disappearance of the Malaysia Airlines jet, which vanished from civilian radar screens less than an hour after taking off from Kuala Lumpur on a routine flight to Beijing on March 8, has gripped the world and baffled investigators. \n \n Officials believe someone on board Flight MH370 may have shut off the plane\'s communications systems before flying it thousands of miles off course where it crashed into the ocean in one of the most isolated and foreboding regions on the planet. \n \n Theories range from a hijacking to sabotage or a possible suicide by one of the pilots, but investigators have not ruled out technical problems. \n \n The search zone centers on the latest sightings of possible wreckage that were captured by Thai and Japanese satellites in roughly the same frigid expanse of sea as earlier images reported by France, Australia and China. \n \n ""We detected floating objects, perhaps more than 300,"" Anond Snidvongs, the head of Thailand\'s space technology development agency, told Reuters. ""We have never said that the pieces are part of MH370 but have so far identified them only as floating objects."" \n \n The U.S. Navy said it was sending a second P8 Poseidon maritime surveillance aircraft to help in the search for the missing Boeing 777. \n \n ""It\'s critical to continue searching for debris so we can reverse-forecast the wind, current and sea state since March 8th to recreate the position where MH370 possibly went into the water,"" said Commander Tom Moneymaker, a U.S. 7th Fleet oceanographer. \n \n The United States has also sent a device that can be towed behind a ship to pick up faint pings from the plane\'s black box voice and data recorders, but time is running out. \n \n ""We\'ve got to get this initial position right prior to deploying the Towed Pinger Locator since the MH370\'s black box has a limited battery life and we can\'t afford to lose time searching in the wrong area,"" Moneymaker said. \n \n NEW IMAGES \n \n The Australian Maritime Safety Authority, which is coordinating the effort, said it would give details later on the search after flights were halted on Thursday. \n \n ""It\'s the nature of search and rescue. It\'s a fickle beast,"" Flying Officer Peter Moore, the captain of an Australian AP-3C Orion, told Reuters aboard the plane after it turned around 1,000 km (600 miles) from the search zone. \n \n ""This is incredibly important to us. The reality is we have 239 people whose families want some information and closure."" \n \n The objects spotted by the Thai satellite on Monday were between 2 meters (6.5 ft) and 16 meters (52 ft) in size and were in an area around 2,700 km (1,680 miles) southwest of Perth, Snidvongs said. \n \n The prolonged and so far fruitless search and investigation have taken a toll, with dozens of distraught relatives of 150 Chinese passengers clashing with police and accusing Malaysia of ""delays and deception"". \n \n China has repeatedly voiced its frustration with the efforts of Malaysia to find the plane. China\'s special envoy to Malaysia said on Thursday that Beijing was doing its best to push the Southeast Asian nation to coordinate the international search effort, state news agency Xinhua said. \n \n Chinese insurance companies have started paying compensation to the families of passengers, Xinhua reported separately. \n \n A U.S.-based law firm has said it expects to represent families of more than half of the passengers in a lawsuit against the carrier and Boeing, alleging the plane had crashed due to mechanical failure. \n \n (Additional reporting by Suilee Wee in Beijing, Niluksi Koswanage in Kuala Lumpur, Stanley White in Tokyo and Amy Sawitta Lefevre in Bangkok; Writing by Lincoln Feast and Alex Richardson; Editing by Dean Yates)', ""The crucial moments of doomed Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 may never be discovered experts have warned as the 'black box’ which records details of the flight may have over written key data. \n \n As the search for wreckage of MH370 was bolstered on Wednesday by the detection of 122 “credible” floating objects in the Indian Ocean experts said the black box anyway may be “impossible” to find. \n \n A United States black box detector being towed to the area is due to arrive on April 5, 28 days after the crash and just two days before the data recorder’s pinger is due to run out of battery life. \n \n David Barry, an aviation specialist at Cranfield University, said the pings may continue for an extra ten days but the signal will weaken. He said the effort to find the box could take years. \n \n “Given the remoteness of the site and the depth of the water and the weather down there, the black box will be almost impossible to find,” he told The Telegraph. “It will then be a case of digging through the wreckage field, possibly for a couple of years.” \n \n A further difficulty for the crash investigators is that the crucial moment for understanding the unusual flight revolves around the period during which its communications systems were disabled and it took a sharp turn westward before flying silently for about seven hours. This occurred during the first hour of the flight, but the black box records cockpit communication on a two hour loop and deletes all but the final two hours. \n \n Though the flight data will have survived, Mr Barry said, “the bit we are interested in – where they lost contact with air traffic control – would have been overridden unless power to the recorder was lost.” \n \n On Wednesday Hishammuddin Hussein, Malaysia’s acting transport minister, said new satellite images had found objects ranging from 3 to 75 feet across an area of 154 square miles in the southern Indian Ocean. \n \n He described the sighting of an apparent debris field as “the most credible lead we have so far”. \n \n The images, captured through clouds by Airbus Defence and Space in France four days ago, were about 1,589 miles southwest of Perth in a remote stretch of the southern Indian Ocean. The zone tallies with previous images captured by United States and Chinese satellites. \n \n “We cannot tell whether the potential objects are from MH370,” Mr Hishammuddin said. “Nevertheless, this is another new lead that will help direct the search operation.” \n \n Twelve aircraft flew over the search area on Wednesday but spotted only three objects, including two items believed to be rope and a blue piece of flotsam. No wreckage has been found, nor any confirmed sign of the missing Malaysia Airlines aircraft, since it disappeared with 239 passengers and crew aboard after taking off from Kuala Lumpur for Beijing on March 8. \n \n Mr Hishammuddin said authorities have begun looking at the steps that will need to be taken after the crash site and wreckage are found. The top priority is to locate the black box which will help to explain the cause of the crash. \n \n As the search continued, a multimillion-dollar lawsuit was initiated in the United States against Malaysia Airlines and Boeing. A firm representing families of the passengers filed a petition of discovery in Illinois, requiring the companies to produce evidence of possible flaws in the crashed Boeing 777. “We believe that both defendants named are responsible for the disaster of Flight MH370,” said Monica Kelly, the lead lawyer."", 'World \n \n Ahmad Seth Zaharie, 26, with his sister Aishah Zaharie (left), 27, and mother Faizah Khanum Mustafa Khan. \n \n The son of the experienced pilot who flew the missing Malaysian Airlines flight has insisted his father was not the kind of man who would hijack a plane. \n \n Ahmad Seth, the youngest of Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah\'s three children, told Malaysian media he has paid no attention to suggestions his father may have been involved in a hijacking or suicide mission. \n \n “I\'ve read everything online. But I\'ve ignored all the speculation. I know my father better,” the 26-year-old student told the New Straits Times, an English-language newspaper in Malaysia. \n \n The captain of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, Zaharie Ahmad Shah. Photo: Facebook \n \n Amid the incessant theories about the flight, which disappeared on March 8, many have speculated about state of mind and political persuasions of the 53-year-old pilot at the controls of flight MH370. \n \n Advertisement \n \n This week, a New Zealand publication claimed to have spoken to one of Captain Shah\'s friends who said the experienced pilot was going through a number of relationship problems and felt that his life was crumbling at the time of the ill-fated flight. \n \n Shortly after the plane vanished, attention turned to whether Captain Shah or his co-pilot, Fariq Abdul Hamid, had deliberately crashed the jet as part of a suicide mission. \n \n The political leanings and religious beliefs of Captain Shah have also been closely examined in the media. It has been claimed the captain was a political activist who attended the trial of Malaysia’s opposition leader, Anwar Ibrahim, just seven hours before he took control of the passenger jet. \n \n ""We may not be as close as he travels so much. But I understand him,” Mr Seth said. \n \n He said the family was holding out for “the right confirmation” that the aircraft ended its journey in the southern Indian Ocean. \n \n ""I will believe it [that there are no survivors] when I see the proof in front of my eyes,"" he said. \n \n He is the first of the pilot\'s immediate family members to speak publicly since the search began. \n \n Captain Shah joined Malaysia Airlines in 1981 and was certified by Malaysia’s Department of Civil Aviation as a simulator test examiner. \n \n He had 18,365 flying hours experience, and had installed a Boeing 777 flight simulator in his home, from which he made YouTube videos. \n \n smh.com.au', 'Human Rights Watch alleges that villagers were evacuated from a \'national disaster\' and put to work as cheap labor in sugarcane fields. \n \n This February 3,000 families were driven out of an area in southeast Zimbabwe known as Tokwe-Mukosi when flood waters rose dramatically. \n \n The flood was proclaimed a “national disaster” by Zimbabwe’s president Robert Mugabe, after state media reported it was caused by the broken wall of a dam. \n \n International donors pledged food and humanitarian aid, which has been steadily delivered. \n \n In an operation conducted partly by the military, the displaced and destitute families -- about 20,000 people -- were quickly whisked off and resettled in a “transit camp” of tents 80 miles away, on something called the Nuanetsi Ranch. \n \n The ranch is home to sugarcane fields that feed a large ethanol production facility that is also on the ranch. The sugar cane and ethanol project is jointly owned by Mr. Mugabe’s political party, Zanu (PF), and a controversial Zimbabwe businessman named Billy Rautenbach, sometimes called “Africa’s Napoleon.” \n \n From the moment the 3,000 families were relocated, they were told that their new employment was filling a sugarcane farming labor shortage. They were also advised that distribution of their donated food aid was contingent on their work. \n \n Now a Human Rights Watch investigation alleges not only that the families were commandeered as a form of cheap labor to serve Mr. Mugabe’s energy business interests – but that the flood itself was artificially created. \n \n There is no broken dam wall, the investigation found. In interviews with three senior employees of the Italian firm, Salini Impregilo JVC that is helping construct the dam, it is alleged that the flood was created by closing the sluice gates of the dam, which covers an area where two rivers come together. The closed flood gates caused high waters to back up and flood out the villagers. \n \n “What the media reported – that the dam wall collapsed leading to floods – is false information,” said one of the senior Salini officers, all three of whom requested anonymity. “The dam wall did not collapse and was never in danger of collapsing. With sluice gates and spillways open, it would have taken at least five years for the dam to fill up to capacity, but in this case they were deliberately closed because villagers in Tokwe-Mukorsi had resisted relocation.” \n \n Tiseke Kasambala, director of southern Africa for Human Rights Watch, charges that “these 3,000 families have been displaced under questionable circumstances and dumped in a place where their only alternative is to be cheap labor for Zimbabwe’s ruling party.” \n \n The Human Rights Watch charges were vociferously denied by local Zimbabwe officials and members of the ruling Zanu (PF) party, which won reelection last July in a vote that was highly contested. \n \n “That is the most mischievous and ridiculous comment you can get from Human Rights Watch,” said the provincial affairs minister for Masivingo province, Kudakwashe Bhasikiti, where the dispute is taking place. “Flooding was not only experienced in Zimbabwe but even in the UK, Canada.” \n \n Mr. Bhasikiti three days ago banned five journalists from visiting the camp and the area, charging them with bias -- effectively closing off access to the families and to further examination of the dam. \n \n Mr. Bhasikiti also denied that Mr. Rautenbach, the wealthy co-owner of the ethanol project, was formally affiliated with the ruling party. However, Rautenbach’s ties to Mugabe are old and well-known, and on those grounds he has been sanctioned by the US, UK, and EU dating to 2008. \n \n HRW officials contacted by the Monitor confirmed that flooding at the turn of the year had taken place in the region but that leaving the flood gates open would have caused the waters to run off. “This was a water management issue, not a flood,” said one. \n \n Instead, HRW points to local villagers that were displaced who were told by military officials that Mugabe had ordered the reservoir basin at Tokw-Mukosi where they lived to be filled up without delay. \n \n Thousands of children have had their schooling disrupted or no longer have access to education in the tent city refugee camp, according to a visitor there. \n \n A makeshift school set up near the camp is not adequately equipped and staffed to meet the children’s needs. \n \n There were also widespread allegations that Masvingo police and provincial officials responsible for distributing food, blankets, and clothing have diverted some of the aid to the neighboring towns of Triangle and Chiredzi, where they are sold for profit, allegations HRW monitors witnessed to be true. \n \n “The Zimbabwean government has an obligation to ensure that displaced people have food, clothing, and shelter, but when food aid is turning up in local markets instead of in the tents of the displaced, then the responsible local officials need to be investigated,” said Kasambala. \n \n One of the Italian corporate officers that leaked information to HRW summed up the situation by saying, “’Floods’ enabled [the] government to swiftly remove some 20,000 people without compensation under the guise of a national disaster while at the same time attracting international sympathy and aid from the donor community.""']",4,"– Another big lead, but yet more frustration in the hunt for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370: Officials say a Thai satellite has detected ""300 objects of various sizes"" floating near the search area in the Indian Ocean, reports the AP. Another set of satellite images released yesterday showed 122 ""potential objects""—but severe weather prevented planes from searching the area today, Reuters reports. Some 11 military and civilian aircraft had been on the way to the area, but the forecast ""was calling for severe icing, severe turbulence, and near-zero visibility,"" a US Navy spokesman says. ""Anybody who's out there is coming home and all additional sorties from here are canceled."" The latest images, together with the possible debris field spotted by a French satellite, add to what the BBC calls ""a growing body of circumstantial evidence"" suggesting the flight came down in a remote part of the Indian Ocean—though the Boeing 777's black boxes could now be hundreds of miles away from any floating debris. The son of pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah, meanwhile, has rejected claims his father may have been on a ""suicide mission,"" reports the Sydney Morning Herald. ""I've read everything online,"" says the 26-year-old, the first family member to speak out publicly. ""But I've ignored all the speculation. I know my father better."" A US Navy black box detector is on the way to the area, but experts fear the pinging will soon be too weak to detect, meaning it could be years before the mystery of the plane's disappearance can be solved. ""Given the remoteness of the site and the depth of the water and the weather down there, the black box will be almost impossible to find,"" an aviation expert tells the Telegraph. ""It will then be a case of digging through the wreckage field, possibly for a couple of years."""

This machine is known as the Lenovo IdeaCentre Horizon Table PC, a beast of a device with a 27-inch touchscreen and the ability to work upright, on its side, and with a set of accessories that make it a full-on board game-capable beast. \n \n The IdeaCentre Horizon Table PC’s full details can be found in our original reveal post, it also making the case for Lenovo’s newest term: Phygital. This term makes for the mix of physical game playing and digital interaction, with this gaming table allowing you to play table hockey, dice-base board games, and everything in-between. \n \n The machine we had a peek at here in its current form had fabulous viewing angles and a rather realistically nice setup – in other words, it felt as though we’d really, actually use it in the real world. Not such a thing can be said about all massive touchscreen devices such as this. What we got from our first experience was this: we definitely need one to be able to play Candy Land in the future. \n \n As it stands, we’ll be playing some of Lenovo’s own games as well as a set of games that have been optimized for play on this device specifically by 3rd party systems. Can’t wait for the real push! Check out the rest of our Lenovo coverage and stick around our CES portal for more action from all angles all week long!', ""This is at once pretty cool and also very, really, incredibly silly and dumb. But that's not a bad thing! Here's Lenovo's Horizon desktop computer. It's half Minority Report, half newjack board game. Oh, and also a full Windows 8 all-in-one computer. \n \n Lenovo's all-in-ones have contorted down to be worked on horizontally for a while now, the Horizon is specifically designed to be picked up, moved around, and used by multiple people. It's got a rubber edge to protect it from bangs, and to make it easier to carry, and its screen is drop-proof (though not spill-proof). \n \n Advertisement \n \n It uses what Lenovo calls the Aura UI, which uses drag-wheels to launch videos, pictures, apps, and games. You can use gestures to isolate one video, zoom or shrink, clean the whole desktop, or close all open files. The Horizon comes with 15 pre-loaded apps, and there are 3000 more in its app store. Lenovo says it's got five major developers making games for the Horizon, headlined by EA and Ubisoft. \n \n The Horizon comes with a bunch joysticks to play its games, and can run on battery power if you want to take it away from its power source—like outside into a club house, if your kids are very rich an insane. It weighs 17 pounds, so they better be strong. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Internally, this is a regular all-in-one. It goes from i3 to i7, can go up to 16GB of RAM, and has discrete graphics. Its cheapest configuration starts at $1000. It's basically the same purchase as if you'd buy any other all-in-one, just with this functionality added. Lenovo has a custom stand for it, so it can be a waist-level console in the middle of your house. Unfortunately, the automated space-age table/desk/gaming center from the video is just a concept for now. \n \n The Horizon is cool—and also very, very gimmicky. It's sort of like the Wii U in that it's deeply centered on in-person, multi-user experiences, but when you're just by yourself, you probably won't use any of this new stuff. Still, it seems like the kind of thing that all your friends might not actually want, but would be more than happy to come over to your house and play with."", 'Apparently Lenovo liked what it saw from Sony\'s Tap 20, because here at CES the company is introducing its own ""portable"" desktop PC. The IdeaCentre Horizon is primarily a Windows 8-enabled all-in-one — Lenovo calls it a ""table PC"" — with a 27-inch, 1080p 10-finger touchscreen, Intel\'s Core i7 processors and discrete graphics. But it\'s also portable, at least in theory, thanks to an internal battery that Lenovo says will power the gigantic device for two hours at a time. The gigantic slate is only 1.06 inches thick, but it weighs 17 pounds, so its actual viability as a tablet will vary with your upper-body strength. In a more practical nod to the Horizon\'s touch-friendliness, Its hinge lets it either sit up at a normal angle for a PC, or lay flat on a table. \n \n When you lay the Horizon flat, Lenovo\'s ""Moon Dial"" interface automatically opens, providing a wheel-based interface for launching apps, flipping through pictures, and moving things around. It\'s incredibly reminiscent of Microsoft\'s original Surface interface, turning your table into a giant touchscreen. Gestures let you move things around, fling them to the edges, shake them to show similar objects, and much more. The Horizon doesn\'t interact with other devices — which was maybe the coolest feature of the original Surface — but it\'s a pretty fun concept nonetheless. We spent a few minutes using the Horizon, and though it\'s definitely a gimmicky idea, it\'s definitely fun to use and play with. \n \n Almost as cool as the Microsoft Surface — but much more gimmicky \n \n Lenovo designed the Horizon for families and offices, for more than one person to use at a time. It comes with a handful of specific accessories to that end, too: four joysticks, e-dice, and strikers, which Lenovo says creates a more physical gaming experience than is typical with a laptop. (It\'s calling that experience ""phygital."" No, really, that\'s what it\'s called.) A number of games also come pre-loaded, like Monopoly, King of the Opera, Raiding Company, and others. We played Air Hockey using the included joysticks, and it was fun, though using a physical joystick to hit a virtual puck felt a little odd. We\'re not so sold on this phygital thing yet. \n \n The Horizon will be available ""in early summer,"" and will start at $1,699. The beginning of a trend for Lenovo, with more of these table PCs coming soon — the company\'s showing off a 36-inch prototype called ""Gamma"" at CES as well.

212,"[""As a neurosurgeon, I did not believe in the phenomenon of near-death experiences. I grew up in a scientific world, the son of a neurosurgeon. I followed my father’s path and became an academic neurosurgeon, teaching at Harvard Medical School and other universities. I understand what happens to the brain when people are near death, and I had always believed there were good scientific explanations for the heavenly out-of-body journeys described by those who narrowly escaped death. \n \n The brain is an astonishingly sophisticated but extremely delicate mechanism. Reduce the amount of oxygen it receives by the smallest amount and it will react. It was no big surprise that people who had undergone severe trauma would return from their experiences with strange stories. But that didn’t mean they had journeyed anywhere real. \n \n Although I considered myself a faithful Christian, I was so more in name than in actual belief. I didn’t begrudge those who wanted to believe that Jesus was more than simply a good man who had suffered at the hands of the world. I sympathized deeply with those who wanted to believe that there was a God somewhere out there who loved us unconditionally. In fact, I envied such people the security that those beliefs no doubt provided. But as a scientist, I simply knew better than to believe them myself. \n \n In the fall of 2008, however, after seven days in a coma during which the human part of my brain, the neocortex, was inactivated, I experienced something so profound that it gave me a scientific reason to believe in consciousness after death. \n \n I know how pronouncements like mine sound to skeptics, so I will tell my story with the logic and language of the scientist I am. \n \n Very early one morning four years ago, I awoke with an extremely intense headache. Within hours, my entire cortex—the part of the brain that controls thought and emotion and that in essence makes us human—had shut down. Doctors at Lynchburg General Hospital in Virginia, a hospital where I myself worked as a neurosurgeon, determined that I had somehow contracted a very rare bacterial meningitis that mostly attacks newborns. E. coli bacteria had penetrated my cerebrospinal fluid and were eating my brain. \n \n When I entered the emergency room that morning, my chances of survival in anything beyond a vegetative state were already low. They soon sank to near nonexistent. For seven days I lay in a deep coma, my body unresponsive, my higher-order brain functions totally offline. \n \n Alexander discusses his experience on the Science channel's 'Through the Wormhole.' \n \n Then, on the morning of my seventh day in the hospital, as my doctors weighed whether to discontinue treatment, my eyes popped open. \n \n ‘You have nothing to fear.’ ‘There is nothing you can do wrong.’ The message flooded me with a vast and crazy sensation of relief. (Photo illustration by Newsweek; Source: Buena Vista Images-Getty Images) \n \n There is no scientific explanation for the fact that while my body lay in coma, my mind—my conscious, inner self—was alive and well. While the neurons of my cortex were stunned to complete inactivity by the bacteria that had attacked them, my brain-free consciousness journeyed to another, larger dimension of the universe: a dimension I’d never dreamed existed and which the old, pre-coma me would have been more than happy to explain was a simple impossibility. \n \n But that dimension—in rough outline, the same one described by countless subjects of near-death experiences and other mystical states—is there. It exists, and what I saw and learned there has placed me quite literally in a new world: a world where we are much more than our brains and bodies, and where death is not the end of consciousness but rather a chapter in a vast, and incalculably positive, journey. \n \n On the iPad Read Newsweek’s 2007 story on how science is bringing more heart-attack victims back to life \n \n I’m not the first person to have discovered evidence that consciousness exists beyond the body. Brief, wonderful glimpses of this realm are as old as human history. But as far as I know, no one before me has ever traveled to this dimension (a) while their cortex was completely shut down, and (b) while their body was under minute medical observation, as mine was for the full seven days of my coma. \n \n All the chief arguments against near-death experiences suggest that these experiences are the results of minimal, transient, or partial malfunctioning of the cortex. My near-death experience, however, took place not while my cortex was malfunctioning, but while it was simply off. This is clear from the severity and duration of my meningitis, and from the global cortical involvement documented by CT scans and neurological examinations. According to current medical understanding of the brain and mind, there is absolutely no way that I could have experienced even a dim and limited consciousness during my time in the coma, much less the hyper-vivid and completely coherent odyssey I underwent. \n \n It took me months to come to terms with what happened to me. Not just the medical impossibility that I had been conscious during my coma, but—more importantly—the things that happened during that time. Toward the beginning of my adventure, I was in a place of clouds. Big, puffy, pink-white ones that showed up sharply against the deep blue-black sky. \n \n Reliving History: The search for the meaning of the afterlife is as old as humanity itself. Over the years Newsweek has run numerous covers about religion, God, and that search. As Dr. Alexander says, it’s unlikely we’ll know the answer in our lifetimes, but that doesn’t mean we won’t keep asking. \n \n Higher than the clouds—immeasurably higher—flocks of transparent, shimmering beings arced across the sky, leaving long, streamerlike lines behind them. \n \n Birds? Angels? These words registered later, when I was writing down my recollections. But neither of these words do justice to the beings themselves, which were quite simply different from anything I have known on this planet. They were more advanced. Higher forms. \n \n A sound, huge and booming like a glorious chant, came down from above, and I wondered if the winged beings were producing it. Again, thinking about it later, it occurred to me that the joy of these creatures, as they soared along, was such that they had to make this noise—that if the joy didn’t come out of them this way then they would simply not otherwise be able to contain it. The sound was palpable and almost material, like a rain that you can feel on your skin but doesn’t get you wet. \n \n Seeing and hearing were not separate in this place where I now was. I could hear the visual beauty of the silvery bodies of those scintillating beings above, and I could see the surging, joyful perfection of what they sang. It seemed that you could not look at or listen to anything in this world without becoming a part of it—without joining with it in some mysterious way. Again, from my present perspective, I would suggest that you couldn’t look at anything in that world at all, for the word “at” itself implies a separation that did not exist there. Everything was distinct, yet everything was also a part of everything else, like the rich and intermingled designs on a Persian carpet ... or a butterfly’s wing. \n \n It gets stranger still. For most of my journey, someone else was with me. A woman. She was young, and I remember what she looked like in complete detail. She had high cheekbones and deep-blue eyes. Golden brown tresses framed her lovely face. When first I saw her, we were riding along together on an intricately patterned surface, which after a moment I recognized as the wing of a butterfly. In fact, millions of butterflies were all around us—vast fluttering waves of them, dipping down into the woods and coming back up around us again. It was a river of life and color, moving through the air. The woman’s outfit was simple, like a peasant’s, but its colors—powder blue, indigo, and pastel orange-peach—had the same overwhelming, super-vivid aliveness that everything else had. She looked at me with a look that, if you saw it for five seconds, would make your whole life up to that point worth living, no matter what had happened in it so far. It was not a romantic look. It was not a look of friendship. It was a look that was somehow beyond all these, beyond all the different compartments of love we have down here on earth. It was something higher, holding all those other kinds of love within itself while at the same time being much bigger than all of them. \n \n Without using any words, she spoke to me. The message went through me like a wind, and I instantly understood that it was true. I knew so in the same way that I knew that the world around us was real—was not some fantasy, passing and insubstantial. \n \n The message had three parts, and if I had to translate them into earthly language, I’d say they ran something like this: \n \n “You are loved and cherished, dearly, forever.” \n \n “You have nothing to fear.” \n \n “There is nothing you can do wrong.” \n \n The message flooded me with a vast and crazy sensation of relief. It was like being handed the rules to a game I’d been playing all my life without ever fully understanding it. \n \n “We will show you many things here,” the woman said, again, without actually using these words but by driving their conceptual essence directly into me. “But eventually, you will go back.” \n \n To this, I had only one question. \n \n Back where? \n \n The universe as I experienced it in my coma is ... the same one that both Einstein and Jesus were speaking of in their (very) different ways. (Ed Morris / Getty Images) \n \n A warm wind blew through, like the kind that spring up on the most perfect summer days, tossing the leaves of the trees and flowing past like heavenly water. A divine breeze. It changed everything, shifting the world around me into an even higher octave, a higher vibration. \n \n Although I still had little language function, at least as we think of it on earth, I began wordlessly putting questions to this wind, and to the divine being that I sensed at work behind or within it. \n \n Where is this place? \n \n Who am I? \n \n Why am I here? \n \n Each time I silently put one of these questions out, the answer came instantly in an explosion of light, color, love, and beauty that blew through me like a crashing wave. What was important about these blasts was that they didn’t simply silence my questions by overwhelming them. They answered them, but in a way that bypassed language. Thoughts entered me directly. But it wasn’t thought like we experience on earth. It wasn’t vague, immaterial, or abstract. These thoughts were solid and immediate—hotter than fire and wetter than water—and as I received them I was able to instantly and effortlessly understand concepts that would have taken me years to fully grasp in my earthly life. \n \n I continued moving forward and found myself entering an immense void, completely dark, infinite in size, yet also infinitely comforting. Pitch-black as it was, it was also brimming over with light: a light that seemed to come from a brilliant orb that I now sensed near me. The orb was a kind of “interpreter” between me and this vast presence surrounding me. It was as if I were being born into a larger world, and the universe itself was like a giant cosmic womb, and the orb (which I sensed was somehow connected with, or even identical to, the woman on the butterfly wing) was guiding me through it. \n \n Later, when I was back, I found a quotation by the 17th-century Christian poet Henry Vaughan that came close to describing this magical place, this vast, inky-black core that was the home of the Divine itself. \n \n “There is, some say, in God a deep but dazzling darkness ...” \n \n That was it exactly: an inky darkness that was also full to brimming with light. \n \n I know full well how extraordinary, how frankly unbelievable, all this sounds. Had someone—even a doctor—told me a story like this in the old days, I would have been quite certain that they were under the spell of some delusion. But what happened to me was, far from being delusional, as real or more real than any event in my life. That includes my wedding day and the birth of my two sons. \n \n What happened to me demands explanation. \n \n Modern physics tells us that the universe is a unity—that it is undivided. Though we seem to live in a world of separation and difference, physics tells us that beneath the surface, every object and event in the universe is completely woven up with every other object and event. There is no true separation. \n \n Before my experience these ideas were abstractions. Today they are realities. Not only is the universe defined by unity, it is also—I now know—defined by love. The universe as I experienced it in my coma is—I have come to see with both shock and joy—the same one that both Einstein and Jesus were speaking of in their (very) different ways. \n \n I’ve spent decades as a neurosurgeon at some of the most prestigious medical institutions in our country. I know that many of my peers hold—as I myself did—to the theory that the brain, and in particular the cortex, generates consciousness and that we live in a universe devoid of any kind of emotion, much less the unconditional love that I now know God and the universe have toward us. But that belief, that theory, now lies broken at our feet. What happened to me destroyed it, and I intend to spend the rest of my life investigating the true nature of consciousness and making the fact that we are more, much more, than our physical brains as clear as I can, both to my fellow scientists and to people at large. \n \n I don’t expect this to be an easy task, for the reasons I described above. When the castle of an old scientific theory begins to show fault lines, no one wants to pay attention at first. The old castle simply took too much work to build in the first place, and if it falls, an entirely new one will have to be constructed in its place. \n \n I learned this firsthand after I was well enough to get back out into the world and talk to others—people, that is, other than my long-suffering wife, Holley, and our two sons—about what had happened to me. The looks of polite disbelief, especially among my medical friends, soon made me realize what a task I would have getting people to understand the enormity of what I had seen and experienced that week while my brain was down. \n \n One of the few places I didn’t have trouble getting my story across was a place I’d seen fairly little of before my experience: church. The first time I entered a church after my coma, I saw everything with fresh eyes. The colors of the stained-glass windows recalled the luminous beauty of the landscapes I’d seen in the world above. The deep bass notes of the organ reminded me of how thoughts and emotions in that world are like waves that move through you. And, most important, a painting of Jesus breaking bread with his disciples evoked the message that lay at the very heart of my journey: that we are loved and accepted unconditionally by a God even more grand and unfathomably glorious than the one I’d learned of as a child in Sunday school. \n \n Today many believe that the living spiritual truths of religion have lost their power, and that science, not faith, is the road to truth. Before my experience I strongly suspected that this was the case myself. \n \n But I now understand that such a view is far too simple. The plain fact is that the materialist picture of the body and brain as the producers, rather than the vehicles, of human consciousness is doomed. In its place a new view of mind and body will emerge, and in fact is emerging already. This view is scientific and spiritual in equal measure and will value what the greatest scientists of history themselves always valued above all: truth. \n \n Proof of Heaven by Eben Alexander, M.D. To be published by Simon & Schuster, Inc.. Copyright (c) 2012 by Eben Alexander III, M.D. \n \n This new picture of reality will take a long time to put together. It won’t be finished in my time, or even, I suspect, my sons’ either. In fact, reality is too vast, too complex, and too irreducibly mysterious for a full picture of it ever to be absolutely complete. But in essence, it will show the universe as evolving, multi-dimensional, and known down to its every last atom by a God who cares for us even more deeply and fiercely than any parent ever loved their child."", 'Once upon a time, a neurosurgeon named Eben Alexander contracted a bad case of bacterial meningitis and fell into a coma. While immobile in his hospital bed, he experienced visions of such intense beauty that they changed everything—not just for him, but for all of us, and for science as a whole. According to Newsweek, Alexander’s experience proves that consciousness is independent of the brain, that death is an illusion, and that an eternity of perfect splendor awaits us beyond the grave—complete with the usual angels, clouds, and departed relatives, but also butterflies and beautiful girls in peasant dress. Our current understanding of the mind “now lies broken at our feet”—for, as the doctor writes, “What happened to me destroyed it, and I intend to spend the rest of my life investigating the true nature of consciousness and making the fact that we are more, much more, than our physical brains as clear as I can, both to my fellow scientists and to people at large.” \n \n Well, I intend to spend the rest of the morning sparing him the effort. Whether you read it online or hold the physical object in your hands, this issue of Newsweek is best viewed as an archaeological artifact that is certain to embarrass us in the eyes of future generations. Its existence surely says more about our time than the editors at the magazine meant to say—for the cover alone reveals the abasement and desperation of our journalism, the intellectual bankruptcy and resultant tenacity of faith-based religion, and our ubiquitous confusion about the nature of scientific authority. The article is the modern equivalent of a 14th-century woodcut depicting the work of alchemists, inquisitors, Crusaders, and fortune-tellers. I hope our descendants understand that at least some of us were blushing. \n \n As many of you know, I am interested in “spiritual” experiences of the sort Alexander reports. Unlike many atheists, I don’t doubt the subjective phenomena themselves—that is, I don’t believe that everyone who claims to have seen an angel, or left his body in a trance, or become one with the universe, is lying or mentally ill. Indeed, I have had similar experiences myself in meditation, in lucid dreams (even while meditating in a lucid dream), and through the use of various psychedelics (in times gone by). I know that astonishing changes in the contents of consciousness are possible and can be psychologically transformative. \n \n And, unlike many neuroscientists and philosophers, I remain agnostic on the question of how consciousness is related to the physical world. There are, of course, very good reasons to believe that it is an emergent property of brain activity, just as the rest of the human mind obviously is. But we know nothing about how such a miracle of emergence might occur. And if consciousness were, in fact, irreducible—or even separable from the brain in a way that would give comfort to Saint Augustine—my worldview would not be overturned. I know that we do not understand consciousness, and nothing that I think I know about the cosmos, or about the patent falsity of most religious beliefs, requires that I deny this. So, although I am an atheist who can be expected to be unforgiving of religious dogma, I am not reflexively hostile to claims of the sort Alexander has made. In principle, my mind is open. (It really is.) \n \n But Alexander’s account is so bad—his reasoning so lazy and tendentious—that it would be beneath notice if not for the fact that it currently disgraces the cover of a major newsmagazine. Alexander is also releasing a book at the end of the month, Proof of Heaven: A Neurosurgeon’s Journey into the Afterlife, which seems destined to become an instant bestseller. As much as I would like to simply ignore the unfolding travesty, it would be derelict of me to do so. \n \n But first things first: You really must read Alexander’s article. \n \n I trust that doing so has given you cause to worry that the good doctor is just another casualty of American-style Christianity—for though he claims to have been a nonbeliever before his adventures in coma, he presents the following self-portrait: \n \n Although I considered myself a faithful Christian, I was so more in name than in actual belief. I didn’t begrudge those who wanted to believe that Jesus was more than simply a good man who had suffered at the hands of the world. I sympathized deeply with those who wanted to believe that there was a God somewhere out there who loved us unconditionally. In fact, I envied such people the security that those beliefs no doubt provided. But as a scientist, I simply knew better than to believe them myself. \n \n What it means to be a “faithful Christian” without “actual belief” is not spelled out, but few nonbelievers will be surprised when our hero’s scientific skepticism proves no match for his religious conditioning. Most of us have been around this block often enough to know that many “former atheists”—like Francis Collins—spent so long on the brink of faith, and yearned for its emotional consolations with such vampiric intensity, that the slightest breeze would send them spinning into the abyss. For Collins, you may recall, all it took to establish the divinity of Jesus and the coming resurrection of the dead was the sight of a frozen waterfall. Alexander seems to have required a ride on a psychedelic butterfly. In either case, it’s not the perception of beauty we should begrudge but the utter absence of intellectual seriousness with which the author interprets it. \n \n Everything—absolutely everything—in Alexander’s account rests on repeated assertions that his visions of heaven occurred while his cerebral cortex was “shut down,” “inactivated,” “completely shut down,” “totally offline,” and “stunned to complete inactivity.” The evidence he provides for this claim is not only inadequate—it suggests that he doesn’t know anything about the relevant brain science. Perhaps he has saved a more persuasive account for his book—though now that I’ve listened to an hour-long interview with him online, I very much doubt it. In his Newsweek article, Alexander asserts that the cessation of cortical activity was “clear from the severity and duration of my meningitis, and from the global cortical involvement documented by CT scans and neurological examinations.” To his editors, this presumably sounded like neuroscience. \n \n The problem, however, is that “CT scans and neurological examinations” can’t determine neuronal inactivity—in the cortex or anywhere else. And Alexander makes no reference to functional data that might have been acquired by fMRI, PET, or EEG—nor does he seem to realize that only this sort of evidence could support his case. Obviously, the man’s cortex is functioning now—he has, after all, written a book—so whatever structural damage appeared on CT could not have been “global.” (Otherwise, he would be claiming that his entire cortex was destroyed and then grew back.) Coma is not associated with the complete cessation of cortical activity, in any case. And to my knowledge, almost no one thinks that consciousness is purely a matter of cortical activity. Alexander’s unwarranted assumptions are proliferating rather quickly. Why doesn’t he know these things? He is, after all, a neurosurgeon who survived a coma and now claims to be upending the scientific worldview on the basis of the fact that his cortex was totally quiescent at the precise moment he was enjoying the best day of his life in the company of angels. Even if his entire cortex had truly shut down (again, an incredible claim), how can he know that his visions didn’t occur in the minutes and hours during which its functions returned? \n \n I confess that I found Alexander’s account so alarmingly unscientific that I began to worry that something had gone wrong with my own brain. So I sought the opinion of Mark Cohen, a pioneer in the field of neuroimaging who holds appointments in the Departments of Psychiatry & Biobehavioral Science, Neurology, Psychology, Radiological Science, and Bioengineering at UCLA. (He was also my thesis advisor.) Here is part of what he had to say: \n \n This poetic interpretation of his experience is not supported by evidence of any kind. As you correctly point out, coma does not equate to “inactivation of the cerebral cortex” or “higher-order brain functions totally offline” or “neurons of [my] cortex stunned into complete inactivity”. These describe brain death, a one hundred percent lethal condition. There are many excellent scholarly articles that discuss the definitions of coma. (For example: 1 & 2) \n \n \n \n We are not privy to his EEG records, but high alpha activity is common in coma. Also common is “flat” EEG. The EEG can appear flat even in the presence of high activity, when that activity is not synchronous. For example, the EEG flattens in regions involved in direct task processing. This phenomenon is known as event-related desynchronization (hundreds of references). \n \n \n \n As is obvious to you, this is truth by authority. Neurosurgeons, however, are rarely well-trained in brain function. Dr. Alexander cuts brains; he does not appear to study them. “There is no scientific explanation for the fact that while my body lay in coma, my mind—my conscious, inner self—was alive and well. While the neurons of my cortex were stunned to complete inactivity by the bacteria that had attacked them, my brain-free consciousness ...” True, science cannot explain brain-free consciousness. Of course, science cannot explain consciousness anyway. In this case, however, it would be parsimonious to reject the whole idea of consciousness in the absence of brain activity. Either his brain was active when he had these dreams, or they are a confabulation of whatever took place in his state of minimally conscious coma. \n \n \n \n There are many reports of people remembering dream-like states while in medical coma. They lack consistency, of course, but there is nothing particularly unique in Dr. Alexander’s unfortunate episode. \n \n Okay, so it appears that my own cortex hasn’t completely shut down. In fact, there are further problems with Alexander’s account. Not only does he appear ignorant of the relevant science, but he doesn’t realize how many people have experienced visions similar to his while their brains were operational. In his online interview we learn about the kinds of conversations he’s now having with skeptics: \n \n I guess one could always argue, “Well, your brain was probably just barely able to ignite real consciousness and then it would flip back into a very diseased state,” which doesn’t make any sense to me. Especially because that hyper-real state is so indescribable and so crisp. It’s totally unlike any drug experience. A lot of people have come up to me and said, “Oh that sounds like a DMT experience,” or “That sounds like ketamine.” Not at all. That is not even in the right ballpark. \n \n \n \n Those things do not explain the kind of clarity, the rich interactivity, the layer upon layer of understanding and of lessons taught by deceased loved ones and spiritual beings. \n \n “Not even in the right ballpark”? His experience sounds so much like a DMT trip that we are not only in the right ballpark, we are talking about the stitching on the same ball. Here is Alexander’s description of the afterlife: \n \n I was a speck on a beautiful butterfly wing; millions of other butterflies around us. We were flying through blooming flowers, blossoms on trees, and they were all coming out as we flew through them… [there were] waterfalls, pools of water, indescribable colors, and above there were these arcs of silver and gold light and beautiful hymns coming down from them. Indescribably gorgeous hymns. I later came to call them “angels,” those arcs of light in the sky. I think that word is probably fairly accurate…. \n \n \n \n Then we went out of this universe. I remember just seeing everything receding and initially I felt as if my awareness was in an infinite black void. It was very comforting but I could feel the extent of the infinity and that it was, as you would expect, impossible to put into words. I was there with that Divine presence that was not anything that I could visibly see and describe, and with a brilliant orb of light…. \n \n \n \n They said there were many things that they would show me, and they continued to do that. In fact, the whole higher-dimensional multiverse was this incredibly complex corrugated ball and all these lessons coming into me about it. Part of the lessons involved becoming all of what I was being shown. It was indescribable. \n \n \n \n But then I would find myself—and time out there I can say is totally different from what we call time. There was access from out there to any part of our space/time and that made it difficult to understand a lot of these memories because we always try to sequence things and put them in linear form and description. That just really doesn’t work. \n \n Everything that Alexander describes here and in his Newsweek article, including the parts I have left out, has been reported by DMT users. The similarity is uncanny. Here is how the late Terence McKenna described the prototypical DMT trance: \n \n Under the influence of DMT, the world becomes an Arabian labyrinth, a palace, a more than possible Martian jewel, vast with motifs that flood the gaping mind with complex and wordless awe. Color and the sense of a reality-unlocking secret nearby pervade the experience. There is a sense of other times, and of one’s own infancy, and of wonder, wonder and more wonder. It is an audience with the alien nuncio. In the midst of this experience, apparently at the end of human history, guarding gates that seem surely to open on the howling maelstrom of the unspeakable emptiness between the stars, is the Aeon. The Aeon, as Heraclitus presciently observed, is a child at play with colored balls. Many diminutive beings are present there—the tykes, the self-transforming machine elves of hyperspace. Are they the children destined to be father to the man? One has the impression of entering into an ecology of souls that lies beyond the portals of what we naively call death. I do not know. Are they the synesthetic embodiment of ourselves as the Other, or of the Other as ourselves? Are they the elves lost to us since the fading of the magic light of childhood? Here is a tremendum barely to be told, an epiphany beyond our wildest dreams. Here is the realm of that which is stranger than we can suppose. Here is the mystery, alive, unscathed, still as new for us as when our ancestors lived it fifteen thousand summers ago. The tryptamine entities offer the gift of new language, they sing in pearly voices that rain down as colored petals and flow through the air like hot metal to become toys and such gifts as gods would give their children. The sense of emotional connection is terrifying and intense. The Mysteries revealed are real and if ever fully told will leave no stone upon another in the small world we have gone so ill in. This is not the mercurial world of the UFO, to be invoked from lonely hilltops; this is not the siren song of lost Atlantis wailing through the trailer courts of crack-crazed America. DMT is not one of our irrational illusions. I believe that what we experience in the presence of DMT is real news. It is a nearby dimension—frightening, transformative, and beyond our powers to imagine, and yet to be explored in the usual way. We must send fearless experts, whatever that may come to mean, to explore and to report on what they find. (Terence McKenna, Food of the Gods, pp. 258-259.) \n \n Alexander believes that his E. coli-addled brain could not have produced his visions because they were too “intense,” too “hyper-real,” too “beautiful,” too “interactive,” and too drenched in significance for even a healthy brain to conjure. He also appears to think that despite their timeless quality, his visions could not have arisen in the minutes or hours during which his cortex (which surely never went off) switched back on. He clearly knows nothing about what people with working brains experience under the influence of psychedelics. Nor does he know that visions of the sort that McKenna describes, although they may seem to last for ages, require only a brief span of biological time. Unlike LSD and other long-acting psychedelics, DMT alters consciousness for merely a few minutes. Alexander would have had more than enough time to experience a visionary ecstasy as he was coming out of his coma (whether his cortex was rebooting or not). \n \n Does Alexander know that DMT already exists in the brain as a neurotransmitter? Did his brain experience a surge of DMT release during his coma? This is pure speculation, of course, but it is a far more credible hypothesis than that his cortex “shut down,” freeing his soul to travel to another dimension. As one of his correspondents has already informed him, similar experiences can be had with ketamine, which is a surgical anesthetic that is occasionally used to protect a traumatized brain. Did Alexander by any chance receive ketamine while in the hospital? Would he even think it relevant if he had? His assertion that psychedelics like DMT and ketamine “do not explain the kind of clarity, the rich interactivity, the layer upon layer of understanding” he experienced is perhaps the most amazing thing he has said since he returned from heaven. Such compounds are universally understood to do the job. And most scientists believe that the reliable effects of psychedelics indicate that the brain is at the very least involved in the production of visionary states of the sort Alexander is talking about. \n \n Again, there is nothing to be said against Alexander’s experience. It sounds perfectly sublime. And such ecstasies do tell us something about how good a human mind can feel. The problem is that the conclusions Alexander has drawn from his experience—he continually reminds us, as a scientist—are based on some very obvious errors in reasoning and gaps in his understanding. \n \n Let me suggest that, whether or not heaven exists, Alexander sounds precisely how a scientist should not sound when he doesn’t know what he is talking about. And his article is not the sort of thing that the editors of a once-important magazine should publish if they hope to reclaim some measure of respect for their battered brand.']",2,"– Dr. Eben Alexander held a scientific worldview until, he says, he went to heaven.

213,"['When Wilco\'s ace guitarist Nels Cline told The Times recently that his band leader, Jeff Tweedy, was a ""collage artist,"" one who would resurrect ""treasured items,"" Cline was talking pop structures. Yet he apparently could have been discussing an appreciation for vintage cartoons. In what\'s a rare proper music video from Wilco, which is in the midst of a three-night stand in Los Angeles this week, the band\'s ""Dawned on Me"" has been re-fashioned as a tale of love and jealously centered on Popeye the Sailor Man and his familiar cast of characters. \n \n The cartoon, a collaboration between Wilco\'s label dBpm Records and Blow Me Down! King Features, was directed by designer-branding guru Darren Romanelli. Said to be the first hand-drawn Popeye cartoon since 1987, the clip sees the popular spinach-eating sailor trying to distract the love of his life, Olive Oyl, from failling for Wilco\'s Tweedy.

Meanwhile, her family, US politicians, and even her doctor are trying to get her out of a possible years-long prison sentence—for carrying a drug that's one of America's most widely prescribed, NPR reports. Trouble is, Japan's drug laws are among the world's toughest. The country routinely announces busts of amphetamines, which Yakuza crime syndicates smuggle into Japan for those who pull long hours, like white-collar workers, students, and truck drivers. Another problem: Russell's mom sent her the prescription in an old Tylenol bottle, which created the appearance of smuggling. She says she did it to ward off thieves and avoid identifying Russell's illness—attention deficit disorder—in a country where mental illness is stigmatized. But warnings against taking Adderall to Japan do exist online, and so far Japanese authorities haven't budged. ""She made a mistake,"" her stepfather wrote Japanese prosecutors.

216,"['This image show the mummy of an ancient Egyptian man in his 50s who had rectal cancer. \n \n Archaeologists have uncovered six cases of cancer while studying the bodies of ancient Egyptians who were buried long ago in the Dakhleh Oasis. The finds include a toddler with leukemia, a mummified man in his 50s with rectal cancer and individuals with cancer possibly caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). \n \n The researchers found these cancer cases while examining the remains of 1,087 ancient Egyptians buried between 3,000 and 1,500 years ago. \n \n Extrapolating from these cases, the researchers estimated that the lifetime cancer risk in the ancient Dakhleh Oasis was about 5 in 1,000, compared with 50 percent in modern Western societies, wrote El Molto and Dr. Peter Sheldrick in a paper published in a special cancer issue of the International Journal of Paleopathology. ""Thus, the lifetime cancer risk in today\'s Western societies is 100 times greater than in ancient Dakhleh,"" they wrote. [Photos: Ancient Egyptian Cemetery with 1 Million Mummies] \n \n Molto, a retired anthropology professor at Western University in Ontario, Canada, cautioned that some people living at Dakhleh could have died of cancer without any traces being left in their remains and that people in the ancient world tended to have shorter life spans than people today. However, even accounting for these factors, the researchers believe the risk of cancer was considerably lower in ancient Egypt. \n \n In five of the six cases, scientists determined that they had cancer by studying lesions (holes and bone damage) on their skeletons. Those holes were left when cancer spread throughout their bodies. For instance, a woman in her 40s or 50s had a hole on her right hip bone that is about 2.4 inches (6.2 cm) in size that researchers believe was caused by a tumor. In one case (the man in his 50s with rectal cancer), an actual tumor was preserved. Researchers cannot be certain where the cancers originated in many of the cases. \n \n Three of the six cases (two females and one male) were people in their 20s or 30s, an age when it is rare for people to get cancer, the researchers said. \n \n An ancient Egyptian woman in her 20s suffered from cancer that had spread to her skull. She may have had the HPV virus, researchers believe. Credit: Image courtesy El Molto \n \n ""When the Dakhleh cases were first presented at professional meetings, a common comment against accepting the diagnosis of cancer was that \'their ages were too young,\'"" wrote Molto and Sheldrick, a physician in Chatham, Ontario, in their paper, referring to the three young adults. [Image Gallery: Digging Up a Cemetery in Dakhleh Oasis] \n \n However, recent research has revealed that HPV is a major cause of several forms of cancer, including those that often affect young adults. ""HPV is a confirmed cause of cancer of the uterine cervix and testes, and it evolved in Africa long before Homo sapiens emerged,"" wrote Molto and Sheldrick in their paper. \n \n ""The two female and the male burials from Dakhleh, all young adults, could have, respectively, developed cancer of the uterine cervix and testicular cancer,"" the authors wrote. ""We know from current cancer epidemiology research that both types of cancers peak in the young adult cohorts."" \n \n While scientists were not able to genetically test the three young adults to see if they had HPV, other studies confirm that it did exist in the ancient world, Molto and Sheldrick wrote, noting that the virus likely existed in the ancient Dakhleh Oasis. \n \n So far, research into Egyptian medical texts and human remains have revealed no indication that the ancient Egyptians had a specific treatment for cancer. \n \n This image shows an ancient Egyptian child from the Dakhleh Oasis who was between 3 and 5 years old at death. This child died of leukemia, research indicates. His bones were riddled with holes caused by the disease. Credit: Image courtesy El Molto \n \n ""They knew that something nasty was going on,"" Molto told Live Science. However, ""we have no indication as to specific treatments for cancer, because they didn\'t understand [what cancer was],"" Molto said, adding that the ancient Egyptians may have tried to treat some of the symptoms such as skin ulcers. \n \n The researchers said they hope that in the future, data will be gathered on cancer and other diseases in the modern-day Dakhleh Oasis. This data could then be compared to the ancient rate to provide more clues as to how the risk of cancer has changed over time. \n \n Originally published on Live Science.', 'Bones bearing signs of cancer found in an ancient Egyptian cemetery reveal that the often devastating disease is much more prevalent now than it was in the people who lived near the Dakhleh Oasis. \n \n Out of 1,087 skeletons buried between 1,500 and 3,000 years ago, just 6 were found with cancer - two younger women with cervical cancer, and a man with testicular cancer, which have all been associated with HPV; and an older mummified man with colorectal cancer, an older woman with metastatic carcinoma, and a toddler with leukaemia. \n \n That\'s a rate of 5 cases in 1,000 - compared to today, where the cancer rate in Western societies approaches 500 per 1,000 people - a lifetime cancer risk 100 times greater than what it was in the ancient Dakhleh in Egypt\'s Western Desert. \n \n Because soft tissue doesn\'t often survive millennia, the researchers looked for the traces cancer leaves on bone. \n \n Lesions found on the skeletons were consistent with carcinoma, and, although it\'s difficult to diagnose based simply on bones, the researchers were able to determine the most likely types based on the distribution and types of legion, as well as the age and sex of the person. \n \n Three of them - two women and a man - fell outside the normal age range, dying in their 20s and 30s. \n \n ""When the Dakhleh cases were first presented at professional meetings a common comment against accepting the diagnosis of cancer was that \'their ages were too young\'!"" the researchers, anthropologist El Molto of The University of Western Ontario and Ontario physician Peter Sheldrick, wrote in their paper. \n \n But the 25-30-year-old male was likely afflicted with testicular cancer, since that age is the highest risk group, and the two young women were most likely afflicted by cervical cancer. \n \n Both of these types of cancer are linked with HPV, recent research has found (although its implication in testicular cancer is rare) - and HPV has been around for a very long time, much longer than the age of the bones. \n \n And all strains of the virus evolved in Africa. \n \n ""The two female and the male burials from Dakhleh, all young adults, could have respectively developed cancer of the uterine cervix and testicular cancer,"" Molto and Sheldrick wrote. \n \n ""We know from current cancer epidemiology research that both types of cancers peak in the young adult cohorts and the HPV risk factor would have likely been present the paleoecology of ancient Dakhleh."" \n \n Interestingly, the older male mummy had soft tissue preserved, including a tumour. This meant that a full autopsy and tissue analysis could be performed, positively identifying rectal adenocarcinoma. \n \n The older woman most likely had ovarian, breast, or colorectal cancer; and the child, in whom almost every single bone showed signs of a systemic disease, probably had acute leukaemia, given its prevalence among that age group. \n \n There are some caveats guiding estimates of the prevalence of cancer in ancient Egypt. Firstly, the average lifespan was shorter - only 7.7 percent of the ancient Dakhlans were estimated to be over 60 years of age, the researchers said. \n \n Given that a quarter of new cancer cases are diagnosed between the ages of 65 and 74, according to the US National Cancer Council, this shorter lifespan could impact lifetime cancer risk. \n \n Another factor that could affect results is the relative lack of soft tissue. Cancer doesn\'t always leave a mark on bones, so there could have been some cases among the 1,087 skeletons that the researchers missed. \n \n Even accounting for these caveats, however, Molto and Sheldrick believe that the prevalence of cancer was still at least 50 times lower in ancient Dakhleh. \n \n ""In our opinion, it is doubtful that even if the ancient Dakhlans had the same life expectancy as modern western societies the rate of cancer would have been equivalent,"" they wrote in their paper. \n \n ""The carcinogenic load in their past environments would have been considerably less carcinogenic than modern western societies."" \n \n The research has been published in the International Journal of Paleopathology.']",2,"– Diagnoses have just been made for patients who've been dead for thousands of years. Researchers digging in Egypt have uncovered six cases of cancer among ancient Egyptians, including a young child with leukemia, a middle-aged woman with a carcinoma—most likely ovarian, breast, or colorectal cancer—and a middle-aged man with a preserved tumor indicating rectal cancer, per Live Science and ScienceAlert. Based on those and three other cancer cases perhaps caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV), found among the remains of 1,087 Egyptians buried 1,500 to 3,000 years ago in a cemetery in the Dakhleh Oasis, researchers say ancient residents had a 0.5% risk of developing cancer during their lifetimes, compared to the ""100 times greater"" risk of 50% for people living in the West today. In most cases, researchers had to identify cancers based on bone damage, including holes left by tumors, and admit traces of disease could've long ago vanished. Still, the finding makes sense since ancient Egyptians had significantly shorter life spans than modern humans (which would affect lifetime cancer risk) and ""the carcinogenic load in their past environments would have been considerably less carcinogenic than modern Western societies,"" anthropologist El Molto and doctor Peter Sheldrick write in the International Journal of Paleopathology. As three of the six cases occurred in people who died relatively young, in their 20s and 30s, the pair suspect HPV could be to blame. ""HPV is a confirmed cause of cancer of the uterine cervix and testes"" and ""both types of cancers peak in the young adult cohorts,"" write the authors, who found no evidence of cancer treatment.

218,"['The Bluefin-21 underwater vehicle is hoisted back aboard the Australian ship Ocean Shield after successful buoyancy testing in the Indian Ocean. (U.S. Navy / Getty Images / ) \n \n BEIJING -- An unmanned underwater vehicle will be deployed to look for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 on the floor of the Indian Ocean, Australian authorities said Monday, and investigators have collected samples from an oil slick discovered in the search area. \n \n With six days having passed with no further detection of “pings” from what may have been the plane’s black boxes, searchers on the Australian ship Ocean Shield will cease using the U.S. Navy’s towed pinger locator and deploy the Bluefin-21 underwater search vessel, officials said. \n \n “It is time to go underwater,” said Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, who is coordinating the search from Perth, Australia. \n \n The Bluefin-21, Houston said, will search an area of about 15 square miles on its first 24-hour mission. It takes two hours to get to the sea floor and will search for 16 hours. It takes another two hours to bring the Bluefin-21 to the surface and four hours to download and analyze the data it has collected. The Bluefin-21, which moves at a walking pace, produces a high-resolution, 3-D map of the sea floor. \n \n Meanwhile, searchers will work to send the oil slick sample, collected Sunday evening, to a laboratory on shore for analysis, Houston said. “We don’t think it’s from the ships” involved in the search, he said. \n \n Monday marked day 38 of the search for the Boeing 777, which disappeared March 8 en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people aboard. The aircraft’s black box batteries have a guaranteed shelf life of 30 days, so hope is dwindling that further transmissions from the transponders will be detected. Four acoustic signals were earlier picked up by the towed pinger locator. \n \n Houston said the air and surface search for floating debris in the area where the plane “most likely” entered the water would be concluded within two to three days. After that, he suggested, the countries involved in the search would need to consult with one another and determine how to proceed. No debris has been found. \n \n Eleven military planes, one civil aircraft and 15 ships were participating in Monday’s search about 1,300 miles northwest of Perth. \n \n The ocean where investigators believe the plane went down is extremely deep -- 2.8 miles -- and not much detail is known about the terrain. This is an area, Houston said, that is “new to man.” \n \n Asked if other underwater vehicles besides the Bluefin-21 would be joining the search, Houston indicated that investigators had no plans at this point.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. \n \n / Updated By Ken Dilanian, Peter Alexander. and Courtney Kube \n \n Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and one of his senior advisers, has come under FBI scrutiny in the Russia investigation, multiple U.S. officials told NBC News. \n \n Investigators believe Kushner has significant information relevant to their inquiry, officials said. That does not mean they suspect him of a crime or intend to charge him. \n \n The FBI’s scrutiny of Kushner places the bureau’s sprawling counterintelligence and criminal investigation not only on the doorstep of the White House, but the Trump family circle. The Washington Post first reported last week that a senior White House official close to Trump was a ""person of interest,"" but did not name the person. The term ""person of interest"" has no legal meaning. \n \n The officials said Kushner is in a different category from former Trump aides Paul Manafort and Michael Flynn, who are formally considered subjects of the investigation. According to the Justice Department\'s U.S. Attorneys\' Manual, ""A \'subject\' of an investigation is a person whose conduct is within the scope of the grand jury\'s investigation."" \n \n Records of both Manafort and Flynn have been demanded by grand jury subpoenas, NBC News has reported. \n \n Related: Feds Subpoena Records for $3.5M Mystery Mortgage on Manafort\'s Home \n \n It is not known whether Kushner has received any records requests from federal investigators. \n \n Also unclear is what precisely about Kushner’s activities has drawn the FBI’s interest as it investigates whether Trump associates coordinated with the Russian campaign to interfere in the election. Former FBI Director Robert Mueller is now leading the probe as a special counsel. \n \n Kushner met at least once in December with the Russian ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, and he also met last year with a Russian banker, Sergey Gorkov. \n \n Related: Flynn, Manafort Are Key Figures in Russia Probe That Mueller Will Lead \n \n “Mr. Kushner previously volunteered to share with Congress what he knows about these meetings,"" Kushner\'s lawyer, Jamie Gorelick, told NBC News. ""He will do the same if he is contacted in connection with any other inquiry."" \n \n Congressional aides have said they would like to question Kushner about that meeting, and Kushner has said he would voluntarily appear before the Senate intelligence committee as part of its Russia investigation. \n \n Gorkov is chairman of VneshEconomBank, a Russian government-owned institution that has been under U.S. sanctions since July 2014. Gorkov studied at the training school for the FSB, one of Russia’s intelligence services. \n \n Kushner, whose family’s real estate empire is worth $1.8 billion, according to Forbes, wields significant power in the White House. He is married to Trump’s daughter, Ivanka.', 'The Democratic National Committee (DNC) is calling for the suspension of Jared Kushner’s security clearance while the senior White House adviser is under FBI scrutiny. \n \n “The FBI’s Russia investigation reached Trump’s backyard, and now it’s in his house,” DNC Deputy Communications Director Adrienne Watson said in a statement Thursday. “Kushner’s security clearance should be suspended until the FBI’s findings are complete.” \n \n NBC News on Thursday reported that Kushner has come under scrutiny in the FBI’s investigation of possible collusion between Russia and President Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential election. \n \n The FBI’s focus on Kushner does not mean he is suspected of a crime or considered a subject of the bureau’s wider probe of Russian election meddling last year. \n \n Kushner’s attorney on Thursday said that top Trump administration official would cooperate on any probes of his past meetings with Russians. \n \n ADVERTISEMENT \n \n “Mr. Kushner previously volunteered with Congress what he knows about these meetings,” Jamie Gorelick said in a statement. “He will do the same if he is contacted in connection with any other inquiry” \n \n The Washington Post on Thursday reported that investigators are instead examining Kushner’s meetings with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak and a Russian banking executive late last year. The news comes a week after reports that the law enforcement investigation of Russian election intrusions had identified a current White House official as a person of interest, though the person’s identity was not revealed. \n \n Kushner ranks among Trump’s closest confidants as is married to the president’s daughter Ivanka and oversees a vast agenda in his administration.', 'Jared Kushner, a senior adviser to Donald Trump and the president\'s son-in-law, is under scrutiny by the FBI as part of the Russia investigation, it was reported on Thursday night. \n \n Officials believe that Mr Kushner has ""significant information"" and they are reportedly focusing on meetings he held with the Russian ambassador to the US and a banker from Moscow in the weeks after Mr Trump\'s election victory last December. \n \n Mr Kushner, a real estate developer who is married to the president\'s eldest daughter Ivanka Trump, has not been accused of committing any crimes.', 'WASHINGTON—An attorney for senior White House aide Jared Kushner said Thursday that Mr. Kushner would cooperate with any investigations into meetings he had with Russians, amid a federal probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. \n \n Mr. Kushner’s attorney, Jamie Gorelick, said in a statement: “Mr. Kushner previously volunteered to share with Congress what he knows about these meetings.

Attorney Jamie Gorelick said Kushner has already offered to tell Congress all about his meetings with Russian officials and he will do the same ""if contacted in connection with any other inquiry."" Sources tell the Wall Street Journal that federal investigators have been looking into Kushner's Russian contacts for months, though he has not yet been contacted by the FBI. In other coverage: Sources tell NBC News that investigators believe Kushner has information that could be very useful to the Russia investigation, though he's not personally suspected of wrongdoing. Kushner met Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak and Russian banker Sergey Gorkov last year. Democrats are calling for Kushner's White House security clearance to be pulled, the Hill reports. ""The FBI's Russia investigation reached Trump's backyard, and now it's in his house,"" DNC Deputy Communications Director Adrienne Watson said in a statement. ""Kushner's security clearance should be suspended until the FBI's findings are complete."" Investigators are also looking into possible financial crimes, according to the Telegraph, though the Justice Department isn't providing details. ""I can't confirm or deny the existence or non-existence of investigations or subjects of investigations,"" spokesperson Sarah Isgur Flores said. While much is still unclear, there will be plenty of people saying ""I told you so"" if corruption allegations involving Kushner surface, according to Aaron Blake at the Washington Post. Trump's hiring of a family member for a senior White House role was strongly criticized, and ""as any expert on corrupt authoritarian regimes throughout history will tell you, those regimes' wrongdoing will often run through family members with official titles,"" he writes. In a separate development linked to the Russia investigation, House Oversight Committee chief Rep. Jason Chaffetz said he wants to review former FBI Director James Comey's contacts with the White House and Justice Department going all the way back to 2013, the AP reports. He told acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe that he wants to ""better understand"" Comey's interactions with the White House. Chaffetz announced his surprise resignation last week, and Republicans are pushing to have him replaced by somebody who will be in office for longer."

221,"['President Obama has just completed the most arduous act of community organizing of his career. Two hundred and nineteen of his neighbors down the street joined together in the House of Representatives to pass historic health care legislation. Speaker Nancy Pelosi made it happen, but Obama worked harder and more intensely than he has on any other issue of his presidency. He made 92 direct pitches to Democratic members of the House, according to a White House tally. Last week he gave three speeches, culminating in an appeal to fellow Democrats more personal and philosophical than any he\'s given since taking office. \n \n This week the legislation goes to the Senate, where it will be difficult for Republicans to derail the bill (though they might be able to delay it). \n \n ""We rose above the weight of our politics. ... We are still a people capable of doing big things,"" said the president. ""I know this wasn\'t an easy vote for a lot of people but it was the right vote."" \n \n No matter what happens next, Obama\'s sucessful effort to reshape the country\'s social safety net is a turning point in his presidency. This is his project. Unlike the bailout of the auto companies or the stimulus package, health care reform was not a response to an emergency. Whether the Obama presidency is a diptych, triptych, or something even more complex, the first hinge will mark the time before health care and the time after health care. \n \n Advertisement \n \n \n \n Obama didn\'t just work harder to clear this hurdle. He worked deeper, making his final pitch to provide insurance to 32 million people on moral grounds in a more focused way than he has in the last year of debate. Twice this past week he went to the presidential library for moral ballast. On Friday he quoted Teddy Roosevelt: ""Aggressively fighting for the right is the noblest sport the world affords."" On Saturday he built his speech to House Democrats around a quote from Lincoln that touched on the same sentiment—doing the right thing despite the odds. ""I am not bound to win, but I\'m bound to be true. I\'m not bound to succeed, but I\'m bound to live up to what light I have."" \n \n Presidents like to compare themselves to their successful predecessors. It adds to the nobility of their cause and allows them to bask in their reflected glory. But it was clear that when Obama spoke to House Democrats, he was not just reaching for rhetorical tricks. He spoke in personal terms and at length about their collective moral obligation. \n \n He talked about the impulse that moved them all to get into politics and that made them become Democrats. ""Something inspired you to get involved, and something inspired you to be a Democrat instead of running as a Republican,"" he said. ""Because somewhere deep in your heart you said to yourself, \'I believe in an America in which we don\'t just look out for ourselves, that we don\'t just tell people you\'re on your own.\' "" \n \n The push to pass this bill has not only pushed him to use all of the tools of his office—speeches to the public, town halls with members of Congress, addresses to joint sessions of Congress, Q&A sessions shown over the Internet, Air Force One trips for undecided lawmakers, hours of one-on-one cajoling—but it has also pushed him rhetorically. It\'s one thing to say Republicans aren\'t participating in the health care process. The argument Obama made Saturday went further. As Obama framed it, only Democrats care about those less fortunate. \n \n The president continued his personal pitch, empathizing with lawmakers who had sacrificed so much for their office but often felt empty for the sacrifice. Tallying up all the promises lawmakers have made during their careers, Obama offered this one redeeming act to counter the feelings of emptiness: ""Every single one of you have made that promise not just to your constituents but to yourself. And this is the time to make true on that promise.""', 'Obama\'s Place In History \n \n Let me offer a ludicrously premature opinion: Barack Obama has sealed his reputation as a president of great historical import. We don\'t know what will follow in his presidency, and it\'s quite possible that some future event--a war, a scandal--will define his presidency. But we do know that he has put his imprint on the structure of American government in a way that no Democratic president since Lyndon Johnson has. \n \n The last two generations have no model for such a president. The only two other Democratic presidents of the last four decades are Jimmy Carter, a failure, and Bill Clinton, who enjoyed modest successes but failed in his most significant legislative fight. Obama, who helped pull the country out of a depression and reshaped the health care system, has already accomplished far more than Clinton. (This isn\'t necessarily Clinton\'s fault--he lacked the votes to break a Republican filibuster that Obama has--but the historical convention is to judge a president by what he and the Congress achieve together.) He will never be plausibly compared with Jimmy Carter. \n \n Historians will see this health care bill as a masterfully crafted piece of legislation. Obama and the Democrats managed to bring together most of the stakeholders and every single Senator in their party. The new law untangles the dysfunctionalities of the individual insurance market while fulfilling the political imperative of leaving the employer-provided system in place. Through determined advocacy, and against special interest opposition, they put into place numerous reforms to force efficiency into a wasteful system. They found hundreds of billions of dollars in payment offsets, a monumental task in itself. And they will bring economic and physical security to tens of millions of Americans who would otherwise risk seeing their lives torn apart. Health care experts for decades have bemoaned the impossibility of such reforms--the system is wasteful, but the very waste creates a powerful constituency for the status quo. Finally, the Democrats have begun to untangle the Gordian knot. It\'s a staggering political task and substantive achievement. \n \n The template of a powerful, historically consequential Democratic president is unfamiliar to many of us. Certainly the Republicans have no real idea how to deal with it. Look at Bill Kristol\'s taunting editorial in the Weekly Standard: \n \n After his 1851 coup d’état, Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte, nephew of the real Napoleon, pronounced himself Napoleon III. It was the rise to power of this great-man-wannabe that prompted the famous opening of Karl Marx’s Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis-Bonaparte: “Hegel remarks somewhere that all great world-historic facts and personages appear, so to speak, twice. He forgot to add: the first time as tragedy, the second time as farce.” \n \n And presiding over this three-ring circus of liberal incompetence was President Barack Obama, who stands in relation to the towering and tragic figure of Lyndon Johnson as Napoleon III did to the real Napoleon. Have we had in modern times a president who was so out of his depth? \n \n It occurs to me that Bill Kristol stands in relation to the towering and tragic figure of Irving Kristol as Napoleon III did to the real Napoleon. But I digress. The broader point is that the Republicans have spent a year chortling over the inevitable collapse of Obama, and they seem to cling even more tightly to that fantasy--""Incompetence""? ""Out of his depth""?--as it slips further away. \n \n Obama\'s accomplishments do not, and probably will not, meet those of Johnson, let alone Franklin Roosevelt. It\'s worth noting that he has smaller majorities, and governs in an era when the republican Party is far more ideologically radical and unified in opposition. A measure of that greater discipline and partisan unity can be seen in the fact that Social Security and Medicare both won significant Republican support, and both were far more liberal and government-centric in their design. \n \n We can\'t know what the future holds in store for Obama.

How did he do it and what does it mean? Here’s what people are saying: “Obama didn't just work harder to clear this hurdle. He worked deeper,” writes John Dickerson of Slate. For the first time he made a cause personal, framing it in moral terms, and urging lawmakers to risk sacrificing their jobs to do the right thing. He showed a newfound “combative stubbornness,” writes Peter Nicholas of the LA Times. Republicans thought this would be his “Waterloo,” but Obama proved “that a president who picks a goal, adopts a battle plan and sticks with it” is tough to beat. The president basically schmoozed his way to victory, says Jennifer Bendery on Roll Call. Through one-on-one talks and social events, he flipped even tough votes like Dennis Kucinich. Republicans have delighted in calling Obama ineffective or incompetent, but that’s all over, writes Jonathan Chait of The New Republic; Obama has sealed his place in history. “He will never be plausibly compared with Jimmy Carter.”"

Just seeing or being told about the signature at the end of the diary would have been enough for him to reach for the phone. \n \n “He was not very literate and the idea that he would have been capable of producing such a sophisticated and credible forgery is not remotely plausible.” \n \n MOST READ IN LIVING GREAT BRITISH BUZZ OFF We rate sex toys from Poundland Bullet to Tango Lipstick to see if discount brands are an anti-climax fresh princess Remember Ashley from the Fresh Prince of Bel Air?

Was he Jack the Ripper? He now has to be a prime suspect, but the disputes over the Ripper\'s identity may well rage for another century at least"". \n \n A limited edition of 25 Years of The Diary of Jack The Ripper: The True Facts by Robert Smith is available from www.mangobooks.co.uk from September 4.', 'A federal judge on Wednesday upheld most of the sections of Alabama’s far-reaching immigration law that had been challenged by the Obama administration, including portions that had been blocked in other states. \n \n The decision, by Judge Sharon Lovelace Blackburn of Federal District Court in Birmingham, makes it much more likely that the fate of the recent flurry of state laws against illegal immigration will eventually be decided by the Supreme Court. It also means that Alabama now has by far the strictest such law of any state. \n \n “Today Judge Blackburn upheld the majority of our law,” Gov. Robert Bentley said in a brief statement he delivered outside the State Capitol in Montgomery. “With those parts that were upheld, we have the strongest immigration law in the country.” \n \n The judge did issue a preliminary injunction against several sections of the law, agreeing with the government’s case that they pre-empted federal law. She blocked a broad provision that outlawed the harboring or transporting of illegal immigrants and another that barred illegal immigrants from enrolling in or attending public universities. \n \n The governor, in his statement, said he believed even the sections that were temporarily enjoined on Wednesday would eventually be upheld, and added that the state would consider appealing if that did not happen. \n \n For the most part, Judge Blackburn, who was appointed by the elder President George Bush, disagreed with the Justice Department’s arguments, including those that had been successful in challenges to laws in Arizona and Georgia. \n \n The judge upheld a section that requires state and local law enforcement officials to try to verify a person’s immigration status during routine traffic stops or arrests, if “a reasonable suspicion” exists that the person is in the country illegally. And she ruled that a section that criminalized the “willful failure” of a person in the country illegally to carry federal immigration papers did not pre-empt federal law. \n \n In both cases, she rejected the reasoning of district and appeals courts that had blocked similar portions of Arizona’s law. Legal experts expected the Justice Department to appeal. \n \n “The department is reviewing the decision to determine next steps,” Xochitl Hinojosa, a department spokeswoman, said in a statement. “We will continue to evaluate state immigration-related laws and will not hesitate to bring suit if, in fact, a state creates its own immigration policy or enforces state laws in a manner that interferes with federal immigration law.” \n \n The Alabama law was the latest, and broadest, of the state laws against illegal immigration, going further than one passed in Arizona. \n \n While Alabama is estimated to have a relatively small population of people who are in the country illegally, the numbers have been growing. \n \n Acting on a pledge that they would crack down on illegal immigration, Republicans passed the bill when they won a supermajority in the State Legislature in the 2010 elections. Mr. Bentley signed it into law in June. \n \n Del Marsh, the Republican president pro tem of the Alabama Senate, said in a statement after Wednesday’s ruling, “Our goal has always been to make sure Alabama jobs and taxpayer-funded resources are going to legal Alabama residents, and Judge Blackburn’s ruling is a significant win for this cause.” \n \n All summer, rallies for and against the law have been taking place throughout the state. Farmers and even the state agriculture commissioner have raised concerns about the law’s effect on farms, sheriffs have condemned it as too onerous for financially hurting counties and others have worried that it could seriously hinder the state’s efforts to rebuild after last April’s devastating tornadoes. \n \n The law’s backers argued that most of the concerns arose out of a misreading of the law that they believed in some cases was intentional. \n \n The judge ruled on three suits challenging the law on Wednesday, one brought by the federal government, another by a group of church leaders and another brought by civil rights groups. \n \n She dismissed the suit brought by church leaders, who had argued that the law prevented them from carrying out crucial duties of their ministry, concluding that they did not have standing to challenge one part of the law and that she had addressed the other challenge in her ruling on the federal law. \n \n Judge Blackburn agreed with the arguments of the civil rights groups on several sections or subsections of the law, but did not address many of their arguments because they overlapped with those put forth in the Justice Department’s suit. \n \n “We’re really disappointed,” said Andre Segura of the American Civil Liberties Union, a plaintiff in one of the suits. “We already know that this is going to cause a lot of problems in Alabama.” \n \n The civil rights groups are planning an appeal. \n \n Among the other sections Judge Blackburn upheld: one that nullifies any contracts entered into by an illegal immigrant; another that forbids any transaction between an illegal immigrant and any division of the state, a proscription that has already led to the denial of a Montgomery man’s application for water and sewage service; and, most controversially, a section that requires elementary and secondary schools to determine the immigration status of incoming students. \n \n The civil rights groups challenged this last section on the ground that it would unlawfully deter students from enrolling in school, even if it did not explicitly allow schools to turn students away. The judge dismissed their challenge for lack of standing, though she did not rule on the argument’s merits. \n \n Peter J. Spiro, a law professor at Temple University, said: “This decision really gives the anti-immigration folks more of a victory than they’ve been getting in other courts. There’s a lot for them to be happy about.” \n \n Still, Professor Spiro added, “This is not the last word on the constitutionality of this statute.”']",2,"– In 1992, a 9,000-word diary was found in the floorboards of a home in England containing a detailed confession to murders tied to Jack the Ripper, the serial killer who terrorized London for 10 weeks in 1888. It ended thusly: ""I give my name that all know of me, so history do tell, what love can do to a gentleman born. Yours Truly, Jack The Ripper."" It appears to belong to wealthy Liverpool cotton Merchant James Maybrick, who died a year later, but many experts dismissed the tell-all tome as a sophisticated forgery. Now, the Telegraph reports, a team led by writer and film director Bruce Robinson has unearthed timecards that show which electricians were working on Maybrick's home, Battlecrease House, on March 9, 1992, the morning the book was said to have been found. The man who came up with the diary, scrap metal dealer Mike Barrett, claimed to have gotten it through a family friend who died soon thereafter, leading many to believe it was a fake. But Barrett was a colorful character who frequented the Saddle Inn public house in Anfield, where one of the electricians working on Battlecrease House was also a regular. Because Barrett fancied himself a writer, it is believed that the electricians who found the book passed it onto Barrett, who then famously contacted a London literary agent that very day in March claiming he had Jack the Ripper's diary, adds the Sun. Mental Floss notes that many suspects have been proposed over the decades, including a former royal obstetrician. (The Ripper's last known victim remains mysterious.)"

225,"['geograph.org.uk The quest for definitive proof of bigfoot, the towering man-like ape that reportedly walks on two legs and terrorizes loggers and campers in North America, has been well documented for decades. The search for his Russian counterpart is less well known. \n \n A group of Russian enthusiasts says they have new evidence of the existence of a Russian bigfoot — and it was found just outside of Moscow. \n \n On a table inside the capital\'s illustrious State Darwin Museum last month, surrounded by glass cases containing beetles and moths, lies the purported proof: a fragment of tree bark that appears to have been marked by a large primate. \n \n The bark sample was taken by Andrei Stroganov, a biophysical technologist at Moscow\'s Agricultural Academy, from an uprooted two-meter-long tree trunk that he says had been planted in the earth and marked with horizontal scratches. Stroganov found the curiosity in July in a forested area near a railway line in the Solnechnogorsk district — just five kilometers from the Moscow satellite town of Zelenograd — while scouring the forests for signs of the Almas, as the Russian bigfoot is known, after hearing reports that such a creature had been spotted in the area. \n \n ""The Almas is cosmopolitan,"" jokes Stroganov in response to an expression of alarm at its apparent proximity to the capital. \n \n ""I am not worried: They are benevolent and need our protection."" \n \n Igor Burtsev, an athletic septuagenarian who has become Russia\'s most vocal publicist for Almas research and is also present in the Darwin Museum, concurs. He calls the as yet mythical creatures ""Forest People"" and sees them as a hybrid species, half-human and half-something unknown. \n \n Stroganov has placed the tree bark behind Perspex glass, over which he has drawn measurements. He thinks the marks resemble a paw print measuring nine inches across. There are no thumb marks, nor are there the claw marks of a bear. \n \n Stroganov takes swabs of the bark prints and, with Burtsev videoing the proceedings, secures them in small plastic folders. They will air-mail these to Alabama in the U.S., where the Russian-born researcher Vladimir Yamschekov will do a morphological study of the traces and check out any DNA. \n \n Burtsev heads a closed online Russian-speaking community of researchers and investigators that includes members in Ukraine and Kazakhstan. They all share the belief that the Almas announces its presence with stick structures. \n \n Burtsev has just returned from a 1,730-kilometer journey to the city of Miass in the Urals region of Chelyabinsk, where he stayed with someone who claimed to have seen a Almas and be able to show just such signs of the creature\'s habitats. \n \n He was reluctant to discuss the details, saying only that he had seen ""confirmation"" of the Almas\' presence there. \n \n ""There is more information on this than when I started 50 years ago,"" he said. ""Then again, people have less time now and travel is more expensive. The bigfoot scene in America is bigger."" \n \n Indeed, the quest for definitive proof of bigfoot, the towering man-like ape that reportedly walks on two legs and terrorizes loggers and campers in North America, has been well documented for decades. The search for his Russian counterpart is less well known. \n \n The Soviet government set up a ""Almas Commission"" in 1958 to conduct field work on the matter after Everest mountaineers returned with tales of the yeti. The commission was short-lived, but areas like the Urals, Siberia\'s Kemerovo region and the Caucasus became known as the stomping ground of the real-life Almas. \n \n Burtsev, who lives with his daughter in a Moscow suburb, is waiting on a visa to visit America. There he will reconnect with bigfoot advocates such as Thom Cantrall and Randy Bisson, and hopes to generate interest in an English-language book he has written on the Kemerovo Almas. \n \n Science joins the quest \n \n Russia\'s yeti-hunters have not only allies abroad, but also those who argue against the Almas\' existence. \n \n Professor Bryan Sykes, a 67-year-old geneticist and fellow of Wolford College, Oxford, has written his own book debunking some purported evidence of the creature\'s existence. Sykes previously helped identify the bones of the last of the Romanovs, Russia\'s royal family murdered by the Bolsheviks in 1918. Now, in ""The Yeti Enigma,"" due out in September, he draws on the same expertise to look at alleged yeti evidence. He claims that all the 39 supposed yeti hairs and teeth samples that he tested came from ordinary animals. Sykes has also suggested that the Himalayan yeti is a species of polar bear. \n \n Last October, Burtsev took on his nemesis in a TV series called ""The Bigfoot Files"" broadcast by the U.K.\'s Channel 4. \n \n The two men also clashed over a skull in Burtsev\'s possession believed to have belonged to the son of a ""wild woman"" who had been held in captivity in Mongolia 150 years ago. After testing some samples, Sykes hypothesised that she might have been a black African slave, or a descendant of a group of people who migrated to Mongolia from Africa thousands of years ago. Burtsev insists that the skull\'s shape is not that of an ordinary human. \n \n Michael Trachtengerts, a colleague of Burtsev who also featured in the program, remains unswayed by Sykes\' arguments against the existence of the yeti. \n \n ""The samples he tested were doubtful,"" he says over a recent lunch in a Moscow cafe. ""Hairs from Siberia were identified as belonging to a North American brown bear! How is that possible?"" \n \n Trachtengerts, who has his own dual-language website on the Almas, remains optimistic that proof will soon be found. He is nearly 80. \n \n Mission to America \n \n \n \n While Burtsev waits for his U.S. visa, his collection of footprint casts — as well as the contentious skull — remain stashed away in a Moscow garage. Burtsev hopes to transfer them to a sanctuary in the form of the State Darwin Museum. \n \n The museum has provided a haven for the Almas hunters since 1960. They gather there every month. This does not necessarily mean, however, that the museum officially believes in their cause. \n \n ""I specialize in birds, and haven\'t looked into this problem,"" says Vitaly Kontorshchikov, a staff member of the museum\'s ecology department who was present at the bark examination. \n \n ""However, we can say nothing until we have some real bone samples. No bones — no science,"" he said. \n \n This leaves the usually garrulous Bourtsev silent.

The Heat led by 24 points after three quarters and were never threatened. Despite the fact that this was a mere formality—the Heat had a commanding 3-1 lead in the series and frankly, the Heat were expected to win the title due to their talent—the mood among the team, especially James, was giddiness and joy. Drenched in champagne, he could not stop smiling. In the packed, alcohol-soaked locker room, he became separated from his Finals MVP trophy and immediately started hollering that he needed to hold it again. It is apparently good to be King. \n \n For the Heat, this is the reward for an impossibly wacky two years that began in the summer of 2010, when it became possibly the most disliked team in sports after James ditched the Cleveland Cavaliers to team up with Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade to form a megateam in South Florida. In a twist, Thursday\'s win didn\'t look like the superstar circus the team usually looks like: Sharpshooter Mike Miller, a role player with a bad back, made seven 3-pointers to score 23. Bosh had 24, and Wade added 20. \n \n Podcast \n \n The players, wearing white championship T-shirts, spoke of the evolution of an often-clumsy team that struggled to mesh and sometimes played out like a bad novel. After one game last year, Spoelstra revealed players were crying; in another, Spoelstra and James had what looked to be an angry collision. Miller, in fact, characterized the team by saying ""Everyone\'s dealing with something"" as if it were a soap opera, and oftentimes it was. Wade said the process of becoming a workable if colossal entity was finished this season when he took what could be considered a secondary role. \n \n ""I know I\'m playing with the best player in the world and that doesn\'t take anything away from me at all,"" Wade said. ""It was hard for me to do it, and no one would understand, but it was easy for me to do it for this team."" \n \n That didn\'t come easily last year when the Heat made the Finals but lost to the Dallas Mavericks in one of the biggest flops in recent NBA history. Wade said he saw the team\'s stars ""not wanting to step on each other"" while James saw what he had to improve on—namely, everything. \n \n ""[Losing last year] was the best thing that ever happened to me in my career,"" James said. ""Because basically, I got back to the basics, it humbled me, and I knew what it was going to take and I was hoping to have to change as a basketball player and change as a person to get what I wanted."" \n \n It wasn\'t all smiles—James sidestepped a question about what he\'d say to Cleveland fans tonight, two years after leaving the team during a television special called ""The Decision."" When asked another question about the shortened season, he answered simply that none of it mattered, he was an NBA champion. \n \n James notched a triple-double in a superb 44 minutes, with 26 points, 13 assists and 11 rebounds to set a steady pace for a drubbing. \n \n Oklahoma City was led by Kevin Durant, who had 32 points. \n \n ""I didn\'t want to admit it during the series, but those guys are really good,"" said Durant. \n \n James, meanwhile, said the same about the team he\'d just vanquished and hinted at a sequel: ""This won\'t be the last time we see them in Finals."" \n \n Write to Kevin Clark at kevin.clark@wsj.com', ""LeBron James, Miami Heat win NBA championship, rout Oklahoma City Thunder 121-106 in Game 5 King James' gets triple-double, wins Finals MVP and leads Miami to NBA title two years after televised special 'The Decision' broke hearts of hometown \n \n HEAT 121, THUNDER 106 \n \n \n \n MIAMI — LeBron James danced the last few precious seconds away, soaking up the moment and waiting to take a confetti shower. The one-time child prodigy, with a smile you could see from Cleveland, was a kid once more. \n \n \n \n And finally a King. \n \n \n \n PHOTOS: LEBRON, HEAT WIN NBA TITLE \n \n \n \n “It’s about damn time,” James said when it was over. “It’s about damn time.” \n \n \n \n A few weeks shy of the two-year anniversary of his infamous made-for-television special, “The Decision,” James delivered on his promise to bring an NBA championship to Miami. \n \n \n \n LUPICA: LEBRON'S HEAT WILL TORMENT KNICKS LIKE JORDAN'S BULLS \n \n \n \n Only time will tell if he ever lives up to “five, six, seven” titles he once predicted, but at least James and the Miami Heat have something to build on. \n \n \n \n Title No. 1 for James was clinched on Thursday night as the Miami Heat overpowered the upstart Oklahoma City Thunder, 121-106, in Game 5 of the NBA Finals. James, who uttered the phrase, “I’m going to take my talents to South Beach” when he announced he was leaving the Cleveland Cavaliers after seven seasons to sign with Miami, punctuated his first championship by recording a triple-double. \n \n \n \n LAWRENCE: KING JAMES SILENCES CRITICS WITH RING \n \n \n \n “This right here is the happiest day of my life,” James said from the podium after embracing his mother, Gloria. “It’s a dream come true.” \n \n \n \n The world’s best all-around player also pulled off a rare double by being named NBA Finals MVP in the same year when he was MVP of the regular season. \n \n \n \n It was a fitting encore to the “LBJ Redemption Tour,” which started when he admitted that he should have handled his exit from his home state of Ohio with more class. James also publicly acknowledged that he failed miserably as the Heat lost the NBA Finals to the Dallas Mavericks in six games last season. \n \n \n \n “I was a selfish player,” James said. “I was a selfish person.” \n \n \n \n The hurt from that performance served as motivation for James to return this season as a better, more mature player. He was dominant during Miami’s playoff run, which began with victories over the Knicks, Pacers and Celtics. \n \n \n \n Overall, he scored 30 or more points in 13 of 23 playoff games, including two games against the Thunder. He was averaging 29 points in four Finals games, but with the Heat in control for a majority of Game 5, James didn’t need his A-game. And yet, he still ended the season with 26 points, 13 assists and 11 rebounds. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n LeBron James hugs partner-in-crime Dwyane Wade after the duo help the Miami blowout the Thunder. (Ronald Martinez/Getty Images) \n \n \n \n When Erik Spoelstra cleared his bench with 3:01 to play, James hugged veteran teammate Juwan Howard before raising his right index finger to the crowd. He was then mobbed by his teammates and coaches when he got to the bench. \n \n \n \n Chris Bosh, who left the Toronto Raptors as a free agent two summers ago to join James and Dwyane Wade, added 24 points while Wade scored 20. \n \n \n \n “This is why we came here,” Bosh said. \n \n \n \n “We came here to win a championship.” \n \n \n \n The Heat also got a huge performance from Mike Miller in what could have been his final game. The veteran shooting guard is suffering from a serious back injury and he may be forced to retire. \n \n \n \n If so, Miller, a class act, went out in grand style. He scored 23 points and made 7-of-8 three-point shots. Point guard Mario Chalmers, the hero of Game 4, added 10 points and Shane Battier had 11. \n \n \n \n It was a disappointing finish for Oklahoma City, which reached the Finals by beating three quality opponents: the Mavs, Lakers and Spurs. But after Game 1 of the Finals, the Thunder lost four straight and at times played like a young team in its first Finals. Oklahoma City had only one three-game losing streak during the regular season. \n \n \n \n \n \n LeBron James - aka 'King James' - is finally on top of the NBA. (LynneSladky/AP) \n \n Kevin Durant finished with 32 points, and Russell Westbrook 19 for the Thunder. Sixth Man of the Year James Harden, who struggled throughout the series, scored 19 points, reaching double figures for the second time in the five games. The Thunder trailed over the final 42 minutes while Miami went up by 27 in the fourth quarter. \n \n \n \n Through it all, Heat president Pat Riley sat emotionless for much of the night in his customary seat across from the Miami bench. Riley’s decision to resign as Knicks coach following the 1994-95 season has paid off handsomely for the Heat. Miami has its second title in six years, which gives the franchise as many trophies as the Knicks, who began play in 1946-47 and last won in 1973. The Miami Heat entered the league in 1988-89. \n \n \n \n “I hope to see OKC again,” Riley said from the podium. “I think we will.” \n \n \n \n James and the Heat may just be getting started. At 27, James is in the prime of his career and after losing in two previous Finals appearances, he appears to be more comfortable in this setting. James’ teams went 2-9 in his first 11 NBA Finals games. He has now won four straight and the throne is his. \n \n \n \n It’s good to be the King.""]",2,"– LeBron James was king of the court last night as the forward finally made good on his promise to bring an NBA championship to Miami. The Heat suffocated the Oklahoma City Thunder 121-106 in Game 5. LeBron was the star, chalking up a triple-double in 44 minutes, with 26 points, 13 assists, and 11 rebounds. The Heat led by 24 points after three quarters, and never looked back, notes the Wall Street Journal. ""It’s about damn time,"" James said during the trophy presentation, calling it ""the happiest day in my life"" and ""a dream come true."" James averaged 28.6 points, 10.2 rebounds, and 7.4 assists in the series, and was named the most valuable player by a unanimous vote. Chris Bosh, who left the Toronto Raptors as a free agent two summers ago to join LeBron and Dwyane Wade, added 24 points to last night's game while Wade scored 20. Mike Miller, suffering from a serious back injury that could end his career, scored 23 points and nailed 7 of 8 three-pointers, reports the New York Daily News. James' disappointing history as the antihero of the ESPN special The Decision, when he made his painful announcement he was leaving Ohio for Miami, his flawed role in last year's finals, and his inability to deliver a championship to his Cleveland hometown was blown away in Game 5. Now, ""the greatest NBA player"" without a championship ring ""will soon have one,"" notes the New York Times."
227,"['Apple has discovered multiple cases of child labour in its supply chain, including one Chinese company that employed 74 children under the age of 16, in the latest controversy over the technology giant\'s manufacturing methods. \n \n An internal audit found a flipside to the western consumer\'s insatiable thirst for innovative and competitively priced gadgets. It uncovered 106 cases of underage labour being used at Apple suppliers last year and 70 cases historically. The report follows a series of worker suicides over working conditions at Foxconn, the Taiwanese company that assembles must-have products such as the iPad and iPhone, and lethal explosions at other plants. \n \n Apple\'s annual supplier report – which monitors nearly 400 suppliers – found that children were employed at 11 factories involved in making its products. A number of them had been recruited using forged identity papers. \n \n The report uncovered a catalogue of other offences, ranging from mandatory pregnancy tests, to bonded workers whose wages are confiscated to pay off debts imposed by recruitment agencies. They also found cases of juveniles being used to lift heavy goods, workers having their wages docked as a punishment and one factory dumping waste oil in the toilets. \n \n One Chinese supplier, a circuit board component maker called Guangdong Real Faith Pingzhou Electronics, was axed by Apple after 74 children under the age of 16 were recruited to work on its production lines. According to Apple, the children had been knowingly supplied by one of the region\'s largest labour agencies, Shenzhen Quanshun Human Resources. Its investigators found that the agency conspired with families to forge identification documents. Apple did not disclose the ages of the children involved, but its code of conduct states it will not employ workers under the age of 15, or under the legal working age in any jurisdiction – which is 16 in China. \n \n Apple\'s chief executive, Tim Cook, who in a previous role was responsible for building Apple\'s supply chain, has been under pressure to push through changes after the suicides at Foxconn, whose manufacturing operations are largely based in China. Last September a brawl involving up to 2,000 workers forced Foxconn to close a plant in northern China. \n \n Last year he described the use of underage labour as ""abhorrent"", saying it was ""extremely rare in our supply chain"", and stepped up measures to weed out bad practice including hiring an independent auditor, the Fair Labor Association. \n \n ""Underage labour is a subject no company wants to be associated with, so as a result I don\'t believe it gets the attention it deserves, and as a result it doesn\'t get fixed like it should,"" said Jeff Williams, senior vice president of operations at Apple. He vowed to eradicate the practice, but said it could take some time. \n \n At Pingzhou, the children were returned to their families and the employer was ""required to pay expenses to facilitate their successful return"". Although 95% of the facilities scrutinised by Apple complied with child labour laws, transgressors were told to return minors to a school chosen by their family, pay for their education, and give them an income equal to their factory wages. \n \n Bonded labour was discovered at eight factories. In order to find work, some foreign labourers pay fees to a string of recruitment agencies and sub-agencies, amassing huge debts. Their wages are then automatically handed over to pay the debts, tying them to jobs until the balance has been paid off. \n \n Apple ordered its suppliers to reimburse excessive recruitment fees – anything higher than one month\'s wages – and said $6.4m (£4m) was handed back to contract workers in 2012. \n \n Investigators found 90 facilities that deducted wages to punish workers, prompting Apple to order the reimbursement of employees. Mandatory pregnancy testing was found at 34 places of work, while 25 tested for medical conditions such as hepatitis B. At four facilities, payroll records were falsified to hide information from auditors, and at one, a supplier was found intentionally dumping waste oil ""into the restroom receptacle"". \n \n Apple said it took measures to protect whistleblowers, and that it made 8,000 calls last year to workers interviewed by auditors in order to find out if they had suffered intimidation.', 'One person was killed and at least seven were injured when a runaway tractor-trailer careening down East Hill crashed into Simeon’s restaurant Friday afternoon in downtown Ithaca. By 7:45 a.m. Saturday, the truck was removed from the building and East State Street was reopened. North Aurora Street was closed and fenced off from the Commons to The Mahogany Grill. Restaurants on the east side of Aurora Street were not affected. The driver of the truck sustained superficial injuries and was being questioned at Ithaca police headquarters, police said Friday. The cause of the crash and whether speed was a factor were being investigated. Lindsey Pou, 26, a pastry chef at nearby Madeline’s Restaurant, said she was sitting outside on The Commons when she saw the tractor-trailer barreling down East State Street and smash into the building. She said the driver did not sound the horn, and she did not hear any screeching brakes. There were a number of diners sitting in the restaurant, and more Simeon’s employees were arriving for the evening shift when the accident occurred, she said. A group of construction workers renovating The Commons were standing in the truck’s path and had to leap out of the way to avoid being hit, according to Pou. “Everyone screamed. A lot of people ran to try and help, to see what they could do,” she said. “The response time for the police was really quick, which was awesome. They took hold of the situation.” Police evacuated the 100 block of North Aurora Street and the 200 block of East State-MLK Street, according to Ithaca Police Department Public Information Officer Jamie Williamson. A small fire started in the bar area of Simeon’s immediately after the collision but was extinguished. The city engineer’s office as well as an outside engineering firm were evaluating the building. After the truck collided with the restaurant, the building’s front corner collapsed, leaving a gaping hole in the apartments above Simeon’s. Ithaca Mayor Svante Myrick said the occupants of the apartments were not home at the time of the collision. \n \n (Page 2 of 3) \n \n Myrick advised people to avoid the east end of The Commons for the time being. “There is some risk of the building collapsing,” he said. “We did bring in a crane. We have our building inspectors on the scene. They are going to tell us what we need to do to the building to keep it stable. We want to save the building if we can. It’s beautiful land, it’s historic, but safety is our number one priority right now. If we feel that the building is going to collapse, we will take it down ourselves.” Late Friday evening, a crane tore a section off the four-story building’s roof. Tow trucks were on the scene to remove the car carrier. Williamson said four injured people had been transported to Cayuga Medical Center with an additional person possibly arriving on their own. A hospital spokesperson said seven injured people had been admitted. None of the injuries was considered life-threatening, they said. The names of the person killed and of the driver were not immediately released. Previous accidents Pou noted that the particular location has a history of such accidents. In September 2010, a dump truck headed down the State-Martin Luther King Street hill and hit the Community School of Music and Art building at Seneca Way. Only the driver was hurt. Authorities said he apparently lost control of the gravel-laden truck, which then rolled over and hit parked cars, then the building. The driver was pinned but extricated within 15 minutes. The building was evacuated and closed until damages were repaired and it was confirmed safe. In 2008, police suspected brake failure when a northbound car headed down South Hill on Aurora Street and hit a parked delivery truck in the 100 block of the street. The driver and four children riding with her were hospitalized. “I don’t want to say this frequently happens, but this isn’t the first time we’ve had a horrible accident of this magnitude here,” Pou said. Myrick said tractor-trailers are allowed on East State-Martin Luther King Jr. Street, given that it is a state route, and he noted that bollards are installed on The Commons to avoid such accidents, although they were not enough to withstand a large tractor-trailer towing two decks of cars.']",2,"– Two key facts about billionaire Robert Mercer: He is, in the words of a recent New Yorker profile, the ""reclusive hedge-fund tycoon behind the Trump presidency."" Second, the IRS is going after his Renaissance Technologies fund for nearly $7 billion in back taxes. All of which sets up a dicey situation for President Trump, as a story at McClatchy News Service explains. Mercer wants IRS chief John Koskinen booted from office, and he's pushing Trump to fire him before his five-year term expires in November. The president has not tipped his hand on whether he'll do that, but it makes for ""bad optics,"" per the chief ethics adviser in the George W. Bush White House. ""The guy’s got a big case in front of the IRS,"" says Richard Painter. ""He’s trying to put someone in there who’s going to drop the case. Is the president of the United States going to succumb to that?"" Mercer, whose daughter Rebekah is a major political player on the right as well, ramped up political contributions to conservative groups after the IRS began investigating his fund's use of a complicated banking method known as ""basket options"" in 2010 to cut its tax bill, reports McClatchy. The method involves converting short-term gains on trades into long-term gains, which are taxed at a lower rate. The IRS does not comment on ongoing cases, but a Senate panel accused the fund of short-changing the agency of at least $6.8 billion. The company has maintained that it did nothing illegal. One thing that could work in the Mercers' favor: They have long ties to top Trump strategist Steve Bannon. Still, a Columbia professor says that even if the Mercers succeed in getting Koskinen fired, it's doubtful that would upend a years-long IRS case."
228,"['BALTIMORE (WJZ) — A Baltimore attorney defending a man accused of rape is now out of jail after authorities say they caught him trying to bribe the victim and a witness in the case. \n \n Christos Vasiliades faces a litany of charges, including obstruction of justice and witness intimidation. \n \n “This is terrible. This is as bad as it gets. You’ve got an officer of the court, who is supposed to uphold the law, really attempting to induce a witness not to testify,” says Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh. \n \n Vasiliades’ lawyer released the following statement: \n \n “The State has the enormous burden of proving guilt beyond reasonable doubt. Unless and until the State proves each and every allegation to a near certitude, Mr. Vasiliades is innocent.” \n \n The investigation into Vasiliades began back in April, when he is accused of contacting the victim his client, Mario Aguilar-Delossantoso, is accused of raping, along with a witness in the case. \n \n During that meeting, he reportedly warned the victim and witness of the increased risk of deportation if they were to testify in court. He also offered to pay them is they didn’t show up to court and dropped the charges. \n \n Frosh says the local attorney tried to take advantage of a climate of fear in Baltimore’s immigrant population. Many who are afraid to report crimes. \n \n “We’ve heard rumblings that these kinds of actions go on, but we haven’t been able to prove it. In this case, we have a taped conversation,” Frosh says. \n \n The victim contacted police, and agreed to wear a recording device when they met up with Vasiliades again. \n \n They met with Vasiliades again on May 18, and during that meeting, he ordered everyone to keep their cell phones in the lobby, and didn’t allow them to bring phones into the office. \n \n During that meeting, authorities say they caught Vasiliades on tape offering the victim and the witness $3,000 each if they didn’t show up to testify, and if the case got “thrown out.” \n \n On the recording court documents say Vasiliades tells the victim’s husband “you know how things are with Trump’s laws now; someone goes to court, and boom, they get taken away.” \n \n Vasiliades had a plan that on the court date, the victim and witness should wait outside the courthouse, with a man who would have the cash. When the case was “thrown out” after the didn’t appear to testify, Vasiliades would give the other man a thumbs up, and he would then give them the money. \n \n He also reportedly told the victim and witness that instead of testifying, they should take the money, then “find [Aguilar-Delossantoso] and wear him out,” and “if we were back home where I’m from, from Greece… we would go **** him up, that’s it, if you want to do that, that’s fine.” \n \n The indictment shows he also said, “$3,000, and then find him and kick his ass,” and, “I did my job, I did very good, and I can go home and go to sleep, OK, and then you get something, and then you find him outside, brother, and you **** him up, that’s it.” \n \n He also reportedly reiterated the increased chance of deportation if they were to testify. \n \n “Cases like this that really take us two steps backward are such a shame,” says Elizabeth Alex of CASA of Maryland. \n \n Alex says the organization has spent years trying to eliminate fear and encourage immigrant victims to report crimes. \n \n She hopes this isn’t a setback. \n \n “There is such a big and supportive environment here in Baltimore for these victims when they do come out, but its about getting the message to them that it’s not your fault and there’s people here to help,” Casa says. \n \n Frosh says if convicted, Vasiliades is facing a lot of jail time for most of the charges and could also lose his license to practice law. \n \n Vasiliades pleaded not guilty to the charges. \n \n Follow @CBSBaltimore on Twitter and like WJZ-TV | CBS Baltimore on Facebook', 'A Baltimore defense attorney was caught on tape telling a rape victim that she could be deported under President Donald Trump\'s immigration policies if she showed up in court to testify against his client, according to court documents filed Wednesday. \n \n ""You know how things are with Trump\'s laws now.

Law enforcement and advocates across the country have expressed concern that the undocumented are not reporting crimes because they fear being deported under new policies. \n \n Vasiliades — who boasts of a ""stellar reputation"" on his website — could not be reached for immediate comment on the allegation he used those policies to threatened a crime victim. He was scheduled to appear in court Wednesday afternoon. \n \n He was representing Mario Aguilar-Delossantos in a rape case when he called the victim\'s husband in April and said things had become ""complicated"" and asked to meet. \n \n That night, he and an associate serving as a Spanish interpreter sat down with the couple at a restaurant and warned them that immigration agents would be in the courtroom for their client and that they could be deported, too, prosecutors charged. \n \n The couple reported the incident to law enforcement and authorities were listening in when the husband called Vasiliades a few weeks later and said he wanted to meet to talk more about the offer. \n \n “ I think you should find him and kick his ass, personally.” \n \n The next day, the group gathered again in an office, and this time the husband was wearing a wire when the attorney warned that his client would finger the victim as someone who is in the country illegally. \n \n ""My guy\'s going to be like, \'I\'m here, but she is too!\'"" the lawyer said, according to the indictment.

During a second meeting on May 18, during which the victim's husband wore a wire, Vasiliades allegedly said his client was ""very sorry"" and would pay $3,000 if the couple failed to show up to his trial for assault, rape, and other sex offenses. Referring to his client, Vasiliades said that in his home country of Greece, ""we would go [expletive] him up,"" according to an indictment. ""I think you should find him and kick his ass, personally,"" he reportedly added, per NBC News.

229,"['With financial help from his father and other partners, Mr. Balin opened the Matrix in 1965, designing the stage to accommodate a six-member band. Jefferson Airplane was the first band to play there, and it went on to perform frequently at the club, both on its own and as a backup band for visiting bluesmen. It was the first psychedelic San Francisco band to sign to a major label, RCA, and it released its debut album, “Jefferson Airplane Takes Off,” in 1966. \n \n Grace Slick replaced Ms. Anderson, and Spencer Dryden took over the drums from Skip Spence before the release of the second Jefferson Airplane album, “Surrealistic Pillow,” in 1967, the year of the Summer of Love. “White Rabbit” and “Somebody To Love” — two songs Ms. Slick brought to the band — became Top 10 hits. (Mr. Kantner and Ms. Anderson died in 2016, Mr. Dryden in 2005 and Mr. Spence in 1999.) \n \n For Mr. Balin, Jefferson Airplane was focused on live performance, not commercial formula. “We got to a place where the music was playing us, we weren’t playing it,” he told Relix magazine in 1993. “That’s where you want to get to.

Marty Balin, who co-founded Jefferson Airplane and played on and off with its later iteration, Jefferson Starship, died en route to the hospital in Tampa, Florida, at age 76, reports the New York Times. The cause of death wasn't immediately known. The Times calls Balin a ""prime mover in the flowering of psychedelic rock in mid-1960s San Francisco,"" not only through the band he co-founded in 1965 but through a nightclub he owned called the Matrix. Rolling Stone has a detailed obituary on Balin's interesting career, noting that he was a struggling folk guitarist when he met another guitarist named Paul Kantner and decided to form a band. Other original Airplane members were guitarist Jorma Kaukonen, bassist Jack Casady, drummer Skip Spence, and singer Signe Toly Anderson, but the band didn't truly take off until Anderson left and was replaced by Grace Slick in 1967, notes Rolling Stone. Balin wrote or co-wrote many of the songs, and his ""high and soulful"" voice became a signature sound for the group, per Variety. (Here is ""Comin' Back to Me."") But he was also a savvy businessman, as this old quote from the late Kanter shows: “He was the leader of the band on that level. He was the one who pushed us to do all the business stuff, orchestrating, thinking ahead, looking for managers and club opportunities. He was very good at it.”"
230,"['Eric Gay / AP Senator Wendy Davis listens as the Texas Senate debate an abortion bill before the final vote, on July 12, 2013, in Austin. \n \n A Wendy Davis run for Texas governor may be just what the Democratic party needs as it gears up for the 2014 midterm elections. \n \n And that’s not just because the pro-choice state senator’s June filibuster –11 hours of talk in which she couldn’t lean on her desk, have a drink of water, cede the microphone or change the subject (she was penalized just for putting on a back brace) — was so much more hardcore than Republican Ted Cruz’s recent “Green Eggs and Ham” reading gabfest in the U.S. Senate. \n \n It’s not just because her own personal story – an absent father, a sixth-grade-educated mother, a teen pregnancy, followed by life as a single mom in a mobile home, then community college and, at last, Harvard Law School – gives the party that backs her impeccable “real people” credibility. \n \n It’s a whole lot more simple than that. \n \n MORE: Wendy Davis Eyes Texas Governor Run \n \n Blonde, strikingly pretty, outspoken and female, Davis is, to put it bluntly, invaluable as bait. In her short tenure on the national scene, she has elicited an almost Pavlovian response from anti-woman blowhards. \n \n First, Fox News commentator Erick Erickson called Davis “Abortion Barbie.” Then, a twitter poster, @jefflegal, expressed his support for a gubernatorial bid by the Republican Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott by dismissing Davis as “Retard Barbie”—a rather artless insult that might not have gotten much attention, had the attorney general not tweeted back, “Jeff, thanks for your support.” And just last month, Abbott’s top political advisor, Dave Carney, stepped into the Davis-bashing fray again by tweeting an article from a conservative Texas blog that promised in its headline to explain “why Wendy Davis is too Stupid to be Governor.” \n \n There’s every reason to expect that, as a misogyny magnet, Davis, whom The New York Times has described as an Austin “fashion icon,” will be the gift that keeps on giving all through the upcoming campaign season. Her hair, her clothes, her pink sneakers; the fact that she’s unmarried; the fact that abortion is the issue that brought her to national prominence—all these things sexualize her to a degree that’s unusual for female politicians (as it any accident that Sarah Palin was always dripping with kids?) and they open her up to a very specific, and very ugly, form of woman-hate. \n \n The more hits Davis takes, the better is will be for the Democrats. It was, after all, a consistent pattern of gender-based disrespect that helped land Democrats their 2012 election victories in the U.S. Senate and the presidency. A long pile-up of Republican insults to women’s dignity, particularly in the area of reproductive rights, led President Obama to win the women’s vote by a 12-point margin. Women don’t always vote as a unified block; they’re by no means unanimous in their support for abortion rights, or for any of the pro-family social policies that tend, unhelpfully, to be classed together as “women’s issues.” But they have, in recent years, tended to come together in a common understanding when the “yuck factor” in politics – the macho posturing, the questionable remarks that cut away at women’s hard-won public dignity – just gets to be too much. \n \n Abbott, sensitized by outrage that followed his Twitter thank-you, has tried to backpedal, tweeting his supporters to “Stay positive. ” The admonition, however @Barbie-worthy, hasn’t done much to mollify his critics. The Republican party’s effort to rebrand itself to women doesn’t seem to be working out too well, either. A new United Technologies/National Journal Congressional Connection poll just this week found that 33 percent of the women surveyed felt that the party had drifted even further away from them since the 2012 election. Only 14 percent of women—and just 11 percent of women younger than 50—said that Republicans had moved closer in perspective to them. \n \n Message: we Barbies are no dummies. You can’t change a legacy of policies that insult and hurt women through the power of positive thinking.', 'Politics \n \n The summer’s Democratic hero, Texas State Sen. Wendy Davis — whose 13-hour filibuster against a Texas abortion-restricting bill catapulted her into the national spotlight — is set to be featured in the September issue of Vogue. \n \n The gushy profile, published online Thursday, details Davis’ personal story from a single teen mom to political star. \n \n “Looking back, I don’t know if I could do it again. But somehow you just have the energy to do what you have to do,�? she told Vogue of being a single mom and attending community college classes in the morning while she worked as a paralegal. “And the great thing was, after a year, I realized that college wasn’t only for other people.�? \n \n Davis’ hair struggles (she admitted to having “super-supercurly hair�?), clothing (“She loves to put on something nice, dresses by Chloé and Victoria Beckham, and Miu Miu heels or Louboutins�?), home life (she lives in a “Spanish-style town house�?) and speculation about a potential run for Texas governor are also prominently featured. \n \n In the profile, Davis revealed that she was not always interested in politics, finding such conversations boring when out with her second husband Jeff Davis, a lawyer and the youngest person to be elected to the Fort Worth city council. \n \n “I remember we’d go into restaurants and everyone wanted to talk politics, and I thought, God, this is soooo boring,�? she said. \n \n From bored with politics to Harvard law, law career to city council seat, and State Senate to household name, the profile delves into her potential run for governor. \n \n “I feel confident that the next campaign will sort itself out in due time,�? Davis wrote Vogue in an email after Republican Gov. Rick Perry announced he would not seek reelection. “For now my priorities remain the same—focusing on the work at hand and fighting to make Texas a great place for all families.�? \n \n The word “abortion�? — the practice she fought to protect after 20-weeks of pregnancy in her multi-hour filibuster — does not appear a single time in the nearly 3,000 word essay. The word “antiabortion�? appears three times. \n \n Since the Perry announcement, Davis has remained coy about her future plans. At the National Press Club last week, Davis said Texas needed a change, but would not reveal if she will run. \n \n “I can say with absolute certainty that I will run for one of two offices: Either my state Senate seat or the governor,�? she said at the Press Club. \n \n This week, a lawyer and lobbyist Robert Miller published a report claiming that “credible sources�? have told him Davis will run for governor in 2014. \n \n Davis posed in the Texas Capitol for her Vogue spread, titled “Stand and Deliver: After Her 12-Hour Filibuster, How Far Will Texas Senator Wendy Davis Run.�? \n \n Follow Caroline on Twitter', ""Last updated at 08:13 19 October 2006 \n \n Like most Mail readers, I read the McCartney divorce papers yesterday with mounting astonishment. But unlike everyone else, I also read them with a mounting sense of guilt. It was me, after all, who first introduced Paul to Heather, at the Mirror's Pride of Britain Awards in 1999. \n \n I remember the moment well. It was Macca's first real public appearance since the death of his wife, Linda, and he turned up an hour late after agonising all morning whether to come or not. \n \n 'This is not easy for me,' he whispered tearfully in my ear, as one particularly heroic piece of child bravery was saluted. \n \n More here... \n \n \n \n • The McCartneys at war \n \n \n \n \n \n I genuinely felt for him. But Paul perked up enormously when a feisty buxom lady called Heather Mills marched on stage and delivered a speech about a young girl who had lost her legs to meningitis. \n \n Heather was articulate, opinionated, determined, well-researched and inspiring. \n \n I introduced her to Paul after the show, and before I knew it they'd fallen in love. It was supposed to be the happy-ever-after script that everyone wanted for the world's favourite, tragic, Beatle. \n \n But Heather quickly began attracting unfavourable headlines. Her past, to put it mildly, was 'murky'. She'd been a party girl for wealthy Arabs, had run through boyfriends and fiancés like a bull through Pamplona, and developed an unfortunate tendency to tell endless porky pies about herself. \n \n She was also a fiery little number, prone to rages, rows and general 'anger management' issues. \n \n Stories soon emerged that the marriage was in trouble - at one stage I was played a tape of a message Paul had left for Heather on her mobile phone. \n \n It was heartbreaking. The couple had clearly had a tiff, Heather had fled to India, and Paul was pleading with her to come back. He sounded lonely, miserable and desperate, and even sang 'We Can Work It Out' into the answerphone. \n \n But despite it all, I still rather liked and admired Heather. When I interviewed her for a TV series, I found her to be a tough cookie with a waspish sense of humour, who was rightly proud of the very effective work she does for charity. \n \n But I also didn't believe a lot of what she said, and thought she was ludicrously obsessed with - and touchy about - the Press. I could also sense a growing - and even more ludicrous - irritation that she had to constantly play second fiddle to Paul. \n \n Becoming 'Lady' Heather had compounded her sense of self worth to dangerously high levels, and I began hearing more and more stories of her diva behaviour. \n \n The separation, when it came, only served to confirm what many already suspected: there had been three of them in the marriage - Paul, Heather and her Ego, and one of them had to go. It was Paul. \n \n Since the split, she's been fighting a PR war with Macca - from being photographed locked out of his house, to hiring Princess Diana's divorce lawyer. Operation Make-Me-A-Martyr has been fought with ruthless efficiency in the pages of the popular press over the last few months. \n \n What Heather has never understood, though, is that she can NEVER supplant a Beatle in public affection. However difficult Paul might be - and I suspect that, like most geniuses, he's not the easiest guy to live with - he's still the man who wrote Yesterday, Hey Jude and Let It Be. And the man who had one of the happiest, most loyal marriages in showbusiness, until Linda was so cruelly taken from him. \n \n We all love Macca because he's always seemed such a nice, ordinary type, relatively untainted by fame. And that's why Heather has made such a hideous mistake in making all these horrible allegations about her husband in the divorce papers. \n \n Even if she was not directly responsible for the leak, she must have known that the details would come out, and presumably assumed we'd all read them with horror and a sudden new sympathy for this poor, tortured, tormented soul. \n \n But we didn't, Heather. We all read them with horror alright - horror that you could be so disgusting about our Paul. As for sympathy, that's all going to swing even further his way. Fast. \n \n Let me be clear at this point. There is nothing remotely comical about genuine victims of domestic abuse. But the woman who emerges from these papers is no victim. \n \n The picture the documents paint is of a self-obsessed, demanding, selfish, whining woman, apparently intent on making Paul's life as unhappy as possible. \n \n Every two paragraphs, another incident seems to have occurred because Heather was, by her own admission, 'in a bad mood', usually because someone's said something nasty about her on TV or in a paper. \n \n On one extraordinary occasion she even tries to get Paul to pull out of the Superbowl in America, the single biggest entertainment event in the world, because the Sunday Times is about to be bitchy about her - and Rupert Murdoch owns both the paper and Fox TV, the Superbowl's official broadcaster. \n \n I laughed out loud when I read that. The sheer scale of her self delusion is scary. \n \n As is her hypocrisy. Heather always used to bang on about how she didn't want people to think of her as 'disabled.' She wanted us to treat her as a perfectly normal, able-bodied person. \n \n Yet her court papers are peppered with constant references to her disability. She's permanently either 'crawling up' stairs, or slithering on her hands and knees on to planes, or trapped wheelchair-bound and helpless. \n \n But later we read that she's strong enough to haul a drunken Macca out of the bath, upstairs and into bed. \n \n Make your mind up Heather, you're either Stephen Hawking or Superwoman. Which is it to be? \n \n I felt thoroughly sickened by the time I finished raking through this self-serving rant. \n \n Any sympathy I once had for Miss Mills has evaporated. Instead, I am filled with guilt and sorrow that, as a lifelong Beatles fan, I am at least partly responsible for the hell Paul McCartney is going through at the hands of this vengeful, shameless, ghastly woman. \n \n Paul, it may be a bit late now, but I'm sorry.""]",3,"– Wendy Davis officially announced her candidacy for governor of Texas yesterday, and Judith Warner thinks she's exactly what Democrats need—and not just because of her filibuster-generated fame.

We should have closed that consulate long before Sept. 11, and I put that on the president of the United States.” Dick Durbin on GOP and Libya: ""Darrell Issa does a document dump with sensitive information about those in Libya who are helping keep America safe.

It was blamed for deaths in at least five states, with parts of Iowa and Wisconsin hit with more than a foot of snow. \n \n While some people went to work on digging themselves out even as the storm continued Thursday, others had less control: They were stuck waiting for word of new flight times. \n \n Most of the canceled flights were in Chicago, where aviation officials said more than 350 flights were called off at O\'Hare International Airport and more than 150 at Midway International Airport. \n \n Southwest Airlines, which canceled all of its flights out of its Midway hub after 4:30 p.m. Thursday, was anticipating normal operations Friday morning in Chicago. United Airlines also planned to operate a full schedule, though spokeswomen for both airlines cautioned travelers to check their flight status before heading to the airport. \n \n Erin Henderson is among the people hoping to get out of O\'Hare Friday morning. The 20-year-old college student was trying to return home to Kansas City after five months of studying abroad in Italy when she arrived in Chicago early Thursday evening to learn the last leg of her flight had been canceled. \n \n Exhausted and teary-eyed, Henderson said she planned to get some sleep in a nearby hotel before trying to catch a flight to St Louis early Friday. She said her father planned to drive across Missouri to get her. \n \n ""It was the closest I can get,"" Henderson said. \n \n In Madison, Wis., more than 19 inches of snow fell, prompting the University of Wisconsin at Madison to cancel Thursday\'s finals. Senior Elle Knutson, 21, said she spent most of the day in her apartment chatting with friends on the Internet and staring out her window at the snow. \n \n ""At first it was kind of nice, but I\'m going a little stir-crazy,"" Knutson said Thursday night. \n \n The storm made travel difficult from Kansas to Wisconsin, forcing road closures, including a 120-mile stretch of Interstate 35 from Ames, Iowa, through Albert Lea, Minn.

The Weather Channel reported that parts of 17 states are under winter weather advisories -- as far west as Washington state and as far east as Maine. \n \n The storm brought much-needed precipitation for drought-plagued regions but was bad news for holiday travelers. Most of the nation\'s big airlines responded to the storm\'s threat by enacting flexible rebooking policies for passengers scheduled to fly into the storm\'s path. \n \n The storm led airlines to cancel about 1,000 flights ahead of the Christmas holiday — relatively few compared to past big storms, though the number was climbing. \n \n More than 600 flights were canceled at Chicago\'s two airports, O\'Hare and Midway. O\'Hare is a major hub for both United and American, meaning the disruption could ripple out and affect fliers at other airports. \n \n MORE: Storm snarls flights in Chicago, Midwest \n \n Southwest Airlines, which canceled all of its flights out of its Midway hub after 4:30 p.m. Thursday, was anticipating normal operations Friday morning in Chicago. \n \n United Airlines also planned to operate a full schedule, though spokeswomen for both airlines cautioned travelers to check their flight status before heading to the airport. \n \n American Airlines cancelled flights scheduled to depart after 8 p.m. CT on Thursday. \n \n The snowstorm walloped Iowa, where almost a foot of snow has fallen in Des Moines. State police said a 25-vehicle pileup killed at least two people, and across Iowa 30,900 customers were without power Thursday, including more than 25,000 in the Des Moines area. \n \n The storm dropped as much as 13 inches of snow on portions of central Iowa, paralyzed travel, knocked out power to scores of people and closed schools, government offices and businesses across the state. \n \n ""It\'s just awful out there,"" Capt.

""People need to just stay home."" \n \n The storm made travel difficult from Kansas to Wisconsin, forcing road closures, including a 120-mile stretch of Interstate 35 from Ames, Iowa through Albert Lea, Minnesota. \n \n Most major roads across Iowa remained closed either by official order or impassible due to snow and ice buildup late Thursday. \n \n The Iowa State Patrol said at least 88 crashes occurred on highways and interstate systems Wednesday night through Thursday afternoon. There were also at least 164 emergency calls from the public and 161 motorist assists. \n \n On the southern edge of the storm system, tornadoes destroyed several homes in Arkansas and peeled the roofs from buildings, toppled trucks and blew down oak trees and limbs Alabama. \n \n In southeastern Wisconsin, where a blizzard warning was in effect, sheriff\'s officials said slick conditions led to at least two fatalities late Wednesday when a driver lost control of his car in Rock County, about 90 miles northwest of Chicago. \n \n The weather service was forecasting ""thundersnow"" in Milwaukee and the surrounding areas, where snow could fall at the rate of 2-3 inches an hour. \n \n Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker issued an executive order declaring a state of emergency, which put the state emergency government, National Guard, State Patrol and other agencies on high alert. \n \n At least two people in Nebraska died in crashes blamed on poor driving conditions, the State Patrol said. In many areas, drivers were being told to stay off the roads because of whiteout conditions. Most of I-80 in the state was closed. Nebraska\'s biggest school districts canceled classes, as did many districts across the region. \n \n In Utah, Washington County sheriff\'s detective Nate Abbott says the woman and a man were driving when their car got stuck in rural Washington County on Tuesday night during the storm that hit the Rocky Mountain region. \n \n He says the pair started walking for help, but the woman couldn\'t go any farther and sought shelter while the man continued on. Search-and-rescue teams later found her body. \n \n Although the Plains and Midwest could do without the travel headaches, precipitation should be welcome. \n \n More than 93% of the high Plains region and 54% of the Midwest are enduring drought conditions, according to Thursday\'s U.S. Drought Monitor, a federal website that tracks drought. \n \n Out west, the leading edge of a powerful storm system arrived in Washington, Oregon and Northern California. Rain is expected across Northern California from late Thursday through the weekend, with heavy snow possible in the Sierra Nevada range as the system moves east. \n \n Four to seven feet of snow is forecast to fall above 7,000 feet, prompting the U.S. Forest Service to issue an avalanche warning for Mount Shasta. \n \n Contributing: Ben Mutzabaugh, USA TODAY; Michael Winter, USA TODAY; the Associated Press; The Des Moines Register \n \n Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/RHTLA8']",2,"– Seven people died across four states as a winter storm continued to tear through the Midwest, dumping more than a foot of snow on sections of Iowa and Wisconsin.

Weather warnings are in effect in 17 states spanning the lower 48, from Washington to Maine. But the National Weather Service says the Midwest storm should ""finally begin to wind down"" today; it's headed over the Great Lakes and into Canada. Meanwhile, some 1,000 flights have been canceled—actually a lower number than in previous storms, USA Today notes. About 600 of those were at Chicago's two airports, which could affect travelers elsewhere. Some 20,000 people have lost power in Iowa, particularly around Des Moines, CNN reports. The storm did bring some good news for students at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, which saw 19 inches of snow: Yesterday's final exams were cancelled."
235,"[""Tokyo condemns ‘absolutely unacceptable’ provocation, as Pyongyang reacts to imposition of new UN sanctions following missile tests \n \n We will sink Japan and turn US to 'ashes and darkness', says North Korea \n \n North Korea has threatened to sink Japan and said the US should be “beaten to death like a rabid dog” after the two countries spearheaded fresh UN security council sanctions in response to the regime’s recent nuclear test. \n \n The Korea Asia-Pacific peace committee, which oversees North Korea’s relations with the outside world, described the UN security council, which passed a new round of sanctions on Monday, as a “tool of evil” in the pay of Washington, and called for it to be broken up. \n \n 'Quite backwards': Chinese tourists gawk at impoverished North Koreans Read more \n \n It is the first time that Pyongyang has issued an explicit threat to Japan since it fired a medium-range ballistic missile over the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido at the end of last month, triggering emergency sirens and mass text alerts. \n \n “The four islands of the [Japanese] archipelago should be sunken into the sea by the nuclear bomb of Juche,” the committee said in a statement carried by the official KCNA news agency. Juche is the ideology of self-reliance pioneered by Kim Il-sung, the country’s founder and grandfather of the current leader, Kim Jong-un. \n \n “Japan is no longer needed to exist near us,” the committee added. \n \n The 15-member security council voted unanimously in support of a US-drafted resolution condemning the missile test and imposing measures that include a ban on North Korean textile imports and restrictions on oil exports to the country. \n \n \n \n In response, the committee said the US should be “beaten to death like a rabid dog” for the “heinous sanctions resolution”. \n \n “Let’s reduce the US mainland into ashes and darkness. Let’s vent our spite with mobilisation of all retaliation means which have been prepared till now,” it said. \n \n Japan’s top government spokesman, Yoshihide Suga, described the statement as “extremely provocative and egregious”. \n \n He added: “It is something that markedly heightens regional tension and is absolutely unacceptable.” \n \n A new report has claimed that the detonation on 3 September of what North Korea claimed was a hydrogen bomb involved a device with an estimated yield of 250 kilotons – making it far more powerful than initially thought. \n \n The US-based 38 North website noted that the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organisation had revised upwards the seismic power created by the test from magnitude 5.8 to 6.1. \n \n How has North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme progressed this year? Read more \n \n It added: “This revision is significant because, rather than providing an equivalent yield of about 120 kilotons derived from the lower magnitude estimates, the application of standard formula with appropriate constants shows that the yield can now be estimated to have been roughly 250 kilotons (one quarter megaton). \n \n “Regardless of whether this most recent test was an operational warhead for an ICBM [intercontinental ballistic missile] or simply a device, the yield of the test clearly shows North Korean progress in increasing the yields of their nuclear weapons.” \n \n After weeks of heightened tensions and threats emanating from Pyongyang and Washington, there are signs that US and other officials may be attempting to engage the regime diplomatically. \n \n Play Video 2:10 UN Security Council steps up sanctions against N Korea – video \n \n Japan’s public broadcaster NHK claimed on Thursday that US and North Korean officials had met “secretly” on the sidelines of a security forum in Switzerland earlier this month. \n \n The report did not offer details, but said that Choe Kang-il, deputy director general for North American affairs at the North Korean foreign ministry, and Evans Revere, a former senior official at the state department, had raised North Korea’s ballistic missile and nuclear tests. \n \n While Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has refused to consider negotiations unless Pyongyang abandons its nuclear weapons programme, an MP has claimed that support is rising inside the governing Liberal Democratic party for possible engagement with the regime. \n \n Antonio Inoki, a former professional wrestler, said he had spoken to several unnamed LDP MPs who supported sending a delegation of Japanese parliamentarians to Pyongyang in an attempt to defuse tensions. \n \n In the court of Kim Jong-un: a ruthless, bellicose despot, but not mad Read more \n \n “We are seeing a situation where [Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un] is raising his fist, and the situation is escalating,” said Inoki, who met North Korea’s top diplomat, Ri Su-yong, and other officials during a trip to Pyongyang last week. “It’s important to see who can be the first to lower his fist and reduce tensions.” \n \n The 74-year-old, who has visited North Korea 32 times, said LDP lawmakers had become more receptive to the idea of dialogue. “The political wind has changed direction,” he said, adding that North Korean officials were receptive to the idea. “I made a proposal and was told they would be happy to receive such a delegation.” \n \n In another gesture apparently aimed at lowering the diplomatic temperature, South Korea’s government is considering an $8m (£6m) aid package for North Korea. \n \n Seoul suspended aid to North Korea, provided via UN agencies, after the regime conducted nuclear and missile tests in 2016. But under a proposal that could be approved next week, the South would provide $4.5m to a World Food Programme project to help infants and pregnant women, and $3.5m to Unicef, according to Yonhap news agency. \n \n “The government’s basic stance is that humanitarian assistance to those who are vulnerable in North Korea should be continued regardless of political considerations,” Yonhap quoted a unification ministry official in Seoul as saying. \n \n “Seoul plans to decide the details of the aid and its timing after taking into account the inter-Korean situation,” he added."", '(LEAD) N. Korea invites S. Korean bizmen, officials to talks \n \n SEOUL, May 28 (Yonhap) -- In what appeared to be a conciliatory move, North Korea on Tuesday invited South Korean officials as well as businessmen for talks on reopening a suspended joint industrial complex in its territory.The joint industrial complex in the North\'s border city of Kaesong remains shut down since early April when the communist country withdrew all of its 53,000 workers hired by 123 small-size South Korean factories operating there.South Korea has since proposed working government-level talks to try to reopen the factory zone but North Korea has turned it down, demanding that Seoul should first address more fundamental issues such as joint military exercises with the U.S.On Tuesday, the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea, the North\'s arm for dealing with cross-border affairs with Seoul, said that Pyongyang is willing to start talks on the future of the industrial complex.In a statement issued by its unidentified spokesman, the committee noted that North Korea has already approved a plan by the South Korean business representatives to visit the industrial complex for maintenance and other purposes.""We have given permission for the visit and can even discuss the shipment of products at the industrial complex,"" it said, adding that if the South Korean entrepreneurs visit the North, discussions can be made on the normalization of the complex.The North\'s committee said it will fully guarantee safe passage of all South Koreans who would cross the border for the visit.""If the South feels uneasy, it can send members of the Kaesong Industrial District Management Committee with the businessmen,"" the statement said. The committee is not a government organization but represents the country\'s interests in Kaesong. Its chairman Hong Yang-ho is a former Ministry of Unification vice minister.South Korea\'s Unification Ministry, which handles inter-Korean affairs, was cautious in assessing the North\'s move, saying that government-level talks should be held first. It said business representatives have no authority to discuss the matter.Related to the proposal made, Yang Moo-jin, a political science professor at the University of North Korean Studies, said the North may be trying to abide by the promise it made to China through its special envoy, to engage in talks.North Korean leader Kim Jong-un\'s special envoy Choe Ryong-hae was in Beijing last week and promised to engage in dialogue with interested parties, including in the stalled six-party talks. Choe, the director of the General Political Bureau of North Korea\'s People\'s Army, met with Chinese President Xi Jinping and delivered Kim\'s personal message,""Pyongyang seems to be aiming to first hold talks with businessmen, followed by working level governmental talks that can pave the way for other exchanges,"" Yang speculated.In a separate statement, the North\'s committee criticized Seoul for banning the proposed joint civilian celebrations of the upcoming anniversary of the historic June 15, 1980 inter-Korean summit.""The participation of South Koreans in the event must be permitted and if Seoul is fearful of the gathering triggering internal discord, it can send government officials with the group,"" it said.Pro-unification civic activist groups from both Koreas had jointly marked the anniversary almost every year since the historic inter-Korean summit until a conservative government took office in Seoul in 2008.The sitting South Korean government of President Park Geun-hye barred this year\'s joint civilian celebration of the anniversary, saying that it could create discord among South Koreans.The two Koreas, which remain divided since 1945, are in a state of conflict, as they did not sign a peace treaty at the end of the 1950-53 Korean War.(END)']",2,"– North Korea has made more of the kind of blood-curdling threats that the world found easier to shrug off before Pyongyang stepped up its nuclear program. The ""Korea Asia-Pacific Peace Committee,"" North Korea's state agency for dealing with the outside world, issued a statement Thursday calling for the islands of Japan to be ""sunken into the sea"" with nuclear bombs and for the US mainland to be reduced to ""ashes and darkness,"" the Guardian reports. ""Japan is no longer needed to exist near us,"" said the committee's statement, which also called for the US to be ""beaten to death like a rabid dog"" and denounced the United Nations Security Council as a ""tool of evil."" The committee called for the breakup of the Security Council, which imposed its toughest-ever sanctions on North Korea earlier this week. It called the council a ""money-bribed"" group that does whatever the US asks it to. Before the sanctions vote, which passed the 15-member council unanimously, Pyongyang warned that the US would face the ""greatest pain"" in its history. Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said Pyongyang's threat to sink the country is ""extremely provocative and outrageous,"" the AP reports. The statement ""significantly escalates tension in the region and is absolutely unacceptable,"" he said Thursday. (The world may have underestimated Pyongyang's latest nuclear test.)"

237,"['Media caption The BBC\'s Alan Johnson: ""We will never know the details of their talks"" \n \n Newly elected Pope Francis has met his predecessor for lunch, the first time such a meeting has been possible for more than 600 years. \n \n Pope Francis was flown by helicopter to Castel Gandolfo for the private lunch with Pope Emeritus Benedict. \n \n Benedict has lived at the lakeside castle south of Rome since last month, when he became the first pope in six centuries to resign, citing ill health. \n \n Cardinal Jorge Maria Bergoglio was elected to succeed him on 13 March. \n \n No known precedent \n \n There was no official communique on the results of the Pope\'s brief lunchtime visit to Castel Gandolfo, says the BBC\'s David Willey in Rome. \n \n Analysis There had been intense speculation about how Vatican protocol would deal with the first face to face meeting since the election of Pope Francis between the new Pope and the retired Pope. It was a carefully calculated mixture of formality and informality. Emeritus Pope Benedict embraced his luncheon guest on Pope Francis\' arrival at the helipad at the papal summer villa at Castel Gandolfo, which has become Benedict\'s temporary home. Benedict, who stepped down from the papacy at the end of February, wore a white padded jacket and looked rather frail in comparison to 76-year-old Pope Francis, nine years his junior. The two white-clad clerics then prayed together in the villa\'s private chapel where Pope Francis insisted on kneeling side by side with his predecessor, rather than using the padded papal kneeler prepared for him. ""No! we are brothers, we pray together!"" Francis told Benedict in a gesture of humility. \n \n On the agenda, some delicate handover details, including a top secret document prepared by the former pope on last year\'s scandal involving leaked documents, our correspondent adds. \n \n The new head of the Catholic Church is usually elected after the death of his predecessor, and there is no public record of any previous meeting between an incumbent pope and a former pope. \n \n In 1294, former hermit Celestine V resigned after five months as pope. Boniface VIII was elected days later, and had his predecessor imprisoned. Celestine was dead within a year. \n \n In contrast, Pope Francis has spoken warmly of his predecessor. \n \n One of his first acts as Pope was to call Benedict at Castel Gandolfo, where the former pontiff had been following proceedings on television. \n \n The pope emeritus is expected to stay on at the papal summer residence until new accommodation being prepared for him inside the walls of Vatican City is ready at the end of April. \n \n For his part, Pope Francis will begin the Church\'s most important liturgical season on Sunday with a Palm Sunday Mass in St Peter\'s Square. \n \n He will then lead six more liturgies during the week, culminating with the Easter Sunday Mass and Urbi et Orbi blessing. \n \n New style \n \n The new Pope chose the name Francis in honour of St Francis of Assisi - the 13th Century Italian saint who spurned a life of luxury to work with the poor. \n \n He has called for the Roman Catholic Church to be closer to ordinary people, especially the poor and disadvantaged. \n \n Castel Gandolfo retreat Picturesque lakeside ""castle town"" in the Alban hills, 15 miles (24km) south-east of Rome \n \n Dates back to the 17th Century; its gardens occupy the site of a residence of the Roman Emperor Domitian \n \n Benedict is staying at the palace while a permanent residence is readied inside the Vatican City walls \n \n He has a staff of two secretaries and four women helpers, and is guarded by Vatican police officers \n \n And, only 10 days into his pontificate, he has made some subtle but significant changes in the lifestyle of the leader of the Roman Catholic Church, says our correspondent. \n \n He dresses very simply, preferring to wear plain black shoes under a simple white habit rather than the red leather loafers and ermine-trimmed cape worn by his predecessor. \n \n The first Latin American Pope spurned a special car to take a bus with his cardinals after he was elected, and insisted on returning to his Rome hotel the next day to pay his own bill. \n \n And Pope Francis places himself on the same level as his guests, rather than greeting them from a throne on an elevated platform, which is seen as a powerful gesture after centuries of Vatican pomp. \n \n The former archbishop of Buenos Aires has also started inviting guests to his early morning Mass - including Vatican gardeners, street sweepers, kitchen staff and maids working at the hotel where he is currently staying.', 'Centenarians, people 100 years or older, are more likely to die of pneumonia or as a result of frail health than from cancer or heart disease, compared with ""younger"" elderly adults, according to the results of a new study. \n \n The study also revealed that people who reach their 100th birthday and beyond were most likely to die in a residential care home (61 percent) or hospital (27 percent), and less likely to die at home (10 percent) or in hospice (0.2 percent), said Catherine Evans, clinical lecturer on palliative care at King\'s College London, one of the study\'s authors. \n \n Centenarians are a rapidly growing demographic group worldwide, projected to reach more than 3.2 million by 2050, Evans said. In the United Kingdom, the number of centenarians has doubled every 10 years since 1956, and is estimated to reach more than half a million by 2066. \n \n ""Despite the worldwide increase in the number of centenarians, few studies have considered the health and social care needs of older adults,"" she told Live Science. ""The rising number of centenarians, coupled with continued use of hospital care at the end of life, indicates an urgent need to ensure adequate long-term care and responsive community care services to support people living to advanced age."" \n \n The researchers used data on deaths from the Office for National Statistics for England from 2001 to 2010, which included information on socioeconomic status of the region, place of residence and care- home bed capacity. The number of centenarian deaths in England per year increased by 56 percent over that 10-year period, from 2,823 to 4,393, Evans said. [Extending Life: 7 Ways to Live Past 100] \n \n The median age of the nearly 36,000 people in the study — of whom 87 percent were women — was 101 at the time of death. The proportion of people who died in the hospital changed little over time, despite the increased number of centenarians. \n \n The data also indicated that most elderly people would prefer to die not in a hospital, but rather in an environment where they are surrounded by familiarity, autonomy and loved ones, Evans said. \n \n Evans added that in order to reduce centenarians\' reliance on hospital care at the end of life, the response must be proactive rather than reactive. ""There needs to be a greater emphasis on anticipatory care with contingency planning that details treatments and interventions when an unanticipated, or sentinel, event occurs,"" she said. ""A chest infection, for example, can be managed at home with oral antibiotics and comfort care, rather than in the hospital with intravenous antibiotic treatment."" \n \n Increasing the number of beds in residential care homes may also reduce reliance on in-patient hospital stays for people with extreme longevity, Evans noted. ""Better health care provisions could enable people to remain in their usual residence and reduce hospital admission — a major cost driver in end of life care."" \n \n The study is published online today (June 3) in the journal PLOS Medicine. \n \n Follow Live Science @livescience, Facebook & Google+.

238,"['11 months ago \n \n (CNN) – Former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, who along with President George W. Bush helped send the United States military action in Iraq and Afghanistan, said in an interview Wednesday the White House has yet to justify potential strikes in Syria. \n \n And he sharply criticized President Barack Obama’s administration for allowing details about that potential military action to become public before any decisions have been made. \n \n \n \n “I can’t imagine what they’re thinking, why they would want the Assad regime to have crystal clarity with respect to what they intend,” Rumsfeld said in an interview on the Fox Business Network. \n \n Obama told the ""PBS Newshour"" on Wednesday that he hadn’t yet made a final decision about U.S. military action in Syria, though U.S. officials have been cited widely in news reports pointing to cruise missile attacks on military facilities as a likely American response to alleged chemical weapons use by the Syrian regime. \n \n Acknowledging it was difficult to fully ascertain the administration’s thinking as an outsider, Rumsfeld maintained it was puzzling the amount of information that’s made its way to the public. \n \n ""The idea of demystifying for the enemy what you\'re going to do is mindless,” he said. \n \n Rumsfeld served a secretary of defense from 2001-2006, a period that saw the U.S. begin wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. He said in the interview, however, that current statements from Obama and his aides haven’t met the threshold for intervention in Syria. \n \n “There really hasn’t been any indication from the administration as to what our national interest is with respect to this particular situation,” he said. “When you think about what’s really important in that region – it’s Iran’s nuclear program and the relationship between Iran and Syria, the Assad regime, with respect to terrorists that go around killing innocent men, women and children, including Americans.” \n \n He added that Secretary of State John Kerry, who left the U.S. Senate earlier this year for the top diplomatic post, had been “dealt a bad hand” by his predecessor Hillary Clinton and Obama, who he claimed had created a global leadership void. \n \n “This administration has been in a withdrawal mode, an apology mode,” he said, adding: “That vacuum we’ve created is being filled by people that don’t have our values or interests.”', ""UPDATE: She’s in! \n \n EARLIER: Amy Sherman-Palladino would like Gilmore Girls fans to know there is no bad blood between her and Melissa McCarthy. \n \n Back in early February it seemed otherwise when McCarthy, who played Gilmore’s endearingly klutzy Dragonfly chef Sookie St. James, tweeted, “… sadly no one asked me or Sookie to come back to Stars Hollow.

What could boost his run: his record in Wisconsin on cutting taxes and unemployment, his strong stance against organized labor, and the potential to win Iowa's caucuses based on ""high polling numbers and plenty of grassroots enthusiasm,"" per the Hill. He's not a shoe-in, though. ""He's clearly the frontrunner and there’s a lot of interest in him here,” a former Iowa Republican Party official tells the paper.

Still, Hansen and colleagues expected to see a heat source under Mount St. Helens, as seen at other volcanoes. \n \n Instead, thermal modeling revealed a wedge of a rock called serpentinite that’s', 'Picture a volcanic eruption: fiery lava and smoke billowing skyward as a towering mountain empties its over-pressurized belly of a hot meal. At least, that’s how most of us think it works. So you can imagine volcanologists’ surprise when they discovered that Mount St. Helens, which was responsible for the deadliest eruption in US history, is actually cold inside. \n \n Apparently, it’s stealing its fire from somewhere else. \n \n \n \n Mount St. Helens is one of the most active volcanoes of the Cascade Arc, a string of eruptive mountains that runs parallel to the Cascadia subduction zone from northern California to British Columbia. It’s also one of the strangest. Most major volcanoes of the Cascade Arc sit neatly along a north-south line, where the wedging of the Juan de Fuca tectonic plate beneath the North American plate forces hot mantle material to rise. Mount St. Helens, however, lies to the west, in a geologically quiescent region called the forearc wedge. \n \n Advertisement \n \n “We don’t have a good explanation for why that’s the case,” said Steve Hansen, a geoscientist at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque. \n \n Seeking answers, Hansen recently led a seismic mapping survey of Mount St. Helens. In the summer of 2014, his team deployed thousands of sensors to measure motion in the ground around the volcano. Then, they drilled nearly two dozen holes, packed the holes full of explosives, triggered a handful of minor quakes, and watched as seismic waves bounced around beneath the mountain. “We’re looking at what seismic energy propagates off in the subsurface,” Hansen explained. “It’s a bit like a CAT scan.” \n \n \n \n Advertisement \n \n Their analysis, which is published today in Nature Communications, appears to have created more questions than it answered. From seismic reflections, Hansen and his colleagues learned that the types of minerals present at the boundary between Earth’s crust and mantle are markedly different to the east and west of Mount St. Helens, confirming that this area is geologically special. But instead of finding a hot mantle directly beneath the volcano, seismic data indicates a relatively cool wedge of serpentine rock. \n \n Not only is Mount St. Helens out of place, but it also lacks the magma reserves we’d expect given its violent history. So, where on Earth is Mount St. Helens getting its fuel? \n \n Hansen suspects the volcano’s magma source lies to the east, closer to the rest of the Cascade Arc, where material in the upper mantle is hotter. But that still leaves the question of why gooey rock being forced westward, through the crust or upper mantle, to erupt in this one off-kilter location. Earthquakes in the deep crust may be partially responsible, but more data is needed to confirm such a link. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Fortunately, more data is exactly what Hansen, and other scientists associated with the Imaging Magma Under St Helens (iMUSH) project, are now collecting. What geologists learn about this weird volcano—how its magmas form, how they move around, when and why they erupt—could improve our understanding of volcanic arc systems around the world. \n \n “Mount St. Helens is pretty unusual,” Hansen said. “It’s telling us something about how the arc system is behaving, and we don’t yet know what that something is.” \n \n \n \n [Nature Communications]', 'A diseased ringed seal in Alaska is shown in this handout photo released to Reuters October 13, 2011. \n \n ANCHORAGE, Alaska A mysterious disease, possibly a virus, has afflicted ring seals along Alaska\'s coast, killing scores of them since July, local and federal agencies said on Thursday. \n \n The diseased seals have been beaching themselves on the Arctic coastline since July, with numbers picking up in subsequent months, biologists with the North Slope Borough Department of Wildlife Management and other agencies said. \n \n About 100 of the diseased animals have been found near Barrow, the nation\'s northernmost community, and half of those have died, the borough biologists reported. \n \n Elsewhere in the sprawling borough, villagers have reported 146 ringed seals hauling themselves onto beaches, and many of those were diseased, the biologists said. \n \n Ringed seals rarely come ashore in normal circumstances, spending most of the year in the water or on floating ice, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\'s Fisheries Service. \n \n Biologists said they believe the illness was caused by a virus. Symptoms include sometimes-bleeding lesions on the hind flippers, irritated skin around the nose and eyes and patchy hair loss on the animals\' fur coats. \n \n They said the mystery outbreak may not be limited to ringed seals. Some dead walruses at Point Hope, a village on Alaska\'s northwest coast, were found with similar lesions, borough biologists said. \n \n Local hunters also reported finding skin lesions on two bearded seals, the biologists said. \n \n Yet identification of the disease remains elusive, and it was not clear that the lesions found on the walruses were from the same disease that has afflicted the ringed seals, said Bruce Woods, spokesman for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. \n \n ""We\'re kind of in the dark at this point,"" he said. \n \n The remote locations and other logistical challenges make it impossible to provide veterinary care to beached animals that are sick, said Jason Herreman, a borough biologist. \n \n ""Seals that are found dead are collected for sampling. Seals that are sick but alive are being left to recover on their own,"" he said in an e-mail. Samples were being sent to various laboratories in Anchorage and elsewhere, he said. \n \n Ringed seals, bearded seals and Pacific walruses are all dependent on floating summer sea ice and suffering the impacts of rapid warming in the Arctic, according to federal agencies. \n \n NOAA has proposed listing Alaska\'s ringed seals and bearded seals as threatened, and the Fish and Wildlife Service has also designated the Pacific walrus as a candidate for Endangered Species Act protections. \n \n (Editing by Dan Whitcomb and Cynthia Johnston)']",3,"– Mount St. Helens already stands out as one of the most active volcanoes in the Cascade Arc and the deadliest in the US, since its 1980 eruption claimed nearly 60 lives. It's also an outlier in a literal sense, sitting 30 miles west of the volcanoes that neatly line the Cascade Arc from north to south. Now scientists are reporting in the journal Nature Communications that they've discovered another oddity: The volcano appears to be perched atop what Gizmodo calls ""a cool wedge of serpentine rock""—dramatically unlike the fiery cauldrons of hot magma beneath other volcanoes. ""We don’t have a good explanation for why that’s the case,"" Steve Hansen, a geoscientist at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, tells Gizmodo. His team drilled a couple dozen holes, filled them with explosives, and triggered minor earthquakes to watch seismic wave activity beneath Mount St. Helens, ""a bit like a CAT scan,"" Hansen says. But their findings leave them with more questions, namely: What's the volcano's heat source, if it's not right below the volcano itself? Hansen surmises that it's coming from further east, but until his team does more research, it's what Science News is calling ""a cold case.""

244,"['U.S. military personnel prepare to transfer an injured on board USS Fitzgerald, off Izu Peninsula, Japan, after the Navy destroyer collided with a merchant ship, Saturday, June 17, 2017. The Japan... (Associated Press) \n \n YOKOSUKA, Japan (AP) — U.S. and Japanese vessels and aircraft were searching Saturday for seven American sailors who were missing after their Navy destroyer collided before dawn with a container ship four times its size off the coast of Japan. \n \n The USS Fitzgerald was back at its home port in Yokosuka Naval Base south of Tokyo by sunset Saturday, its crew lined up on deck. The Philippine-flagged container ship was berthed at Tokyo\'s Oi wharf, where officials began questioning crew members about the cause of the nighttime crash. \n \n After helping stabilize the USS Fitzgerald, the destroyer USS Dewey joined other American and Japanese vessels and aircraft in the search for the missing sailors. \n \n At least three other Navy sailors were injured in the collision. \n \n Family members were frantically seeking news, appealing via social media for calls from sailors aboard from the ship. \n \n The U.S. 7th Fleet said in a statement that the crash damaged two berthing spaces, a machinery room and the radio room. Most of the more than 200 sailors aboard would have been asleep in their berths at the time of the pre-dawn crash. \n \n Water was being pumped out of flooded areas and it was unclear how long it would take to get into the crushed mid-right side of the ship once it was at the pier in Yokosuka, the statement said. \n \n The USS Fitzgerald\'s captain, Cmdr. Bryce Benson, was airlifted early Saturday to the U.S. Naval Hospital in Yokosuka and was in stable condition with a head injury, the Navy said. Two other crew members suffered cuts and bruises and were evacuated. It was unclear how many others may have been hurt. \n \n The Navy said that the collision occurred 56 nautical miles (103 kilometers) southwest of Yokosuka, home to the 7th Fleet. \n \n ""Right now we are focused on two things: the safety of the ship and the well-being of the sailors,"" said Adm. Scott Swift, commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet. \n \n The Japanese coast guard said it received an emergency call from the container ship, the ACX Crystal, reporting the collision at around 2:20 a.m. (1720 GMT Friday). It was questioning crew members of the ACX Crystal, which is operated by the Japanese shipping company Nippon Yusen K.K., and was treating the incident as a case of possible professional negligence, said Masayuki Obara, a regional coast guard official. \n \n The ACX Crystal weighs 29,060 tons and is 222 meters (730 feet) long, the coast guard said, much larger than the 8,315-ton Navy destroyer. The container ship\'s left bow was dented and scraped, but it did not appear to have sustained any major structural damage. \n \n Nippon Yusen said all of the ACX Crystal\'s 20-member Filipino crew members were safe. \n \n Conditions were clear at the time of the collision, though Yutaka Saito of the coast guard said the area is particularly busy with sea traffic. \n \n The names of the missing sailors were being withheld pending notification of their families. U.S. Navy personnel set up support and counseling services to help families as they sought updates on crew members. \n \n ""Just heard the sweetest voice and saw a wonderful face. He\'s okay. Thank you all for the prayers,"" Rita Schrimsher of Athens, Alabama, tweeted after speaking with her 23-year-old grandson, Jackson Schrimsher, via Facetime. \n \n ""It could have been worse, so we\'re grateful,"" she said by phone. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writers Mari Yamaguchi and Elaine Kurtenbach in Tokyo and Cathy Bussewitz and Jennifer Kelleher in Honolulu contributed to this report.', 'Tokyo (CNN) Seven US sailors are missing and the commanding officer of a US destroyer is among the injured after the warship and a merchant ship collided off the coast of Japan, the US Navy said. \n \n The smaller guided-missile destroyer USS Fitzgerald suffered severe damage to its starboard side. \n \n ""The collision affected Fitzgerald\'s forward starboard side above and below the water line, causing significant damage and associated flooding to two berthing spaces, a machinery space, and the radio room,"" according to a statement from US 7th Fleet. \n \n The statement hinted that the missing sailors could be trapped in the damaged area of the destroyer. \n \n ""It remains uncertain how long it will take to gain access to the spaces once the ship is pier side ... to methodically continue the search for the missing,"" the statement said. \n \n The two ships collided around 1:30 a.m. local time Saturday in the Pacific Ocean, about 56 nautical miles southwest from the port of Yokosuka and 12 miles off the Izu Peninsula, the Japanese coast guard said. \n \n The USS Fitzgerald heads to Yokosuka, home base of the 7th Fleet, beside a US tugboat, off Shimoda, Japan on Saturday. \n \n The Fitzgerald had left the US naval base in Yokosuka, where it is based, earlier Friday for routine operations in the area, a US Naval Forces Japan spokesman said. \n \n The warship was towed back to Yokosuka, escorted by a Japanese coast guard ship, naval officials said. It arrived at port late Saturday, when divers began inspecting the damage. \n \n Earlier, the ship\'s commander, Cmdr. Bryce Benson, was evacuated by a Japanese naval helicopter while US military copters evacuated two injured US sailors. All three are in stable condition at the US Naval Hospital in Yokosuka, said Cmdr. Ron Flanders, public affairs officer for US Naval Forces Japan. \n \n Five Japanese Maritime Self Defense force ships were leading the search for the missing US sailors at the site of the collision, joined by another US warship, the guided-missile destroyer USS Dewey, the 7th Fleet said. US and Japanese aircraft also were involved. \n \n No one hurt on merchant ship \n \n The merchant vessel involved is the ACX Crystal, a container ship flagged in the Philippines, officials said. It is chartered by Japanese shipping company Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha (NYK) and owned by Dainichi-Invest Corporation, NYK said. \n \n A photo from shipping company NYK shows damage from the collision. \n \n No one aboard the Crystal was hurt, and no oil spilled from the vessel, NYK said. \n \n NYK and the ship\'s owner are cooperating a Japan Coast Guard investigation into the collision, the shipping firm said. \n \n ""Our thoughts and deep concerns go out to all those directly affected,"" NYK said. \n \n The ship-tracking website marinetraffic.com shows the ship had left the Japanese port of Nagoya on Friday evening. It was expected to dock at a Tokyo Bay port around 4:30 p.m. local time, officials said after the wreck, adding that the container ship was operating under charter to a Japanese shipping company. \n \n Photos of the Crystal showed damage to its bow. \n \n Damage to the Philippine container ship ACX Crystal is seen after it collided with the USS Fitzgerald in the waters off Izu Peninsula, this photo released by Japan\'s coast guard shows. \n \n Shipping zone can be precarious \n \n The area where the wreck happened is known for heavy maritime traffic, the Japanese coast guard said. About 400 to 500 ships pass through the zone each day, the service said. \n \n The last known fatal incident there was in September 2015, when a South Korean vessel and a Japanese container ship collided, Japan\'s coast guard reported. Six Japanese crew were declared dead. \n \n The area has seen two other major collisions in the past five years. \n \n In such a busy shipping lane, the ships may have been in a ""restricted navigation"" situation, meaning they would have had o observe strict rules for movement and positioning in relation to other vessels in their vicinity, said Carl Schuster, former director of operations at the US Pacific Command\'s Joint Intelligence Center and a Hawaii Pacific University professor. \n \n Those rules leave vessels little room to maneuver, as turning away from one ship could place a vessel at risk of an even more serious incident with another, Schuster said. \n \n It completed $21 million in upgrades and repairs in February and is forward-deployed to Yokosuka, supporting security and stability in the Indo-Asia-Pacific region, the service said. \n \n The 29,000-ton container ship, which handles general cargo, includes a captain and a crew of 20, NYK said. It was built in 2008 and is about 730 feet long. \n \n The larger size of the container ship could have left the smaller US destroyer vulnerable in the collision, Schuster said. \n \n An injured USS Fitzgerald crew member is carried by US military personnel, left, and Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force members upon arriving Saturday to the US Naval Base in Yokosuka Japan. \n \n The force of the impact could have thrown overboard sailors who were standing on the opposite side of the destroyer from where it was struck, he said. That could account for the missing sailors, who may have been on deck on watch or even just relaxing in the night air, he said. \n \n Sailors also could have been trapped in compartments below deck, Schuster said, pointing out that container ships have a bulbous bow below the water line, which may have plowed into the US warship. \n \n Experienced commander in charge \n \n Benson, the Fitzgerald\'s commander, was new to the position, having taken command of the vessel May 13 after serving as the ship\'s executive officer, or second in command, since November 2015, the Navy said last month. \n \n Cmdr. Bryce Benson \n \n The Fitzgerald is the second command for Benson, a 1999 Naval ROTC graduate of Marquette University. He commanded the minesweeper USS Guardian, operating out of Sasebo, Japan, from 2008 to 2010, before taking shore assignments in Washington and with US Pacific Command. \n \n The collision was the second in the region for US Navy warship in just more than a month. On May 9, the guided-missile cruiser USS Lake Champlain was struck by a South Korean fishing boat off the Korean Peninsula. \n \n No injuries were reported in that incident, which a Navy official said occurred when the fishing boat\'s crew did not have a radio to hear warnings from the US warship. \n \n The guided-missile cruiser USS Antietam ran aground in late January while anchoring near Yokosuka, damaging its propellers and discharging 1,100 gallons of hydraulic oil into the bay. \n \n Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly described the status of the commanding officer.

This may be because later pregnancy coincides with the development of a brain region called the cerebellar cortex, which is involved in controlling movement, the researchers said. \n \n However, it is not clear whether or how the results of the tests conducted in the study may translate into real-life impacts for the participants, said Dr. Andrew Adesman, chief of Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics at Cohen Children\'s Medical Center of New York in New Hyde Park, New York. \n \n For example, the motor skills the researchers tested, such as the ability to stand on one foot, ""may not necessarily matter much in life,"" Adesman told Live Science. \n \n Instead, it would be more interesting to learn whether stress was linked with coordination problems such as buttoning buttons or riding a bicycle, Adesman said. \n \n ""Those might be more real-world examples of motor deficits that affect people on a daily basis,"" he said. \n \n The new study was published today (Oct. 14) in the journal Child Development. \n \n Follow Agata Blaszczak-Boxe on Twitter.

(Associated Press) \n \n The statement, by Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, appeared to be the most serious threat of reprisal by Moscow for Western sanctions against Russia over its annexation of Ukraine\'s Crimea region. \n \n Russia is key to attempts to coax Iran into significant long-term curbs of its nuclear program in exchange for relief from U.N. and other sanctions. Iran insists it does not want nuclear arms but is seeking a deal that will result in full sanctions relief. \n \n The Russian threat, hours after the latest negotiating round ended, appeared to catch Washington off guard. \n \n Days ahead of the meeting, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki had said she expects Russia to ""remain an active partner"" in the talks. During the two-day talks, Western officials involved described Russia\'s participation as constructive and unchanged by the Ukraine tensions. \n \n Ryabkov was cited by the Interfax news agency as saying Russia may feel compelled to respond to U.S. and European Union actions. He said Russia considers ""reunification"" with Crimea more important than the developments surrounding Iran\'s nuclear program. \n \n ""We wouldn\'t like to use these talks as an element of the game of raising the stakes taking into account the sentiments in some European capitals, Brussels and Washington,"" Ryabkov was quoted as saying. ""But if they force us into that, we will take retaliatory measures here as well."" \n \n Russia and the U.S. often hold different positions about what Iran needs to do to banish fears about its nuclear activities. That includes uranium enrichment, which Iran says it needs to make reactor fuel — but which can also manufacture fissile warhead material. \n \n Ahead of the most recent talks, diplomats told The Associated Press that Moscow was ready to accept a more robust Iranian enrichment program than Washington. \n \n But American officials have always said that Russia and the United States are united in their goal of banishing the threat of a nuclear-armed Iran, even if they differ on how to get there. \n \n Iran has often tried to exploit U.S.-Russian differences and Ryabkov\'s comments could embolden it to resist significant nuclear cutbacks. \n \n China usually supports Russia at the negotiations but the United States, Britain, France and Germany are unlikely to accept a lenient deal. \n \n At worst, the talks could fall apart. That could embolden Israel to make good on threats to attack Iran\'s nuclear facilities and draw the United States into any military confrontation. \n \n The Russian comments overshadowed signs that Iran may be ready to compromise. \n \n Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif had suggested earlier Wednesday his country was ready eliminate fears that a reactor it is building at Arak could be used to make atomic arms. \n \n Zarif implied that Iran was open to re-engineering the facility to one that would produce less plutonium, according to the semi-official Fars news agency. Like enriched uranium, plutonium can be used to arm nuclear warheads. \n \n While Iran insists on completing and running its nuclear reactor, ""any proliferation concerns"" linked to it ""have to be removed,"" he was quoted as saying. \n \n ___ \n \n Ischachenkov reported from Moscow. Margaret Childs in Vienna and Associated Press writer Ali Akbar Dareini in Tehran contributed to this report.', 'MOSCOW, Feb. 8 (UPI) -- \n \n Russia\'s president has announced starting this year the country will stick to summer time and not switch to daylight saving time as it has done since 1981. \n \n ""I decided to cancel the shift to winter time, starting from this autumn,"" President Dmitry Medvedev said of the usual October time change, the RIA Novosti news agency reported Tuesday. \n \n Medvedev said he was making the decision because the shift in time ""may lead to stress and illnesses."" \n \n Daylight saving time, practiced in every European country except Iceland and in many other countries around the world, was introduced as a way to save energy. \n \n Its first use in Russia was in 1917, RIA Novosti said.', 'Magnesium Ion Some researchers are looking beyond lithium. The Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency for Energy (ARPA-E) is funding high-risk, high-reward technology, such as the magnesium ion battery being developed at Pellion Technologies, an MIT spin-off. Pellion says its batteries will have twice the energy density as existing lithium-ion batteries for both consumer products and electric vehicles. At the same time, Toyota researchers in Michigan say they are developing their own magnesium battery for an EV that can run twice the distance as current batteries on a single charge, but don’t expect it until 2020. The race is on. \n \n Lithium Air One materials scientist told me that lithium air is the ""grand slam home run"" of energy density. Lithium-air batteries differ from lithium-ion batteries in that they use carbon for their positive electrode instead of metal oxides. Carbon is lighter and reacts with oxygen in the surrounding air to produce electrical current. Although it promises a 1,000-mile range instead of just 125 miles for electric vehicles, lithium air batteries have also proven to be unstable. The big problem is that lithium ignites when it contacts moist air. But IBM researchers in California and Switzerland reported this month that they have solved a key problem in the battery’s electrochemistry by finding a different kind of electrolyte solution. IBM hopes to have a prototype lithium-air battery by 2013. Startups like Berkeley-based PolyPlus are also hunting for this ""holy grail"" of battery tech. Critics say that lithium-air research has been underway for two decades without complete success. \n \n Solid State Lithium Ion For electric vehicles, weight, range and safety are the big concerns. One idea is using solid state technology that doesn’t have a liquid electrolyte solution for a lithium-ion fuel cell. ""That gives our cells greater energy density and also potentially reduces system complexity dramatically,” said Ann Marie Sastry, CEO of Ann Arbor-based Sakti3. The firm\'s batteries pack more power into less space, said Sastry, a University of Michigan professor of materials science and engineering. There\'s no flammable material either, something that’s recently plagued the Chevy Volt’s battery. GM and Khosla Ventures are backing Sakti3’s research and development efforts. Meanwhile in Japan, Toyota announced recently that its own solid state battery with a 600-mile range will be ready for roll-out sometime around 2015. \n \n Sodium Ion Pittsburgh-based Aquion Energy is betting on simple, non-toxic materials for their grid storage battery system. ""It’s made out saltwater, cotton, charcoal and dirt, actually lithium manganese oxide,"" said Ted Wiley, Aquion’s vice president of business development. ""Everything we\'re made out of is cheap and staying cheap."" Aquion is building shipping-container-size storage cells for solar, wind and other renewable energy producers who need to store the electricity they make before selling it to the grid. It’s a hybrid battery using the food preservative, sodium sulfate, and is based on research coming out of Carnegie Mellon University’s school of engineering. This simple and inexpensive concept should also work to augment diesel generators in remote areas, Wiley said, or back up the power supply of homes and businesses. \n \n Lithium Imide When Leyden Energy’s Noam Kedem was at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas earlier this month, he was struck by the fact that almost nobody could talk on the phone after 3 p.m. ""Everyone was running from charger to charger,"" Kedem said. To meet the demand for more power and longer life, Fremont, Calif.,-based Leyden is using a unique electrolyte salt solution with existing lithium ion technology. Kedem says that doubles the number of laptop or cellphone battery charges from 350 cycles to more than 800. Kedem says their batteries can also operate up to 140 degrees Fahrenheit without producing hydrofluoric acid or the swelling that can occur when batteries heat up as they run multiple applications. Canada’s Dr. Battery retailer began selling Leyden’s first rechargeable battery pack, and the firm is beginning mass production of tablet and cellphone batteries this year. Kedem says the firm is testing a prototype electric vehicle battery using the same electrolyte platform. \n \n What do smart phones, electric vehicles and solar panels have in common? They all demand more and more battery power to keep our homes, jobs and vehicles running. Lithium ion is still the ""gold standard,"" but researchers are looking at the entire periodic table for new combinations of elements that can conduct and store electrons in smarter ways. And the sooner they find it, the sooner society can get off fossil fuels and use more sustainable energy sources. “With the combination of new materials, new design concepts, and new production and manufacturing methodologies, I believe we will get there,” said Esther Takeuchim, professor of advanced power systems at SUNY Buffalo, Here’s a look at five new battery techs – some ready for market in the next year, others just over the horizon: \n \n Mushrooms never cease to amaze. They’re one of the weirdest organisms on the planet, and we keep coming up with unexpected uses for them. Actually, some people think mushrooms aren’t from this planet at all. Really. \n \n Now comes word that researchers at Researchers at the University of California, Riverside Bourns College of Engineering have found yet another use for mushrooms — in batteries. \n \n Magic Mushrooms In My Yard: Photos \n \n The UC research team has developed a new kind of lithium-ion battery anode using portobello mushrooms, which could eventually replace the industry standard of synthetic graphite. Besides being less expensive and eco-friendlier, the mushrooms are potentially more efficient as well, thanks to their highly porous composition. \n \n The development could have a fairly big impact in multiple industries, actually. We’re likely to be using a lot more batteries in coming years, particularly in consumer electronics and electric vehicles. By using biological materials, we can bring down costs and expend less energy in the manufacturing process. \n \n Synthetic graphite, on the other hand, has a relatively high manufacturing cost due to specific preparation and purification processes that can also be harmful to the environment, according to the research team. \n \n Some Mushrooms Glow, And Here’s Why \n \n The mushroom anodes’ porosity creates more space for the transfer of energy, which can improve battery performance. But even better, according to the UC team, mushroom anodes could actually result in batteries that increase in efficiency over time, due to the organic material’s high potassium salt content. \n \n “With battery materials like this, future cell phones may see an increase in run time after many uses, rather than a decrease, due to apparent activation of blind pores within the carbon architectures as the cell charges and discharges over time,” says researcher Brennan Campbell in press materials accompanying the announcement. \n \n Mushrooms are also, as a rule, more tasty than graphite. Everybody wins. The research findings were published today in the journal Nature Scientific Reports.']",4,"– The US won't be sending troops to Crimea anytime soon.

In other Ukraine news: Russian forces freed Ukraine's captured navy commander today, after Ukraine demanded the release of all hostages in Crimea, CNN reports. If they weren't freed by 9pm, acting President Oleksandr Turchynov threatened to take ""technical and technological"" action—meaning, likely, turning off Crimea's utilities. Russia's defense minister asked Crimea to free the hostages. Even though Ukraine is reportedly pulling troops from the region, its parliament issued a declaration today saying that it still considered Crimea part of the Ukraine, and that ""the Ukrainian people will never, under no circumstances, stop fighting for the liberation of Crimea from the occupants."" European leaders met today in Sevastopol to discuss further punitive action against Russia, with Angela Merkel saying the EU would issue more travel bans and asset freezes against Russians, the Washington Post reports. But analysts say the measures aren't strong enough to change Russian behavior. Ukraine, too, is taking only restrained steps. Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk yesterday backed off Kiev's threat to impose a visa regime, saying it would likely be ineffective, and would inconvenience many Ukrainians. Russia, meanwhile, pulled out a threat of its own. Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Russia might revise its stance on Iran's nuclear program in response to US and EU sanctions. ""We wouldn't like to use these talks as an element of the game of raising the stakes,"" he said, according to the AP. ""But if they force us into that, we will take retaliatory measures."""
