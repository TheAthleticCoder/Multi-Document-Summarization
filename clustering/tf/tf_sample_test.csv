(May 1) AP \n \n Marks of butchery evident on teen\'s remains discovered at the site. \n \n This August 2012 photo shows four shallow chops to an incomplete skull excavated in Jamestown, Va., by William Kelso of the Jamestown Rediscovery Project. (Photo: Don Hurlbert, Smithsonian) Story Highlights During the \'starving time,\' only 60 of 300 colonists survived \n \n Researchers: Skull shows signs of cannibalization \n \n Final blow split the cranium open \n \n WASHINGTON -- Jamestown\'s colonists resorted to cannibalism during the ""starving time"" winter of 1609-10, archaeologists confirmed Wednesday. \n \n In a briefing at the Smithsonian\'s National Museum of Natural History, archaeologist Doug Owsley presented the reconstructed skull of a 14-year-old English girl, named ""Jane"" by the researchers, discovered at the site of the fort and bearing the marks of butchery. \n \n ""The skull was split in half, most likely with a lightweight ax or quite possibly, a cleaver,"" Owsley said at the briefing. Cut marks crisscrossing the skull and jaw of the girl indicate her flesh, tongue and brains were removed from the skull, Owsley said. Those were traditional cuts for animal butchery of the time, ""all parts of the cuisine of the 17th century,"" he said. \n \n Jamestown was founded in 1607 by English colonists. The starving time was a period two years later in which 80% of the colonists died. Besieged by Powhatan Indians in their wooden fort, the settlers had been joined by new colonists late that summer, among them women and children, whose main supply ship had disappeared in a storm, leaving them without food. Only 60 of 300 people survived the winter. \n \n ""They were so emaciated when they were rescued that they were described as resembling skeletons,"" says historian James Horn of the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, who spoke at the briefing. Records kept by the colony\'s governor, George Percy, make clear references to cannibalism during the winter, Horn says. ""The English would have only resorted to cannibalism under the most severe circumstances,"" he added. \n \n VIDEO: Cannibalism at Jamestown confirmed \n \n Owsley reported on the forensic analysis of 17th century human remains and a reconstruction of her appearance made by forensic scientists. The remains had been excavated by Jamestown archaeologists led by William Kelso of the Jamestown Recovery Project in 2012 as part of a 20-year excavation of the James Fort site. ""We don\'t believe Jane was a lone case,"" Kelso said. \n \n This April 2013 photo shows a forensic facial reconstruction produced by StudioEIS of Brooklyn, N.Y., in consultation with William Kelso of the Jamestown Rediscovery Project. (Photo: Don Hurlbert, Smithsonian) \n \n ""This is amazingly interesting, but it also confirms stories of cannibalism from the settlers themselves,"" says Charles Mann, author of 1493: Uncovering the New World Columbus Created. ""Things were indeed terrible during those early years,"" Mann says, by email. \n \n While not all colonial-era historians agreed that cannibalism took place at Jamestown, most modern ones generally credited the accounts (one man was executed for eating his wife) as reliable. Horn and Owsley argued the butchery marks on Jane provide stronger evidence for the practice. ""No one can say with authoritative certainty exactly why this young lady was cut up, but given the context, it looks like butcher\'s marks,"" Owsley said. \n \n In the briefing, he identified a number of features on the skull and a shin bone that indicated that Jane was cannibalized. Four shallow chops to the forehead were attempted in a first, failed attempt to open the skull. The back of the head was then split open. The final blow split the cranium open. \n \n ""The person doing this was not a very good, or experienced butcher,"" Owsley said. Chop marks on the shin bone resemble more conventional butchers\' marks seen on animal bones from the time, indicating that more than one person may have been involved in cannibalizing the girl. She was doubtless one of the newly arrived settlers, though still not definitively identified. An exhibition devoted to the discovery will open this Friday at the Historic Jamestowne site, and her reconstructed face will be displayed at the Smithsonian museum. \n \n Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/18cNUHU', 'Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The dram was bought for £7,600 \n \n A dram of vintage Scotch bought by a Chinese millionaire in a Swiss hotel bar for £7,600 was a fake, laboratory tests have concluded. \n \n Analysts from Scotland were called in by the Waldhaus Am See hotel in St Moritz after experts questioned the authenticity of the 2cl shot. \n \n It had been poured from an unopened bottle labelled as an 1878 Macallan single malt. \n \n It is believed to be the largest sum ever paid for a poured dram of Scotch. \n \n But analysis found that it was almost certainly not distilled before 1970. \n \n The hotel said it had accepted the findings and reimbursed the customer in full. \n \n Zhang Wei, 36, from Beijing - one of China\'s highest-earning online writers - had paid just under 10,000 Swiss francs (£7,600, $10,050) for the single shot while visiting the hotel\'s Devil\'s Place whisky bar in July. \n \n But suspicions about the spirit\'s provenance surfaced soon after the purchase, when whisky industry experts spotted discrepancies in the bottle\'s cork and label from newspaper articles. \n \n Image copyright Sandro Bernasconi Image caption Mr Zhang was photographed with hotel manager Sandro Bernasconi after buying the dram \n \n That prompted the Waldhaus to send a sample to Dunfermline-based specialists Rare Whisky 101 (RW101) for analysis. \n \n Carbon dating tests were then carried out by researchers from the University of Oxford, which suggested a 95% probability that the spirit was created between 1970 and 1972. \n \n Further lab tests by Fife-based alcohol analysts Tatlock and Thomson indicated that it was probably a blended Scotch, comprising 60% malt and 40% grain - ruling it out as a single malt. \n \n RW101 said the tests had shown that the bottle was ""almost worthless as a collector\'s item"". \n \n Had the bottle been genuine, it would have carried a bar-value of about 300,000 Swiss francs (£227,000). \n \n Image copyright Sandro Bernasconi Image caption The dram was poured from an unopened bottle that purported to be an 1878 Macallan \n \n Mr Zhang, who writes martial arts fantasy novels under the pen name Tang Jia San Shao, earned the equivalent of about $16.8m in 2015, according to China Daily. \n \n He bought the dram while on holiday with his grandmother at the Swiss hotel, which stocks 2,500 different whiskies. \n \n Waldhaus manager Sandro Bernasconi told BBC Scotland that the hotel had no idea the bottle was a fake. \n \n He said: ""My father bought the bottle of Macallan 25 years ago, when he was manager of this hotel, and it had not been opened. \n \n ""When Mr Zhang asked if he could try some, we told him it wasn\'t for sale.

4,"['Click image above to view graphic \n \n Although the prospect of a pill for Alzheimer\'s remains a long way off, the landmark British study provides a major new pathway for future drug treatments. \n \n The compound works by blocking a faulty signal in brains affected by neurodegenerative diseases, which shuts down the production of essential proteins, leading to brain cells being unprotected and dying off. \n \n It was tested in mice with prion disease - the best animal model of human neurodegenerative disorders - but scientists said they were confident the same principles would apply in a human brain with debilitating brain diseases such as Alzheimer\'s or Parkinson\'s. \n \n The study, published today in the journal Science Translational Medicine, was carried out at the Medical Research Council\'s (MRC) Toxicology Unit at the University of Leicester. \n \n “It\'s a real step forward,” team leader Professor Giovanna Mallucci told The Independent. “It\'s the first time a substance has been given to mice that prevents brain disease. The fact that this is a compound that can be given orally, that gets into the brain and prevents brain disease, is a first in itself… We can go forward and develop better molecules and I can\'t see why preventing this process should only be restricted to mice. I think this probably will translate into other mammalian brains.” \n \n In debilitating brain diseases like Alzheimer\'s, the production of new proteins in the brain is shut down by a build-up of “misfolded proteins” or amyloids. This build-up leads to an “over-activation” of a natural defence mechanism that stops essential proteins being produced. Without these proteins to protect them, brain cells die off - leading to the symptoms of diseases like Alzheimer\'s. \n \n The compound used in the study works by inhibiting an enzyme, known as PERK, which plays a key role in activating this defence mechanism. In mice with prion\'s disease, it restored proteins to protect brain cells “stopping the disease in its tracks”, restoring some normal behaviours and preventing memory loss. \n \n Although the compound also produced significant side effects in mice, including weight loss and mild diabetes, which was caused by damage to the pancreas, Professor Mallucci said it would “not be impossible” to develop a drug that protected the brain without the side effects and that work towards doing so had been “very promising”. \n \n The breakthrough was greeted with excitement by scientists, who nonetheless cautioned that it remained a significant proof of principle and a possible basis for new treatments, rather than a guarantee of an Alzheimer\'s cure in the near future. \n \n Computer graphic of a vertical (coronal) slice through the brain of an Alzheimer patient (credit: Science Photo Library) \n \n Professor Roger Morris, acting head King\'s College London\'s department of chemistry, said: “This is the first convincing report that a small drug, of the type most conveniently turned into medicines, stops the progressive death of neurons in the brain as found, for instance, in Alzheimer\'s disease. True, this study has been done in mice, not man; and it is prion disease, not Alzheimer\'s, that has been cured. However, there is considerable evidence that the way neurons die in both diseases is similar; and lessons learned in mice from prion disease have proved accurate guides to attenuate the progress of Alzheimer\'s disease in patients.” \n \n “From finding the first effective drug in a mouse, to having an effective medicine in man, usually takes decades to bring to fruition, in the very few cases in which it is successful. So, a cure for Alzheimer\'s is not just around the corner. However, the critical point of principle made by Professor Mallucci\'s study is that a drug, given orally, can arrest neurodegeneration caused by amyloid in the brain. \n \n ”This finding, I suspect, will be judged by history as a turning point in the search for medicines to control and prevent Alzheimer\'s disease.“ \n \n David Allsopp, professor of neuroscience at Lancaster University said that the study had thrown up ”very dramatic and highly encouraging results“, but said that more research was needed to overcome the ""problematic side-effects"" and to prove the technique would be effective against other disease like Alzheimer\'s and Parkinson\'s. \n \n There are currently 800,000 people in the UK with dementia and Alzheimer\'s disease is the most common cause. The number of people living with the condition is set to break one million by 2021, and represents an enormous health burden for the NHS and the social care system. Parkinson\'s affect 1 in 500 people and around 127,000 people suffer from the condition. \n \n Dr Eric Karran, director of research at Alzheimer\'s Research UK, said: ""Targeting a mechanism relevant to a number of neurodegenerative diseases could yield a single drug with wide-reaching benefits, but this compound is still at an early stage. It will be important for these findings to be repeated and tested in models of other neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer\'s disease. While Alzheimer\'s is the most common form of dementia, other diseases that cause dementia are also characterised by the abnormal build-up of proteins in the brain. \n \n “If this process is also working overtime in these conditions too, targeting it could be a promising avenue for investigation. However, what is true in animals does not always hold true in people and the ultimate test for this compound will be to see whether it is safe and effective in people with these diseases.”', 'Scientists are hailing a landmark British study which has paved the way for a pill that can cure brain diseases such as Alzheimer\'s and Parkinson\'s by stopping the death of neurons. \n \n The Medical Research Council (MRC) team focused on the root cause of many degenerative brain diseases - abnormally shaped proteins that stick together in clumps and fibres. \n \n When enough misshapen protein builds up in the brain it can trigger a reaction that results in the death of nerve cells. \n \n Other approaches have sought to stop or limit the accumulation of the abnormal protein, whose structure is folded the wrong way. \n \n But this research, published in the journal Science Translational Medicine, targeted the harmful way brain cells react to misfolded proteins. \n \n Using a drug injected into the stomachs of mice through a mouth tube, they flipped a cellular switch from ""off"" to ""on"" to prevent neurons dying. \n \n Five weeks after treatment one group of mice remained free of symptoms such as memory loss, impaired reflexes and limb dragging. \n \n They also lived longer than untreated animals with the same brain disease. \n \n During the study, a neurodegenerative disease caused by abnormal prion proteins was induced in the mice. \n \n Prion diseases, which include Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD), are rare in humans but share the same underlying cause - misfolded proteins - as more common conditions such as Alzheimer\'s. \n \n Lead scientist Professor Giovanna Mallucci, from the MRC Toxicology Unit, said: ""We were extremely excited when we saw the treatment stop the disease in its tracks and protect brain cells, restoring some normal behaviours and preventing memory loss in the mice."" \n \n The scientists stress human trials are a long way off and point out that the mice suffered serious side effects, including significant weight loss and raised blood sugar. \n \n But they also believe the research demonstrates in principle the possibility of developing an oral treatment - a pill or swallowed liquid - that can protect the brain from neurodegenerative disease. \n \n The research is at a very early stage and it could be a decade or more before the medicine is actually developed. \n \n But experts said the findings were highly significant. \n \n Professor Roger Morris, from King\'s College London, said: ""This is the first convincing report that a small drug, of the type most conveniently turned into medicines, stops the progressive death of neurons in the brain as found, for instance, in Alzheimer\'s disease. \n \n ""True, this study has been done in mice, not man; and it is prion disease, not Alzheimer\'s, that has been cured. \n \n ""However, there is considerable evidence that the way neurons die in both diseases is similar; and lessons learned in mice from prion disease have proved accurate guides to attenuate the progress of Alzheimer\'s disease in patients."" \n \n He added: ""This finding, I suspect, will be judged by history as a turning point in the search for medicines to control and prevent Alzheimer\'s disease."" \n \n Professor David Allsop, from the University of Lancaster, said: ""Inhibiting this pathway has produced some very dramatic and highly encouraging results in mice infected with prion disease. \n \n ""The main caveats of the research, however, are that prion disease is very rare in humans, and it is not yet clear if the same approach will be viable for much more common neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer\'s disease and Parkinson\'s disease. \n \n ""More research is needed to determine if this approach is valid for any condition other than prion disease, and also to find ways of getting around these problematic side-effects.""']",2,"– Scientists are calling it a breakthrough and a turning point: In a new study, a compound successfully halted brain cell death in mice, meaning we're one step closer to a pill that can treat Alzheimer's, the Independent reports. Neurodegenerative diseases halt the production of key proteins, which in turn results in the unprotected brain cells dying off, and symptoms appearing. The compound blocks the faulty brain signal that causes the initial ""shutdown,"" thus basically flipping the switch from ""off"" back to ""on."" Proteins are produced, brain cells are protected, and symptoms are reversed. The mice in the study had prion disease, which is similar to a human neurodegenerative disorder. After receiving the compound, memory loss and other symptoms including impaired reflexes and limb dragging were reversed; the treated mice also lived longer than those who didn't receive the compound, Sky News reports. Though it's still a long way off, scientists think a treatment based on these findings could also help people with Parkinson's disease. Now the bad news: The mice did suffer side effects, including weight loss and diabetes.

It\'s the first time we\'re introducing really comparable data,"" said Ruediger Kuehr of United Nations University, in Germany, and executive secretary of the StEP Initiative. ""In addition, it gives magnitude to the issue on a national level, so policymakers are aware of the issue in order to take action,"" Kuehr told LiveScience. \n \n Mapping worldwide e-waste \n \n The U.S. and China produce more total e-waste than any other country. [ See full-size infographic Credit: Ross Toro, Infographic Artist \n \n The interactive e-waste map shows data from 184 countries on the estimated amount of electrical and electronic equipment that hits the market and how much e-waste it ultimately generates. Having this data could help governments and companies manage their e-waste. \n \n The world produced nearly 54 million tons (49 million metric tons) of used electrical and electronic products last year. That\'s an average of about 43 lbs. (20 kg), or the weight of eight bricks, for each of the 7 billion people on Earth. \n \n The StEP Initiative forecasts that by 2017, the world will produce about 33 percent more e-waste, or 72 million tons (65 million metric tons). That amount weighs about 11 times as much as the Great Pyramid of Giza. \n \n China currently leads the world in production of electrical and electronic equipment. In 2012, China produced about 12.2 million tons (11.1 million metric tons), followed by the U.S. with about 11 million tons (10 million metric tons). \n \n However, the United States eclipses China in e-waste generation, because more products previously put on the market in the U.S. are likely to be retired. In 2012, the U.S. produced about 10.4 million tons (9.4 million metric tons), versus China\'s 8 million tons (7.3 million metric tons). \n \n The U.S. generated the seventh highest amount of e-waste per person — about 66 lbs. (30 kg) per capita. (The country with the highest per capita e-waste was Qatar.) \n \n E-waste in the U.S. \n \n The U.S. National Center for Electronics Recycling (NCER) and MIT have released a detailed report on U.S. generation, collection and export of used electronics in conjunction with the e-waste map. \n \n The U.S. generated about 258.2 million units of used computers, monitors, TVs and cellphones in 2010, 171.4 million of which were collected for recycling, and 14.4 million were exported, according to the report. [Green Guide to Holiday Electronic Gifts (Op-Ed)] \n \n The U.S. is a major exporter of used electronics. The U.S. exports more CRT (cathode ray tube) monitors by weight than any other product, and more cellphones than any other electronics product in terms of numbers. \n \n However, export numbers could be an underestimate, because exporters want to keep them quiet in order to bypass restrictions or bad press, said Jason Linnell, executive director of NCER. \n \n In terms of recycling, ""We are a little bit behind compared with countries in the European Union,"" Linnell told LiveScience.European countries have had established e-waste recycling programs for more than 10 years, whereas only 25 U.S. states have started similar programs, Linnell said. \n \n But recycling of e-waste is on the rise. ""We\'re seeing more recycling programs, and a lot of states are collecting 5 to 6 lbs. (2.3 to 2.7 kg) of e-waste per person per year,"" he said. \n \n ""It\'s better than the past, but we we still have a ways to go,"" Linnell said. \n \n Follow Tanya Lewis on Twitterand Google+.

Original article on LiveScience.', 'It has been called the “dirty underbelly” of electronics. \n \n E-waste — all those discarded electrical or electronic devices, from cell phones and TVs to tablets and computers. \n \n The numbers are staggering. And now, a world e-waste map — the first of its kind — shows just how staggering. \n \n The average Canadian, for example, generated about 24 kilograms of e-waste in 2012. That’s more than 860,000 tonnes for the entire country, roughly equivalent to the weight of about 1,700 fully loaded Boeing 747s at take off. \n \n But the biggest producer of e-waste is the United States, with an astonishing 9,359,000 tonnes produced in 2012, about 29 kilograms per person, according to the map, which was created by a number of agencies through their “solving e-waste problem” (StEP) initiative. \n \n The numbers are mind-boggling, said Josh Lepawsky, a professor at Memorial University in St. John’s, N.L., and a member of StEP. \n \n “The main purpose (of the map) is to give a sense how much electronic waste is present in any given any country,” said Lepawsky. \n \n It also allows a comparison between purchasing power in different countries, which is a measure of wealth, he said. \n \n (The richer the country, the more e-waste it generally generates.) \n \n By 2017, the volume of discarded e-products worldwide is expected to be 33 per cent higher than in 2012 and weigh the equivalent of eight of the Great Pyramids of Egypt. \n \n Haiti is among the lowest producers of e-waste in the world, with less than 8,000 tonnes produced in 2012, or less than one kilogram per person. \n \n Afghanistan, too, was among the lowest in the world, with less than 19,000 tonnes of e-waste for the country, or 0.58 kilogram per person. \n \n The map is surprising in parts, said Lepawsky. \n \n Singapore is much wealthier than Canada, he said, “when you look at e-waste generated.” In Singapore, a tiny country, the average person generated about 36 kilograms in 2012. \n \n “The world is changing quite quickly,” he said. \n \n Luxembourg is another example. \n \n It has a much smaller population than the U.S., 520,000, compared to more than 314 million, but more new electrical and electronic equipment comes to the market in Luxembourg per capita. \n \n (The U.S. is the largest consumer in absolute terms but it is behind Luxembourg in per capita terms.) \n \n It is a disheartening number, said Miriam Diamond, a professor in the department of earth sciences at the University of Toronto, referring to the e-waste that emanates from Canada. \n \n “It represents throwing away a tremendous amount of energy that went into making it in the first place.” \n \n Used electronics often make their way to the developing world where some are reused. \n \n But, Diamond says, “In a lot of the recycling sector, they are dismantled by hand. That is a serious threat to health and the environment.” \n \n Innovation is a trademark in the world of electronics, especially in the world of cellphones, laptops and computers, where engineers come up with distinct, sleek styles to lure people to buy more. \n \n “Why won’t these same smart people also find a way that electronics can be used longer or reused in the best way, too?” she asked. \n \n The cost of mining new resources is also staggering. \n \n “These minerals that we mine are scarce. . . is it worth it? Mining, too, has negative impact on people and places.” \n \n For Lepawsky, the solution to the tonnes of e-waste is relatively simple. \n \n “Stop buying new electronics; use what you have for longer,” he said, adding that sometimes buying new products is about fashion more than anything else.', 'An employee holds circuit boards at the Coopermiti warehouse of electronic waste in Sao Paulo March 6, 2013. According to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), Brazil generates the greatest amount of electronic waste (e-waste) per capita among emerging countries. \n \n OSLO (Reuters) - China and other emerging economies have overtaken Western nations in dumping old electronic goods, from TVs to cellphones, and will lead a projected 33 percent surge in the amount of waste from 2012 to 2017, a U.N.-backed alliance said on Sunday. \n \n The report, the first to map electronic waste by country to promote recycling and safer disposal of often toxic parts, shows how the economic rise of developing nations is transforming the world economy even in terms of pollution. \n \n ""The e-waste problem requires attention globally,"" Ruediger Kuehr of the U.N. University and executive secretary of the Solving the E-Waste Problem (StEP) initiative, told Reuters. StEP is run by U.N. agencies, governments, NGOs and scientists. \n \n The weight of electronic goods discarded every year worldwide would rise to 65.4 million tonnes from 2012 to 2017 from 48.9 million in 2012, with most of the growth in developing nations, StEP said. \n \n By 2017, it would make the annual piles of old washing machines, computers, fridges, electronic toys and other goods with an electric cord or battery the weight equivalent of 200 Empire State Buildings or 11 Great Pyramids of Giza, it said. \n \n Some waste from rich countries ends up in developing nations, where many people work in hazardous conditions for low wages dismantling it. \n \n Waste from emerging countries, as well as Russia and other former Soviet bloc nations, overtook totals from Western nations such as the United States, the European Union, Japan and Australia around 2012, StEP data showed. \n \n In that year, the West produced 23.5 million tonnes of waste and all others 25.4 million, a shift from the previous estimates for 2007 when the West accounted for most, StEP said. \n \n MOUNTAINS OF TRASH \n \n By 2017, trash from the West would rise to 28.6 million tonnes, far less than the 36.7 million from other countries, a side-effect of the economic rise of emerging nations such as India, Brazil and South Africa. \n \n ""Although there is ample information about the negative environmental and health impacts of primitive e-waste recycling methods, the lack of comprehensive data has made it hard to grasp the full magnitude of the problem,"" Kuehr said in the report. \n \n Consumers could help with better recycling, especially at Christmas, he said. \n \n Waste can be valuable if recycled. One study estimated that a million cellphones can yield 24 kg (53 lb) of gold, 250 kg of silver, 9 kg of palladium and more than 9 tonnes of copper. \n \n Sunday\'s report also showed that the average person on the planet produces 7 kg of electronic waste every year. Americans were among the highest with 29.8 kg each. \n \n Separately, U.S.-based experts trying to track the fate of waste said that about two-thirds of U.S. electronics waste is collected for re-use or recycling and that only 8.5 percent of the collected units are exported. \n \n Bigger electronic items, especially TVs and computer monitors, were exported to nations including Mexico, Venezuela, Paraguay and China, it said. Smaller items often went to Asia. \n \n Jeremy Gregory, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a co-author of the report, told Reuters it was hard to track trade because the waste is often merely described as ""mixed metals"" on import documents. \n \n StEP urged nations to adopt clearer trade descriptions. \n \n For StEP maps, click here: here \n \n (Editing by Alison Williams)']",3,"– Electronic waste is growing at a staggering rate—Americans alone chucked an average of 65 pounds of old electronic goods each last year—and it is set to surge another 33% within five years unless consumers and producers change their ways, LiveScience reports. Most of the waste ends up in developing nations, and those countries plus the former Soviet bloc now produce more electronic waste of their own than Western nations, according to a new map that tracks the problem worldwide for the first time. The world produced around 54 million tons of electronic waste in total last year, researchers found, and though it can be valuable—a million old cell phones can yield 53 pounds of gold and 550 pounds of silver, Reuters notes—recycling rates remain low and where e-waste is recycled, it is often done so in a way harmful to both the environment and workers' health. The rate of waste is so high because engineers are constantly creating innovative designs to lure people to buy more, an earth sciences professor tells the Toronto Star. ""Why won’t these same smart people also find a way that electronics can be used longer or reused in the best way, too?”"

""We\'ve even looked at a couple of other forms of dementia.

11,"[""The Catholic Diocese of Dallas faces harsh criticism for how it handled allegations of sexual abuse against one it's priests. \n \n The alleged abuse by now-former Reverend Edmundo Paredes happened 10 years ago, but it was only brought to the diocese's attention six months ago. He was a longtime priest at St. Cecilia’s Catholic Church in Oak Cliff. \n \n It all comes on the heels of a bombshell Pennsylvania grand jury report about hundreds of alleged predator priests accused of preying on children. \n \n At least three men came forward with allegations against the Dallas former priest. \n \n The abuse allegations came to the diocese attention in February. It was the diocese that immediately reported them to police. But some are furious the public is just now learning about it and that the accused priest is missing \n \n One man who says he was victimized as a child by a Dallas priest did not want his name used or face shown. But he is speaking out on behalf of other potential victims through a nationwide group called SNAP, the Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests. \n \n “I would like to say I’m surprised, but I’m simply not,” the man said. “This has been a dirty secret that’s been going on for decades.” \n \n On Sunday, Dallas Bishop Edward Burns had this to say when a reporter asked specifically why it took six months for the diocese to go public with allegations of sex abuse against Paredes. \n \n “Because when all of this occurs, there are many steps that have to fall into place,” he responded. \n \n Burns said these situations have to be approached methodically. \n \n The recent report by a Pennsylvania grand jury highlighted by State Attorney Josh Shapiro and exposing hundreds of predator priests influenced Bishop Burns’ decision. \n \n “Some ask ‘Well, is it because of the grand jury report that prompted the Diocese of Dallas to bring it forward now?’ And the answer is yes,” Burns said. \n \n “It begs the question if Josh Shapiro did not have his action from Pennsylvania, would this have been news on Sunday?” the victim asked. “And the simple answer is no.” \n \n Late Monday afternoon, the Diocese of Dallas clarified the Bishop’s Sunday comments in a press release. It says Bishop Burns was “prepared to announce the allegations in March” but there was “concern for the victims” who asked that it not be made public. \n \n The statement goes on to say Bishop Burns tried to be sensitive to the victim’s request. But when the Pennsylvania report became public, he decided to inform the public about Paredes. \n \n PREVIOUS STORIES: \n \n Dallas Diocese suspends priest over sexual abuse allegations, theft"", 'Paredes is no longer permitted to function or present himself as a priest, the bishop said. \n \n Burns decided to disclose the allegations to parishioners Sunday after a meeting Thursday with the Diocesan Review Board, a group of non-clergy Catholics who counsel the diocese on matters involving the sexual abuse of minors. He said Sunday that he wanted to make the allegations public after last week\'s report from Pennsylvania that said more than 1,000 children had been abused by clergy since the 1940s. \n \n Lisa Kendzior and Paul Petersen, local chapter leaders of the Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests, said in a joint statement that they found it disturbing Burns didn\'t tell parishioners about the allegations sooner. \n \n \n \n ""Why would Bishop Burns suppress this crucial information? Was it to protect the diocese from scandal?"" the written statement said. ""What about concern for the safety of children and the need to comfort any survivors? Where is the transparency that the Catholic bishops promised?"" \n \n Petersen said he had been abused by Richard Johnson, a priest who was suspended in 2006 when he was at St. Patrick Church in Lake Highlands. Before St. Patrick, Johnson served at St. Cecilia. The diocese later settled cases with three men Johnson abused in the 1970s and \'80s. \n \n Petersen said he was skeptical of the timing of the weekend announcement. \n \n ""The fair question that every Catholic — and all the citizens of Dallas should ask — is what\'s special about today, that the revelation was made?"" he said. \n \n The information was not disclosed earlier because Burns ""did not want to hinder [the police] investigation or compromise the anonymity of victims,"" a church spokeswoman said.', 'SAN DIEGO — A one-time San Diego police criminalist who died in an apparent suicide in the East County highlands this week was due to be arrested on suspicion of taking part in the gruesome murder of a teenage girl 30 years ago, authorities reported Thursday. \n \n Kevin Charles Brown, 62, was found dead at Cuyamaca State Park on Tuesday afternoon. Brown evidently had killed himself, SDPD Lt. Paul Rorrison said, declining to disclose what led to that conclusion. \n \n In November 2012, cold-case homicide detectives uncovered DNA evidence that allegedly linked Brown and a second man to the slaying of 14-year-old Claire Hough, who was found dead at Torrey Pines State Beach on Aug. 24, 1984. \n \n The girl, who was visiting and staying with her grandparents at the time, had been beaten, strangled and stabbed, and one of her breasts had been cut off, according to San Diego County Crime Stoppers. \n \n The other suspect, Ronald Clyde Tatro, died at age 67 in a boating accident in Tennessee the year before investigators got the break in the case. \n \n Brown was civilian lab worker for the San Diego Police Department from 1982 until his retirement in 2002. \n \n “The investigation confirmed Kevin Brown had no association with any of the evidence processed in this case; nor was he assigned to any part of the murder investigation,” Rorrison said. \n \n Since the DNA evidence surfaced in the case two years ago, homicide detectives had “conducted extensive investigative follow-ups to bring forward a prosecutable case,” the lieutenant said. \n \n At the time of Brown’s death, “preparations were being made” for his arrest, Rorrison said. \n \n The murder occurred six years after a highly similar one at the same northern San Diego beach. In August 1978, 15-year-old Barbara Nantais was found slain with one of her breasts severed. Her boyfriend was nearby, suffering from severe head wounds that had left him semiconscious and with no memory of the attacks. \n \n It was unclear if Brown and Tatro were considered suspects in the earlier murder as well.']",3,"– The Catholic Church has hired two private investigators to track down a former Dallas priest who disappeared months before sexual abuse allegations against him surfaced. Pastor at St. Cecilia Catholic Church in Oak Cliff for 27 years, Rev. Edmundo Paredes stands accused of molesting three boys in their midteens between 10 and 20 years ago, though the exact period is being withheld to protect the victims’ identities, reports the Dallas Morning News. Paredes, 69, was removed from St. Cecilia in June 2017 after allegedly stealing $60,000 to $80,000 in cash. This February, church officials also learned of sexual abuse allegations, which were reported to police and found to be credible, Bishop Edward Burns told parishioners on Sunday. ""I recognize this diocese cannot cover its ears, its eyes, its mouth. We need to look at this head on,"" Burns said. Still, the Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests questions the delay in releasing the information. Officials initially said the allegations weren’t disclosed earlier because of a police investigation. Late Monday, however, the Diocese of Dallas said a Pennsylvania grand jury report describing more than 1,000 victims of abuse by clergy since the 1940s had motivated the disclosure after victims objected to an announcement in March, per Fox 4. Officials suspect Paredes is in his native Philippines, which he visited annually, per WFAA. Per the Morning News, authorities there say they are unaware of his location."
12,"['North Korean leader Kim Jong-un executed two top officials publicly, killing them with an anti-aircraft gun, a source with special knowledge of North Korea told the JoongAng Ilbo.One was apparently killed for nodding off during a meeting with Kim.The executed men were Hwang Min, former agricultural minister, and Ri Yong-jin, who had a senior position in the education ministry, possibly as high as minister level.“I have the information that ministers of agriculture and education were publicly executed on a special order from Kim Jong-un,” said the source. The executions took place at a military academy in Pyongyang, he said, and an anti-aircraft gun was used.If the report is true, it would mark the first execution ordered by Kim Jong-un from outside the Workers’ Party and military.The report may be interpreted as a new reign of terror in North Korea prompted by a series of defections by senior officials that has rekindled talk of instability and disunity among the North Korean elite.“One of the executed is Hwang Min, a former agricultural minister,” said the source. “I understand he was executed because policy proposals he had pushed for were seen as a direct challenge to the Kim Jong-un leadership.""The source did not elaborate what the proposal was or why it was seen as a challenge to the leader. Hwang was replaced by Ko In-ho at a meeting of the rubber-stamp parliament in late June before apparently being executed.The other ill-fated official was Ri Yong-jin, who the source said was a ministerial-level official at the education ministry.“He incurred the wrath of Kim after he dozed off during a meeting presided over by Kim. He was arrested on site and intensively questioned by the state security ministry. He was executed after other charges such as corruption were found during the probe.”In North Korea, there are two ministries related to education: the Ministry of Common Education and Ministry of Higher Education, which are headed by Kim Sung-du and Thae Hyong-chol, who is also president of Kim Il Sung University. A government official said the ill-fated Ri could have had a minister-level position at one of the two.Since taking over after his father’s death in late 2011, Kim has carried out a series of executions of party and military officials. The most high-profile was the December 2013 execution of Jang Song-thaek, Kim’s uncle and former political guardian. Another high-profile execution was that of Hyon Yong-chol, North Korea’s former defense chief, who South Korean intelligence said was executed by firing squad in April 2015 on charges of dozing off during a meeting attended by the supreme leader.If the report of the two executions is true, they may have been related to a series of defections by senior North Korean officials with privileged backgrounds.The recent defection of Thae Yong-ho, formerly No. 2 at the North Korean embassy in London, sparked speculation that there is disunity among the North’s inner circle and a decline in faith in the Kim regime. The young leader could have felt the need to impose a sense of terror among elite officials to reinforce their loyalty.“The recent series of defections by top officials is less a looming sign of the collapse of the North Korean regime than the outcome of the North’s wrong policies for its overseas officials,” said Kim Byung-yeon, professor of economics at Seoul National University, who specializes in the North Korean economy.North Korean officials overseas are said to be under growing pressure to find source of hard currency to be transferred to Pyongyang after sanctions were slapped on the country in March, following its fourth nuclear test in January and a long-range missile launch the following month. Such pressure could have driven elite officials like Thae to opt to defect to the South rather than face dire consequences back home after failing to find the motherland extra sources of foreign exchange, observers say.President Park Geun-hye said Monday that her government would continue to “send a message of hope for North Korean people for the life of liberty and dignity.”At a meeting with senior secretaries at the Blue House, Park said, “Improving human rights conditions in North Korea is a humanitarian issue that cannot be put off any more and a cornerstone to bringing about an era of peace on the Korean Peninsula.”She called on the military to maintain readiness so the North Korean regime can be brought to “self-destruction” should it choose to provoke the South violently.BY KANG JIN-KYU, LEE YOUNG-JONG [kang.jinkyu@joongang.co.kr]', 'Rutgers University, New Jersey’s premier public university, continues to dominate top spots in several national college rankings — it ranks 26th among the nation’s top public schools and 30th in campus ethnic diversity, among other accolades. \n \n But the university’s most recent ranking is one that university administration and prospective students may find less favorable. Of all the public institutions in the country, Rutgers has the most graduate student debt. \n \n According to the Washington Post, the Center for American Progress, a non-partisan public policy think tank, released a report earlier this month, which found that just 20 U.S. universities accounted for $6.5 billion — or one-fifth — of all federal student loan debt for the 2013-2014 academic year. \n \n Ranked 19th on the list was Rutgers University, the only public college to appear in the top 20 alongside pricy private universities like New York University and for-profit colleges like the University of Phoenix. \n \n Ava Lorenzo, an out-of-state graduate student at Rutgers’ campus in New Brunswick, N.J., was not surprised to learn the university was the top public college in the nation in terms of graduate student debt. \n \n She says she has met many in-state students who do not qualify for sufficient federal aid but whose parents’ income are not high enough to finance their full tuition and fees. \n \n “A lot of my friends’ parents who live in New Jersey make a decent salary,” Lorenzo says. “[But] this salary is not enough to fund college completely and also not enough for these students to receive wage-based grants from the federal government. Therefore, most of these kids had to take out a significant amount in loans.” \n \n While Lorenzo funded most of her undergraduate expenses with income-based grants and scholarships, she says she is paying for her doctorate degree with loans. \n \n She adds, “I know [the debt] is adding up, but getting a doctoral degree should mean that I will make enough to live comfortably despite having a loan bill to pay each month.” \n \n In addition, Rutgers has one of the highest tuition rates in the nation among state colleges. And while graduate students enrolled at the university received more than $192 million in federal loans in 2013-2014 academic year, undergraduate students at Rutgers received more than $230,962,547 in federal loans that same year, according to the university’s official 2013-2014 financial aid report. \n \n Candice Yeung, an undergraduate student at the Rutgers campus in Newark, N.J. who is considering enrolling in a graduate program in the next few years, says undergraduate debt alone can be so crippling that it becomes a major factor in the decision to pursue an advanced degree. \n \n “Students spend four years paying or taking out loans for education and in addition to that, there are meal plans and dorm payments for those who choose to dorm at school,” she says. “Then, there are the textbooks, the supplies and the extra accessories that professors demand for a class. Even with jobs, it is hard to maintain a stable financial status in college. To be honest, I try to not think about my student loans. It makes me wonder if I’m going to graduate school or if law school is even worth it.” \n \n While the university offers graduate students scholarships and other financial aid resources — including the Eagleton and Ralph Bunche fellowships — federal student loans remain the primary source of aid, according to NJ.com. \n \n Historically, Americans journeyed to the nation’s top public schools to pursue either an undergraduate or graduate education with an expectation of affordability due to government investment. \n \n Elizabeth Baylor, the director of postsecondary education at Center for American Progress and author the new report, argued in a 2014 analysis that cuts in-state funding of public colleges have made a bachelor’s degree or advanced degree very unaffordable for students across the country. \n \n “In response to the fiscal crisis, the majority of state governments charted a budgetary course that reduced direct support to public colleges and universities, which, not surprisingly, coincided with the increasing unaffordability of these institutions,” Baylor said. “To make up for the funding cuts, public colleges increased their reliance on tuition revenue, which unduly burdened low- and moderate-income families.” \n \n Rutgers University – much like other public colleges — has had to increase tuition in response to state disinvestment in recent years, thus forcing more students to rely more heavily on loans to finance their education. \n \n The university’s board just approved a 2.3% tuition hike in undergraduate tuition and fees and approved similar increases of approximately 2.3% for most graduate students for the 2015-2016 academic year on Thursday.']",2,"– Christopher Kennedy Lawford, an actor, author, and nephew of John F.

13,"['Justice Anthony Kennedy’s retirement — coming on the heels of the chaotic, ugly realpolitik that followed Justice Antonin Scalia’s death — is a good moment to step back and realize just how broken the process for selecting Supreme Court justices now is. \n \n In 2016, Senate Republicans responded to Antonin Scalia’s death by inventing and establishing the absurd faux principle that open seats on the Supreme Court cannot be filled in an election year. Given that America hosts national elections one out of every two years, that means, in theory, that Supreme Court seats should remain unfilled fully 50 percent of the time. \n \n Democrats, infuriated by the GOP’s treatment of President Obama and Merrick Garland, filibustered Neil Gorsuch — the kind of broadly qualified nominee who would’ve passed easily in previous eras. In response, Senate Republicans eliminated the filibuster on Supreme Court nominations. \n \n What we are seeing here is a case of what the political scientist Steven Smith calls “Senate syndrome”: One side breaks a norm or rule, then the other side breaks another in response, and the tit-for-tat escalates until the underlying process is in ruins. That’s now happened with Supreme Court nominations. \n \n Here, in truth, is where the past few years have left us. The minority party no longer holds a scintilla of power over Supreme Court picks. The majority party can and will jam whomever they want onto the Court, where that person will serve for life. But in times when the Senate and the White House are controlled by different parties — which happens fairly often — there’s almost no chance that any seat on the Court will be filled. \n \n Imagine, for a minute, that Democrats win the Senate in 2018 and Ruth Bader Ginsburg retires in 2019. What are the chances, given the precedent of the past few years, that Senate Democrats will permit Trump to replace Ginsburg and give conservatives a 6-3 majority on the Supreme Court? I’d guess somewhere between zero and zero. \n \n This is an insane way to manage one of the most powerful institutions in American life. But the decorous, gentle equilibrium of yesteryear was also nonsensical. There’s always been something bizarre about the idea that a position as important, as long-serving, and as irreversible as Supreme Court justice should be made based on qualifications rather than ideology. \n \n Politics isn’t a résumé competition, it’s a contest for power, and the wielding of that power has real consequences. In practice, the Supreme Court decides how elections are funded, whether abortions are legal, whether millions of people will continue to have health insurance — if elected politicians and activist groups see its composition as a matter of life and death, that’s because it often is. \n \n Yes, Garland was relatively moderate, but if he had replaced Scalia, he would’ve swung the Court to a 5-4 liberal majority, leading to a slew of transformative rulings Republicans would find abhorrent. Yes, Gorsuch was qualified, but he has ruled in ways Democrats find awful, and the clarity of his opinions will not soften their effects. \n \n For that reason, I don’t blame Republicans for blocking Garland. Nor do I blame Democrats for filibustering Gorsuch. And I do not expect Republicans to give Democrats a sliver of oversight over Kennedy’s replacement. \n \n But the result of both sides taking SCOTUS nominations as seriously as they deserve to be taken is disastrous — it will become common for seats on the Court, perhaps multiple at one time, to remain open for years, and when they are filled, they will be filled with more extreme candidates. \n \n The core problem here is the stakes of Supreme Court nominations: They’re too damn high. Candidates serve for life — which, given modern life spans and youthful nominees, can now mean 40 years of decisions — and no one knows when the next seat will open. President Jimmy Carter served four years and saw no open seats. President George H.W. Bush served four years and filled two. Barack Obama served eight years and named two justices. Donald Trump isn’t even two years into his presidency and he’s already been given two vacancies. \n \n The result isn’t merely an undemocratic branch of government but a randomly undemocratic branch of government. And that randomness, and the stakes of seeing it play out in your side’s favor, makes it necessary to turn Supreme Court nominations into bloodsport. It creates incentives for justices to stay on the bench long after the point at which they should’ve retired, in the hopes that they can outlast an ideologically unfriendly administration — Ruth Bader Ginsburg, for instance, is 85, but it’s hard to imagine she won’t do everything in her physical power to hang onto her seat until a Democrat can replace her. It biases presidents toward nominating the youngest qualified jurist they can find, rather than the best jurist they can find. \n \n We need to deescalate Supreme Court fights. The most obvious way to do that is to limit terms. Holding justices to a 10-year, nonrenewable term would lower the stakes of any individual Supreme Court nomination as well as make the timing of fights more predictable. An idea like this could have bipartisan support — Gov. Rick Perry proposed 18-year terms in the 2012 campaign, making an argument that I think sounds even more persuasive today: \n \n Doing this would move the court closer to the people by ensuring that every President would have the opportunity to replace two Justices per term, and that no court could stretch its ideology over multiple generations. Further, this reform would maintain judicial independence, but instill regularity to the nominations process, discourage Justices from choosing a retirement date based on politics, and will stop the ever-increasing tenure of Justices. \n \n Implementing a reform like this would be a step toward repairing and normalizing a process that is now dangerously broken, infuriatingly random, and distorting both our politics and the judges we choose to interpret our laws.', 'The most wanted fugitive from November\'s Paris attacks has been ""caught alive"" after being wounded in a Brussels shootout, say police. \n \n The Belgian asylum minister Theo Francken declared, ""We got him"", referring to 26-year-old Salah Abdeslam, Europe\'s most wanted man. \n \n Abdeslam suffered leg injuries before being arrested, during a major police operation in the Molenbeek suburb. \n \n Television footage showed armed security forces dragging a man wearing a hooded top out of a building and to a car. \n \n At least 10 shots were heard, grenades launched and police helicopters hovered overhead, while fire engines waited in the street. \n \n A suspect is dragged into a car after a raid in Molenbeek \n \n Footage showed masked, black-clad security forces training their weapons towards upper windows of an apartment block. \n \n White smoke could be seen rising above the building, as police with snarling dogs drove crowds in the streets back away from the scene. \n \n Play video ""Suspect Held Outside Brussels Flat"" Video: Suspect Held Outside Brussels Flat \n \n Events As They Unfold: Live Blog \n \n About three hours after Abdeslam\'s arrest, two blasts were heard, before a further suspect - who was still holed up - was detained. \n \n In all, Abdeslam was one of five people arrested in the series of raids, which came after a tip-off to police. \n \n Two of the suspects, including Abdeslam, were injured. \n \n Three of those arrested are being held on suspicion of sheltering Abdeslam and an accomplice. \n \n Play video ""Watch: Explosions At Terror Raid"" Video: Watch: Explosions At Terror Raid \n \n French president Francois Hollande and Belgian PM Charles Michel left a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels on migration amid news of the raid. \n \n Later, the pair held a joint news conference in Brussels where Mr Hollande said France would ask for Abdeslam\'s extradition. \n \n The French leader said it was clear that the Paris attackers had links to Syria and Islamic State and the terror threat remained high. \n \n The shootout comes after Belgian authorities said that fingerprints in a Brussels apartment raided earlier this week belonged to Abdeslam. \n \n A man shot dead in that raid is believed to have been an accomplice of Abdeslam, Belgian prosecutors said on Friday. \n \n Play video ""Terror Standoff In Brussels"" Video: Terror Standoff In Brussels \n \n Sky\'s foreign affairs editor Sam Kiley said that Abdeslam could prove to be ""a goldmine of intelligence"". \n \n Survivors of the attack at the Bataclan venue in Paris reacted to news of the arrest this evening. \n \n Lydia Berkennou said: ""I don’t know why, but deep down in my heart, I knew one of them was him. \n \n ""I knew because I didn’t think he would’ve managed to go back to Syria … I knew he was hiding somewhere."" \n \n Back in November it was reported that Abdeslam had reportedly returned to Brussels with a suicide vest. \n \n Play video ""Ambulances Leave Scene In Brussels"" Video: Ambulances Leave Scene In Brussels \n \n A police source had told The Sunday Times of fears ""there is a walking bomb"" in the Belgian capital. \n \n The source said Abdeslam may have become ""trapped and desperate"" since fleeing the bloodshed which killed 130 people. \n \n After the Paris attacks, reports emerged of a row between Abdeslam and his brother Brahim, on the night before the massacre. \n \n One of their friends told a French documentary he heard one of the brothers telling the other that he was ""not going"" without money. \n \n ""The other one said: \'No, you’re going!\' \n \n 1 / 8 Gallery: Gallery: Paris Attacks Fugitive Captured Alive In Belgium The most wanted fugitive from November\'s Paris attacks has been captured \n \n ""He said to him: \'If I don\'t have any dosh, I’m not budging.

Of course, getting him confirmed is another issue, and the Hill digs into the political logistics in the Senate. Republicans have the numbers, but two wild cards are Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, both of whom support abortion rights and will likely have a big say in who comes next. A remedy: At Vox, Ezra Klein writes that both parties are guilty of turning the nomination process into an ""insane"" one, given the stakes. At this point, if one party held the White House and the other the Senate, it's unlikely any nominee would be confirmed. His solution? Reduce the stakes by limiting justices to 10-year terms. A big percentage: The Washington Post picks out five times Kennedy cast the deciding vote on big issues, on everything from backing abortion rights to supporting gay rights to curtailing the death penalty.

No arrests have been made (it's unclear whose drone it may have been), and the aviation security arm of the Metropolitan Police is looking into the matter. Police note that flying a drone too close to a plane is illegal, NBC News reports, with punishment including up to five years in prison. Specifically, drones over 15 pounds can't fly higher than 400 feet and aren't permitted to fly ""beyond the direct unaided line of sight"" of its operator or near crowds or buildings. Not that the incident came as a total surprise: The head of the International Air Transport Association had previously noted the ""real and growing threat"" of a drone-plane hit, while a British Airline Pilots Association rep says it was ""only a matter of time."" A recent study by Bard College's Center for the Study of the Drone underscores the danger in US airspace, with 327 ""close encounters"" of drones flying within 500 feet of manned aircraft between December 2013 and September 2015, and at least 28 pilots ""[maneuvering] to avoid a collision with a drone."" Frighteningly, aviation experts say they don't really know what would happen if a drone got sucked into a plane's engine, a Civil Aviation Authority rep tells NBC.

But it was only Croatia’s first day at the leading edge of the mass migration, and authorities were scrambling to coordinate their response with E.U. partners. \n \n “We will walk all the way to Germany if we have to,” said Mohammad, 28, who worked in a mobile phone store in Aleppo, Syria’s largest city. \n \n “Shop is gone, house is gone, some of family is gone,” he said. “So I will walk.” \n \n Like many in the migrant stream, he declined to give his last name out of fear of reprisals against relatives back home. \n \n The refugees had nothing good to say about Hungary. “Not nice at all,” said Abdullah, 24, from Aleppo, who smiled and waved at the Croatian police before they hustled him into a van. \n \n “See?

And as restrictions tighten, migrants are seeking other ways into Western Europe through Slovenia and Croatia, as well as through Hungary's border with Romania.

The two rounds that were fired sent passengers scattering in panic. The shot were heard by a special agent of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI). The HSI office is about 150 feet from the shooting. \n \n The agent ran toward the gunfire, continued Miller, identified himself as a federal agent and ordered Moore to drop the gun. Moore turned toward the agent who fired, striking Moore in the upper body. At the same moment, Moore turned his own gun on himself and fired. Moore was dead at the scene. Inside a black suitcase next to where Moore was sitting, HSI, FBI and Houston PD found a black suitcase contains a Smith & Wesson AR15 assault weapon with a fully loaded magazine. \n \n In Moore\'s car, more .223 ammo for the weapon was found. Earlier in the day, Moore had posted on social media that he intended to commit a mass shooting today. A handwritten note found on Moore\'s body said he had changed his mind and wanted to kill himself. \n \n An autopsy will be conducted Friday. \n \n The terminal was closed immediately after the shooting. But later Thursday, parts of the terminal were reopened to passengers. The rest of the airport remained open after the shooting. \n \n Darian Ward, a spokeswoman for the Houston Airport System, said some passengers who were scheduled to leave from Terminal B were rerouted to other terminals. \n \n Dale Howard, of Tomball, was at the baggage handling area of the airport waiting for his sister to arrive on an incoming flight when he heard two shots fired from the floor above. A few seconds later, he said he heard three more shots. \n \n ""People were screaming. I knew exactly what it was \x97 gunfire,"" Howard said. \n \n Police from an adjacent station rushed in, and Howard said he directed them to the floor above. \n \n Greg Newburn, who was in the terminal waiting for a flight to Oklahoma City, said he was sitting in a cafe area when he heard two gunshots and after a pause, several more. \n \n ""It seemed like quite a few shots. Everyone was scrambling, running left and running right, turning tables up and hiding behind tables. Nobody knew what was happening. I couldn\'t tell where the shots were coming from,"" he said. \n \n Newburn, from Gainesville, Fla., said it took him a few seconds to realize that the shots had come from the ticketing area, near the security checkpoint.', 'Page 1 of 1 \n \n UPDATE: Houston police just released this portion of Carnell Marcus Moore\'s suicide note that they say was written on Hotel Derek stationery: \n \n \n \n ""Here in the last hour, I yield to mercy when this could have turned bad.

I ask that authorities handle my disposal – Carnell Marcus Moore"" \n \n ________ \n \n A Beaumont man shot and killed Thursday at Houston\'s George Bush Intercontinental Airport was a reserved person of few words, neighbors said. \n \n But 29-year-old Carnell Marcus Moore wrote of death on his Facebook page earlier Thursday and, according to Houston police, apparently left a suicide note that said he was having trouble controlling his ""monster inside."" \n \n Moore was killed in gunfire about 1:35 p.m. near a Terminal B ticket counter. It is unclear who fired the fatal shot. \n \n HPD spokesman Kese Smith said an armed male in his early 30s entered the airport and fired at least once into the ceiling just inside the doors of the terminal\'s pre-security departure area. \n \n Hearing the gunfire, a Homeland Security Investigations agent came out of his office and confronted Moore, ordering him to put down the gun, Smith said. \n \n When Moore refused the command, the officer pulled out his weapon and the man turned toward him, Smith said. \n \n The agent fired once, and Moore shot himself - apparently at the same time, according to Smith. Moore died at the scene. No one else was injured. \n \n Tricia Bentley, a spokeswoman for the Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences, said an autopsy was expected to be performed on Friday. \n \n Hours after the shooting, officers were at Moore\'s home in Beaumont, carrying out computer equipment, a neighbor said. \n \n Marietta Kidd said she looked out a window toward the duplex where Moore lived and counted seven unmarked cars in her parking lot about the time school let out on Thursday. Kidd said her father owns the home and that her sister is Moore\'s neighbor. \n \n Kidd, who owns a beauty salon on the same street where Moore lived, said he had been in the duplex for several years and that he never talked much. \n \n Moore spoke of death on his Facebook page three times since Wednesday. \n \n \'When I go to meet God\' \n \n The first status update was posted nearly 24 hours before he was killed. ""I recently had the chance of staring death in the face, and she was beautiful,"" he wrote at 1:26 p.m. Wednesday. \n \n About 12:45 a.m. Thursday, he proclaimed that ""This Life Will Crash Tomorrow!"" \n \n And about 12:42 p.m., he posted: ""45 minutes and 59 seconds in God\'s Shadow and Time Stops."" \n \n His timeline also includes a video of a strained and sorrowful spoken word piece called ""When I go to meet God."" \n \n The lyrics include: ""What makes a mother\'s son decide that death is better than tomorrow?"" and ""This is not a life worth living. I already ruined it."" \n \n According to his Facebook profile, Beaumont was Moore\'s hometown, though he finished high school in a Georgia community south of Atlanta. He graduated from the heating, ventilation and air conditioning program at the Lamar Institute of Technology. \n \n \'He was a good guy\' \n \n Colleagues remembered Moore as an affable and kind man. \n \n ""He was a friendly guy who talked to everybody,"" said Tim Knobloch, 29, one of Moore\'s tech school classmates in 2004 and later his co-worker at a Beaumont air conditioning company. ""He was a good guy."" \n \n The shooting scene was chaotic, passengers and employees reported. \n \n Tina Gellinger, a 40-year-old Kansan who went outside between flights, was coming into Terminal B when she heard shouts to ""run!"" \n \n She and others scrambled toward elevators and hid behind walls as gunfire rang out. \n \n Nearby at the McDonald\'s in the food court, employee Tiffany Rigmaiden heard two shots, then shouting, then three more shots. The 23-year-old said a Transportation Security Administration agent running by told her and other workers to get down. Instead, they escaped through a back door and took an elevator to a lower floor. \n \n According to Houston Airport System spokeswoman Darian Ward, Houston police and the FBI ""interviewed quite a few people."" She added that there was no ""visible damage"" to the facility. \n \n The incident also interrupted flights. \n \n Terminal B, where mostly smaller, regional jets land and take off, was shut down for hours.

The company is reviewing taking legal action against both KTVU-TV and the NTSB."" \n \n \n \n Update: The NTSB has released a statement stating an intern is responsible for confirming the incorrect names. Sounds like someone\'s summer internship is over. \n \n KTVU has also provided further explanation into why they said these names on air: They didn\'t say them out loud before rattling them off during their live taping and they didn\'t confirm with the NTSB employee (intern) on their position within the organization. They did, however, call to verify the correct spelling of the names. \n \n \n \n Update: Peter Knudson, a spokesman for the NTSB, just confirmed to SF Weekly that the NTSB did not release the names of the pilots of flight 214 to KTVU, or any news organization, for that matter. \n \n \n \n Original Story: Local station KTVU totally screwed up the names of Asiana Flight 214 pilots when announcing them on live television today, and we\'re a little worried the name ""Ho Lee Fuk"" might actually go down in history. \n \n So just to correct the record: The ill-fated Boeing 777 wasn\'t actually being steered by Mr. Fuk and his co-pilots Sum Ting Wong, Wi Tu Lo, and Bang Ding Ow. \n \n KTVU rushed to fix the blunder and issued an apology,blaming the NTSB for the fuck-up. The apology didn\'t do much to stop screenshots of the offensive names from making their rounds through the blogosphere. \n \n Oh, look -- here they are: \n \n And here\'s a video of the newscaster announcing the names with complete sincerity -- with ""Fuk"" pronounced ""Fook,"" lest you suspect the station of impropriety: \n \n Note: Asiana actually released the names of two pilots -- the ones allegedly responsible for the botched landing -- on Sunday.

But the station was given bad information that made it all the way into the newscast. If you read the names it becomes immediately clear this is a joke, which went unnoticed by the newsroom, producers and the anchor. \n \n You’ll recall earlier this week, KTVU touted its coverage as being not only first, but “100% accurate.” \n \n “Being first on air and on every platform in all aspects of our coverage was a great accomplishment, but being 100% accurate, effectively using our great sources and social media without putting a single piece of erroneous information on our air, is what we are most proud of as a newsroom,” said News Director Lee Rosenthal at the time. Watch: \n \n About 15 minutes later the station corrected its mistake, but claimed an NTSB official had confirmed the names. \n \n Earlier in the newscast we gave some names of pilots involved in the Asiana Airlines crash. These names were not accurate despite an NTSB official in Washington confirming them late this morning. We apologize for this error. \n \n > More: Further apology from KTVU president & GM Tom Raponi: “We sincerely regret the error and took immediate action to apologize, both in the newscast where the mistake occurred, as well as on our website and social media sites. Nothing is more important to us than having the highest level of accuracy and integrity, and we are reviewing our procedures to ensure this type of error does not happen again.” \n \n >More: The NTSB has released a statement saying a summer intern “acted outside the scope of his authority” and mistakenly confirmed the fake names for KTVU Friday morning: \n \n The National Transportation Safety Board apologizes for inaccurate and offensive names that were mistakenly confirmed as those of the pilots of Asiana flight 214, which crashed at San Francisco International Airport on July 6. Earlier today, in response to an inquiry from a media outlet, a summer intern acted outside the scope of his authority when he erroneously confirmed the names of the flight crew on the aircraft.

We work hard to ensure that only appropriate factual information regarding an investigation is released and deeply regret today’s incident. Appropriate actions will be taken to ensure that such a serious error is not repeated. \n \n > More: An apology on the 6pm news: “We made several mistakes. First of all, we never read the names out loud, phonetically sounding them out.” \n \n > More: The AAJA responds: “Those names were not only wrong, but so grossly offensive that it’s hard for us at the Asian American Journalists Association to fathom how those names made it on the broadcast.”']",2,"– There's not fact checking, and then there's ... not even using your brain.

The network later apologized, but said an NTSB official in Washington had ""confirmed"" them. It wasn't exactly an official.

20,"['If all goes well, the Curiosity rover will be on the Mars surface at about 1:17 a.m. Eastern time, and 13 minutes, 48 seconds later (the time it takes for a radio signal to travel 154 million miles to Earth from Mars), there will be confirmation and cheering in the control room at 1:31 a.m., give or take a minute or so. \n \n Or there could be silence – nothing from the rover, and probably a somber pall in mission control. \n \n But it would not necessarily mean that the Curiosity had come to a quick, unfortunate demise. It could just be an interplanetary communications glitch. \n \n There are several transmitters on the spacecraft that will broadcast at different frequencies. Using one of them, the so-called X-band, the Curiosity will send simple messages directly to Earth. But, a couple of minutes before landing, the landing site at Gale Crater will rotate out of view from Earth – that means the direct communications path will be blocked, too. \n \n In addition, the spacecraft will be broadcasting a wealth a data using a UHF antenna. That is not powerful enough to be picked up by antenna on Earth, but a NASA orbiter, Mars Odyssey, will act as a relay, re-transmitting the data to Earth in real-time. \n \n If anything goes wrong with the Curiosity-to-Odyssey-to-Earth communications, then the result will be silence. \n \n That is not inconceivable, especially as Odyssey experienced a malfunction two months ago with one of three spinning wheels used to orient the spacecraft. A spare wheel was put into operation, but if it turns out that Odyssey cannot turn itself toward Curiosity, it will not hear anything. \n \n If Odyssey misses Curiosity’s messages, a second orbiter, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, will also be listening. But Reconnaissance Orbiter will be recording the data, not relaying it, and engineers on Earth will not get to sift through that information until hours later. \n \n If silence persists, the two orbiters will make additional passes over Curiosity over the next day, and late on Monday, the Curiosity will be able to talk directly to Earth, bypassing the orbiters. \n \n NASA engineers said it is quite possible for Curiosity to land successfully and that they would not find out for hours. Once they establish contact, the mission proceeds. \n \n But if a full day passes without hearing from Curiosity, then pessimism will set in that something had gone terribly wrong. \n \n — KENNETH CHANG', 'That landing is scheduled for 1:31 a.m., and officials said they could know almost immediately if the rover was safely on the ground. That tracking would come from the Odyssey orbiter circling Mars, if the spacecraft is able to get to the right location at the right time. \n \n If not, the waiting time for a final answer on whether the rover was safely on the surface could range from two to eight hours. If no signal arrives from Curiosity via three Mars orbiters and the Deep Space Network after 18 hours, NASA officials said, then they would start to worry about its safety. \n \n The final descent has been pre-programmed and the army of engineers and scientists at the Jet Propulsion Lab’s Mission Control have no control over it. “Our position will be identical to anyone at home,” said Adam Steltzner, lead of the Entry, Descent and Landing (EDL) team. “We’re all along for the ride.” \n \n Speaking for the team as a whole, Steltzner said they were “Rationally confident, emotionally terrified and ready for EDL.” \n \n Because the rover is so much larger, more complicated and more ambitious than earlier models, it has to land in a new and far more hazardous way. The landing, which could never be tested in full on Earth, includes a hovering rocket stage, a kind of sky crane, to lower it to the ground. NASA’s chief scientist John Grunsfeld has said that because of that heightened landing difficulty, in addition to the unprecedented sophistication of the instruments on board, Curiosity is “the most important NASA mission of the decade.” \n \n Worldwide spectacle \n \n The Curiosity landing is shaping up to be an international spectacle. Formal “landing” parties have been scheduled from South Australia to Rome, from Israel to Crete; and in the United States from Atlanta to Seattle, Milwaukee to Honolulu. \n \n NASA also has helped organize a landing gathering in New York’s Times Square, which will feature a large screen that will beam the streaming news from atop a building and high above the crowd. \n \n Reaching, orbiting and landing on Mars is notoriously hard.

She cooks beef four nights a week and can list dozens of ways she likes it: T-bone, tri-tip, boneless rump roast...Flores, a graduate student in veterinary medicine at Washington State University-Pullman , plans to work in the beef industry when she finishes.

Yet he\'s wary of the interests behind the campaign, noting that a PR firm funded by McDonald\'s reportedly urged elementary schools not to let Fast Food Nation author Eric Schlosser speak to kids. \n \n Asked if the MBA is just a phony PR campaign for Big Ag, Flores is emphatic: ""We\'re not Astroturf. We\'re just worried about our futures in agriculture."" The dozen or so MBA grads and young farmers I spoke to shared similar anxieties. ""We know the environment is in crisis and we don\'t want to contribute to that,"" says Crystal Young, a recent graduate of Kansas State University, where she received degrees in animal science and journalism. ""But we\'re also farmers, so the hard thing for us is to take into account all the criticisms of conventional agriculture, and to also continue to feed the world on the scale we are doing now.

And he\'d extended the invitation to his family\'s feast without anyone in his house knowing. \n \n His mom, Landi McCormick, was in the kitchen preparing Thanksgiving dinner with her mom while Billy was outside with his grandfather and his little brother, 4-year-old Camden. Billy was playing with an old cell phone when his grandfather noticed that he was talking to someone. \n \n “I came out and asked him what he was doing,” McCormick recalled. \n \n Billy looked at his mother rather sheepishly and admitted that he had dialed 911. \n \n “I asked him, ‘Why did you do that? You know that you are only supposed to do that if there’s an emergency,’ ” McCormick said. “He started crying, and just a few minutes later Deputy (Dannon) Byrd from the Sheriff’s Office drove up.” \n \n The deputy walked up to McCormick and asked if Billy was the young man who had called 911. Rather than scold the little boy, Byrd knelt down and thanked Billy for his kind invitation. \n \n “He told us that Billy had made his day,” McCormick said. “But then he reminded him that we should only use 911 for emergencies.” \n \n As an added treat, Byrd and his partner, Deputy Aaron Ethridge, gave the boy a sheriff’s badge and allowed him to sit in their patrol car and activate the lights and siren. \n \n “They asked him what he wanted to be when he grew up,” McCormick said. “He said, ‘I want to be a cop, so I can be nice to little kids like you are some day.’ ” \n \n Billy said he first became aware of the Walton County Sheriff\'s Office when deputies visited his school, Maude Saunders Elementary, for Dads and Donuts Day. \n \n ""I wanted them to have cheesecake with us,"" Billy said, explaining why he invited the deputies for dinner. ""It\'s my favorite, so I wanted them to have some, too."" \n \n WSCO Public Information Officer Corey Dobridnia posted some photos from the visit on the Sheriff’s Office Facebook page, and the post quickly went viral.

But CGI is a ""roll-up"" company formed by acquiring other companies—one of which, American Management Systems, was one giant black mark. AMS projects have hit trouble in at least 12 states as well as at the federal level, including a much-publicized 2001 failure to automate federal retirement benefits. The company went $60 million over budget on that one, yet produced nothing useful. More than 100 AMS alumni are now CGI executives or consultants.

I would consider that dropping the ball."" But it didn't come up in 2007, and CMS never re-vetted the company, the Post's review of internal documents reveals. On the bright side, the review also reveals that the decision was politics-free, made purely because officials considered CMS' bid ""technically superior.""

Jon Tester, who won a hard-fought, close contest Tuesday over Republican challenger U.S. Rep. Denny Rehberg, said Wednesday it’s time for Congress to put aside partisanship and tackle the nation’s pressing problems. \n \n Tester, speaking in Great Falls shortly after he was declared the winner, said those problems include the federal deficit, taxes, the economy – and the tidal wave of “relentless, secretive political spending” seen in his race and many others across the nation. \n \n “This is larger than me,” he said in an interview. “The outside money that’s coming in (to politics) is bad for democracy. \n \n “We’ve got to get some transparency in this process, at a minimum ... so we know who’s footing the bill. It shouldn’t be about someone who has a ton of money, trying to buy an election.” \n \n Tester, 56, a farmer from Big Sandy, led by 16,000 votes over Rehberg late Wednesday, with some votes yet to be counted in Yellowstone, Silver Bow, Ravalli and Flathead counties. \n \n Tester had 48.5 percent of the vote, while Rehberg had nearly 45 percent. Libertarian Dan Cox of Hamilton carried a significant 6.5 percent, one of the highest showings by a Libertarian in a statewide race. \n \n Rehberg, 57, Montana’s sole congressman since 2001, conceded the race Wednesday morning, issuing a statement that said it had been “an honor to serve the people of Montana.” \n \n “The voters of our state have spoken and I respect their decision,” he said. “Senator Tester and I share an abiding love for Montana and America, a value which transcends political party or disagreements on matters of policy.” \n \n Tester also complimented Rehberg on a “well-fought race,” and said he knew Rehberg would agree that the nation faces big challenges that need to be addressed. \n \n “Despite our differences, we belong to the greatest state and the greatest nation in the world,” Tester said. “We owe thanks to Congressman Rehberg. He has spent a career in public service.” \n \n Rehberg, a rancher from Billings, has been a key figure in Montana politics for more than 30 years, also holding office as state representative and lieutenant governor. \n \n Tester said he’s hopeful Congress will start acting on plans to reduce the nation’s debt and federal deficit and reform the tax code, to make it simpler and more fair. \n \n “I think there is a nucleus of people back in (Washington) D.C. who are willing to do it,” he said. “The bottom line is ... when we deal with that in a common-sense way, I think it will help the economy.” \n \n Tester also said he’d like his wilderness/jobs bill to pass Congress, either as part of an Interior spending package this year or as a stand-alone bill next year. The measure, stalled in Congress since 2009, would create new wilderness in western Montana forests while identifying new acreage for logging. \n \n Yet Tester spoke most forcefully Wednesday about shining a light on the river of money spent on his contest and many others by so-called outside and “dark” money – groups that often don’t have to disclose or detail their donors or expenditures. \n \n Observers estimated that outside groups spent $30 million or more on the Tester-Rehberg matchup, including at least half that amount by nonprofit groups that can keep their donors secret. \n \n The contest was the most expensive in Montana history, as Rehberg and Tester spent about $20 million of their own campaign money, in addition to the outside cash by party and interest groups. \n \n Tester said groups should fully disclose their spending to influence federal elections – including the nonprofits that now keep their donors secret. \n \n On Tuesday, Tester sprinted to a solid lead of about 20,000 votes in early returns and never relinquished it. Cox also started out strongly, polling 5 percent to 6 percent in the first returns – a level he held throughout the vote-counting. \n \n While the Associated Press called the race at about 9 a.m. Wednesday, elections officials in Billings, Kalispell, Butte and Hamilton were still counting some ballots late Wednesday afternoon. \n \n The biggest lag occurred in Billings, where officials said the final count wouldn’t be finished until Wednesday evening.

The ruling in Lauri Love\'s appeal against extradition to the United States, where he faced solitary confinement... (Associated Press) \n \n LONDON (AP) — An alleged computer hacker from Britain won his appeal Monday against extradition to the United States. \n \n The High Court in London ruled that Lauri Love\'s extradition wouldn\'t be allowed, although judges said it would still be possible to prosecute him in England. \n \n The decision in Love\'s favor was greeted with cheers in the courtroom. \n \n U.S. officials had requested Love\'s extradition on cyber-hacking charges for allegedly compromising government networks between October 2012 and October 2013 and stealing data. \n \n Love, 32, has Asperger\'s syndrome and a depressive illness. His lawyers said it would be ""unjust and oppressive"" to send him to the U.S. to face trial. \n \n He said outside the courthouse he hopes his case can help spur discussion about how people with mental health issues are handled by the justice system. \n \n ""This decision is important for the appropriate administration of criminal justice and also for the humanitarian accommodation of people whose brains work differently,"" he said. \n \n He criticized prosecutors for suggesting his mental issues were fabricated, saying that only served to stigmatize people with similar problems. \n \n Love is alleged to have stolen large quantities of data from various American agencies, including the Department of Defense, the Federal Reserve and NASA, and the U.S. Army. \n \n He has been charged in three U.S. states: New Jersey, New York and Virginia. \n \n At a hearing in November, his legal team said there was a high risk that Love would kill himself if extradited. \n \n In their ruling, the High Court judges raised the possibility that Love could be put on trial in England, saying that that wouldn\'t be considered ""oppressive"" and that he would be much less of a suicide risk if imprisoned in England because he would be close to his family and loves ones. \n \n The judges said the Crown Prosecution Service ""must now bend its endeavors to his prosecution, with the assistance to be expected from the authorities in the United States, recognizing the gravity of the allegations in this case, and the harm done to the victims."" \n \n Prosecutors haven\'t indicated whether charges will be brought against Love in Britain.', 'Be your own boss, set your own schedule, and have more time to pursue your goals and dreams.

The AP reports the judges felt his suicide risk would be lessened if he was jailed in England, where family and friends would be accessible to him. The BBC and Wired quote Love as saying ""the reason I have gone through this ordeal is not to just to save myself from being kidnapped and locked up for 99 years in a country I have never visited,"" but that he hoped his case set a ""precedent so this will not happen to people in the future. ... I'm hoping that this outcome can contribute to the discussion we are having as a society about how to accommodate people that have neuro-diversity, whose brains are made up in a slightly different way."" Wired notes that Love would have faced up to 99 years and a fine of up to $9 million were he convicted in US courts. As for prospects of being tried on his own shore, the judges in their ruling ""emphasize ... that it would not be oppressive to prosecute Mr. Love in England for the offences alleged against him."""

Protein-deficiency malnutrition and anaemia are health concerns for pregnant women and meats are a great source of both protein and iron, which is better absorbed from animal sources than plant sources,” said senior gynaecologist and obstetrician Malavika Sabharwal of the Apollo Healthcare Group. \n \n As for sex, if the pregnancy is normal, there is no need for abstinence as the baby in the womb is protected by the amniotic fluid and the uterus muscles. \n \n “Caution is advised during the first trimester when the placenta is low-lying and for complicated pregnancies, where there is a miscarriage risk,” said Suneeta Mittal, director of the obstetrics and gynaecology at Fortis Gurgaon. \n \n Some studies show that a mother’s stress, anxiety and depression may affect the baby’s development. \n \n “Pregnant women need to be happy and instead of being prescriptive about what they should think and do to be happy, we must urge them to do things they enjoy and strongly advise the family be to supportive,” Sabharwal added. \n \n Around 44,000 women die of pregnancy-related causes in India each year, official data show.

India’s government is advising... (Associated Press) \n \n NEW DELHI (AP) — India\'s government is advising pregnant women to avoid all meat, eggs and lusty thoughts. \n \n Doctors say the advice is preposterous, and even dangerous, considering India\'s already-poor record with maternal health. Women are often the last to eat or receive health care in traditionally patriarchal Indian households. \n \n Malnutrition and anemia, or iron deficiency, are key factors behind India\'s having one of the world\'s highest rates of maternal mortality, with 174 of every 100,000 pregnancies resulting in the mother\'s death in 2015. That\'s better than five years earlier, when the maternal mortality rate was 205 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births, but still far worse than China\'s 27 per 100,000 or the United States\' 14 per 100,000, according to UNICEF. \n \n ""The government is doling out unscientific and irrational advice, instead of ensuring that poor pregnant women get to eat a nutritious, high-protein diet,"" said gynecologist Arun Gadre, who is based in the western Indian city of Pune but works in rural areas. \n \n The government booklet, titled ""Mother and Child Care,"" smacks of religious dogma and ignores widely accepted medical evidence that pregnant women benefit from eating protein-rich meats and can safely engage in sex, doctors said. \n \n It says pregnant women should also shun ""impure thoughts"" and look at pictures of beautiful babies to benefit the fetus. \n \n ""Pregnant women should detach themselves from desire, anger, attachment, hatred and lust,"" reads the booklet, released last week by the Central Council for Research in Yoga and Naturopathy, a part of the government\'s ministry that promotes traditional and alternative medicine. \n \n The traditional medicine minister defended the booklet as containing ""wisdom accumulated over many centuries,"" and said it did not advise specifically against sex, only against all thoughts of desire or lust. \n \n ""The booklet puts together relevant facts culled out from clinical practice in the fields of yoga and naturopathy,"" Minister Shripad Naik said. \n \n The advice is unlikely to be followed at the many government-run health centers across India. They are operated by the Health Ministry, which has had past conflicts with the traditional medicine ministry and follows more scientific practices. \n \n The booklet is the latest push for vegetarianism by Prime Minister Narendra Modi\'s Hindu-nationalist government, which already advocates avoiding beef and strictly limits the transportation and slaughter of cows, which are considered sacred by Hindus. \n \n But the latest homily to pregnant women has outraged the medical community. \n \n ""This is a national shame. If the calories of expectant mothers are further reduced by asking them to shun meat and eggs, this situation will only worsen,"" Gadre said. ""This is absurd advice to be giving to pregnant women in a country like India."" \n \n About a third of India\'s 1.3 billion people struggle to live on less than $2 a day. Many are lucky to eat more than one full meal a day, and women often give their portions up to their hungry children or husbands. \n \n Malnourished women are more likely to give birth to underweight babies, who then are in danger of being ""stunted"" or not growing to their full height and weight. A full 48 percent of all Indian children under the age of 5 are considered stunted, according to a 2015 report by UNICEF. \n \n ""Undernourished girls grow into undernourished women. Married by their families while still in their teens, these girls become pregnant by the time they are 17 or 18, when their bodies have not matured enough to safely deliver a child,"" said Amit Sengupta, a physician and health care activist with the Delhi Science Forum, a public advocacy organization. \n \n He said the government\'s advice to pregnant women betrayed ""backward thinking"" and hostility toward evidence-based science. \n \n ""This kind of advice is detrimental to women\'s health,"" he said.']",2,"– A government pamphlet's advice for pregnant women in India isn't going over well. The booklet titled ""Mother and Child Care"" tells the women to ""detach themselves from desire, anger, attachment, hatred and lust,"" spurn ""impure thoughts,"" look at ""beautiful pictures"" to benefit their fetus, and avoid meat and eggs, per the AP and Hindustan Times. According to one gynecologist in India, the advice isn't just ""unscientific and irrational,"" but it's ""a national shame"" in a country where 174 of every 100,000 pregnancies resulted in the mother's death in 2015, due in part to malnutrition and anemia. That's compared to 14 deaths per 100,000 pregnancies in the US, according to UNICEF. Since women are typically the last to eat and receive medical care in Indian households, the government should be ""ensuring that poor pregnant women get to eat a nutritious, high-protein diet,"" says gynecologist Arun Gadre. This would also help prevent stunted births; some 48% of Indian children under 5 have not grown to the proper height and weight. But ""if the calories of expectant mothers are further reduced by asking them to shun meat and eggs, this situation will only worsen,"" Gadre says. With its advice against lust, the pamphlet also suggests that engaging in sex is dangerous for pregnant women, contrary to medical evidence. A government minister charged with promoting traditional and alternative medicine says the booklet contains ""wisdom accumulated over many centuries"" from ""the fields of yoga and naturopathy."""
29,"['Correction: Earlier versions of this article misspelled the name of reality-TV personality Tareq Salahi. This version has been corrected. \n \n A couple of thousand people were held hostage by Charlie Sheen’s ego Tuesday night in an auditorium named after the female descendants of the American Revolution, half a mile from the World War II Memorial in the capital of the free world. This prompts an icky existential question: If the abusive ex-star of a CBS sitcom can compel a legion of citizens to pay $104.25 apiece to be doused in cultural bile, is the free world a little too free? \n \n The answer, of course, is no. Mostly no. No, except for the five seconds after Sheen seemed to imply that he believes President Obama wasn’t born in the United States, triggering boisterous applause from the mostly young, near-capacity crowd at the 3,700-seat DAR Constitution Hall. Sheen seemed to toy with the idea of running for president (with Nicolas Cage) and noted that his birth certificate was not “Photoshopped.” \n \n The man has become so unreadable that it was hard to tell whether he was joking or serious. He was, though, noncommittal about running and occasionally circumspect. \n \n “Every day is just one day,” Sheen said at the top of the show. “Tomorrow is not here yet.” \n \n It was the end of a long day for Sheen, who deployed his lawyers to two court hearings in Southern California on Tuesday morning, charioted himself in a black Rolls-Royce to the Van Nuys Airport that afternoon, and blazed across the continent in a private jet to walk onstage 67 minutes late for his show in downtown Washington, the halfway point in his 20-city tour titled “Violent Torpedo of Truth: Defeat Is Not an Option,” a kind of Sherman’s March of the male libido. \n \n Washington as a whole greeted Sheen with a feisty, inebriated bear hug, but there was some wonky thoughtfulness in the crowd. \n \n “I came here to see Charlie Sheen on an extended loop and be both horrified and entertained,” said a 34-year-old lobbyist who declined to give her name because she’s a “professional girl” who “cares about my future.” \n \n “Not often can you see a public figure implode in front of your eyes — usually you can only see that through the media,” said her 40-year-old lobbyist friend, who was also too embarrassed to be identified. \n \n “We perpetuate this image that is fake and a lie, and we put it on television,” railed a TV reporter into her cellphone — presumably to an editor — as she prepared to do a spot from outside the venue before the show started. “That’s how I feel as a journalist.” \n \n Me, too, but here’s the straightest scoop deliverable: The show began with a stream-of-consciousness monologue about Sheen’s hatred of ex-wives and his failure to secure sole custody of his children earlier in the day. It lurched onward to a dry sit-down interview — led by much-booed WBIG (100.3 FM) host Tommy Griffiths — about the first time Sheen met Marlon Brando. The crowd quaked with catcalls whenever Sheen wasn’t talking about doing drugs or manhandling women. \n \n “ENTERTAIN US,” boomed a male voice as Sheen waxed philosophical on the hard living of Dennis Hopper. \n \n “SHUT THE [EXPLETIVE] UP AND SAY SOMETHING WEIRD,” demanded another. \n \n It has been less than two months since Sheen outed himself as a warlock who is capable of ingesting “epic” amounts of cocaine, vanquishing addiction with his superhuman mind, shrugging off his nearly $2 million-an-episode job with Warner Bros. and orating on national television about the vague, seemingly mutable bylaws of nature and space-time (Google “winning” and “tiger blood” and “Adonis DNA” and so on). \n \n In the first week or so of his renaissance (or breakdown, depending on your standards), it seemed as if Sheen was onto something, as if he were imbued with a spiritual clarity reserved for prophets, as if he were pulverizing and remolding the very notion of celebrity. \n \n That notion of celebrity now seems to belong to his audiences — or at least the one at DAR, whose restlessness guided the rhythms of the show and whose outbursts were often more entertaining than the ramblings of Sheen or his better-received guest, stand-up comic Jeff Ross. \n \n “Curiosity about exploitation” was why 33-year-old Arlington salesman Johnny Champane came with three friends at the last minute. “Exploitation of himself. Of us. We bought tickets, didn’t we?” \n \n Since this was Washington, Griffiths asked Sheen how he’d handle Libyan dictator Moammar Gaddafi (“I’d make him marry [my ex-wives] Brooke and Denise”) and about what he’d defund to balance the budget (disband the Fed and “send the IRS to prison”). The crowd veered between boos and applause so frequently and quickly that one was indistinguishable from another. \n \n “Geez, you guys hate everything,” Sheen said at one point. \n \n Recognizable Washingtonians in attendance included Tareq and Michaele Salahi, the infamous White House gate-crashers and erstwhile reality-TV personalities, who signed autographs in the lobby, where they inadvertently created the event-horizon of a cultural black hole.', 'New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, right, and Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly announce the arrest of 19 people and seizure of 254 guns as part of gun smuggling between the Carolinas and New York, Monday,... (Associated Press) \n \n A pair of gunrunners smuggled firearms into New York City by hiding them in luggage they carried on discount buses that offered cheap fares and lesser odds of getting caught, authorities said Monday. \n \n An undercover city police officer posing as a gun broker for criminal customers bought 254 weapons from the men in dozens of transactions since last year _ the largest gun seizures in the city in recent memory. One of the guns was an assault rifle that was disassembled and transported in a girlfriend\'s zebra-striped bag, authorities said. \n \n The alleged smugglers, Walter Walker and Earl Campbell, were among 19 people arrested in New York and in North Carolina and South Carolina _ states where the guns originated _ as the result of a 10-month investigation. Also charged was an aspiring rapper from Brooklyn. \n \n Walker and Campbell were arrested earlier this month by local police in their home states, authorities said. The names of their defense attorneys were not immediately available. \n \n New York Police Department officials and prosecutors announced details of the case on Monday, citing it as another example of a persistent black market in which firearms from the South can sell for three times their original price in the city. New York has some of the nation\'s strictest gun-control measures and a mayor who has crusaded for tougher laws in other states. \n \n ""There is no doubt that the seizure of these guns has saved lives,"" Mayor Michael Bloomberg said at a news conference. \n \n Wiretap evidence showed that sellers in the Carolinas knew the weapons were destined for New York, said Special Narcotics Prosecutor Bridget Brennan. \n \n ""Perhaps the two most disturbing aspects of the gun-trafficking operation were the simplicity of the business model, and the complete indifference of the gun suppliers to the mayhem their actions would cause here in New York City,"" Brennan said. ""The marketing strategy was buy low, sell high and keep a low profile."" \n \n The gun case was a spinoff of a drug investigation in Brooklyn that turned up Instagram photos of handguns and wads of cash posted by the rapper. Wiretap and other evidence led investigators to Walker, 29, of Sanford, N.C. and Campbell, 24, of Rock Hill, S.C., who were smuggling guns separately but using the same middleman in New York City, authorities said. \n \n The two tapped a loose network of suppliers in their hometowns, authorities said. Some guns were obtained on the black market, while others were bought from gun dealers using straw buyers to get around one-gun-a-month restrictions. \n \n ""The problem is that the gun laws passed now, so it\'s like now I can only buy a gun from a gun store every 30 days,"" Campbell complained in one conversation, according to an indictment. ""So I had to, like, pay different people to keep buying different guns."" \n \n Before heading to New York, Campbell would get photos of the guns his suppliers were offering and send the images to the undercover officer, authorities said. Both defendants would travel to the city carrying a dozen or more handguns, rifles and shotguns in bags that were stowed in luggage compartments of Chinatown-based carriers also favored by drug couriers, investigators said. \n \n One of the discount bus companies charges $60 one-way from Raleigh, N.C., to New York. The fare is about half that charged by Greyhound, which, unlike the Chinatown buses, requires identification for boarding. \n \n Walker met two times last year with the middleman and the undercover officer at the rapper\'s Brooklyn recording studio to sell the undercover firearms, the indictment said. He also alleged sold weapons to the undercover in April in Manhattan. \n \n In January, the undercover officer met with Campbell and his girlfriend, who was carrying assault rifle parts in her zebra-striped suitcase, authorities said. The girlfriend struggled to assemble the weapon in the backseat of a car by using a YouTube instructional video she called up on her smartphone, investigators said. When she failed, the undercover bought the pieces anyway for $1,100, they said.']",2,"– Charlie Sheen may have alienated his ""truther"" fans, but it looks like he'll be able to replace them with birthers.

Sheen—observing that a poll shows him beating ""that lunatic from Alaska"" Sarah Palin—discussed the possibility of a presidential bid, with Nicolas Cage as his running mate, Politico reports. President Sheen would legalize pot, ""send the IRS to prison,"" and deal with Moammar Gadhafi by sending ex-wife Denise Richards and soon-to-be-ex-wife Brooke Mueller to Libya.

In many cases, they are suspected of harming their children or other loved ones. As a result, when under investigation, they may be coping with deep personal loss, rendering them especially vulnerable to high-pressure interrogation tactics that can lead to false confessions or seemingly inculpatory statements. When women—traditionally viewed as nurturers and protectors—are accused of murdering or sexually abusing children, they are particularly reviled by society, including, of course, police, prosecutors, judges, jurors, and witnesses. 40% of female exonerees were convicted harming children or loved ones in their care. \n \n In cases in which no crime has occurred—such as accidental or natural deaths that are mistaken for homicides—the evidence is often entirely circumstantial. DNA evidence, the gold standard for exonerating the innocent, has been central to less than 3% of women\'s exonerations (compared to 22% of men\'s exonerations). In circumstantial cases, other types of forensic evidence may play an unusually large role, yet the evidence may be erroneous. More than a third of exonerated women\'s cases involved flawed or misleading forensic evidence. Two-thirds of female exonerees were convicted in cases in which no crime occurred. \n \n *Statistics on this webpage are derived from the National Registry of Exonerations and are reasonably current but may not be fully up to date.', 'Center on Wrongful Convictions \n \n CWC client Tommy Ward featured in The Innocent Man, premiering on Netflix December 14, 2018 \n \n The Innocent Man Netflix series includes the story of the Center on Wrongful Convictions’ client Tommy Ward.

Case in point is Karl Lagerfeld, who today announced he has teamed up with Faber-Castell to create a brand-spanking-new set of fine artist tools. The limited-edition collection is fittingly labeled Karlbox with a slogan that reads: “Colours in black.” Only 2,500 have been made and each boasts its own unique serial number as well as a certificate of authenticity and a steep $2,850 price tag. Vogue.com can exclusively reveal that the Kaiser himself has already ordered five—one for each of his international offices. \n \n Far from your average store-bought Crayola fare, Karlbox comes luxuriously equipped with a staggering 350 different premium-grade supplies for drawing and painting, including Lagerfeld’s own personal favorite product line, the Albrecht Dürer artist’s water-soluble color pencils—all 120 shades of them. Everything is housed in an über-chic black lacquered box designed by Lagerfeld. The beech wooden frame is reminiscent of a Chinese wedding cabinet; inside, drawers store utensils carefully sorted by primary and secondary color palettes that range from soft pastels to bolder pigmentations, all of which have been handpicked by the couturier. \n \n Expand \n \n The color family found in each section is thoughtfully etched along the side spelled out in three different languages: English, French, and German. All five of the individual drawers are removable so as to set them up for creative work, while essential accessories such as a foldable Clic & Go water cup are also included. “To me, drawing is like breathing and writing. These are the things that almost relax me,” said the designer in a press release. Lagerfeld is fluent in the delicate synergy between fashion and design, and is said to often turn to pen and paper when bringing his new ideas to life. Of course, the first lesson in the art of expressing oneself is all about having the right tools, making the Karlbox collection expertly tailored to seriously stylish adults this back-to-school season. Though we think Lagerfeld’s 7-year-old muse, Hudson Kroenig, would also no doubt approve. \n \n Karlbox is available for purchase online and sold exclusively at Faber-Castell stores, Karl Lagerfeld boutiques worldwide, Harrods London, and Gump’s in San Francisco.']",3,"– Exonerating women who are wrongfully convicted of violent crimes is no easy task—just ask Kristine Bunch. She got 60 years for supposedly setting the fire that killed her 3-year-old son in 1995, and struggled to find anyone who could help, Mother Jones reports. Finally, lawyers at the Center on Wrongful Convictions at Northwestern University's law school exposed a glaring hole (and possibly corruption) in the arson investigators' case. That evidence got Bunch released in 2012 after 16 years in prison, USA Today reported at the time. Then two lawyers from the Center, Karen Daniel and Judy Royal, began helping wrongfully convicted women based on a shocking statistic: Women constitute roughly 11% of violent-crime convictions but only 6% of overturned cases. But why are women's cases harder to overturn? Daniel and Royal give their reasons: Women are usually convicted of violent crimes against people close to them (like a husband or son) so DNA evidence won't help; the suspect's DNA is already spread around the crime scene. By contrast, men usually assault or kill strangers. An incredible 63% of women's exoneration cases turn out to be accidents or suicides rather than crimes. So instead of finding a ""real culprit,"" Daniel and Royal may have to laboriously dismantle the prosecutors' case, perhaps with new science on arson or shaken-baby syndrome that not everyone accepts. Sexist stereotypes are used against women in court. In the case of a woman wrongfully convicted of murdering her son, the prosecutor implied she did it to pursue a modeling career. ""That was based on one tiny conversation expressing slight interest in maybe having a nice photo taken,"" says Daniel. ""Almost every case has something like this.""

Although multiple studies have identified risk factors for the development of ESCC, notably, exposure to alcohol and tobacco, this research is the first meta-analysis to look at the interaction between alcohol and tobacco in the risk of ESCC, a class of esophageal cancer that begins in the flat cells lining the esophagus. \n \n ""Our study suggests that not only do alcohol and tobacco play an important role in the development of esophageal cancer, the combination of their use markedly increases their potency as carcinogens.

But at the BBC, a review of existing research on the topic suggests the drinks' variety itself isn't the problem. Instead, Claudia Hammond points to other possible factors. For instance, she notes, having several different types of drinks may simply mean drinking more total alcohol. (As for ""beer before liquor, never been sicker""? It appears no research has been done to prove or disprove the idea that drink order makes a difference.) ""The existing evidence suggests that hangovers can't be blamed on mixing drinks,"" Hammond writes. But the amount of alcohol may not be the only culprit: Congeners, the non-ethanol products of the fermentation process, also contribute to a hangover. Tannins, for instance, are responsible for the color in darker types of alcohol. There are 37 times more congeners in bourbon than in vodka, and one study found that bourbon drinkers reported worse hangovers than those who drank vodka. So, Hammond writes, people having various types of drinks in a single night may end up indulging in drinks with more tannins. So go ahead and mix types of alcohol if you so desire, but you may want to avoid mixing alcohol with cigarettes: A study last month found that people who smoke and drink are at a higher risk of developing esophageal cancer, Science Daily reported.

40,"['BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) — Scientists from the U.S. and Denmark are seeking to map out the plumbing system hidden inside the earth\'s crust that\'s responsible for the famous Old Faithful geyser and other hydrothermal features at Yellowstone National Park. \n \n Throughout November the research team will conduct flights over the park using a giant, hoop-shaped electromagnetic system suspended from a helicopter. The device acts like an X-ray to determine where and how hot water flows beneath the surface. \n \n The team also hopes to gain insights into the infrequent but sometimes massive hydrothermal explosions that occur in the park, said lead scientist Carol Finn with the U.S. Geological Survey. \n \n One such explosion, or possibly multiple explosions, that occurred roughly 13,800 years ago left a crater that measures 1-1/2 miles (2.6 km) across beneath at the bottom of Yellowstone Lake. It\'s believed to be the largest such crater in the world. \n \n Similar to the regular eruptions of Old Faithful, hydrothermal explosions occur when huge pockets of boiling water beneath the ground experience a sudden drop in pressure, causing the water to convert to steam and explode violently to the surface. \n \n Similar work elsewhere in the U.S. has helped reveal hazards from volcanoes. \n \n ""Nobody knows anything about the flow paths"" for the hot water that erupts from Yellowstone\'s geysers, Finn said. ""Does it travel down and back up? Does it travel laterally?"" \n \n The electromagnetic system was developed in Denmark to map out groundwater supplies in Denmark. It\'s able to discern between water and rocks to a depth of about 1,500 feet beneath the surface. \n \n In Yellowstone, a better understanding of the hydrothermal plumbing could help administrators plot out future development so tourists can enjoy the park\'s features without damaging them or being put into harm\'s way. \n \n The study is a collaboration between the U.S.G.S., Yellowstone National Park, the University of Wyoming and Denmark\'s Aarhus University.', 'This week, a survey will begin to map the underground hydrothermal features of Yellowstone National Park for the first time. \n \n The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), in collaboration with the Aarhus University in Denmark and the University of Wyoming, will use a helicopter carrying electromagnetic technology that resembles a giant hula hoop to record tiny voltage signals. \n \n The data will be able to tell the scientists if they are flying over solid earth, “rotten” sulfuric rock, or water.

She's waited a decade to explore what she calls ""a last frontier ... in Yellowstone,"" and the intention is to better map the flow of water that's feeding Old Faithful and rare but sometimes violent hydrothermal explosions.

We know that it can take as long as thousands of years for that process to run its course. What scientists are hoping to determine are the routes these waters take. ""Does it travel down and back up? Does it travel laterally?"" asks Finn. Right now, ""nobody knows."" (Archaeologists made a surprise find underneath a Mayan temple.)"
41,"['Once they sense danger, fruit flies can pitch their bodies like a fighter jet during flight, rolling almost upside down in order to shift momentum and speed to avoid a oncoming threat, new research shows. \n \n “We discovered that fruit flies alter course in less than one one-hundredth of a second, 50 times faster than we blink our eyes, which is faster than we ever imagined.” Michael Dickinson, UW professor of biology and co-author of the paper about these findings, said in a news release. \n \n In his lab, Dickinson and other researchers have found that evasive maneuvers performed by fruit flies, also known as Drosophila hydei, are very similar to those of a fighter jet. His research will be published in the April 11 issue of Science. \n \n Escape Maneuver in a Flying Fly from Michael Dickinson on Vimeo. \n \n More like a plane than a boat \n \n “One of the fastest things a fruit fly does is take information from its eyes and react accordingly,” Dickinson said. \n \n Previous research suggested that flies would turn like a boat would, Dickinson said, but this new research has shown that they can pitch their body and perform banked turns much like a plane would. \n \n “They do this with remarkably subtle changes in wing movement,” Dickinson told us. \n \n Florian Muijres, lead author of the paper and postdoctoral researcher, said that it’s both the speed and accuracy of the flies that they have found impressive. \n \n “What we have found is that these flies are fast and accurate in their response,” Muijres said. \n \n According to Muijres, the flies can roll almost completely upside down while flying thanks to the incredible speed at which they flap their wings. \n \n “These flies normally flap their wings 200 times a second and, in almost a single wing beat, the animal can reorient its body to generate a force away from the threatening stimulus and then continues to accelerate,” Muijres said in the UW release. \n \n The fly’s brain may be small, but it’s very dense with neurons. Muijres said a fly’s brain is actually more dense than a human brain. The mystery of how these little creatures are able to perform such amazing feats is still pushing the researchers at UW forward with their research. \n \n “We have the input and the output and now we are looking at how the input translates into the output,” Muijres said. \n \n Using tech to slow down time \n \n UW researchers used three high speed cameras to accurately capture the flies’ movements in a 20-by-20 centimeter flight arena. They used an expanding shadow effect to make the fly take evasive action, and the cameras recorded the action at 7,500 frames per second. \n \n Escape Maneuver Fly SetupNrobofly from Michael Dickinson on Vimeo. \n \n Because the camera shutters were opening and closing every one thirty-thousandth of a second, they need to light the flight arena so the cameras would be able to get the footage. Dickinson said they used infra-red light in order to light the space for the cameras without blinding the flies in the process. \n \n “When the flies would go through the focus of all three cameras is when we would start recording,” Dickinson said. \n \n Once the measurements and video were recorded, the scientists were able to replicate the fly’s movement on a robot fly model. \n \n “We are able to take the measurements and replay them on the robot and directly measure the forces the wings were generating,” Dickinson said. \n \n Amazing brains \n \n Dickinson said a fruit fly’s brain performs very complicated calculations in a split second, an amazing level of calculation for something so small. \n \n “How can such a small brain generate so many remarkable behaviors? A fly with a brain the size of a salt grain has the behavioral repertoire nearly as complex as a much larger animal such as a mouse. That’s a super interesting problem from an engineering perspective,” Dickinson said in a news release. \n \n Check out some more videos of the fruit fly in action: \n \n Escape Maneuver FlyModel from Michael Dickinson on Vimeo. \n \n Escape Maneuver Fly Topview from Michael Dickinson on Vimeo. \n \n Escape Maneuver in Fly #2 from Michael Dickinson on Vimeo. \n \n Break out your 3D glasses for this one: \n \n Escape Maneuver FlyModel 3D from Michael Dickinson on Vimeo.', 'Fruit flies could make some talented fighter pilots. Scientists who had the insects wing it through two laser beams watched the bugs make hairpin turns at blazing fast speeds, by banking in the same way that fighter jet planes do. The findings, published in the journal Science, shed light on these tiny critters’ remarkable ability to evade predators (and fly swatters). \n \n [Updated at 5:15 p.m. PDT April 10: Tracking how these insects fly in response to a threat should help researchers understand the fruit fly\'s inner life, said Cornell University physicist Jane Wang, who was not involved in the research. \n \n ""The insects turn because they have some internal control circuitry, just like a pilot [who\'s] turning a plane,"" Wang said. ""And by looking how the insects turn, we might be able to say what the \'pilot\' is thinking.""] \n \n When trying to escape from a threat, the Drosophila hydei flies turn at a speed that’s five times faster than their normal turning speed, according to researchers from the University of Washington. Instead of turning right or left on the ""yaw"" axis, like a boat in the water, the flies execute banked turns, by rolling and pitching their bodies at the same time, which supercharges their turns. They can execute one of these within less than one hundredth of a second after seeing a threat, the scientists said. That’s 50 times faster than the blink of an eye. \n \n “A lot of other people working in the field … would not have predicted the fly could rotate itself so quickly,” said study coauthor Michael Dickinson, a neurobiologist at the University of Washington in Seattle. \n \n Dickinson and his colleagues captured 3,566 wing beats involved in 92 separate fruit fly escapes, which was no easy task. To capture such infinitesimally tiny movements, the scientists had to use high-speed cameras that took 7,500 frames per second -- that’s nearly 40 frames for each wing beat. They also needed flood the flight area with light to capture the motions in high detail -- but all that light would blind the flies, which wouldn’t be able to maneuver. \n \n Instead, they had to use infrared light, whose wavelength is too long for human or fly eyes to pick up on. All the circuitry in those lights generated so much heat that the scientists had to run an air conditioner in the laboratory, forcing the researchers to dress warmly in already chilly Seattle weather. \n \n There were, Dickinson said, “a whole lot of wool hats worn in the lab.” \n \n The scientists watched the flies fly through two crossing laser beams, causing their own shadow to loom large like an impending threat. In response, the flies quickly executed their escape maneuvers, which the scientists were able to capture on camera. \n \n The videos showed that the flies could roll to one side by 90 degrees or even more as they made these turns, almost bringing them upside down. And they could make these turns in less than two wing beats -- which is pretty remarkable, given that they typically flap their wings at 200 times per second, the scientists said. \n \n “So it’d kind of be like a jet fighter pilot with a stick in his or her hand, only had to make a little bit of tiny change in the stick and pshooo, the plane goes off,” Dickinson said. “So we’re very interested in how the brain can control motion on such a fine scale.” \n \n With all this high quality data, the scientists were able to pull out mathematical rules that governed the flies’ decisions on how to make a banked turn, and they then programmed them into a robotic fly that they tested in flowing mineral oil. (Because the robot was much bigger than the flies, the scientists had to adjust the viscosity of the fluid they were ""flying"" through so the physics would stay about the same, the scientists said.) \n \n The next step, Dickinson said, is to understand the complex neural circuitry linked to the flight muscles that makes these daring maneuvers possible. \n \n ALSO: \n \n Hallelujah!

British babies came in second, followed by Italy. The most tranquil tots, meanwhile, live in Denmark and Germany. Writing in the Journal of Pediatrics, psychologists at the University of Warwick analyzed 28 previous studies of some 8,700 infants to measure colic—a harmless, if nerve-jangling, condition—by gauging crying times during the first 12 weeks. The longest crying jags were clocked in Canada, reports the Guardian, where 34.1% of babies wailed more than three hours a day, at least three days a week. In the UK, the tally was 28% and in Italy 20.9%. Relatively blissful Danish babes scored 5.5%, with Germany at 6.7%. The first-of-its kind analysis found that babies the world over cry around two hours a day for the first weeks, peaking at two hours and 15 minutes at six weeks. Happily for stressed-out new parents everywhere, crying time is halved by week 12, per a press release. Lead researcher Dieter Wolke says parents in countries with low colic scores are less likely to intervene when baby starts crying, allowing the infant to self-soothe. ""They don’t get all worried about it,"" Wolke tells the Telegraph. Then again, he notes, Danish babies may enjoy a bit of ""genetic bias"" since their country consistently ranks at the top of wellness surveys. In any case, new parents should learn to chill.

Mackenzie Wethington, who went skydiving Saturday as a birthday present from her parents, slammed into the ground, yet somehow only suffered a lacerated liver and kidney, broken bones, and a broken tooth; she's already communicating with her parents in writing and doctors say she's in good condition and should suffer few long-term effects. ""I have no idea how she survived,"" one tells Today. Experts are calling it a miracle; one suspects the teen somehow decreased her air speed and thus landed somewhat more softly—in other words, she was incredibly lucky. The teen was supposed to do a tandem jump with an experienced skydiver, but was told when she arrived that Pegasus Air Sports Center wasn't doing tandem jumps, so her first jump after six hours of training was on her own—and went horribly awry. It's not clear exactly what happened: According to MyFox DFW, the family says Mackenzie's primary parachute didn't open properly (it was supposed to open automatically) and may have gotten tangled, and Mackenzie couldn't open the emergency chute. Mackenzie's dad (who says the main chute only half-opened, according to CNN) blames Pegasus Air Sports Center, claiming it offered inadequate training and didn't properly maintain its equipment. The owner of Pegasus, however, blames Mackenzie and denies any problem with her equipment: ""She didn't do what she was supposed to do,"" he says, though it's not clear what she did wrong; the owner says she didn't take a ""corrective counter action"" to make her parachute ""stop turning."" He claims the chute did open fully but somehow, ""maybe ... initiated by her,"" started a rotation that caused the problem. The family has hired a lawyer, Fox News Insider reports."

45,"['A 1,112-y tree-ring record of moisture shows that in opposition to conventional wisdom, the climate during the rise of the 13 th -century Mongol Empire was a period of persistent moisture, unprecedented in the last 1,000 y. This 15-y episode of persistent moisture likely led to a period of high grassland productivity, contributing fuel to the Mongol Empire. We also present evidence that anthropogenic warming exacerbated the 21st-century drought in central Mongolia. These results indicate that ecosystems and societies in semiarid regions can be significantly affected by unusual climatic events at the decadal time scale. \n \n Abstract \n \n Although many studies have associated the demise of complex societies with deteriorating climate, few have investigated the connection between an ameliorating environment, surplus resources, energy, and the rise of empires. The 13th-century Mongol Empire was the largest contiguous land empire in world history. Although drought has been proposed as one factor that spurred these conquests, no high-resolution moisture data are available during the rapid development of the Mongol Empire. Here we present a 1,112-y tree-ring reconstruction of warm-season water balance derived from Siberian pine (Pinus sibirica) trees in central Mongolia. Our reconstruction accounts for 56% of the variability in the regional water balance and is significantly correlated with steppe productivity across central Mongolia. In combination with a gridded temperature reconstruction, our results indicate that the regional climate during the conquests of Chinggis Khan’s (Genghis Khan’s) 13th-century Mongol Empire was warm and persistently wet. This period, characterized by 15 consecutive years of above-average moisture in central Mongolia and coinciding with the rise of Chinggis Khan, is unprecedented over the last 1,112 y. We propose that these climate conditions promoted high grassland productivity and favored the formation of Mongol political and military power. Tree-ring and meteorological data also suggest that the early 21st-century drought in central Mongolia was the hottest drought in the last 1,112 y, consistent with projections of warming over Inner Asia. Future warming may overwhelm increases in precipitation leading to similar heat droughts, with potentially severe consequences for modern Mongolia.', 'Image copyright National Palace Museum Image caption Genghis Khan was the founder of the Mongol empire, which historians say was the largest contiguous empire in history \n \n The rise of Genghis Khan and the huge Mongol Empire in the early 13th Century may have been helped by good weather, scientists suggest. \n \n American researchers studying the rings of ancient trees in central Mongolia have discovered that his rise coincided with the mildest, wettest weather in more than 1,000 years. \n \n Grass grew at a rapid rate, providing fodder for his war horses. \n \n Genghis Khan united the Mongol tribes to invade and rule a vast area. \n \n It covered modern-day Korea, China, Russia, eastern Europe, India and south-east Asia. \n \n Charismatic leader \n \n The research shows that the years before Genghis Khan\'s rule were characterised by severe drought from 1180 to 1190, the study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences said. \n \n Image caption Present-day Mongolians regard Genghis Khan as the founding father of their country \n \n But as the empire expanded from from 1211 to 1225, Mongolia saw an unusual spell of regular rainfall and mild temperatures. \n \n ""The transition from extreme drought to extreme moisture right then strongly suggests that climate played a role in human events,"" study co-author and West Virginia University tree-ring scientist Amy Hessl told the AFP news agency. \n \n ""It wasn\'t the only thing, but it must have created the ideal conditions for a charismatic leader to emerge out of the chaos, develop an army and concentrate power. \n \n ""Where it\'s arid, unusual moisture creates unusual plant productivity, and that translates into horsepower.

This would probably remain of note only in tree-ring-studying circles if not for one other thing: Those dates happen to coincide with the rise of none other than Genghis Khan, reports the BBC. And the researchers say it's no coincidence. They argue in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that the change in weather from severe drought conditions prior to 1211 to fertile ones afterward directly helped Khan build his empire. Think rain—specifically the lush grasslands it created to fuel to Khan's horse-driven army, along with the livestock his soldiers needed to survive.

46,"['george washington Washington the ‘Blackest’ Name in America \n \n On the eve of George Washington\'s birthday, Associated Press writer Jesse Washington investigates why the founding father\'s surname now belongs predominantly to African-Americans. The 2000 U.S. Census counted 163,036 people with the last name Washington, 90 percent of whom were black — a far higher percentage than any other name. Writes Washington: \n \n \n \n The story of how Washington became the ""blackest name"" begins with slavery and takes a sharp turn after the Civil War, when all blacks were allowed the dignity of a surname. \n \n By choosing the name, he says, Reconstruction-era blacks might have been showing pride in the nation\'s history, as George Washington, who died in 1799, was still hugely popular at the time. Alternately, the name could have been a way to maintain ties to plantation owners who continued to be powerful regional figures after the Civil War. Then again, ""It\'s a myth,"" writes Washington, ""that most enslaved blacks bore the last name of their owner."" \n \n For instance, ""only a handful"" of George Washington\'s slaves had his name. According to Mary Thompson, a historian at Washington\'s Mount Vernon plantation, the president recorded most as having only a first name — and despite the abolitionist writings he left behind, he owned hundreds of slaves. ""Washington was leading this schizoid life,"" says biographer Ron Chernow. ""In theory and on paper he was opposed to slavery, but he was still zealously tracking and seeking to recover his slaves who escaped."" (Martha Washington\'s maid, Oney Judge, ran away while the family was living in Philadelphia. Washington abused his presidential powers by asking the Treasury Department to kidnap Judge from her new life in New Hampshire, says Chernow, but the plot failed.) \n \n In the end, any assumption that the name is tied to George may be a faulty one. ""There is no direct evidence,"" says Tony Burroughs, an expert on black genealogy. ""As far as I\'m concerned it\'s a coincidence."" \n \n But the coincidence is a marked one. According to Jesse Washington, the name is so heavily African-American that many present-day Washingtons are ""surprised to learn"" that white Washingtons exist, having never met one. In 2000, only 5 percent (8,813) of Washingtons in the U.S. were white. (The surname study was not repeated in the 2010 Census.) By comparison, Williams was the sixteenth ""blackest"" name, at 46 percent black, even though the name is much more popular, and there were 716,704 black Williamses overall. \n \n Washington: The \'Blackest Name\' In America [AP via HuffPo]', 'MANILA — The International Criminal Court said on Thursday that it was opening a preliminary investigation into accusations that President Rodrigo Duterte and other Philippine officials had committed crimes against humanity in the course of the government’s deadly crackdown on drugs. \n \n Fatou Bensouda, a prosecutor for the international court, said in a statement that the inquiry would gauge whether there was enough evidence to build a case. She said she would be looking at events since July 1, 2016, “in the context of the ‘war on drugs’ campaign.” \n \n “My office undertakes this work with full independence and impartiality,” Ms. Bensouda said. “As we do, we hope to count on the full engagement of the relevant national authorities in the Philippines.” \n \n Harry Roque, a spokesman for the Philippine president, said that the government’s crackdown was a “legitimate police operation” and that the president welcomed The Hague-based tribunal’s decision.']",2,"– George Washington’s name is synonymous with America—and of the people who bear his surname today, 90% of them are African-American, according to the 2000 census. How did “Washington” become, as Jesse Washington, writing for the AP calls it, the “blackest name"" in America? It could be that blacks chose the name to honor George himself, an odd prospect when you consider that the first US president, while opposed to slavery on paper, owned 124 slaves and worked them hard. But perhaps not so odd when you realize that Washington also freed all 124 of those slaves upon his and his wife’s deaths; of the eight American presidents who owned slaves while in office, he was the only one to do so. Some of his former slaves may have chosen to take his surname as a mark of their community; others may have wanted to maintain a link to a powerful family after being freed. Or the choice could have been random: Booker T. Washington, for example, has never said why he chose his last name 60 years or so after George Washington’s death. Some may even have picked the name to signal their devotion to their new country: ""There was a lot more consciousness and pride in American history among African-Americans and enslaved African-Americans than a lot of people give them credit for,” says one professor and author. But one black genealogy expert, who says 82% to 94% of Washingtons listed in the 1880 to 1930 censuses were black, disagrees. ""As far as I'm concerned it's a coincidence.""

There are only 10 such cases of bipaternal twins reported from across the world so far. — Photo dantri.com.vn \n \n HA NOI (VNS) — A set of twins in the northern Hoa Binh Province were found to have different fathers, following DNA tests done by the Ha Noi-based Centre for Genetic Analysis and Technology. \n \n This is the first case of its kind to be detected in Viet Nam. The two-year-old twins of the same sex look different, as one has thick and wavy hair, while the other has thin and straight hair. \n \n The 34-year-old father, under pressure from a family member, agreed to a DNA test, which proved that he is the father of one infant. \n \n In order to rule out possible mistakes by nurses at the hospital in giving them a baby of another couple, the wife also underwent a DNA test. The result shows that she is the mother of both children. \n \n President of Viet Nam Genetics Association Le Dinh Luong said bipaternal twins were very rare. \n \n There are reportedly about 10 sets of twins with different fathers across the world, including one in Poland, one in Spain, two in the United States and two in India. \n \n He said the phenomenon had a scientific explanation. \n \n Two eggs of the same mother get fertilised by two different fathers, within the same ovulation period. \n \n When we see twins, we assume that both eggs were fertilised during a single act of intercourse. But it\'s quite possible for one egg to be fertilised during one act of intercourse, and the other during another. \n \n It\'s only logical, then, that when a woman has sex with more than one man while she\'s fertile, ""heteropaternal superfecundation"" can occur. That is, each egg can be fertilised by a different father. \n \n However, if the twins don\'t look alike, it should not be assumed that they have different fathers. Like siblings, twins with the same father can look completely different from each other. They may even appear to be of different races. — VNS', 'To be a modern Republican in good standing, you have to believe — or pretend to believe — in two miracle cures for whatever ails the economy: more tax cuts for the rich and more drilling for oil . And with prices at the pump on the rise, so is the chant of “Drill, baby, drill.” More and more, Republicans are telling us that gasoline would be cheap and jobs plentiful if only we would stop protecting the environment and let energy companies do whatever they want. \n \n Thus Mitt Romney claims that gasoline prices are high not because of saber-rattling over Iran , but because President Obama won’t allow unrestricted drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Meanwhile, Stephen Moore of The Wall Street Journal tells readers that America as a whole could have a jobs boom, just like North Dakota , if only the environmentalists would get out of the way. \n \n The irony here is that these claims come just as events are confirming what everyone who did the math already knew, namely, that U.S. energy policy has very little effect either on oil prices or on overall U.S. employment. For the truth is that we’re already having a hydrocarbon boom, with U.S. oil and gas production rising and U.S. fuel imports dropping. If there were any truth to drill-here-drill-now, this boom should have yielded substantially lower gasoline prices and lots of new jobs. Predictably, however, it has done neither. \n \n Why the hydrocarbon boom? It’s all about the fracking. The combination of horizontal drilling with hydraulic fracturing of shale and other low-permeability rocks has opened up large reserves of oil and natural gas to production. As a result, U.S. oil production has risen significantly over the past three years, reversing a decline over decades, while natural gas production has exploded. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Given this expansion, it’s hard to claim that excessive regulation has crippled energy production. Indeed, reporting in The Times makes it clear that U.S. policy has been seriously negligent — that the environmental costs of fracking have been underplayed and ignored. But, in a way, that’s the point.

(Photo: Nicholas Kamm, AFP/Getty Images) \n \n Addressing crises both domestic and foreign, President Obama appealed for calm Thursday amid violent protests in a St. Louis suburb, and said a rescue operation for religious minorities in Iraq will not be necessary. \n \n Obama, speaking from his vacation at Martha\'s Vineyard, Mass., called the weekend death of 18-year-old Michael Brown a tragedy, and urged police and protesters in Ferguson, Mo., to ""take a step back"" and consider how to best move forward. \n \n ""Now\'s the time for healing,"" Obama said. ""Now\'s the time for peace and calm on the streets of Ferguson."" \n \n STORY: Governor vows a \'different tone\' on Ferguson\'s streets \n \n STORY: Michael Brown had no criminal record, police say \n \n The president called on local police to be ""open and transparent"" about their investigation of Brown\'s death. He said there is never an excuse for looting and violence toward police officers, and ""there\'s also no excuse for police to use excessive force against peaceful protests, or to throw protesters in jail for lawfully exercising their First Amendment rights."" \n \n In particular, Obama criticized police for detaining two journalists during protests Wednesday, and for threatening others. Officers ""should not be bullying or arresting journalists who are just trying to do their jobs and report to the American people on what they see on the ground,"" he said. \n \n Police have used tear gas and smoke bombs on crowds who gathered to protest the death of Brown on Saturday; some protesters have thrown Molotov cocktails. \n \n Obama called the teenager\'s death ""heartbreaking and tragic,"" and said the Department of Justice is working with local officials on the investigation. The president said he made it clear to Attorney General Eric Holder that ""we should do what is necessary to help determine exactly what happened and to see that justice is done."" \n \n The president also said he spoke with Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon, calling him ""a good man."" \n \n While ""emotions are raw right now"" and ""there are certainly passionate differences about what has happened,"" Obama asked citizens to remember that all Americans remain united by common values. \n \n ""That includes belief in equality under the law, a basic respect for public order and the right to peaceful public protest,"" Obama said. ""A reverence for the dignity of every single man, woman and child among us and the need for accountability when it comes to our government."" \n \n As for Iraq, Obama said there has been progress with the limited military mission he announced last week. \n \n Earlier in the week, the Obama administration began considering a rescue operation for members of the Yazidi religion who were trapped atop Mount Sinjar in northern Iraq, surrounded by Islamic State fighters. \n \n On Wednesday, a Pentagon assessment team reported that most of the Yazidi have escaped, and a full-scale rescue operation would not be needed. \n \n ""We broke the ISIL siege of Mount Sinjar,"" Obama said. ""We helped vulnerable people reach safety; and we helped save many innocent lives."" \n \n He added, ""I could not be prouder of the men and women of our military who carried out this humanitarian operation almost flawlessly."" \n \n Obama said airstrikes would continue against militants who are threatening U.S. personnel and others in northern Iraq. Humanitarian relief to displaced Iraqis will also continue. \n \n The president praised development of a new government in Iraq, saying it will be better able to eventually take control of the fight against militants. \n \n Said Obama: ""We are modestly hopeful that the Iraqi government situation is moving in the right direction."" \n \n Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/VpCRbA', 'Ty is a 6-year-old brindle and white Bull Terrier (Photo via Frank Romano) \n \n A man is searching for his dog after he went missing Friday night, apparently from a cargo area at LAX. \n \n Frank Romano said he was flying to Tampa out of LAX via Delta Airlines Friday night with his family and his 6-year-old bull terrier, Ty. Ty was in the cargo area in a carrier Romano said he had purchased from PetCo. Romano\'s family boarded the plane, but a Delta employee escorted him off the plane and told him that an hour earlier, Ty had chewed through the door of his pet kennel and escaped. Romano found this odd. \n \n ""I don\'t know how he could\'ve bit through his kennel though when it had a metal door and was made of hard plastic,"" he said. \n \n Romano says the story about what happened to his ""best friend"" gets even more bizarre from there. For one, he doesn\'t understand why the Delta employee didn\'t tell him about Ty\'s escape immediately. Also, he said he was told that the kennel Ty escaped from would appear in baggage claim, but it never did. \n \n Romano said he searched around LAX, but Ty never turned up. The next day, his family flew to Tampa as planned. Romano has called Delta several times, but the situation has only become more confusing. \n \n ""They give us the run around,"" he told LAist. ""Even gave us a number to the cargo place at Tampa airport saying he was there. We called and said they had no dogs."" \n \n If this story sounds odd, you might be disheartened to know that it\'s not uncommon. Delta apparently has a history of losing pets. The airline has allegedly lost so many dogs under their care that someone created a Change.org petition with over 2,000 signatures to demand they take responsibility. \n \n In 2011, a New York man bought a puppy in Alabama, then arranged to have the puppy sent back to New York along with him. Delta temporarily misplaced the dog, then found it in Atlanta. In 2011, a German Shepherd headed from California to Germany to join its owner—a couple in the Army—got loose in Atlanta while under Delta\'s care. That dog was later hit by a car and died. Another unsatisfied Delta customer reported that he and his girlfriend had adopted a stray dog in Mexico in 2010, spent money nursing him to health and then made plans to bring the dog back to their home in Canada with them. Delta allegedly also gave them the run-around as to where the dog was with a similar story about an escape, but couldn\'t seem to produce the dog. \n \n Delta also mixed up two children in 2010—a boy and a girl—sending one to Boston and the other to Cleveland when it was meant to be the other way around. \n \n Romano is still looking for Ty, and still doesn\'t have any concrete answers from Delta. A representative at Delta told LAist that they would look into this and get back to us tomorrow. We\'re hoping we see Ty and Romano reunited soon. \n \n Update, November 7, 12 p.m.: Delta has provided us with the following statement: \n \n Delta continues to investigate what happened, but early indications show that procedures were followed, and the dog may have compromised the kennel on its own. Delta immediately worked with LAX airport teams and the customer to locate the dog but was unsuccessful. We remain in contact with this customer, and we are fully supporting the search for their pet. Delta understands that pets are important members of the family and regrets this occurred while this pet was entrusted to our care.']",2,"– Although it was ""very sad,"" the breakup of Ariana Grande and Pete Davidson at least seemed to be civil.

Rowe, Senior Curator of Mammals, Museum Victoria) Jake Esselstyn, Curator of Mammals for the LSU Museum of Natural Science (courtesy: Kevin C. Rowe, Senior Curator of Mammals, Museum Victoria) \n \n LSU Museum of Natural Science Curator of Mammals Jake Esselstyn and his international collaborators have discovered a new genus and species on a remote, mountainous island in Indonesia. This new discovery is the third new genus described by this group of scientists since 2012, and identifies a rodent with features never seen by the scientific community before. \n \n On the second morning of their field season in 2013, Esselstyn and Museum Victoria Senior Curator of Mammals Kevin Rowe set out in opposite directions from their field camp to check their traps. Unbeknownst to each other, they both caught the same type of animal in their respective traps and immediately knew they were looking at a new species. \n \n “We had never seen anything like this. It was obviously a new species. We came back to camp and were both surprised that the other one had it as well,” Esselstyn said. \n \n The animal is a shrew rat with a large, flat, pink nose and forward-facing nostrils for which they named the Hog-nosed rat, or Hyorhinomys stuempkei. With extremely large ears, long hind legs that may be used for hopping, long white incisors and very long urogenital hairs, the Hog-nosed rat is so genetically different from any other species that the scientists described it as a new genus. This discovery is the cover story of the Journal of Mammalogy this month. \n \n Long incisors are a trait of shrew rats. But the Hog-nosed rat has especially long incisors. Another distinct characteristic of the Hog-nosed rat is that it lacks a jaw muscle attachment point found in most mammals called the coronoid process on the dentary bone. \n \n “I don’t know of any other rodents that have lost the coronoid process completely,” Esselstyn said. \n \n The loss of the coronoid process indicates a weak jaw musculature and a diet that does not require vigorous chewing. The scientists found that the new species eats earthworms and beetle larvae. \n \n Challenging Study Site \n \n The island of Sulawesi in Indonesia is geographically complex, mountainous and challenging to scientifically sample. Little research has been conducted on the island since the early 20th century. \n \n “On Sulawesi, there is a lot of ground to cover and most of it hasn’t been surveyed before, especially at high elevation,” Esselstyn said. \n \n He and his collaborators from Australia and Indonesia have been studying the region since 2010. Inundated by constant rain, the study site for this discovery was a moss-covered habitat on Mt. Dako at about 1,600 meters elevation and a two-day trek from the nearest village. \n \n “There’s a lot of biogeographic complexity at Sulawesi. So we’re not too surprised that we’re finding new things. But our team has been a bit surprised by the degree to which these animals are really novel. They are not just subtly different organisms, but really charismatically different,” Rowe said. \n \n The scientists described the Few-toothed shrew rat, or Paucidentomys vermidax, in 2012. One of the reasons why scientists have thought that rodents have been evolutionarily successful is they have incisors for gnawing and molars for grinding. \n \n “However, this rat we described in 2012, doesn’t have molars and they really can’t gnaw because of the shape of their incisors. Interestingly, this species has lost the two things that we think made rodents successful,” Esselstyn said. \n \n In 2014, the scientists described the Sulawesi water rat, Waiomys mamasae, which was known to villagers and their guides but not to the scientific community. Villagers use this animal as a talisman to protect their homes against fire. \n \n “Our guides didn’t tell us right away that they had caught it. We were asleep and they were up late at night discussing whether they should give it to us or keep it for themselves. We were very glad that they eventually decided to give it to us, because otherwise we would have left and never had known about this animal,” he said. \n \n These animals Esselstyn and his colleagues have described are new species within new genera, because the animals could not be placed within any existing group. After sequencing the DNA from the specimens, the scientists had the molecular evidence to confirm the species’ unique distinctions.', 'As rats go, this one is pretty cute. And until Tuesday, the world was oblivious to its existence. But thanks to the fieldwork of a research team from Australia, Indonesia and America the 250-gram animal has been discovered in the remote, high-altitude jungle of Sulawesi, Indonesia. \n \n Described for the first time in the Journal of Mammalogy, this new species of mammal is so unique that it also represents a new genus. \n \n Museum Victoria mammalogist Kevin Rowe, a member of the team that found the rat in 2013, said among the distinct features were its very small mouth, large white front teeth, big ears and noticeably long pubic hairs. \n \n Dr Kevin Rowe of the Museum Victoria, with a specimen of the newly discovered mammal species, the hog-nosed rat, found in Indonesia. Photo: Eddie Jim \n \n ""It was exciting as I knew immediately that we had a new species,"" Dr Rowe said. ""I am still amazed that we can walk into a forest and find a new species of mammal that is so obviously different from any species, or even genus, that has ever been documented by science."" \n \n Advertisement \n \n While scientists are yet to observe a live hog-nosed rat, the five specimens caught in overnight traps boast long hind limbs similar to a bandicoot, suggesting it might hop, and long pubic hairs not seen in rats but featured on an Australian hopping mammal, the potoroo. \n \n The mouth can hardly open suggesting the carnivorous rat \'slurps\' up its food - most likely earthworms, beetle larvae and other invertebrates. \n \n Meet the newest mammal discovered: the hog-nosed rat from Indonesia. Photo: Museum Victoria \n \n ""It looks like it\'s whistling all the time,"" Dr Rowe said. \n \n While the 40-45 centimetre animal\'s unique anatomy was evidence it was a new species, genetic testing confirmed it was also a new genus. \n \n The hog-nosed rat was found in the cool but humid moss forests of Sulawesi\'s northern peninsula, 1600 metres above sea level. The nearest village is a two-hour hike away and even that village is considered remote. \n \n The pig-like nose with forward-facing nostrils inspired its Greek-in-origin genus name: Hyorhinomys (\'hyo\' meaning hog, \'rhino\' meaning nose and \'mys\' meaning rat). \n \n Named by the discovery team from Museum Victoria, Indonesia\'s Museum Zoologicum Bogoriense and the Louisiana State University Museum of Natural Science, the rat\'s scientific name is Hyorhinomys stuempkei. \n \n Dr Rowe said the rat\'s closest relative was a group of shrew rats found on Sulawesi but that they were not closely related. All rats and mice evolved 25 million years ago, of which there are about 1500 known species. \n \n Geologically isolated, Sulawesi has not been connected to Australia or Asia for 10 million years. The fieldwork is part of a wider project to document and establish the area\'s biodiversity, long considered a hot spot of endemic species.']",2,"– A newly found creature's name is the hog-nosed rat, and things don't get any more picturesque from there. Reporting on their find in the Journal of Mammalogy, scientists describe the animal, found in 2013 on Mount Dako, on Indonesia's Sulawesi Island: It's a long-faced carnivorous creature with ""extremely large ears (~21% of head and body length) [and] very long urogenital hairs""—the latter being pubic hairs. Co-author Kevin Rowe tells Mashable Australia that it's unclear what purpose the hair serves, though ""it probably helps it in some kind of reproductive way. Both males and females have those long ... hairs, like whiskers. They're not like human pubic hairs."" Among its other features: Rowe explains that the 18-inch-long rat's mouth opening is so narrow that it can't open it much. ""It probably eats worms and insect larvae, just kind of slurping them up."" (In line with that slurping, it also lacks the coronoid process on the dentary bone, which other mammals rely on to chew.) KNOE reports it's the third genus newly identified by the international team since 2012 (here's another of the team's finds), and recalls the moment the rat was found—twice. Rowe, of Museum Victoria, and LSU Museum of Natural Science Curator of Mammals Jake Esselstyn went to check their respective traps, saw what was clear to them was a new species, ""came back to camp and were both surprised that the other one had it as well."" The rodent was given the name Hyorhinomys stuempkei, which the Age translates from the Greek as ""'hyo' meaning hog, 'rhino' meaning nose and 'mys' meaning rat.""

53,"['""The Road"" is a road you\'ll wish hadn\'t been taken. Not because anything\'s been badly done, but because there\'s a serious imbalance in the complicated equation between what the film forces us to endure and what we end up receiving in return.Given that it\'s based on Cormac McCarthy\'s somber novel, winner of the Pulitzer Prize for a devastating report from the end of the world witnessed by a man who\'s been there, it\'s no surprise that the film is for the most part profoundly depressing.What is disappointing is that despite numerous strong areas, including fine acting by Viggo Mortensen and young Kodi Smit-McPhee as father-and-son survivors of an unnamed apocalypse, what we\'ve been given is no more than a reasonable facsimile, an honorable attempt at filming an unfilmable book.As adapted by British playwright Joe Penhall and directed by John Hillcoat, best known for the slickly violent ""The Proposition,"" ""The Road"" turns out to be good at shocking and upsetting us, but it lacks the compensating emotional heft that would make absorbing those shocks worth our while.For while Chris Kennedy\'s formidable production design places us in an uncomfortably real space, absent McCarthy\'s haunting language, ""The Road"" for the most part is not so good at transcendence, at making us feel, as the book definitely does, that there is reason for us to endure its pitiless descriptions of what Joseph Conrad described in ""Heart of Darkness"" as ""the horror, the horror.""What Conrad was likely talking about, and what ""The Road"" devotes considerable time to on the screen and on the page, is the terrors that humans inflict on each other. One of the provocative questions this story asks is whether staying alive is worth the savagely inhuman actions necessary to make survival possible.Unwilling to begin on a totally downbeat note, ""The Road"" opens with what turns out to be a dream flashback to a time just before the unspecified catastrophe happens, a time when Mortensen\'s unnamed man is married to Charlize Theron\'s unnamed woman and their first child is on the way.Ten years into the post-apocalypse, the mother is gone, the unborn child is a young boy (Australian actor Smit-McPhee) and the world has changed. It\'s a blasted, blighted, ashen and slowly dying Earth, shaken by quakes, lighted by out-of-control fires and filled with dead cars, empty buildings, deserted bridges and very few people.To stay alive in this world, you have to keep moving, wearing the most utilitarian rags you can find (Margot Wilson did the excellent costume design) and pushing the shopping cart that contains all your possessions. It\'s a vision of a world largely without us that completely chills the soul.The casting of Mortensen and Smit-McPhee is one of the film\'s strengths. With straggly hair and a great wild look, Mortensen is convincing as a harried survivor, and the rapport he has with the more innocent and soulful child played by Smit-McPhee is excellent.""I\'ve never had a better acting partner,"" Mortensen has said, ""someone I knew had my back, and he knew I had his.""One of the great fears of those few survivors is cannibalism, something the strong inflict on the weak, and scenes that hint at that are among ""The Road\'s"" hardest to take.The man\'s greatest fear is that he will die before his son is old enough to protect himself, and the son\'s greatest fear, paradoxically, is that he and his father will somehow lose the essence of their humanity in the drive to stay alive. ""Are we still the good guys?"" he asks his father plaintively. ""Are we carrying the fire?""This pair have their affecting moments, as does Robert Duvall as a kind of barely alive human lump, but absent McCarthy\'s transformative prose, which has a power even images can\'t improve on, what we are left with is more endurance test than anything more elevated.If it is to do more than horrify and depress us, ""The Road"" is in need of a finer sensibility, and that is simply not on offer.', 'The Road \n \n November 24, 2009 \n \n Cast & Credits The Man Viggo Mortensen \n \n The Boy Kodi Smit-McPhee \n \n Wife Charlize Theron \n \n Old Man Robert Duvall \n \n The Veteran Guy Pearce \n \n \n \n Dimension Films presents a film directed by John Hillcoat.

Rated R. \n \n \n \n Printer-friendly » \n \n E-mail this to a friend » \n \n Note: I first saw ""The Road"" in September at the Toronto Film Festival, as one of eight films I saw in three days. I wrote a draft of a review at the time and sent it. That review accidentally found its way into sight in October, long before the film was scheduled to open. I yanked it offline as quickly as I could. \n \n \n \n I saw the movie a second time at a press screening on Oct. 27 in Chicago. I see festival films again whenever I have the chance. I find the second viewing makes the good ones better, and the bad ones worse. Such is the case with ""The Road."" \n \n ""The Road"" evokes the images and the characters of Cormac McCarthy\'s novel. It is powerful, but for me lacks the same core of emotional feeling. I\'m not sure this is any fault of the filmmakers. The novel itself would not be successful if it were limited to its characters and images. Its effect comes above all through McCarthy\'s prose. It is the same with all of McCarthy\'s work, but especially this one, because his dialogue is so restrained, less baroque than usual. \n \n \n \n The story is straightforward: America has been devastated. Habitations have been destroyed or abandoned, vegetation is dying, crops have failed, the infrastructure of civilization has disappeared. This has happened in such recent memory that even The Boy, so young, was born into a healthy world. No reason is given for this destruction, perhaps because no reason would be adequate. McCarthy evokes the general apprehension of post-9/11. The Boy and The Man make their way toward the sea, perhaps for no better reason than that sea has always been the direction of hope in this country. \n \n \n \n The surviving population has been reduced to savage survivalists, making slaves of the weaker, possibly using them as food. We\'ve always done that, employing beef cattle, for example, to do the grazing on acres of pasture so we can consume the concentrated calories of their labor. In a land where food is scarce, wanderers seek out canned goods and fear their own bodies will perform this work for the cannibals. \n \n \n \n Although we read of those who stockpile guns and ammunition for an apocalypse, weapon stores on the Road have dwindled down. The Man has a gun with two remaining bullets. He is a wary traveler, suspecting everyone he sees. He and The Boy are transporting a few possessions in a grocery cart. He encourages his son to keep walking, but holds out little hope for the end of their journey. \n \n \n \n I am not sure the characters could be played better, or differently. Viggo Mortensen portrays The Man as dogged and stubborn, determined to protect his boy. Kodi Smit-McPhee is convincing as a child stunned by destruction, depending on his father in a world where it must be clear to him that any man can die in an instant. The movie resists any tendency toward making the child cute, or the two of them heartwarming. \n \n \n \n Flashback scenes star Charlize Theron as the wife and mother of the two in earlier, sunnier days. These sequences show the marriage as failing, and these memories haunt The Man. I\'m not sure what relevance this subplot has to the film as a whole; a marriage happy or sad -- isn\'t it much the same in this new world? It has a lot of relevance, however, to The Man and The Boy. In times of utter devastation, memories are what we cling to. \n \n \n \n The external events of the novel have been boldly solved, and this is an awesome production. But McCarthy\'s prose has the uncanny ability to convey more than dialogue and incident. It\'s as dense as poetry. It is more spare in The Road than in a more ornate work like Suttree; in The Road, it is as evocative in the way Samuel Beckett is. If it were not, ""The Road"" might be just another film of sci-fi apocalypse. It\'s all too easy to imagine how this material could be vulgarized, as Richard Matheson\'s novel was in the 2007 version of ""I Am Legend."" \n \n \n \n How could the director and writer, John Hillcoat and Joe Penhall, have summoned the strength of McCarthy\'s writing? Could they have used more stylized visuals, instead of relentless realism? A grainy black-and-white look to suggest severely limited resources? I have no idea. Perhaps McCarthy, like Faulkner, is all but unfilmable. \n \n \n \n The one great film of his work is the Coens\' ""No Country for Old Men,"" but it began with an extraordinary character and surrounded him with others. The Road is not fertile soil, providing a world with life draining from it. McCarthy\'s greatest novels are Suttree and Blood Meridian. The second, set in the Old West, is about a fearsome, bald, skeletal man named Judge Holden, who is implacable in his desire to inflict suffering and death. (""Blood Meridian"" is being prepared by Todd Field, director of ""In the Bedroom."") \n \n \n \n Hillcoat\'s earlier film, ""The Proposition"" (2005), written by Nick Cave, seems almost McCarthy-like. Something in McCarthy\'s work draws Hillcoat to it, and you must be a brave director to let that happen. Writing this, I realize few audience members can be expected to have read The Road, even though it was a selection of Oprah\'s Book Club. Fewer still will have read McCarthy\'s other works. \n \n \n \n I\'ve been saying for years that a film critic must review the film before him, and not how ""faithful"" the film is to the book -- as if we\'re married to the book, and somehow screen adaptation is adultery. I realize my own fault is in being so very familiar with Cormac McCarthy. That may affect my ability to view any film adaptation of his work afresh. When I know a novel is bring filmed, I make it a point to not read the book. Yet I am grateful for having read McCarthy\'s.', 'In “The Road,’’ the world has ended with a bang and a whimper. Author Cormac McCarthy’s lean prose has been lifted off the printed page and laid carefully into the soundtrack like antique china in a packing crate. “The clocks stopped at 1:17,’’ says the narrator. “A long shear of light and then a series of low concussions.’’ That’s all we know about the apocalypse and all we need to know. \n \n The movie takes place in an America that has been turned into an ash heap, with skeletal human survivors picking their way across the cinders. Kept rigorously in the foreground are a Man (Viggo Mortensen) and a Boy (Kodi Smit-McPhee), the latter born shortly after the end came and thus a creature exclusively of this fallen world. \n \n The two are traveling from the interior to the coast before winter comes - that’s the action of the movie. That, and keeping clear of marauding bands of men who would gladly skin them and eat them. Also, as the boy reminds his father, the two “carry the fire,’’ whatever that means. It could refer to decency and goodness, the guttering spark of humanity. It could just mean they’re still alive. \n \n “The Road’’ has been poured straight from McCarthy’s bleak bottle and brought to the screen by Australian John Hillcoat, who turned the 2005 Outback Western “The Proposition’’ into an epic of blasted landscapes and bloody motivations. He’s the man for the job, yet in adapting this harsh, unyielding book for the screen, Hillcoat and screenwriter Joe Penhall pull their punches the slightest degree and thus too much. \n \n Or maybe movies can only dully visualize horrors the best writers hint at. Hillcoat’s “Road’’ is true to the book’s profoundly moving post-nuclear stoicism, but it can’t quite get those biblical cadences that make McCarthy such a transfixing read. The Coens managed it with “No Country for Old Men,’’ so it can be done, but you have to be willing to go all the way into the dark. As a colleague said after seeing this movie, you need to show the baby on the spit. “The Road’’ doesn’t dare, can’t dare, and is the lesser thing. \n \n What’s on the screen is disturbing enough. (Even at that, it has taken a year for the Weinsteins, the producers and distributors of “The Road,’’ to get the nerve to release the film.) As the Man and the Boy drag their shopping cart across what’s left of America, the enormity of the cataclysm is glimpsed forward and backward. A wife (Charlize Theron) who may have been the braver for opting out. An impossibly old man (Robert Duvall) like a figure out of “Godot,’’ unable to go on but still going on. A trap door in a kitchen that leads to something you’d better not think about. \n \n There are other basements and further revelations in “The Road,’’ but Hillcoat avoids jack-in-the-box suspense clichés; the movie plods with a literalism that’s at times too reverent (as is Nick Cave’s score, piling on a sensitive “mournfulness’’ both redundant and unnecessary). Mortensen underplays his role admirably, and Smit-McPhee is gratifyingly unactorly. At the movie’s best we see their relationship shift as something crucial and inarticulate is passed from one generation to the next. \n \n Like all end-of-the-world fiction, “The Road’’ brings iconic meaning to the smallest of gestures. A single kindness becomes the hope of humanity; a cruel act the path to hell. If I have mixed feelings about the movie, it’s because Hillcoat honors the story’s minimalism without bringing his own sensibilities to bear on the material. He’s spooked by the responsibility, and maybe he’s right: When the director does add a single furry detail to the final scenes, it feels like a surrender to sentiment. \n \n At the same time, everything about the film is a welcome rebuke to the happy-face apocalypse of “2012,’’ a movie that turns mass extinction into the Greatest Show on Earth. In “The Road,’’ what has been lost is recognized as infinitely precious; what’s left is bitter and our due. \n \n Ty Burr can be reached at tburr@globe.com.

Critics have mixed feelings about the bleak post-apocalyptic film. Here’s what they’re saying: Despite good acting, the film is merely adequate, “an honorable attempt at filming an unfilmable book,” writes Kenneth Turan of the LA Times. “To do more than horrify and depress us, The Road is in need of a finer sensibility.” A devoted Cormac McCarthy fan, Roger Ebert wrestles with his review. “It is powerful, but for me lacks the same core of emotional feeling,” he writes. “I'm not sure this is any fault of the filmmakers.” The movie can only “dully visualize horrors the best writers hint at,” says Ty Burr of the Boston Globe. Still, it’s a “welcome rebuke to the happy-face apocalypse of 2012.” “The Road isn't a masterpiece,” writes Steven Rea in the Philadelphia Inquirer. But it stuck with him, “its images of dread and fear kicking around like such a terrible dream.”"

58,"['Tech-savvy rightwingers have been able to ‘game’ the algorithms of internet giants and create a new reality where Hitler is a good guy, Jews are evil and… Donald Trump becomes president \n \n Here’s what you don’t want to do late on a Sunday night. You do not want to type seven letters into Google. That’s all I did. I typed: “a-r-e”. And then “j-e-w-s”. Since 2008, Google has attempted to predict what question you might be asking and offers you a choice. And this is what it did. It offered me a choice of potential questions it thought I might want to ask: “are jews a race?”, “are jews white?”, “are jews christians?”, and finally, “are jews evil?” \n \n Are Jews evil? It’s not a question I’ve ever thought of asking. I hadn’t gone looking for it. But there it was. I press enter. A page of results appears. This was Google’s question. And this was Google’s answer: Jews are evil. Because there, on my screen, was the proof: an entire page of results, nine out of 10 of which “confirm” this. The top result, from a site called Listovative, has the headline: “Top 10 Major Reasons Why People Hate Jews.” I click on it: “Jews today have taken over marketing, militia, medicinal, technological, media, industrial, cinema challenges etc and continue to face the worlds [sic] envy through unexplained success stories given their inglorious past and vermin like repression all over Europe.” \n \n Google is search. It’s the verb, to Google. It’s what we all do, all the time, whenever we want to know anything. We Google it. The site handles at least 63,000 searches a second, 5.5bn a day. Its mission as a company, the one-line overview that has informed the company since its foundation and is still the banner headline on its corporate website today, is to “organise the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful”. It strives to give you the best, most relevant results. And in this instance the third-best, most relevant result to the search query “are Jews… ” is a link to an article from stormfront.org, a neo-Nazi website. The fifth is a YouTube video: “Why the Jews are Evil. Why we are against them.” \n \n The sixth is from Yahoo Answers: “Why are Jews so evil?” The seventh result is: “Jews are demonic souls from a different world.” And the 10th is from jesus-is-saviour.com: “Judaism is Satanic!” \n \n There’s one result in the 10 that offers a different point of view. It’s a link to a rather dense, scholarly book review from thetabletmag.com, a Jewish magazine, with the unfortunately misleading headline: “Why Literally Everybody In the World Hates Jews.” \n \n I feel like I’ve fallen down a wormhole, entered some parallel universe where black is white, and good is bad. Though later, I think that perhaps what I’ve actually done is scraped the topsoil off the surface of 2016 and found one of the underground springs that has been quietly nurturing it. It’s been there all the time, of course. Just a few keystrokes away… on our laptops, our tablets, our phones. This isn’t a secret Nazi cell lurking in the shadows. It’s hiding in plain sight. \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest Are women… Google’s search results. \n \n Stories about fake news on Facebook have dominated certain sections of the press for weeks following the American presidential election, but arguably this is even more powerful, more insidious. Frank Pasquale, professor of law at the University of Maryland, and one of the leading academic figures calling for tech companies to be more open and transparent, calls the results “very profound, very troubling”. \n \n He came across a similar instance in 2006 when, “If you typed ‘Jew’ in Google, the first result was jewwatch.org. It was ‘look out for these awful Jews who are ruining your life’. And the Anti-Defamation League went after them and so they put an asterisk next to it which said: ‘These search results may be disturbing but this is an automated process.’ But what you’re showing – and I’m very glad you are documenting it and screenshotting it – is that despite the fact they have vastly researched this problem, it has gotten vastly worse.” \n \n And ordering of search results does influence people, says Martin Moore, director of the Centre for the Study of Media, Communication and Power at King’s College, London, who has written at length on the impact of the big tech companies on our civic and political spheres. “There’s large-scale, statistically significant research into the impact of search results on political views. And the way in which you see the results and the types of results you see on the page necessarily has an impact on your perspective.” Fake news, he says, has simply “revealed a much bigger problem. These companies are so powerful and so committed to disruption. They thought they were disrupting politics but in a positive way. They hadn’t thought about the downsides. These tools offer remarkable empowerment, but there’s a dark side to it. It enables people to do very cynical, damaging things.” \n \n Google is knowledge. It’s where you go to find things out. And evil Jews are just the start of it. There are also evil women. I didn’t go looking for them either. This is what I type: “a-r-e w-o-m-e-n”. And Google offers me just two choices, the first of which is: “Are women evil?” I press return. Yes, they are. Every one of the 10 results “confirms” that they are, including the top one, from a site called sheddingoftheego.com, which is boxed out and highlighted: “Every woman has some degree of prostitute in her. Every woman has a little evil in her… Women don’t love men, they love what they can do for them. It is within reason to say women feel attraction but they cannot love men.” \n \n Next I type: “a-r-e m-u-s-l-i-m-s”. And Google suggests I should ask: “Are Muslims bad?” And here’s what I find out: yes, they are. That’s what the top result says and six of the others. Without typing anything else, simply putting the cursor in the search box, Google offers me two new searches and I go for the first, “Islam is bad for society”. In the next list of suggestions, I’m offered: “Islam must be destroyed.” \n \n This is the equivalent of going into a library and asking a librarian about Judaism and being handed 10 books of hate Danny Sullivan \n \n Jews are evil. Muslims need to be eradicated. And Hitler? Do you want to know about Hitler? Let’s Google it. “Was Hitler bad?” I type. And here’s Google’s top result: “10 Reasons Why Hitler Was One Of The Good Guys” I click on the link: “He never wanted to kill any Jews”; “he cared about conditions for Jews in the work camps”; “he implemented social and cultural reform.” Eight out of the other 10 search results agree: Hitler really wasn’t that bad. \n \n A few days later, I talk to Danny Sullivan, the founding editor of SearchEngineLand.com. He’s been recommended to me by several academics as one of the most knowledgeable experts on search. Am I just being naive, I ask him? Should I have known this was out there? “No, you’re not being naive,” he says. “This is awful. It’s horrible. It’s the equivalent of going into a library and asking a librarian about Judaism and being handed 10 books of hate. Google is doing a horrible, horrible job of delivering answers here. It can and should do better.” \n \n He’s surprised too. “I thought they stopped offering autocomplete suggestions for religions in 2011.” And then he types “are women” into his own computer. “Good lord! That answer at the top. It’s a featured result. It’s called a “direct answer”. This is supposed to be indisputable. It’s Google’s highest endorsement.” That every women has some degree of prostitute in her? “Yes. This is Google’s algorithm going terribly wrong.” \n \n I contacted Google about its seemingly malfunctioning autocomplete suggestions and received the following response: “Our search results are a reflection of the content across the web. This means that sometimes unpleasant portrayals of sensitive subject matter online can affect what search results appear for a given query. These results don’t reflect Google’s own opinions or beliefs – as a company, we strongly value a diversity of perspectives, ideas and cultures.” \n \n Google isn’t just a search engine, of course. Search was the foundation of the company but that was just the beginning. Alphabet, Google’s parent company, now has the greatest concentration of artificial intelligence experts in the world. It is expanding into healthcare, transportation, energy. It’s able to attract the world’s top computer scientists, physicists and engineers. It’s bought hundreds of start-ups, including Calico, whose stated mission is to “cure death” and DeepMind, which aims to “solve intelligence”. \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin in 2002. Photograph: Michael Grecco/Getty Images \n \n And 20 years ago it didn’t even exist. When Tony Blair became prime minister, it wasn’t possible to Google him: the search engine had yet to be invented. The company was only founded in 1998 and Facebook didn’t appear until 2004. Google’s founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page are still only 43. Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook is 32. Everything they’ve done, the world they’ve remade, has been done in the blink of an eye. \n \n But it seems the implications about the power and reach of these companies is only now seeping into the public consciousness. I ask Rebecca MacKinnon, director of the Ranking Digital Rights project at the New America Foundation, whether it was the recent furore over fake news that woke people up to the danger of ceding our rights as citizens to corporations. “It’s kind of weird right now,” she says, “because people are finally saying, ‘Gee, Facebook and Google really have a lot of power’ like it’s this big revelation. And it’s like, ‘D’oh.’” \n \n MacKinnon has a particular expertise in how authoritarian governments adapt to the internet and bend it to their purposes. “China and Russia are a cautionary tale for us. I think what happens is that it goes back and forth. So during the Arab spring, it seemed like the good guys were further ahead. And now it seems like the bad guys are. Pro-democracy activists are using the internet more than ever but at the same time, the adversary has gotten so much more skilled.” \n \n Last week Jonathan Albright, an assistant professor of communications at Elon University in North Carolina, published the first detailed research on how rightwing websites had spread their message. “I took a list of these fake news sites that was circulating, I had an initial list of 306 of them and I used a tool – like the one Google uses – to scrape them for links and then I mapped them. So I looked at where the links went – into YouTube and Facebook, and between each other, millions of them… and I just couldn’t believe what I was seeing. \n \n “They have created a web that is bleeding through on to our web. This isn’t a conspiracy. There isn’t one person who’s created this. It’s a vast system of hundreds of different sites that are using all the same tricks that all websites use. They’re sending out thousands of links to other sites and together this has created a vast satellite system of rightwing news and propaganda that has completely surrounded the mainstream media system.” \n \n He found 23,000 pages and 1.3m hyperlinks. “And Facebook is just the amplification device. When you look at it in 3D, it actually looks like a virus. And Facebook was just one of the hosts for the virus that helps it spread faster. You can see the New York Times in there and the Washington Post and then you can see how there’s a vast, vast network surrounding them. The best way of describing it is as an ecosystem. This really goes way beyond individual sites or individual stories. What this map shows is the distribution network and you can see that it’s surrounding and actually choking the mainstream news ecosystem.” \n \n Like a cancer? “Like an organism that is growing and getting stronger all the time.” \n \n Charlie Beckett, a professor in the school of media and communications at LSE, tells me: “We’ve been arguing for some time now that plurality of news media is good. Diversity is good. Critiquing the mainstream media is good. But now… it’s gone wildly out of control. What Jonathan Albright’s research has shown is that this isn’t a byproduct of the internet. And it’s not even being done for commercial reasons. It’s motivated by ideology, by people who are quite deliberately trying to destabilise the internet.” \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest A spatial map of the rightwing fake news ecosystem. Jonathan Albright, assistant professor of communications at Elon University, North Carolina, “scraped” 300 fake news sites (the dark shapes on this map) to reveal the 1.3m hyperlinks that connect them together and link them into the mainstream news ecosystem. Here, Albright shows it is a “vast satellite system of rightwing news and propaganda that has completely surrounded the mainstream media system”. Photograph: Jonathan Albright \n \n Albright’s map also provides a clue to understanding the Google search results I found. What these rightwing news sites have done, he explains, is what most commercial websites try to do. They try to find the tricks that will move them up Google’s PageRank system. They try and “game” the algorithm. And what his map shows is how well they’re doing that. \n \n That’s what my searches are showing too. That the right has colonised the digital space around these subjects – Muslims, women, Jews, the Holocaust, black people – far more effectively than the liberal left. \n \n “It’s an information war,” says Albright. “That’s what I keep coming back to.” \n \n But it’s where it goes from here that’s truly frightening. I ask him how it can be stopped. “I don’t know. I’m not sure it can be. It’s a network. It’s far more powerful than any one actor.” \n \n So, it’s almost got a life of its own? “Yes, and it’s learning. Every day, it’s getting stronger.” \n \n The more people who search for information about Jews, the more people will see links to hate sites, and the more they click on those links (very few people click on to the second page of results) the more traffic the sites will get, the more links they will accrue and the more authoritative they will appear. This is an entirely circular knowledge economy that has only one outcome: an amplification of the message. Jews are evil. Women are evil. Islam must be destroyed. Hitler was one of the good guys. \n \n Fake news and a 400-year-old problem: we need to resolve the ‘post-truth’ crisis Read more \n \n And the constellation of websites that Albright found – a sort of shadow internet – has another function. More than just spreading rightwing ideology, they are being used to track and monitor and influence anyone who comes across their content. “I scraped the trackers on these sites and I was absolutely dumbfounded. Every time someone likes one of these posts on Facebook or visits one of these websites, the scripts are then following you around the web. And this enables data-mining and influencing companies like Cambridge Analytica to precisely target individuals, to follow them around the web, and to send them highly personalised political messages. This is a propaganda machine. It’s targeting people individually to recruit them to an idea. It’s a level of social engineering that I’ve never seen before. They’re capturing people and then keeping them on an emotional leash and never letting them go.” \n \n Cambridge Analytica, an American-owned company based in London, was employed by both the Vote Leave campaign and the Trump campaign. Dominic Cummings, the campaign director of Vote Leave, has made few public announcements since the Brexit referendum but he did say this: “If you want to make big improvements in communication, my advice is – hire physicists.” \n \n Steve Bannon, founder of Breitbart News and the newly appointed chief strategist to Trump, is on Cambridge Analytica’s board and it has emerged that the company is in talks to undertake political messaging work for the Trump administration. It claims to have built psychological profiles using 5,000 separate pieces of data on 220 million American voters. It knows their quirks and nuances and daily habits and can target them individually. \n \n “They were using 40-50,000 different variants of ad every day that were continuously measuring responses and then adapting and evolving based on that response,” says Martin Moore of Kings College. Because they have so much data on individuals and they use such phenomenally powerful distribution networks, they allow campaigns to bypass a lot of existing laws. \n \n “It’s all done completely opaquely and they can spend as much money as they like on particular locations because you can focus on a five-mile radius or even a single demographic. Fake news is important but it’s only one part of it. These companies have found a way of transgressing 150 years of legislation that we’ve developed to make elections fair and open.” \n \n Did such micro-targeted propaganda – currently legal – swing the Brexit vote? We have no way of knowing. Did the same methods used by Cambridge Analytica help Trump to victory? Again, we have no way of knowing. This is all happening in complete darkness. We have no way of knowing how our personal data is being mined and used to influence us. We don’t realise that the Facebook page we are looking at, the Google page, the ads that we are seeing, the search results we are using, are all being personalised to us. We don’t see it because we have nothing to compare it to. And it is not being monitored or recorded. It is not being regulated. We are inside a machine and we simply have no way of seeing the controls. Most of the time, we don’t even realise that there are controls. \n \n Facebook and Google move to kick fake news sites off their ad networks Read more \n \n Rebecca MacKinnon says that most of us consider the internet to be like “the air that we breathe and the water that we drink”. It surrounds us. We use it. And we don’t question it. “But this is not a natural landscape. Programmers and executives and editors and designers, they make this landscape. They are human beings and they all make choices.” \n \n But we don’t know what choices they are making. Neither Google or Facebook make their algorithms public. Why did my Google search return nine out of 10 search results that claim Jews are evil? We don’t know and we have no way of knowing. Their systems are what Frank Pasquale describes as “black boxes”. He calls Google and Facebook “a terrifying duopoly of power” and has been leading a growing movement of academics who are calling for “algorithmic accountability”. “We need to have regular audits of these systems,” he says. “We need people in these companies to be accountable. In the US, under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, every company has to have a spokesman you can reach. And this is what needs to happen. They need to respond to complaints about hate speech, about bias.” \n \n Is bias built into the system? Does it affect the kind of results that I was seeing? “There’s all sorts of bias about what counts as a legitimate source of information and how that’s weighted. There’s enormous commercial bias. And when you look at the personnel, they are young, white and perhaps Asian, but not black or Hispanic and they are overwhelmingly men. The worldview of young wealthy white men informs all these judgments.” \n \n Later, I speak to Robert Epstein, a research psychologist at the American Institute for Behavioural Research and Technology, and the author of the study that Martin Moore told me about (and that Google has publicly criticised), showing how search-rank results affect voting patterns. On the other end of the phone, he repeats one of the searches I did. He types “do blacks…” into Google. \n \n “Look at that. I haven’t even hit a button and it’s automatically populated the page with answers to the query: ‘Do blacks commit more crimes?’ And look, I could have been going to ask all sorts of questions. ‘Do blacks excel at sports’, or anything. And it’s only given me two choices and these aren’t simply search-based or the most searched terms right now. Google used to use that but now they use an algorithm that looks at other things. Now, let me look at Bing and Yahoo. I’m on Yahoo and I have 10 suggestions, not one of which is ‘Do black people commit more crime?’ \n \n “And people don’t question this. Google isn’t just offering a suggestion. This is a negative suggestion and we know that negative suggestions depending on lots of things can draw between five and 15 more clicks. And this all programmed. And it could be programmed differently.” \n \n What Epstein’s work has shown is that the contents of a page of search results can influence people’s views and opinions. The type and order of search rankings was shown to influence voters in India in double-blind trials. There were similar results relating to the search suggestions you are offered. \n \n “The general public are completely in the dark about very fundamental issues regarding online search and influence. We are talking about the most powerful mind-control machine ever invented in the history of the human race. And people don’t even notice it.” \n \n Good luck in making Google reveal its algorithm | John Naughton Read more \n \n Damien Tambini, an associate professor at the London School of Economics, who focuses on media regulation, says that we lack any sort of framework to deal with the potential impact of these companies on the democratic process. “We have structures that deal with powerful media corporations. We have competition laws. But these companies are not being held responsible. There are no powers to get Google or Facebook to disclose anything. There’s an editorial function to Google and Facebook but it’s being done by sophisticated algorithms. They say it’s machines not editors. But that’s simply a mechanised editorial function.” \n \n And the companies, says John Naughton, the Observer columnist and a senior research fellow at Cambridge University, are terrified of acquiring editorial responsibilities they don’t want. “Though they can and regularly do tweak the results in all sorts of ways.” \n \n Certainly the results about Google on Google don’t seem entirely neutral. Google “Is Google racist?” and the featured result – the Google answer boxed out at the top of the page – is quite clear: no. It is not. \n \n Google and Facebook are thinking long term. They have the resources, money and ambition to do whatever they want John Naughton \n \n But the enormity and complexity of having two global companies of a kind we have never seen before influencing so many areas of our lives is such, says Naughton, that “we don’t even have the mental apparatus to even know what the problems are”. \n \n And this is especially true of the future. Google and Facebook are at the forefront of AI. They are going to own the future. And the rest of us can barely start to frame the sorts of questions we ought to be asking. “Politicians don’t think long term. And corporations don’t think long term because they’re focused on the next quarterly results and that’s what makes Google and Facebook interesting and different. They are absolutely thinking long term. They have the resources, the money, and the ambition to do whatever they want. \n \n “They want to digitise every book in the world: they do it. They want to build a self-driving car: they do it. The fact that people are reading about these fake news stories and realising that this could have an effect on politics and elections, it’s like, ‘Which planet have you been living on?’ For Christ’s sake, this is obvious.” \n \n “The internet is among the few things that humans have built that they don’t understand.” It is “the largest experiment involving anarchy in history. Hundreds of millions of people are, each minute, creating and consuming an untold amount of digital content in an online world that is not truly bound by terrestrial laws.” The internet as a lawless anarchic state? A massive human experiment with no checks and balances and untold potential consequences? What kind of digital doom-mongerer would say such a thing? Step forward, Eric Schmidt – Google’s chairman. They are the first lines of the book, The New Digital Age, that he wrote with Jared Cohen. \n \n We don’t understand it. It is not bound by terrestrial laws. And it’s in the hands of two massive, all-powerful corporations. It’s their experiment, not ours. The technology that was supposed to set us free may well have helped Trump to power, or covertly helped swing votes for Brexit. It has created a vast network of propaganda that has encroached like a cancer across the entire internet. This is a technology that has enabled the likes of Cambridge Analytica to create political messages uniquely tailored to you. They understand your emotional responses and how to trigger them. They know your likes, dislikes, where you live, what you eat, what makes you laugh, what makes you cry. \n \n And what next? Rebecca MacKinnon’s research has shown how authoritarian regimes reshape the internet for their own purposes. Is that what’s going to happen with Silicon Valley and Trump? As Martin Moore points out, the president-elect claimed that Apple chief executive Tim Cook called to congratulate him soon after his election victory. “And there will undoubtedly be be pressure on them to collaborate,” says Moore. \n \n Journalism is failing in the face of such change and is only going to fail further. New platforms have put a bomb under the financial model – advertising – resources are shrinking, traffic is increasingly dependent on them, and publishers have no access, no insight at all, into what these platforms are doing in their headquarters, their labs. And now they are moving beyond the digital world into the physical. The next frontiers are healthcare, transportation, energy. And just as Google is a near-monopoly for search, its ambition to own and control the physical infrastructure of our lives is what’s coming next. It already owns our data and with it our identity. What will it mean when it moves into all the other areas of our lives? \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg: still only 32 years of age. Photograph: Mariana Bazo/Reuters \n \n “At the moment, there’s a distance when you Google ‘Jews are’ and get ‘Jews are evil’,” says Julia Powles, a researcher at Cambridge on technology and law. “But when you move into the physical realm, and these concepts become part of the tools being deployed when you navigate around your city or influence how people are employed, I think that has really pernicious consequences.” \n \n Powles is shortly to publish a paper looking at DeepMind’s relationship with the NHS. “A year ago, 2 million Londoners’ NHS health records were handed over to DeepMind. And there was complete silence from politicians, from regulators, from anyone in a position of power. This is a company without any healthcare experience being given unprecedented access into the NHS and it took seven months to even know that they had the data. And that took investigative journalism to find it out.” \n \n The headline was that DeepMind was going to work with the NHS to develop an app that would provide early warning for sufferers of kidney disease. And it is, but DeepMind’s ambitions – “to solve intelligence” – goes way beyond that. The entire history of 2 million NHS patients is, for artificial intelligence researchers, a treasure trove. And, their entry into the NHS – providing useful services in exchange for our personal data – is another massive step in their power and influence in every part of our lives. \n \n Because the stage beyond search is prediction. Google wants to know what you want before you know yourself. “That’s the next stage,” says Martin Moore. “We talk about the omniscience of these tech giants, but that omniscience takes a huge step forward again if they are able to predict. And that’s where they want to go. To predict diseases in health. It’s really, really problematic.” \n \n For the nearly 20 years that Google has been in existence, our view of the company has been inflected by the youth and liberal outlook of its founders. Ditto Facebook, whose mission, Zuckberg said, was not to be “a company. It was built to accomplish a social mission to make the world more open and connected.” \n \n The more we argue with them, the more they know about us. It all feeds into a circular system Jonathan Albright \n \n It would be interesting to know how he thinks that’s working out. Donald Trump is connecting through exactly the same technology platforms that supposedly helped fuel the Arab spring; connecting to racists and xenophobes. And Facebook and Google are amplifying and spreading that message. And us too – the mainstream media. Our outrage is just another node on Jonathan Albright’s data map. \n \n “The more we argue with them, the more they know about us,” he says. “It all feeds into a circular system. What we’re seeing here is new era of network propaganda.” \n \n We are all points on that map. And our complicity, our credulity, being consumers not concerned citizens, is an essential part of that process. And what happens next is down to us. “I would say that everybody has been really naive and we need to reset ourselves to a much more cynical place and proceed on that basis,” is Rebecca MacKinnon’s advice. “There is no doubt that where we are now is a very bad place. But it’s we as a society who have jointly created this problem. And if we want to get to a better place, when it comes to having an information ecosystem that serves human rights and democracy instead of destroying it, we have to share responsibility for that.” \n \n Are Jews evil? How do you want that question answered? This is our internet. Not Google’s. Not Facebook’s. Not rightwing propagandists. And we’re the only ones who can reclaim it.']",1,"– Robert De Niro is set to play NFL coach Vince Lombardi, but—in more casting news from a different film—the role of Captain America is still up for grabs.

Miranda July, the twee mind behind the film “You And Me And Everyone We Know,” has confessed in this week’s issue of The New Yorker to a sordid history of shoplifting. Her first time stealing was during her freshman year of college when she nabbed a package of Neosporin. The minute a guard apprehended her, she wet her pants. And if you think that an incident of public peeing might have put the woman off from shoplifting, you would be wrong again! July continued to shoplift at the grocery store and even at Goodwill. (Yes, this woman stole from charity. Oof.) If you ever go to one of Miranda July’s book signings, watch your purse. [New Yorker] \n \n Alas, Miranda July isn’t the only celeb with sticky fingers. Here are 10 more female celebs who have (allegedly) given themselves a five finger discount.', 'Photo: Courtesy of the Santa Clara County Sheriff \n \n While Brock Turner, the ex-Stanford student who sexually assaulted an unconscious woman behind a dumpster last year, has formally been sentenced on three counts of felony sexual assault, he is not being described as a convicted rapist in the media. Many people have been asking why. Here’s your answer. Warning: It’s pretty unsatisfying. \n \n In California, rape is defined as someone using “physical force, intimidation, duress, or threats to persuade the victim to engage in sexual intercourse.” In the case of Turner’s rape of an unconscious woman, witnesses and testimony determined that Turner penetrated his victim with a foreign object, not a sexual organ. His victim, who read powerful testimony in court directly addressing Turner, explained what she learned after the attack: \n \n Never mentioned me voicing consent, never mentioned us even speaking, a back rub. One more time, in public news, I learned that my ass and vagina were completely exposed outside, my breasts had been groped, fingers had been jabbed inside me along with pine needles and debris, my bare skin and head had been rubbing against the ground behind a dumpster, while an erect freshman was humping my half naked, unconscious body. But I don’t remember, so how do I prove I didn’t like it. \n \n In the eyes of the law, what Turner did to his victim is considered sexual assault and not rape, no matter how horrific it sounds. The three charges Turner was convicted of are “assault with intent to commit rape of an intoxicated woman, sexually penetrating an intoxicated person with a foreign object, and sexually penetrating an unconscious person with a foreign object.” \n \n Intent to commit rape, legally, is not the same as sexually penetrating a person, and therefore, Turner is not being described as a convicted rapist.

The Dalai Lama argued that European countries were “morally responsible” for assisting “a refugee really facing danger against their life,” but that refugees should ultimately go back and rebuild their home countries. (Pope’s ‘Don’t Close Your Doors’ Refugee Initiative Begins On The 445th Anniversary Of Papal Army Driving Out Islamic Invaders) \n \n “Receive them, help them, educate them … but ultimately they should develop their own country,” the Dalai Lama said, according to AFP. \n \n “I think Europe belongs to the Europeans,” he added, saying “they ultimately should rebuild their own country.” \n \n The spiritual leader’s comments likely struck a chord with locals, as Sweden has experienced an explosion in violent migrant gang-related incidents, many of which involved military-grade explosive devices, since 2014 when over 100,000 asylum seekers from predominantly Muslim countries settled in the area. \n \n The Dalai Lama also made similar comments concerning refugees in Germany in 2016, saying that “Europe, for example Germany, cannot become an Arab country.” \n \n “Germany is Germany. There are so many that in practice it becomes difficult,” he said, according to Independent. \n \n “From a moral point of view, too, I think that the refugees should only be admitted temporarily,” he added. \n \n The Dalai Lama clarified at the time that he had compassion for refugees, especially those fleeing from war, but said now the goal of aid should be their return to their homelands. \n \n “When we look into the face of every single refugee, especially the children and women, we can feel their suffering,” he said. “The goal should be that they return and help rebuild their countries.” \n \n The Dalai Lama has remained in exile since 1959, when he escaped Tibet and settled in India with tens of thousands of followers after Chinese communist troops took over the region. The Indian government agreed to grant asylum to him and his followers and also granted voting rights to Tibetans born in India.

63,"['Mirror, Mirror \n \n (out of 4) \n \n Starring Julia Roberts, Lily Collins, Armie Hammer and Nathan Lane. Directed by Tarsem Singh. 106 minutes. Opens March 30 at major theatres. PG \n \n The first volley in the froth-vs.-goth wars between two film versions of the Snow White fairytale has been fired with Mirror, Mirror. \n \n It opens Friday, two months ahead of the June 1 bow for the more sinister-looking Snow White and the Huntsman. \n \n Mirror, Mirror takes itself less seriously, presenting a pink confection of slapstick laughs and swashbuckling heroics that references the classic Disney cartoon liberally, with sly winks to the genre — right down to cliché teeth twinkles. \n \n The story gets a 2012 girl-power update: no more waiting for a prince to save the day. Women don’t escape the fairytale slap-down entirely, however; the villain is still a vain old gal who can’t deal with all of her stepdaughter’s fabulousness. But this Snow White will see to her own destiny. \n \n Director Tarsem Singh certainly knows his way around fantasy filmmaking (Immortals, The Fall) but can he also bring a light touch to the dramatics? It’s a legitimate question in the face of the horribly overwrought Immortals. Turns out he can, although don’t look for much more than that. This rambling version of Snow White’s tale is a pretty, spun-sugar confection, airy as a plate of Easter egg-coloured macarons and similarly devoid of substance. \n \n Everything about Mirror, Mirror echoes old-school animation and the entire thing is gorgeous, from the high-concept snow-covered forest to a human form of a game of Battleship, where three-masted vessels nestle atop players’ heads like fanciful hats. \n \n This is the last film for Oscar-winning (Dracula) Japanese costume designer Eiko Ishioka, who died in January. She and Singh teamed earlier on Immortals, The Fall and The Cell, and it’s fitting that the film is dedicated to her, given the lift her work gives Mirror, Mirror. The elaborate costumes are stunning, especially the fanciful animal-themed masked ball outfits with over-the-top headdresses. \n \n Julia Roberts stars as The Queen, nasty stepmother to Snow White (Lily Collins and her massive eyebrows), sliding from America’s sweetheart to icily evil beauty with ease. Easily bored and self-absorbed, the years are piling up and Queenie is hardly happy about it, using a magical mirror with a surprising inhabitant to keep herself looking fresh. \n \n The Queen’s devoted servant Brighton (Nathan Lane doing a fantastic Nathan Lane) simpers and cowers as he reluctantly does all her bidding. There’s no retirement plan for toadies in this kingdom. \n \n Snow spends most of her time locked up in her bedroom, missing her father, the King, who disappeared in the woods where he was likely devoured by the beast who lives there. Now 18, she’d like to get out of her room occasionally, but The Queen has other plans for her. \n \n The arrival of a handsome prince (Armie Hammer as Prince Alcott) stirs the pot. He’s buff and a bit of a buffoon, but the Queen sees a chance to help the kingdom she’s bankrupted with her party excesses by marrying him. Too bad he only has eyes for Show White, a wrinkle the Queen deals with by ordering Brighton to drop her rival off in the dark woods to be part of the beast’s buffet. \n \n Jason Keller, whose last screenplay was for the ham-fisted Machine Gun Preacher, delivers whimsy by the bucket here, teaming the abandoned Snow up with seven rebel forest dwellers who don’t take well to being called dwarves. Onetime model citizens and business owners banished to the woods by the Queen for looking “different,” they’ve found amusing means to measure up and prefer to make money the Robin Hood way rather than by toiling in a mine. \n \n Among them, we meet Grub (Joe Gnoffo), who loves food, perpetually lovesick Half Pint (Mark Povinelli) and writer Grimm (Danny Woodburn). London, Ont., actor Jordan Prentice plays Napoleon, the de facto leader of the group without a short man syndrome. \n \n Collins, daughter of musician Phil, does well in her first big leading role as a lively Snow, showing a good comic sensibility. But those Groucho Marx eyebrows are a constant distraction. \n \n From the CGI-created castle to the Bollywood-inspired final dance number, Mirror, Mirror is aimed straight at the eyeballs. But it bypasses the heart in the process.', 'Who’s the Most Self-Absorbed of Them All? ‘Mirror Mirror,’ Tarsem Singh’s Snow White Story \n \n Is it possible for filmmakers to still peddle the old “once upon a time” in the age of Katniss Everdeen, the ferocious teenage warrior from “The Hunger Games”? The answer, from the evidence of Tarsem Singh’s “Mirror Mirror,” a would-be comic and cheeky redo of Snow White, is yes, but not persuasively. The princess (Lily Collins) here smiles obligingly while flouncing about in a gown, but she also helps write her own happily ever after with a sword. Whether that makes her a feminist heroine or just another self-actualized Disneyesque waif may depend on your idea of empowerment. (In June the fairy tale gets another makeover in “Snow White and the Huntsman.” ) \n \n Written by, among others, the Brothers Grimm and waggishly retrofitted for “Mirror Mirror” by Marc Klein and Jason Keller, the essential story is as you probably remember it, only with jokes: a widower King remarries, giving the realm a new Queen (Julia Roberts, seemingly very self-amused), and his only child, Snow White, a mother. But when the King disappears, a turn that’s represented in the film by a striking animated sequence, Snow White falls into the grasping hands of the Queen, who turns out to be a pathological narcissist suffering from possible delusions. (She talks to her mirror.) You know the rest — seven dwarfs, a prince, a girl’s youth, a woman’s vanity — all familiar pieces that are both this movie’s strength and its gravest flaws. \n \n Mr. Singh started out directing music videos. The short form suits him. “Mirror Mirror” runs a long 95 minutes, but it’s a virtual breeze when compared with his previous movie, “Immortals,” a camp farrago set in ancient Greece (by way of a Vegas floor show), that runs an enervating 110 minutes. Critics like to take note of Mr. Singh’s eye-catching visuals, and there’s no doubt he knows how to swank up performers and sets or rather hire talented professionals to do the job for him. The costumes in “Mirror Mirror” — by turns ethereal as a dream and as ponderous as sculptured marble — were created by Mr. Singh’s regular collaborator, the Japanese designer Eiko Ishioka. (Ms. Ishioka, who also designed the costumes for Francis Ford Coppola’s “Dracula,” died in January.) \n \n Yet while Mr. Singh knows how to make performers and sets look good, he has trouble putting them into vibrant, kinetic, meaningful play, which effectively means that he’s a better window dresser than a movie director. “Mirror Mirror” is consistently watchable, even when it drifts into dullness because Mr. Singh always gives you something to look at, whether it’s the Queen’s blood-red gown, the sailing clouds decorating her bedroom or the dwarfs’ woodland home. Everything looks as if it has been meticulously selected for this or that spot, including the performers. Ms. Roberts, Ms. Collins and Armie Hammer, as Prince Alcott, look as pretty as fairy-book illustrations, but their performances are similarly one dimensional, as if they had been art directed into place instead of cut loose. \n \n The only lead performer to wiggle free of Mr. Singh’s heavy hand is Nathan Lane, who plays the Queen’s henchman, Brighton, and whose amusingly tremulous, cagey performance owes much to Bob Hope. Mr. Lane is the only performer who sounds comfortable delivering Mr. Klein and Mr. Keller’s often intentionally anachronistic dialogue, which, with its forced lightness and scattershot jokes, makes an awkward fit with Mr. Singh’s lugubriousness. All of the scripted yuks register as an attempt to modernize the movie, as does affording Snow the chance to play a role in her own rescue, mostly by giving her a sword and putting her in palazzo pants. That’s nice, even if in the end it comes down to the same old story of love, glory and the devastating cost of female wrinkles. \n \n “Mirror Mirror” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). Slapstick violence. \n \n Mirror Mirror \n \n Opens on Friday nationwide. \n \n Directed by Tarsem Singh; written by Marc Klein and Jason Keller, based on a story by Melisa Wallack; director of photography, Brendan Galvin; edited by Robert Duffy and Nick Moore; music by Alan Menken; choreography by Paul Becker; production design by Tom Foden; costumes by Eiko Ishioka; produced by Bernie Goldmann, Ryan Kavanaugh and Brett Ratner; released by Relativity Media. Running time: 1 hour 35 minutes. \n \n WITH: Julia Roberts (the Queen), Lily Collins (Snow White), Armie Hammer (Prince Alcott), Nathan Lane (Brighton) and Sean Bean (the King).', 'Encased in a coffin, waiting to be brought back to life: That\'s how Snow White spends a good portion of the folk story that bears her name. There\'s no such downtime for the princess in the snappy retelling ""Mirror Mirror,"" a fractured fairy tale that occupies the divide between Disney and Grimm.A booster shot of testosterone lends kinetic kick to director Tarsem Singh \'s visually inventive interpretation, without shortchanging the requisite froufrou or sugarcoating the story\'s dark Oedipal heart. The mash-up can be choppy, but the fable zings along on the sharp comic timing of the cast, led by a royally wicked Julia Roberts The screenplay by Marc Klein and Jason Keller (a screen story credit goes to Melisa Wallack) pointedly rewrites the fairy-tale convention that finds every damsel helplessly imperiled until a prince delivers her from danger. This Snow White ( Lily Collins ) can get gussied up with the best of them, but she also holds her own in a fencing duel. And — hello, switcheroo — she rescues a prince in distress.When in exile, Snow (it\'s a first-name-informal kingdom) receives martial-arts instruction from the dwarfs. Like the famous septet from Disney\'s 1937 classic, this woods-dwelling crew provides collective-sidekick slapstick, and each has a character-defining shtick — most memorably the love-struck Half Pint (Mark Povinelli). But they\'ve also been restored to their folk tale roots as bandits and outcasts. They\'re action antiheroes with hearts of gold.Transforming Snow White to an action hero in her own right doesn\'t lessen the archetypal power of the stepmother-daughter, age-beauty conflict. Collins ( ""The Blind Side"" ) is a convincing foil for Roberts\' jealous Queen, personifying intelligence, innate goodness and fairest-of-them-all femininity. If a movie-star self-regard has crept into Roberts\' work over the years, here she uses it to winning effect, savoring the tension and silliness, and making an exceptionally entertaining evil monarch.Advised and chided by the alter ego who resides on the other side of her magic mirror — one of the film\'s more striking elements — the Queen sets her sights on an imperial merger with Prince Alcott ( Armie Hammer ), whose province\'s resources would save her from the brink of bankruptcy.Hammer, who brought an air of wounded regality to the Winklevoss twins in ""The Social Network"" and Clyde Tolson in ""J. Edgar,"" gets to shake off the aggrievement and let his princely flag fly, often without a shirt.Singh (a.k.a. Tarsem Singh Dhandwar or simply Tarsem) is a fantasist whose singular knack for spectacle can also be his weakness, set-piece razzle-dazzle not infrequently overwhelming the characters in his previous films: ""The Cell,"" ""The Fall"" and ""Immortals."" That weakness reveals itself in ""Mirror Mirror"" when he stops the story cold to indulge in a puppet sequence.But mostly the built-in structure of a well-known tale helps to rein him in, as does the propulsive rhythm of one-liners — some of the best are delivered with panache by Nathan Lane and Robert Emms, as mouthy servants. For most of its running time, the film strikes the right balance of make-believe enchantment and snark-infused lampoon, playing to older kids and adults alike.Crucial to the movie\'s magic are Tom Foden\'s lush and witty production design and the splendid costumes by Eiko Ishioka, the renowned designer\'s final screen work before her death in January. The finery and regalia of their contributions are integral to Singh\'s vision, giving this mostly conventional princess story its fair share of romantic froth and more than a little moxie.', 'Mirror Mirror \n \n March 28, 2012 \n \n Cast & Credits The Queen Julia Roberts \n \n Snow White Lily Collins \n \n Prince Alcott Armie Hammer \n \n Brighton Nathan Lane \n \n Napoleon Jordan Prentice \n \n Half Pint Mark Povinelli \n \n Grub Joe Gnoffo \n \n Grimm Danny Woodburn \n \n Wolf Sebastian Saraceno \n \n Butcher Martin Klebba \n \n Chuckles Ronald Lee Clark \n \n Charles Renbock Robert Emms \n \n Baker Margaret Mare Winningham \n \n Baron Michael Lerner \n \n King Sean Bean \n \n \n \n Relativity Media presents a film directed by Tarsem Singh.

Printer-friendly » \n \n E-mail this to a friend » \n \n ""Mirror Mirror"" is a sumptuous fantasy for the eyes and a pinball game for the mind, as story elements collide and roll around bumping into each other. This is not a faithful retelling of the versions by the Brothers Grimm or Walt Disney, but neither is it a satire, nor much of a story in its own right. But it\'s great to look at. If there\'s a major difference from the earlier versions, it\'s how this one has beefed-up roles for the seven dwarves, who here seem to be a merry band in search of Robin Hood. Nor do I recall earlier battles with a giant winged griffin. \n \n The look of the film owes everything to the director, Tarsem Singh, an India-born former TV commercial maker, famous for two of the best-looking movies I\'ve ever seen, ""The Cell"" (2000) and ""The Fall"" (2006). He\'s in love with spectacular landscapes and architecture, and in all of his films (including the underwhelming ""The Immortals"" in 2011) the costumes of the late Japanese designer Eiko Ishioka dominate every scene they\'re in and every character they\'re worn by. \n \n \n \n Julia Roberts seems particularly well-suited to wear them, and when first seen is wearing a magnificent orange gown and seated on a seashell throne which acts as a frame and a continuation of the costume. Roberts plays the Queen in a kingdom we\'re introduced to by her opening narration -- which uses animated dolls figures to fill us in on her early life, during which she was married to a King (Sean Bean) who promptly set off into the forest and was not seen again. That left her as the autocratic ruler of a kingdom with painfully high taxes, and the stepmother of Snow White (Lily Collins), who is a captive in the castle until she\'s 18. \n \n \n \n There is a financial crisis. Brighton (Nathan Lane), her aide and accountant, tells her she\'s broke. That comes at an inconvenient time, because Prince Alcott (Armie Hammer) has wandered into the kingdom, and the Queen knows if she marries him, he can solve her finances. Problem is, she can\'t even afford the royal ball at which she plans for them to fall in love. \n \n \n \n The Prince has already met Snow White; they were both wandering in the woods when they encountered the seven dwarfs, jolly bandits with good hearts. It is Snow White and not the Prince in this version who bestows a life-changing kiss. It\'s almost uncanny in some scenes here, how Lily Collins (daughter of Phil Collins) looks like Audrey Hepburn. \n \n \n \n She\'s all sweet, all innocent, but Julia Roberts steals the show with her imperious and autocratic Queen. She consults her own image in a mirror, located as only Tarsem would place it in a weird structure in the middle of a lake. She never asks who is the fairest of them all, and thus never has to hear the inevitable answer, but the Queen\'s vanity and fear of aging give Roberts some plum scenes. Consider the one where she\'s having a spa-style beauty makeover before the ball. Her lips become bee-stung with the help of real bees, she gets a manicure from disgusting wormy creatures, and her skin is refreshed with a preparation made up from parrot droppings. Yes, parrot droppings, and we see the parrots dropping them. \n \n \n \n All of this is in place and looks great, but the dialogue is rather flat, the movie sort of boring, and there\'s not much energy in the two places it should really be felt: Between the Queen and Snow White, and between Snow and the Prince. The story is a listless tale that moves at a stately pace through settings that could have supported fireworks. Indeed, the characters who seem to care the most about each other are the dwarfs.']",4,"– The latest retelling of Snow White (before June's Snow White and the Huntsman) is a lot like its vain queen: visually stunning, but kind of shallow. Critics aren't particularly impressed with Mirror Mirror: Though director Tarsem Singh ""knows how to make performers and sets look good, he has trouble putting them into vibrant, kinetic, meaningful play,"" notes Manohla Dargis in the New York Times. That ""effectively means that he’s a better window dresser than a movie director."" In the Toronto Star, Linda Barnard agrees. ""Everything about Mirror Mirror echoes old-school animation and the entire thing is gorgeous,"" she notes. It's ""a pretty, spun-sugar confection, airy as a plate of Easter egg-colored macarons and similarly devoid of substance."" The script doesn't hold up to the visuals, writes Roger Ebert in the Chicago Sun-Times. ""The dialogue is rather flat, the movie sort of boring,"" he notes. It's ""a listless tale that moves at a stately pace through settings that could have supported fireworks."" In the Los Angeles Times, however, Sheri Linden sees a lot to like. ""The fable zings along on the sharp comic timing of the cast, led by a royally wicked Julia Roberts"" as the queen. It's ""a fractured fairy tale that occupies the divide between Disney and Grimm."""

And it’s not in TV. Gasp! A “real” job? Surely not! \n \n But yes: According to E!, Access Hollywood, the Daily Mail, and pretty much every other entertainment news source out there, the former Kate Plus 8 star has gotten a job, and guess what? She’s a blogger now! Kate has signed on to write for the website CouponCabin.com. In her weekly features, she’ll be offering money-saving advice on such topics as stretching budgets for large family, holiday shopping, gift ideas, and more. Said Kate in CouponCabin’s official release, “No matter what your financial situation is, there’s no reason not to use coupons. It’s like free money in your pocket!” \n \n Kate’s first post will appear on November 22, two days before Thanksgiving. The topic? How to handle Black Friday, of course. As fellow bloggers, we here at BettyConfidential welcome you to the ranks, Kate. Do us proud. \n \n Read ‘Twilight’ Stars to Be Immortalized at Grauman’s Chinese Theatre TODAY! \n \n You know, it’s nice to see that Kate has finally moved on from that whole “NO! I MUST STAY IN TV NO MATTER WHAT!” state of mind. Finding a job in this economy isn’t easy, and odds are, you’re going to end up doing something you hadn’t thought you’d be doing, simply because it’s what will pay the bills. Believe me. I’ve been there. Unemployment is a bitch, and it’s not necessarily your “fault” that it’s where you’re at. But flexibility of thinking is a good skill to have no matter what, and it’s good to know that she’s starting to exercise it. And hey, she can still capitalize off of her reality fame in her new line of work, right? \n \n She might even be able to use her new gig to springboard back into television.

(I just typed that sentence while gazing at my diamond-encrusted fingernails as they tappa-tapped on my keyboard, which is made out of genuine leather and features function keys ensconced in imported silk.) But even if this keeps her busy and semi-compensated for a while — and less focused on the new TV deal she said she wants earlier this week on “The View” — this is a good thing. \n \n 2. Her blog entries may provide fodder for Celebritology blog entries that compare Gosselin’s shopping tips to Gwyneth Paltrow’s shopping tips from Goop. \n \n And the comments on those Celebritology posts will be so rich with gleeful sarcasm that they may incite a phenomenon scientists have long predicted: the Big Snark Bang. Sure, both the blogosphere and the universe may immediately combust as a result. But it will be worth it. \n \n 3. As a result of Gosselin’s new job, CouponCabin.com just got a lot more publicity. \n \n And that’s super-exciting because, as Gosselin noted in the aforementioned press release, CouponCabin.com is the place where you can easily find the best deals on practically everything. \n \n And there are two things we all need more of in these challenging times: great deals on practically everything and Kate Gosselin.', 'Kate Gosselin can ease up on the ""freaking out"": The out-of-work reality star has a job now -- a part-time gig, at least. \n \n Gosselin, whose ""Kate Plus 8"" reality show took its last breath in September, will be a contributing blogger for click-and-save website Coupon Cabin. \n \n ""I\'ve never quit a job in my life without having something else lined up,"" she told People at the time.

The runoffs have also removed gold out of the old abandoned mines and sent it down the river. \n \n “It’s going to bring down more gold,” said Thomas. “It’s going to bring up new areas that I never got to.” \n \n Thomas runs tour groups through his property and said now is the optimum time for gold hunting because the storms have just finished churning the landscape. \n \n Officials from the Bureau of Land Management say the erosion “concentrates” the gold by removing the lighter rock and soil. \n \n You may be wondering if this reporter found any during our time here. We did find some fine flakes of what they call “flour gold” and it was found more quickly than normal in just a couple of panning sessions. \n \n “Eureka!” said Thomas.”That’s hard to do.” \n \n But not as hard this year, now that Mother Nature has shaken up the motherlode. \n \n Thomas said one hot spot this year will be below the Oroville Dam, because the huge water releases from the spillway could reveal some new pockets of gold.', ""It’s none of these. They’re too pretty (Picture: Getty) \n \n A team of experts spent three months trying to determine the world’s ugliest colour. \n \n And, after detailed research into which colours generated the most negative reactions among the general public, the dubious honour goes to Pantone 448C, also known as opaque couché – a sludgy brown colour that was alternately described by respondents as ‘tar’, ‘dirty’ and even ‘death’. \n \n Charming. \n \n But why, you might well ask, are a team of experts throwing so much shade at a colour that was already pretty dreary to begin with? \n \n The world’s most off-putting colour (Picture: Getty) \n \n Well, because researchers believe it may be the key to cutting cigarette sales. \n \n Back in 2012, researchers at Gfk Bluemoon were commissioned by the Australian government to design new packaging aimed at discouraging people from buying cigarettes. \n \n So, they set out to find the most offensive and unappealing shade in the colour spectrum to put on the packets. \n \n Over 1,000 smokers took part in seven studies over a period of three months to identify the ugliest colour, with opaque couché coming out on top (or bottom, depending on how you look at it). \n \n World's ugliest colour, Pantone 448C (opaque couché), helps reduce smoking rates down under: https://t.co/jvTGv8wfiu pic.twitter.com/ImE6ZKASpi — SPHR@Cam (@SPHRcam) June 1, 2016 \n \n Other colours that turned smokers off included lime green, beige, white, mustard and dark gray. Medium olive was also considered a front-runner until it was rejected in the final stages for being ‘too classy’. \n \n But, after three months, Pantone 448C was judged the ultimate turn-off and used to cover cigarette boxes across Australia. \n \n And now, after the use of the new and very unexciting packaging has shown early success in curbing cigarette sales Down Under, the UK, Ireland and France have all developed plainer cigarette packaging, featuring, you’ve guessed it, Pantone 448C. \n \n The new packaging, featuring the world’s ugliest colour (Picture: Getty) \n \n The new packets launched on May 20. \n \n Proving, once again, that beauty is very much in the eye of the beholder. \n \n MORE: Finally, the world’s favourite colour has been revealed""]",3,"– This winter's flooding in Northern California has done more than bring relief after years of drought; it's created the prospect of the best gold prospecting in 20 years. Gold hunters in the area tell the Chico Enterprise-Record the floods have ""rearranged the rivers"" and ""move things around."" That means gold veins that have been hidden for 200 years are suddenly exposed. According to CBS San Francisco, the floods also swept gold out of abandoned mines and washed it downriver. While KCRA reports that gold can simply be picked off the ground following major flooding, the best prospecting will come in the summer months when the water has receded. Right now, rivers are still high and government workers are trying to keep would-be prospectors away while they get things under control. But in the summer—which experts say could be the busiest since the one that followed major flooding in 1997—stream beds will be exposed for better gold hunting. ""I'm going to have a ball,"" one prospector tells the Chico newspaper. The epicenter for the new gold rush could be the Oroville Dam, which nearly catastrophically flooded this winter and required the use of an emergency spillway for the first time.

Dr. Oliver Zong, who founded NYC Footcare and coined the term “toebesity,” once had a woman ask him to remove her pinkie toe (he didn’t do it.) \n \n “Cinderella surgery” is just the latest in a long line of gross things women do to fit into clothes. Some women elect to have botox injected into their calves to slim them down for certain boots and skinnyjeans (although the process is dangerous, because of the major arteries in the legs).

72,"['Latter-day Saints believe that the marriage of one man and one woman is the Lord’s standing law of marriage. In biblical times, the Lord commanded some to practice plural marriage—the marriage of one man and more than one woman. 1 By revelation, the Lord commanded Joseph Smith to institute the practice of plural marriage among Church members in the early 1840s. For more than half a century, plural marriage was practiced by some Latter-day Saints under the direction of the Church President. 2 \n \n Latter-day Saints do not understand all of God’s purposes in instituting, through His prophets, the practice of plural marriage. The Book of Mormon identifies one reason for God to command it: to increase the number of children born in the gospel covenant in order to “raise up seed unto [the Lord].”3 \n \n Plural marriage did result in the birth of large numbers of children within faithful Latter-day Saint homes. It also shaped 19th-century Mormon society in many ways: marriage became available to virtually all who desired it; per-capita inequality of wealth was diminished as economically disadvantaged women married into more financially stable households; and ethnic intermarriages were increased, which helped to unite a diverse immigrant population. Plural marriage also helped create and strengthen a sense of cohesion and group identification among Latter-day Saints. Church members came to see themselves as a “peculiar people,” covenant-bound to carry out the commands of God despite outside opposition.4 \n \n The Beginnings of Plural Marriage in the Church \n \n Polygamy had been permitted for millennia in many cultures and religions, but, with few exceptions, it was rejected in Western cultures. In Joseph Smith’s time, monogamy was the only legal form of marriage in the United States. \n \n The revelation on plural marriage, recorded in Doctrine and Covenants 132, emerged partly from Joseph Smith’s study of the Old Testament in 1831. Latter-day Saints understood that they were living in the latter days, in what the revelations called the “dispensation of the fulness of times.”5 Ancient principles—such as prophets, priesthood, and temples—would be restored to the earth. Plural marriage, practiced by ancient patriarchs like Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Moses, was one of those ancient principles.6 \n \n The same revelation that taught of plural marriage was embedded within a revelation about eternal marriage—the teaching that marriage could last beyond death. Monogamous and plural marriages performed by priesthood power could seal loved ones to each other for eternity, on condition of righteousness.7 \n \n The revelation on marriage stated general principles; it did not explain how to implement plural marriage in all its particulars. In Nauvoo, Joseph Smith married additional wives and authorized other Latter-day Saints to practice plural marriage. The practice was introduced carefully and incrementally, and participants vowed to keep their participation confidential, anticipating a time when husbands and wives could acknowledge one another publicly. \n \n If you would like to learn more about the beginnings of plural marriage in the Church, click here. \n \n Plural Marriage and Families in 19th-Century Utah \n \n Between 1852 and 1890, Latter-day Saints openly practiced plural marriage. Most plural families lived in Utah. Women and men who lived within plural marriage attested to challenges and difficulties but also to the love and joy they found within their families. They believed it was a commandment of God at that time and that obedience would bring great blessings to them and their posterity. Church leaders taught that participants in plural marriages should seek to develop a generous spirit of unselfishness and the pure love of Christ for everyone involved. \n \n Although some leaders had large polygamous families, two-thirds of polygamist men had only two wives at a time. Church leaders recognized that plural marriages could be particularly difficult for women. Divorce was therefore available to women who were unhappy in their marriages; remarriage was also readily available. Women sometimes married at young ages in the first decade of Utah settlement, which was typical of women living in frontier areas at the time. At its peak in 1857, perhaps one half of all Utah Latter-day Saints experienced plural marriage as a husband, wife, or child. The percentage of those involved in plural marriage steadily declined over the next three decades. \n \n During the years that plural marriage was publicly taught, not all Latter-day Saints were expected to live the principle, though all were expected to accept it as a revelation from God. Indeed, this system of marriage could not have been universal due to the ratio of men to women. Women were free to choose their spouses, whether to enter into a polygamous or a monogamous union, or whether to marry at all. Some men entered plural marriage because they were asked to do so by Church leaders, while others initiated the process themselves; all were required to obtain the approval of Church leaders before entering a plural marriage. \n \n If you would like to learn more about plural marriage and families in Utah, click here. \n \n Anti-Polygamy Legislation and the End of Plural Marriage \n \n Beginning in 1862, the U.S. government passed laws against the practice of plural marriage. After the U.S. Supreme Court found the anti-polygamy laws to be constitutional in 1879, federal officials began prosecuting polygamous husbands and wives during the 1880s. Believing these laws to be unjust, Latter-day Saints engaged in civil disobedience by continuing to practice plural marriage and by attempting to avoid arrest by moving to the homes of friends or family or by hiding under assumed names. When convicted, they paid fines and submitted to jail time. \n \n One of the anti-polygamy laws permitted the U.S. government to seize Church property. Federal officers soon threatened to take Latter-day Saint temples. The work of salvation for both the living and the dead was now in jeopardy. In September 1890, Church President Wilford Woodruff felt inspired to issue the Manifesto. “Inasmuch as laws have been enacted by Congress forbidding plural marriages,” President Woodruff explained, “I hereby declare my intention to submit to those laws, and to use my influence with the members of the Church over which I preside to have them do likewise.”8 \n \n The full implications of the document were not apparent at first. The Lord’s way is to speak “line upon line; here a little, there a little.”9 Like the beginning of plural marriage in the Church, the end of the practice was gradual and incremental, a process filled with difficulties and uncertainties. \n \n The Manifesto declared President Woodruff’s intention to submit to the laws of the United States, and new plural marriages within that jurisdiction largely came to an end. But a small number of plural marriages continued to be performed in Mexico and Canada, under the sanction of some Church leaders. As a rule, these marriages were not promoted by Church leaders and were difficult to get approved. Either one or both of the spouses who entered into these unions typically had to agree to remain in Canada or Mexico. On an exceptional basis, a smaller number of plural marriages were performed within the United States between the years 1890 and 1904. \n \n The Church’s role in these marriages became a subject of intense public debate after Reed Smoot, an Apostle, was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1903. At the April 1904 general conference, Church President Joseph F. Smith issued a forceful statement, known as the Second Manifesto, making new plural marriages punishable by excommunication.10 Since President Smith’s day, Church Presidents have repeatedly emphasized that the Church and its members are no longer authorized to enter into plural marriage and have underscored the sincerity of their words by urging local leaders to bring noncompliant members before Church disciplinary councils. \n \n If you would like to learn more about the end of plural marriage in the Church, click here. \n \n Conclusion \n \n Plural marriage was among the most challenging aspects of the Restoration. For many who practiced it, plural marriage was a trial of faith. It violated both cultural and legal norms, leading to persecution and revilement. Despite these hardships, plural marriage benefited the Church in innumerable ways. Through the lineage of these 19th-century Saints have come many Latter-day Saints who have been faithful to their gospel covenants as righteous mothers and fathers; loyal disciples of Jesus Christ; devoted Church members, leaders, and missionaries; and good citizens and prominent public officials. Modern Latter-day Saints honor and respect these faithful pioneers who gave so much for their faith, families, and community. \n \n Resources \n \n The Church acknowledges the contribution of scholars to the historical content presented in this article; their work is used with permission. \n \n Originally published October 2014.', 'Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

It provides a look at the cultural touchstones that shape the lives of students entering college this fall. The creation of Beloit’s Keefer Professor of the Humanities Tom McBride and former Public Affairs Director Ron Nief, it was originally created as a reminder to faculty to be aware of dated references, and quickly became a catalog of the rapidly changing worldview of each new generation. The Mindset List website at www.beloit.edu/mindset, the Mediasite webcast and its Facebook page receive more than 400,000 hits annually. \n \n The class of 2014 has never found Korean-made cars unusual on the Interstate and five hundred cable channels, of which they will watch a handful, have always been the norm. Since ""digital"" has always been in the cultural DNA, they\'ve never written in cursive and with cell phones to tell them the time, there is no need for a wrist watch. Dirty Harry (who’s that?) is to them a great Hollywood director. The America they have inherited is one of soaring American trade and budget deficits; Russia has presumably never aimed nukes at the United States and China has always posed an economic threat. \n \n Nonetheless, they plan to enjoy college. The males among them are likely to be a minority. They will be armed with iPhones and BlackBerries, on which making a phone call will be only one of many, many functions they will perform. They will now be awash with a computerized technology that will not distinguish information and knowledge. So it will be up to their professors to help them. A generation accustomed to instant access will need to acquire the patience of scholarship. They will discover how to research information in books and journals and not just on-line. Their professors, who might be tempted to think that they are hip enough and therefore ready and relevant to teach the new generation, might remember that Kurt Cobain is now on the classic oldies station. The college class of 2014 reminds us, once again, that a generation comes and goes in the blink of our eyes, which are, like the rest of us, getting older and older. \n \n Most students entering college for the first time this fall—the Class of 2014—were born in 1992. \n \n For these students, Benny Hill, Sam Kinison, Sam Walton, Bert Parks and Tony Perkins have always been dead. \n \n 1.

The essay explains that Smith was ordered to take multiple wives by an angel who visited him three times between 1834 and 1842; in the last instance, the angel was armed with a sword and threatened a reluctant Smith. The leader, then married to first wife Emma, took his first plural wife, Fanny Alger, in Kirtland, Ohio. Smith and Alger ultimately separated, and the church relocated to Nauvoo, Ill., where he married many more women. The oldest was 56, and the youngest was 14-year-old Helen Mar Kimball; some were already married, a revelation the New York Times describes as the ""biggest bombshell for some."" The essay explains that a number of marriages, including that with Kimball, were sealed ""for eternity alone,"" suggesting sexual relations weren't involved (the ones that did involve sex were ""for time and eternity""). What did Emma think of all this? Per the essay, she was none too pleased, though at one time she did accept four of Smith's wives into their home. And what was the reasoning behind what the essay describes as the ""wrenching trial"" of polygamy? Kimball said Smith told her that ""the practice of this principle would be the hardest trial the Saints would ever have to test their faith."" Two more essays discuss plural marriage in the church's later years; they're part of an effort the church is making to share ""reliable, faith-promoting"" info about its past, the church's historian tells the Times. (Part of that effort: an explanation of its undergarments.)"

Consider that Democrats lost 63 seats in the 2010 midterms are expected to lose five to 12 (or maybe more) seats on Tuesday. No president has lost as many in back-to-back midterms since Harry Truman lost 83 in 1946 and 1950, writes Stuart Rothenberg. Dwight Eisenhower managed to lose a total of 66, but Obama seems on track to top him. More typical is the pattern of Bill Clinton, who lost 54 in 1994 but bounced back with a gain of five in 1998. Still, if Tuesday is shaping up to be a night of celebration for the GOP, Politico offers a reality check, at least in the Senate: Several first-term Republicans in vulnerable states will be up for re-election in 2016. So even if Republicans win a small majority this year, they might have to give it right back two years later."
74,"['Humankind’s common ancestor with other mammals may have been a roughly rat-size animal that weighed no more than a half a pound, had a long furry tail and lived on insects. \n \n In a comprehensive six-year study of the mammalian family tree, scientists have identified and reconstructed what they say is the most likely common ancestor of the many species on the most abundant and diverse branch of that tree — the branch of creatures that nourish their young in utero through a placenta. The work appears to support the view that in the global extinctions some 66 million years ago, all non-avian dinosaurs had to die for mammals to flourish. \n \n Scientists had been searching for just such a common genealogical link and have found it in a lowly occupant of the fossil record, Protungulatum donnae, that until now has been so obscure that it lacks a colloquial nickname. But as researchers reported Thursday in the journal Science, the animal had several anatomical characteristics for live births that anticipated all placental mammals and led to some 5,400 living species, from shrews to elephants, bats to whales, cats to dogs and, not least, humans. \n \n A team of researchers described the discovery as an important insight into the pattern and timing of early mammal life and a demonstration of the capabilities of a new system for handling copious amounts of fossil and genetic data in the service of evolutionary biology. The formidable new technology is expected to be widely applied in years ahead to similar investigations of plants, insects, fish and fowl. \n \n Given some belated stature by an artist’s brush, the animal hardly looks the part of a progenitor of so many mammals (which do not include marsupials, like kangaroos and opossums, or monotremes, egg-laying mammals like the duck-billed platypus). \n \n Maureen A. O’Leary of Stony Brook University on Long Island, a leader of the project and the principal author of the journal report, wrote that a combination of genetic and anatomical data established that the ancestor emerged within 200,000 to 400,000 years after the great dying at the end of the Cretaceous period. At the time, the meek were rapidly inheriting the earth from hulking predators like T. rex. \n \n Within another two million to three million years, Dr. O’Leary said, the first members of modern placental orders appeared in such profusion that researchers have started to refer to the explosive model of mammalian evolution. The common ancestor itself appeared more than 36 million years later than had been estimated based on genetic data alone. \n \n Although some small primitive mammals had lived in the shadow of the great Cretaceous reptiles, the scientists could not find evidence supporting an earlier hypothesis that up to 39 placental mammalian lineages survived to enter the post-extinction world. Only the stem lineage to Placentalia, they said, appeared to hang on through the catastrophe, generally associated with climate change after an asteroid crashed into Earth. \n \n The research team drew on combined fossil evidence and genetic data encoded in DNA in evaluating the ancestor’s standing as an early placental mammal. Among characteristics associated with full-term live births, the Protungulatum species was found to have a two-horned uterus and a placenta in which the maternal blood came in close contact with the membranes surrounding the fetus, as in humans. \n \n The ancestor’s younger age, the scientists said, ruled out the breakup of the supercontinent of Gondwana around 120 million years ago as a direct factor in the diversification of mammals, as has sometimes been speculated. Evidence of the common ancestor was found in North America, but the animal may have existed on other continents as well. \n \n The publicly accessible database responsible for the findings is called MorphoBank, with advanced software for handling the largest compilation yet of data and images on mammals living and extinct. “This has stretched our own expertise,” Dr. O’Leary, an anatomist, said in an interview. \n \n “The findings were not a total surprise,” she said. “But it’s an important discovery because it relies on lots of information from fossils and also molecular data. Other scientists, at least a thousand, some from other countries, are already signing up to use MorphoBank.”', 'What\'s cute and furry and has a name only a paleontologist could love? \n \n A tiny theoretical creature dubbed the ""hypothetical placental mammal ancestor"" is stealing the hearts of some evolutionary biologists — and annoying others — as it raises new debate over just when our early mammal ancestors began diversifying across the globe. \n \n In a paper published this week in the journal Science, an international team of researchers described how they used a vast database of fossil and anatomical data, as well as DNA evidence, to reverse-engineer an ancestor to the largest group of living mammals. \n \n The scientists theorized that this hypothetical critter would have begun to diversify into new species of mammals after the demise of the dinosaurs roughly 66 million years ago — a concept at odds with some current thinking. \n \n ""This is fairly novel, to reconstruct an ancestor,"" said study coauthor and paleontologist Mike Novacek, the provost of science at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. ""I don\'t know of any other."" \n \n Placental mammals, including humans, make up the largest branch of the mammalian family tree. Only marsupials and a small number of egg-laying mammals are excluded. \n \n For the last several decades, scientists have debated just when it was that placental mammals began their explosive proliferation. Estimates based on DNA, or so-called molecular evidence, suggest that placental mammals appeared in the mid-Cretaceous period when dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurus rex and Triceratops still trod the Earth. \n \n However, scientists have yet to uncover evidence of placental fossils during this period, according to the authors of the new study. They argue that this is because placental mammals began to diversify only several hundred thousand years after the demise of non-avian dinosaurs, in the Paleocene epoch. \n \n ""An environment that radically changed may have offered more opportunities for a new group to take form and radiate,"" Novacek said. \n \n Using a vast online database called Morphobank, the team of 23 scientists built a composite of the hypothetical ancestor based on the morphology, or appearance, of existing and extinct animals, along with the DNA data. Study coauthor Maureen O\'Leary, a paleontologist at Stony Brook University in New York, likened the process to reassembling a crime scene from thousands of bits of evidence. \n \n Over a period of six years, the researchers developed a highly specific picture of an unassuming little animal whose descendants would one day include whales, bats, lions and people. \n \n ""The placental ancestor was a scampering species that had a diet of insects, a fleshy nose, a light underbelly in its fur, and a long tail,"" O\'Leary said. ""It was larger than a mouse, but smaller than a rat."" \n \n Based on their findings, the scientists said placental mammals began their spread about 36 million years later than estimates based on the DNA-derived molecular clock model. \n \n The research team also contradicted the molecular clock-based theory that placental mammals developed into different species because of the fragmentation of the supercontinent Gondwana, millions of years before the dinosaurs vanished. In addition, the study concluded that a subset of placental mammals known as Afrotheria, which includes elephants and aardvarks, did not originate in Africa as commonly believed; instead, authors say they arose in the Americas. \n \n Not all evolutionary biologists have fallen in love with the furry, hypothetical bug eater, however. Argument over the rise of placental mammals is likely to continue for some time. \n \n ""The bottom line is that this study is not convincing and will not settle the debate,"" said Mark Springer, an evolutionary geneticist at UC Riverside who was not part of the research team. \n \n Using fossils to establish branches of a family tree can result in mistaken groupings of species, Springer said, because some traits are passed along by related species while other traits develop in parallel with more distantly related species. This is known as convergent evolution, and Springer said he was not convinced that study authors had addressed that issue. \n \n Study coauthor Novacek said he did not expect the paper to end discussion on the matter, but he hoped it would add weight to an ongoing argument. \n \n ""I think this will reinforce the notion that the fossil record is not in agreement with what\'s been reconstructed by molecular clocks,"" Novacek said. ""As data accumulates, the case for this late origin becomes better and better."" \n \n Another debate is brewing over whether the hypothetical creature deserves a less cumbersome moniker. \n \n ""People who think this organism is cute have asked me for a name,"" Novacek said. ""I tell them we can\'t give it a Latin name, because it never really existed."" \n \n monte.morin@latimes.com']",2,"– Say hello to your great-great-great-great-great-grandparents (times a few million or so)—Protungulatum donnae, a rat-sized insect eater believed to have lived 66 million years ago.

75,"['In a rapid series of progressively escalating press releases by the Illinois Department of Public Health, it appears that a dangerous synthetic cannabinoid product called K2, spice, synthetic marijuana, legal weed or fake weed has now claimed its latest victim in an outbreak currently totaling 38 people whose severe bleeding is linked to exposure of this substance. The state division just announced the first death in this cluster. Over recent days, the toll of those harmed continues to increase with all being hospitalized for spontaneous excessive bleeding, including but not limited to coughing up blood, urinating blood, bloody stools, bleeding from the eyes, ears, nose and gums. \n \n Illinois government officials warn that these items were sold by convenience stores and dealers or obtained from friends. They have issued this advisory: \n \n “If you have purchased any of this product in the past month, do not use it. If you have used any of these products, and start experiencing severe, unexplained bleeding or bruising, please have someone take you to the hospital immediately or call 911. Do not walk or drive yourself. Tell your health care providers about the possible link between your symptoms and synthetic cannabinoid use.” \n \n What are synthetic cannabinoids? \n \n The agency goes on to inform about the varying misperceptions people have with respect to synthetic cannabinoids and their falsely perceived safety. As per their description, they are human-made, unregulated mind-altering chemicals that fall under a drug category called new psychoactive substances (NPS). These substances are sprayed on dried plant material for smoking or sold in liquid form to be used in vaporizing devices. \n \n They are sold and used recreationally under many names (e.g. herbal or liquid incense, K2, Spice, Black Mamba, Bombay Blue, Genie, Zohai, among others). Often pitched as being able to mimic the effects of cannabis because the chemical makeup is similar to those in the marijuana plant, the marketing of synthetic cannabinoids as synthetic “pot” can be deceptive and untrue. Synthetic cannabinoids have been found to impact the brain with greater potency, be volatile and life-threatening. \n \n What is causing the internal bleeding (and now death) in Illinois? \n \n According to the Chicago Tribune, \n \n “Consumption of synthetic cannabinoids previously has caused serious health problems such as seizures and kidney failure, but the side effect of severe bleeding is tied to the recent outbreak, said Dr. Patrick Lank, a medical toxicologist who works at Northwestern Memorial Hospital.” The article goes on to reveal “three of the hospitalized people tested positive for brodifacoum, more commonly known as rat poison.” \n \n You may be familiar with the drug coumadin - a blood thinning medication used to treat clots and prevent stroke - whose generic name is warfarin. Brodifacoum is often called a “superwarfarin” because it is extremely powerful with a long duration of action. \n \n Rat poison notoriously contains ingredients that have anticoagulant properties - or substances that impede someone’s ability to clot effectively. This particular compound antagonizes Vitamin K (which is necessary for proper clotting) and has an especially long half-life, so treatment for poisonings requires high doses at regular, continuous intervals for protracted periods of time. Over-the-counter options are not good enough given the severity of the problem and the urgency needed to correct it. And, therapies are mostly helpful when initiated before extensive bleeding and blood loss takes place. \n \n Once someone loses their ability to clot a cascade of untoward events follows. With such internal bleeding and blood loss, a person can go into shock, suffer a stroke, cardiac events, loss of consciousness and death. \n \n The bottom line… \n \n Efforts to liken synthetic cannabinoids to the active ingredient in marijuana by calling the products synthetic “pot” or “marijuana” are misleading misnomers. These “products” contain many highly potent, dangerous chemicals and you are taking big risks when using them. \n \n ADDENDUM (4/2/18, 8pm) \n \n The Illinois Department of Public Health now reports 2 deaths, 56 cases and expects these numbers to rise. See their link here for daily updates on this outbreak.', '(CNN) A fourth death in central Illinois has been connected to synthetic cannabinoid use, the Illinois Department of Public Health reported Tuesday. \n \n Since March 7, synthetic cannabinoids have sickened 153 people and been blamed in four deaths: a woman in her 30s, a man in his 40s and two men in their 20s. \n \n Synthetic cannabinoids across Chicago and parts of central Illinois have been found to contain brodifacoum, a rat poison, according to state health officials. \n \n Earlier this month, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned about life-threatening bleeding linked to the use of synthetic cannabinoids, often sold as spice, K2 or fake weed . A CDC ""outbreak alert"" noted that there were some bleeding cases also in Indiana, Maryland, Missouri and Wisconsin. \n \n Now, the number of hospitalizations and deaths is continuing to climb. \n \n ""We continue to see new cases of individuals experiencing severe bleeding after using synthetic cannabinoids,"" Dr. Nirav Shah, director of the Illinois Department of Public Health, said in a written statement Tuesday. \n \n ""Like so many other drugs, synthetic cannabinoids are addictive and people are not able to give them up. Alternatively, they think that it won\'t happen to them because they know their dealer or trust wherever they purchased the drugs,"" he said. ""If you know someone who uses synthetic cannabinoids, tell them these are deadly products and try to help them get treatment."" \n \n The US Attorney\'s Office charged three men with federal drug offenses and accused them of conspiring to sell synthetic cannabinoids at a Chicago convenience store, in connection with some of the cases. \n \n JUST WATCHED Police: Spike in synthetic marijuana overdoses in 2015 Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Police: Spike in synthetic marijuana overdoses in 2015 02:13 \n \n Synthetic cannabinoids are human-made chemicals that can be sprinkled on dried, shredded plant material and smoked or consumed as vaporized liquids inhaled through an e-cigarette or other device. \n \n Although these mind-altering chemicals are called cannabinoids, since they are designed to be similar to the chemicals found in marijuana, their actual impacts on the brain and body are much more powerful. They can cause serious side effects that are different from those of marijuana. \n \n One study of a synthetic cannabinoid, published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2016, found that it was 85 times as potent as tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the mind-altering chemical in marijuana. \n \n Since the synthetic cannabinoids in Illinois were found to contain rat poison, most of the hospitalizations have been related to unexplained bleeding, such as coughing up blood, blood in the urine, bloody nose and bleeding gums. \n \n A chemical in rat poison prevents blood from clotting, causing the severe bleeding, according to the state health department. \n \n Health officials warn that anyone who has a reaction to synthetic cannabinoids, such as severe bleeding, should call 911 or be taken to an emergency department immediately. \n \n To treat the bleeding, doctors use high doses of vitamin K, up to 30 tablets a day for up to six months, which can help restore the blood\'s ability to clot. \n \n Follow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter. \n \n Since this rising number of cases calls for a large amount of vitamin K and long duration of treatment -- costing up to thousands of dollars for each patient -- the Illinois Department of Public Health announced that it\'s working to find a way to place no financial burden on patients tied to the synthetic cannabinoids outbreak. \n \n The Bausch Foundation, the charitable organization of Valeant Pharmaceuticals, donated nearly 800,000 tablets of vitamin K to the department.']",2,"– Another person in Illinois has died after using synthetic marijuana, reports the Chicago Tribune. The central Illinois woman, who was in her 30s, is the fourth person to die in the state after apparent use of the tainted substance. She's the third central Illinois victim; the fourth was from Chicago. In the last few weeks, more than 150 people across 13 counties have been hospitalized after using synthetic pot laced with what health officials believe to be a type of a rat poison known as brodifacoum, a powerful anti-coagulant. A widely used pesticide, when ingested by humans brodifacoum can cause bleeding from the nose or gums, as well as internal bleeding. Symptoms include coughing up blood and bloody urine, health officials say, and brodifacoum poisoning can be treated with vitamin K administered via IV to stabilize the blood’s clotting ability. The treatment is effective if initiated before excessive bleeding occurs, per the American Council on Science and Health. CNN reports health officials urge anyone who has a reaction to synthetic marijuana to call 911 or go to an emergency room."

79,"[""LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May survived a confidence vote from her Conservative party on Wednesday, but more than a third of her lawmakers said she was no longer the right leader to implement Britain’s exit from the European Union. \n \n Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May speaks at Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons, London, Britain, December 12, 2018. Parliament TV handout via REUTERS \n \n Britain’s March 29 exit has been plunged into crisis by parliamentary opposition to the divorce deal she struck with the EU last month, which has opened up possibilities including a delay to Brexit or even another referendum on membership. \n \n May on Monday cancelled a parliamentary vote on her Brexit deal, designed to maintain close future ties with the bloc and agreed after two years of negotiations, after it became clear she would lose it badly. \n \n Eurosceptic critics of the deal within her own party triggered a no-confidence vote in her leadership hours after she returned from talks with European leaders aimed at winning additional assurances about her deal. \n \n After two hours of voting in Committee Room 14 in the House of Commons, Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee of Conservative backbenchers, said 200 Conservative lawmakers had voted in support of May as leader, and 117 against, indicating her party was bitterly divided over the direction of Brexit. \n \n Supporters said the result showed the party should now get behind her. But the hardline Brexit supporters who triggered the vote because they saw her deal as a betrayal of the 2016 referendum said she should now quit. \n \n “It is a terrible result for the prime minister,” Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of a hard Brexit faction in the party, told BBC Television. “The prime minister must realise that, under all constitutional norms, she ought to go and see the queen urgently and resign.” \n \n But May loyalist Chris Grayling, her transport minister, said the party had endorsed her “comfortably”. \n \n ENDANGERING BREXIT? \n \n May, who voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum, had warned opponents of her withdrawal deal - struck after two years of negotiations - that if they toppled her, Brexit would be delayed or stopped. \n \n Shortly before the vote, May sought to win over wavering lawmakers by promising to step down before the 2022 election. \n \n Brexit is Britain’s most significant political and economic decision since World War Two. Pro-Europeans fear the departure will weaken the West as it grapples with the U.S. presidency of Donald Trump and growing assertiveness from Russia and China. \n \n The outcome will shape Britain’s $2.8 trillion economy, have far-reaching consequences for the unity of the kingdom and determine whether London keeps its place as one of the top two global financial centres. \n \n Supporters of Brexit admit there may be some short-term pain for Britain’s $2.9 trillion economy, but say it will prosper in the long term when cut free from the EU, which they cast as a failing German-dominated experiment in European integration. \n \n May, 62, won the top job in the turmoil that followed the 2016 EU referendum, where Britons decided by 52 percent to 48 to leave the EU. She promised to implement Brexit while keeping close ties to the bloc, to heal a divided nation. \n \n Sterling jumped as high as $1.2672 GBP=D3 as the result came in but then fell to $1.2605, still up 1 percent on the day, after it emerged that the number of lawmakers who had voted against May was higher than many in the markets had expected."", '19:29 \n \n What about the ‘meaningful vote’? \n \n The result clearly highlights May’s essential Brexit problem. The number of rebels at 117 is eyecatchingly similar to the 100 or so MPs who were planning to vote against her Brexit deal before she postponed the vote a day before its scheduled date of Tuesday. \n \n It is a blocking minority preventing the current deal, or anything like it, from being ratified by parliament. To win round that amount of rebels, May has to make dramatic progress in her talks with Brussels and persuade the right of her party that she can “bin the backstop”. \n \n However, the European Union has made it repeatedly clear that the legally binding 585-page withdrawal agreement – which contains the Northern Irish backstop – is not up for renegotiation. And without renegotiation, the backstop will endure and Tory rebels will almost certainly not vote for it. \n \n No 10 has promised that the vote will happen before 21 January, which in negotiating terms is very little time at all. So the Brexit fundamentals at Westminster remain, for now, unchanged.', 'LUENEBURG, Germany — One of the last remaining survivors of Auschwitz confronted the death camp\'s so-called accountant on Wednesday, saying her forgiveness of Nazi crimes did not absolve the perpetrators from taking responsibility. \n \n As a 10-year-old, Eva Kor became prisoner A-7063 at Auschwitz — torn from her family and subjected to horrific medical experiments at the hands of Dr. Josef Mengele, the Nazis\' so-called Angel of Death. \n \n On Wednesday, the now 81-year-old was in court for the trial of 93-year-old Oskar Groening — charged as an accessory to the murder of 300,000 people at Auschwitz. \n \n ""Did you know Josef Mengele?"" the Hungarian native asked a fragile Groening. ""Did you hear about his experiments?"" \n \n Kor took the stand as the grandson of Auschwitz commandant Rudolf Hoess looked on.

""Too bad she\'s so young,"" she recalled him saying.

There were two doctors at the head of the lines of disembarking Jews who decided who was fit for work or not, Groening testified. \n \n Those on board the trains ""hadn\'t a clue"" what was about to happen to them, Groening added. \n \n The charges against Groening relate to the period between May and July 1944 when 137 trains carrying roughly 425,000 Jews from Hungary arrived in Auschwitz. \n \n At least 300,000 of them were sent straight to the gas chambers, the indictment says.

Tens of thousands of ethnic Croats were displaced, and about 260 Croat men were detained and killed. \n \n Four years later, the Croatian military\'s Operation Storm bombarded the majority ethnic-Serb Krajina area, forcing about 200,000 people from their homes. \n \n Speaking in court on Tuesday, Judge Peter Tomka dismissed both the Croatian claim and the Serbian counter-claim. \n \n Forces on both sides had carried out violent acts during the war, Judge Tomka said. However, neither side had provided sufficient evidence to demonstrate the ""specific intent required for acts of genocide"". \n \n The court\'s ruling was posted online. \n \n Analysis: Guy Delauney, BBC Belgrade \n \n The International Court of Justice has delivered the result that most people here were expecting, with both genocide suits dismissed in their entirety.

Later, he added, “We’ve only had six tornado warnings.” Although there were laughs all around, would Bergeron panic if he woke up Monday morning for the actual show and saw a gray sky? \n \n [D.C.-area forecast: Rain likely for the Fourth, but not necessarily a total washout all day and evening] \n \n Tom Bergeron, host of “A Capitol Fourth.” (Capital Concerts) \n \n “Oh, no,” he told us backstage.

There certainly could, and it will be about border security, of which the wall is a part,"" the president told reporters Thursday, per Reuters, which notes Democrats, who just gained control of the House in the midterms, may now be less amenable to giving in to Trump on this matter.

(Associated Press) \n \n The State Employees\' Retirement System notified Sandusky by letter that his crimes triggered forfeiture of his pension. The former Penn State assistant football coach was sentenced Tuesday to at least 30 years in prison for molesting 10 boys. \n \n The retirement system told Sandusky he will no longer receive his $4,908 monthly annuity and informed his wife, Dottie, she is no longer entitled to a survivor\'s benefit. \n \n Sandusky\'s lawyer, Karl Rominger, contended the agency has no legal grounds for revoking the pension and said Sandusky will fight any attempt to do so. \n \n ""It\'s my inclination to believe that they are just going through the motions to try to throw some red meat to the public, but they know they are going to lose,"" Rominger said. \n \n Pennsylvania\'s pension forfeiture law, originally passed in 1978, primarily applies to public employees convicted of a financial crime related to the office ""or when his public employment places him in a position to commit the crime."" \n \n Since 2004, it has also applied to any public school employee convicted of a sex crime against a student. \n \n In its letter to Sandusky, the retirement system said it had determined that two of the criminal charges of which Sandusky was convicted _ involuntary deviate sexual intercourse and indecent assault _ fell under the forfeiture law. \n \n It also said Sandusky maintained extensive ties to Penn State after his 1999 retirement, qualifying him as a ""de facto"" employee subject to forfeiture for crimes committed even when he was no longer on the university\'s payroll. \n \n SERS\' letter to Sandusky was released to The Associated Press in response to an open-records request. \n \n Rominger argued in part that since Sandusky wasn\'t convicted of molesting a Penn State student, the forfeiture law does not apply to him. Sandusky\'s young victims came to him through The Second Mile, his charity for troubled youth. \n \n ""It did not involve students where he worked, and that\'s going to be the crux,"" Rominger said. \n \n But Philadelphia attorney Alaine Williams, an expert on public employee labor law, said courts have broadly construed the forfeiture law. \n \n ""I think he\'s got a very serious problem,"" she said ahead of the retirement system\'s announcement. \n \n Sandusky entered the State Employees\' Retirement System when he began working as a Penn State football coach in 1969. He collected a $148,000 lump sum payment when he retired from the university in 1999, and began receiving a monthly annuity, according to records provided by SERS. Sandusky received a total of $900,000 in pension payments between 1999 and September 2012. \n \n The forfeiture statute permits an employee to keep his or her contributions without interest, minus any fees or restitution association with the employee\'s conviction.

Sandusky pointed out that the boys came from unstable homes. ""Nobody mentioned the impact of abandonment, neglect, abuse, insecurity, and conflicting messages that the biological parents might have had in this,"" he wrote. The couple, echoing a recording Sandusky made before sentencing, blamed his downfall on a vast conspiracy involving police and the media. In one letter, Dottie describes the couple's adopted son, Matt, who accuses Sandusky of molesting him, as a liar and a thief, the Philadelphia Inquirer reports. A spokesman for the state attorney general's office describes Sandusky's behavior as ""banal, self-delusional, completely untethered from reality.

As in most other winter sports, the South is much stronger than the North. \n \n “Our players were really nervous,” Sarah Murray, South Korean women’s hockey head coach, told Reuters last month during the team’s training swing through the United States. \n \n “We can only take 23 players to the Olympics, and they thought these North Koreans are going to come in and take our spots”, Murray said. \n \n Chun, the South’s lead delegate, said the decision on a united ice hockey team is not yet finalised, as it requires the consent of the IOC and related international body. \n \n “We’re well aware of the people’s concerns and interests about this”, he told a news conference. \n \n “But I would like you to see the other side that it could make a positive contribution to peace of the Korean Peninsula and improving inter-Korean relations”. \n \n On Tuesday, the North said a 140-person orchestra would perform in South Korea during the Games. Pyongyang is also planning to send a large delegation in addition to the athletes and orchestra. \n \n Paik Hak-soon, the director of the Center for North Korean studies at Sejong Institute in South Korea, said North Korea was using the cheering squad to draw attention to its apparent cooperative spirit. \n \n “Seeing good results in competitions thanks to the cheering squad would enable the North Koreans to say they contributed to a successful Olympics and the South Korean government would likely agree,” said Paik. \n \n Slideshow (5 Images) \n \n “In the end, they are using this old tactic to get to Washington through Seoul.” \n \n Reclusive North Korea and the rich, democratic South are technically still at war because their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.

Ahead of the Olympics, skiers from both countries will also train together in North Korea, per CNN. The thawing of relations between the North and South has drawn praise from some. But others, like Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono, fear Kim Jong Un only hopes to ease international pressure while continuing to develop a nuclear weapons arsenal. ""It is not the time to ease pressure, or to reward North Korea,"" Kono said Tuesday in Vancouver, Canada, where 20 countries met and agreed to consider tougher sanctions on the North, per Reuters. Warning countries not to be fooled by its ""charm offensive,"" Kono added, ""The fact that North Korea is engaging in dialogue could be interpreted as proof that the sanctions are working."" China avoided the meeting, saying it showed a ""Cold War mentality."""
87,"['A longtime U.S. postal carrier was found dead in her mail truck in Woodland Hills on Friday afternoon amid blistering summer temperatures, authorities confirmed Monday. \n \n Peggy Frank, 63, of North Hills was found unresponsive while seated in a postal vehicle in the 4800 block of Calderon Road by a co-worker or bystander, said Ed Winter of the Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner-Coroner’s office. \n \n Paramedics attempted to revive her without success, Winter said. Frank was pronounced dead at 3:35 p.m. Friday. \n \n UPDATE: Federal investigators launch probe into Woodland Hills mail carrier’s death on 117-degree day \n \n Temperatures soared to 117 degrees in the Woodland Hills area on Friday, surpassing the record of 106 degrees for that day, July 6, that was set in 1976. (The National Weather Service has kept records there since 1949, according to Keily Delerme, a NWS meteorologist.) \n \n But Winter could not say Monday whether the heat was a factor in Frank’s death. \n \n While her autopsy had been completed, the cause of death was deferred pending additional tests, Winter said. She also had some type of medical history that Winter declined to specify until the final cause of death is determined. \n \n “We want to express our thoughts and prayers for the employee’s family at this difficult time,” said Evelina Ramirez, a spokesperson with the U.S. Postal Service. \n \n She noted that carriers deliver mail in “all kinds of weather, including high temperatures.” \n \n “Safety is our top priority for all of our employees,” Ramirez said. “The Postal Service strives to ensure that they have the tools and training to do so safely.” \n \n Carriers are reminded daily to stay hydrated, wear appropriate clothing, such as hats, and get into the shade whenever and as much as possible, she said. \n \n “The most important thing is to make sure they have water and ice for their entire route,” Ramirez said. \n \n Employees at the Woodland Hills Post Office remembered Frank, a dog lover who had some 28 years working at the post office, as always upbeat and positive despite her health challenges. \n \n “She was a sweetheart – always happy, even when she wasn’t feeling good,” said co-worker Cindy Pritchard. \n \n Frank had recently returned from medical leave, according to colleagues. \n \n Co-worker Joni Hogan Salvatore, who started working at the Woodland Hills Post Office before Frank, called her colleague “amazing” and “a very hard worker.” \n \n “None of us are 20 (years old) anymore; it’s a hard job,” Salvatore said. “It’s a super-hard job, but she always had something nice to say. Never was a complainer or anything. She was just a really good person.” \n \n Salvatore said that when it’s 100 degrees outside, it can be 10-15 degrees hotter inside the mail trucks, which do not have air conditioning. \n \n “They make us lock them and seal them for safety of the mail, but it’s horrible in there,” she said. \n \n The National Weather Service had issued an excessive heat warning on Friday for the region. \n \n A spokesman for the U.S. Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), which has jurisdiction over federal employees, could not be reached late Monday for comment. \n \n In the fall of 2014, an administrative law judge upheld a willful citation to a U.S. Postal Service station in Independence, Mo., by the federal OSHA after a mail carrier died in July 2012, according to media reports. \n \n The mail carrier had collapsed while working his route and died as a result of his exposure to excessive heat, according to an OSHA investigation. \n \n That investigation found that the Postal Service “did not have procedures in place to address worker concerns during times of excessive heat,” according to the administrative agency. A willful violation is one that is committed with intentional, knowing or voluntary disregard for the law’s requirements or with plain indifference to worker or safety health. \n \n The Postal Service was required to pay a penalty of $70,000 in that case, according to the news site Fox4KC.com. \n \n In October of 2016, OSHA cited the Postal Service after two Des Moines, Iowa, workers suffered heat-related illness while delivering mail that past summer. The agency found that the two mail carriers, one of whom was told to continue walking her route despite feeling ill, were exposed to excessive heat. \n \n RELATED STORY: Employees should ‘force breaks’ in extreme heat, top LA County health official says', 'Chris Cuomo told CNN colleague and SiriusXM radio host Michael Smerconish that he views the “fake news” label thrown at the media as the journalistic equivalent of the n-word. \n \n Cuomo spoke to a Democratic senator today who confirmed that Neil Gorsuch expressed his concern about President Trump‘s attacks on the judiciary.

The defense attorneys argued, among other things, that Mosby had influenced the jury pool by ""[adopting] and [encouraging] the public's cry of 'no justice, no peace'"" when she publicly announced the charges against the officers in May. Another complaint by the defense: Mosby's judgment was influenced by her husband serving as councilman for a local district that saw a ""disproportionate amount of violence"" in the days after Gray's death, the AP reports. Williams called that assertion ""condescending"" and said while he was ""troubled"" by some of Mosby's comments during her May 1 news conference, the defendants' right to a fair trial wasn't compromised by her statements, per the AP. The hearing is expected to continue this afternoon to determine whether the trial for the six officers should be split up.

""This is terrible, we are thinking of him and his family."" \n \n In a final essay on his website, Venner railed against France\'s adoption of a ""vile law"" legalising gay marriage and adoption. It finally became law on Saturday after months of bitter political protests from the right. \n \n Venner also denounced immigration from north Africa which, he said, was the real ""peril"", calling on activists to take measures to protect ""French and European identities"". \n \n In what appeared to be a reference to his suicide, Venner wrote: ""There will certainly need to be new, spectacular, symbolic gestures to shake off the sleepiness... and re-awaken the memories of our origins."" \n \n ""We are reaching a time when words must be backed up with acts,"" he added. \n \n Venner had a long career publishing right-wing essays, military histories and books on weaponry and hunting. \n \n He was a soldier during France\'s war in Algeria and was a member of the OAS (Secret Armed Organisation), a short-lived paramilitary group that opposed Algeria\'s independence from France. \n \n Venner\'s publisher, Pierre-Guillaume de Roux, said his next book due in June was titled ""A Western Samurai"". \n \n He said the writer\'s death had ""an extremely strong symbolic power that approximates (Yukio) Mishima,"" the radical right-wing Japanese author who committed ritual suicide in 1970. \n \n Mishima had likely been an inspiration for Venner\'s suicide, Gollnisch, a Japan expert, added. \n \n Mishima, considered one of modern Japan\'s most important authors, killed himself in a dramatic, samurai-style disembowelment at a Self Defense Force camp in Tokyo at age 45 in a political protest. \n \n Minutes before his suicide he addressed the troops, condemning the post-war pacifist constitution and lamenting the decadence of modern Japan.

Farrow was 7 when she said Allen sexually touched her, and a judge later found her claims credible, though Allen has continually denied the allegations, Vulture reports. Sorvino says she was aware of Farrow's claims when she made Mighty Aphrodite but dismissed them ""as an outgrowth of a twisted custody battle"" because of her lifelong love of Allen's work. ""It is difficult to sever ties and denounce your heroes, your benefactors, whom you fondly admired and felt a debt of gratitude toward for your entire career’s existence,"" she writes.

Tsai... (Associated Press) \n \n The Democratic Progressive Party\'s Tsai was poised to become the self-governing island\'s first female president in an election taking place amid concerns that the island\'s economy is under threat from China and broad opposition to Beijing\'s demands for political unification. \n \n Tsai had about 60 percent of votes while Nationalist Eric Chu had about 30 percent, with about half of votes counted. \n \n ""We failed. The Nationalist Party lost the elections. We didn\'t work hard enough,"" Chu said before a thin crowd of a few hundred supporters at his campaign headquarters. He followed his concession speech by making a long bow. \n \n ""As the Nationalist Party chairperson, I need to pay the highest level of responsibility. Dear all friends, Eric Chu apologizes to everyone. I\'m resigning as party chief,"" he said. \n \n Outgoing Nationalist President Ma Ying-jeou has served eight years and is constitutionally barred from another term. \n \n The outcome of the contest for a majority in the 113-seat legislature remained uncertain, with independents and smaller parties posing a threat to both the Nationalists and the DPP. \n \n ""Taiwan and China need to keep some distance,"" said Willie Yao, a computer engineer voting in Taipei who said he backed Tsai. ""The change of president would mean still letting Taiwanese make the decision."" \n \n Reflecting unease over a slowdown in Taiwan\'s once-mighty economy, undeclared voter Hsieh Lee-fung said providing opportunities to the next generation was the most important issue. \n \n ""Economic progress is related closely to our leadership, like land reform and housing prices. People aren\'t making enough money to afford homes,"" Hsieh said. \n \n A win for Tsai would introduce new uncertainty in the complicated relationship between Taiwan and mainland China, which claims the island as its own territory and threatens to use force if it declares formal independence. \n \n ""This is not about defeating the other party. This is about working to overcome the obstacles in Taiwan\'s path,"" Tsai told supporters in the rain at a final rally Friday night in front of the presidential office building in the center of the capital, Taipei. \n \n Tsai has pledged to maintain the status quo of de-facto independence for the island of 23 million, although she has refused to endorse the principle that Taiwan and China are parts of a single nation to be unified eventually. \n \n Beijing has made that its baseline for continuing negotiations that have produced a series of pacts on trade, transport and exchanges. Observers say China is likely to adopt a wait-and-see approach to Tsai\'s presidency, but might use diplomatic and economy pressure if she is seen as straying too far from its unification agenda. \n \n Taiwan was a Japanese colony from 1885 to 1945 and split again from China amid civil war in 1949. \n \n Chu was a late entry in the race after the party ditched its original candidate, Hung Hsiu-chu, whose abrasive style was seen as alienating voters. \n \n China has largely declined to comment on the polls, although its chief official for Taiwan affairs this month warned of potential major challenges in the relationship in the year ahead. \n \n Tsai supporters appeared confident that ties with China would weather a change in government. \n \n ""As long as Tsai doesn\'t provoke the other side, it\'s OK,"" said former newspaper distribution agent Lenex Chang, who attended Tsai\'s rally.

Basically, they\'ve voted to keep Beijing at a distance. \n \n This reflects not only widespread dissatisfaction with President Ma Ying-jeou of the KMT over insufficient measures to improve the lacklustre economy, low wages and widening wealth gap - it also reflects growing worries by Taiwanese people that the island may become too economically dependent on China and that this will make it hard for Taiwan to fend off pressures by Beijing to reunify with it one day. \n \n The message voters have sent Beijing is that, while they want reduced tensions and good relations, they cherish Taiwan\'s sovereignty, democracy and self-rule even more. \n \n The challenge now is for Ms Tsai to find a way to work with China, the island\'s biggest export market, trade partner and security threat. \n \n Ms Tsai, a former scholar, has said she wants to ""maintain [the] status quo"" with China. \n \n She became chairwoman of the DPP in 2008, after it saw a string of corruption scandals. \n \n She lost a presidential bid in 2012 but has subsequently led the party to regional election victories. She has won increased support from the public partly because of widespread dissatisfaction over the KMT and President Ma Ying-jeou\'s handling of the economy and widening wealth gap. \n \n Image copyright AP Image caption Eric Chu\'s loss shows the KMT has lost a nearly 70-year monopoly on power \n \n Saturday\'s polls come after a historic meeting between President Ma and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Singapore in November for talks that were seen as largely symbolic - the first in more than 60 years. \n \n Eric Chu, 54, is the mayor of New Taipei City and stepped up to become chairman of the party in October. \n \n The KMT has lost its majority in the legislature for the first time in history. \n \n The former accounting professor was seen as popular with young people in the party, but had been unable to change public opinion that is increasingly unhappy with the party\'s friendly stance towards China and the island\'s economic travails. \n \n In 2014, hundreds of students occupied the parliament in the largest show of anti-China sentiment on the island for years. Labelled the Sunflower Movement, protesters demanded more transparency in trade pacts negotiated with China. \n \n Taiwan for all practical purposes been independent since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949, when the defeated Nationalist government fled to the island as the Communists, under Mao Zedong, swept to power.']",2,"– Tsai Ing-wen promised a ""new era"" for Taiwan on Saturday after being elected as the island's first female president. The 59-year-old, from the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party, defeated the Nationalist Party's Eric Chu with around 60% of the vote, reports the Los Angeles Times. Tsai will take office in May. Nationalist President Ma Ying-jeou has already served two terms and Taiwan's constitution didn't allow him to seek a third, the AP notes. ""We failed. The Nationalist Party lost the elections. We didn't work hard enough,"" Chu told supporters at party headquarters, announcing his resignation as party chief. The election marks what the BBC calls a ""turning point in Taiwan's democracy and relationship with China,"" which still officially considers the island to be a renegade province. ""I am very happy. I feel I have finally accomplished something for Taiwan, so that Taiwan will have great autonomy instead of just following China,"" a 32-year-old engineer who voted for Tsai tells the LAT. Tsai has said she favors maintaining the status quo, though her refusal to support the principle of reunification between China and Taiwan makes it uncertain whether the closer ties with Beijing that Ma introduced will continue, reports the AP."

Experts say that rather than being one disease, clinical depression is a collection of different disorders with one common symptom – that of low mood. Over the next five years, scientists will study individual groups of people who have known depression risk factors such as a family history of low mood, early life problems such as being born underweight or psychological trauma in childhood. Participants will asked to complete new questionnaires on their mental health and resilience. A subset will also be invited to attend a new clinic visit in Aberdeen or edinburgh, which will include MRI brain imaging. By studying groupings of people both with and without depression in this way they hope to be able to identify its causes and mechanisms , which can be used in the quest for diagnostic tests and new therapies.

According to financial records reviewed by the New York Times and NBC News, a company linked to a Russian oligarch targeted by US sanctions deposited around $500,000 into an account controlled by Essential Consultants, the shell company Cohen used to pay hush money to Daniels before the 2016 election. Michael Avenatti alleges that funds from oligarch Viktor Vekselberg may have ""replenished the account"" in a series of payments in 2017 after the Daniels settlement, though Columbus Nova, a US affiliate of a Vekselberg company, denies that he was involved in its payments to Trump's personal lawyer, the Washington Post reports. The purpose of the company's payments is unclear. Sources tell CNN that Robert Mueller's investigators have already quizzed Vekselberg about the payments to Cohen's company. Records reviewed by the Times show that around $4.4 million flowed through the Essential Consultants account between its creation weeks before the 2016 election and January this year, including hundreds of thousands of dollars from pharmaceutical firm Novartis, AT&T, and Korea Aerospace. AT&T confirmed the payments late Tuesday, saying Cohen's firm was among those it ""engaged in early 2017 to provide insights into understanding the new administration,"" the AP reports.

93,"['LAPORTE, Ind. (WOOD) — A man convicted of four 1993 murders who escaped Sunday from a state prison outside of Ionia was captured in Indiana Monday evening. \n \n Michael David Elliot, 40, was arrested in Kankakee Township in rural LaPorte County, Ind., and allegedly stole a total of four vehicles in his 24-hour run from the law. He was arraigned Tuesday in Indiana on auto theft charges. \n \n The sheriff’s department had been looking for a black 2002 Chevrolet Monte Carlo that was stolen from the area of Boyd Avenue and E. Lincolnway in LaPorte, authorities said. Deputy Jeffrey Wright said the vehicle’s engine was on so it would warm up when it was taken. The sheriff’s department was alerted to the theft at 6:16 p.m. ET, according to a Monday night news release. \n \n Within minutes of learning of the theft, Deputy Slawek Czupryna spotted the stolen vehicle headed south on Boyd Boulevard in LaPorte. He attempted a traffic stop, but the driver didn’t pull over. Instead, the driver fled, leading deputies on a short chase. \n \n Stop Sticks were deployed just before 6:30 p.m., the sheriff’s office said. \n \n “He ran over a couple of sets of Stop Sticks that some of our sergeants had laid out, so his tires were going flat. He lost control of the vehicle and slid into a snowbank,” Deputy Wright told 24 Hour News 8. \n \n That snowbank was at the T-intersection of N 250 E between East Division and E 150 N in Kankakee Township, east of LaPorte. \n \n Elliot then tried to climb out of the car’s window, Wright said. Deputies Czupryna and Wright each grabbed one of Elliot’s shoulders, pulled him from the car, laid him on the ground and handcuffed him. No one was hurt. \n \n When asked what his name was, Elliot answered truthfully, Wright said. He said he asked Elliot if he was “‘the Michael Elliot,” and Elliot confirmed he was the escapee. Wright said he was surprised that Elliot didn’t lie about his identity. \n \n Wright then put Elliot into the back of his cruiser and took him to the LaPorte County Jail. Elliot is being held without bond on felony car theft and resisting charges. \n \n Wright described Elliot was polite to officers, and quiet and emotionless during the ride to jail. Elliot looked tired, Wright said, like he had not slept in days. Wright said Elliot was wearing jeans that were too big and “a couple of jackets.” \n \n Wright said authorities didn’t know Elliot would be in their area — there was more concern he may be in the Shipshewana area — and that he did not expect the man he was chasing to be Elliot. Wright said he was relieved that he and Czupryna were able to get Elliot off the streets and bring worried citizens some peace of mind. \n \n In a Monday night news release, Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder thanked the law enforcement agencies that aided in the search and capture of Elliot. “The swift apprehension of this dangerous criminal is a credit to law enforcement and corrections officials in Michigan and Indiana, and our partners with the U.S. Marshals Service. Their courage, diligence and professionalism reminds us how fortunate we are to have such men and women who are willing to keep our communities safe. …Now that we are assured the public is safe, we will turn our attention to thoroughly reviewing the situation that led to the prisoner’s escape. We will demand an exhaustive assessment of the incident and take whatever appropriate action is needed to prevent future incidents.” \n \n Elliot escaped around 7 p.m. Sunday from the Ionia Correctional Facility, but jail workers didn’t notice he was missing until a routine prisoner check at 9 p.m. \n \n Authorities said Elliot left through the sally port, a secured garage where prisoners are brought into the facility. Elliot then got through a hole in the fencing system which, according to a former corrections officer, is made up of two 12-foot high, razor wire-topped fencing sections with a smaller, electrified fence in between them. \n \n He then made a three-and-a-half mile trek into Ionia where he carjacked a woman, police said. The two then drove to the Elkhart, Ind. area. The woman escaped at a gas station there and he fled in her Jeep Liberty. That SUV was found early Monday morning in Shipshewana, Ind. \n \n LaPorte County, where Elliot was arrested, is west of Shipshewana. \n \n Elliot was serving five life sentences in the Ionia Correctional Facility after being convicted of four 1993 murders. \n \n In the early morning of Aug. 8, 1993, according to court documents, Elliot broke into a home in Bentley Township, north of Midland, killed four people then set the house on fire. Vickie Currie, her boyfriend Michael Tufnell, his cousin Bruce Squires Tufnell Jr. and fiancee Cathy Lave were killed. \n \n Charles and Paul Treece, and Tammy LaCross were with Elliot when the murders were committed. Charles Treece was also convicted of four counts of first-degree murder, armed robbery and setting a house on fire, and possession of a firearm during the commission of a firearm. He is also serving life in prison at the Alger Correctional Facility in Munising in the Upper Peninsula. \n \n LaCross, who was 16 at the time and is victim Vickie Currie’s daughter, and Paul Treece both testified against Elliot. Under the terms of plea agreements, they pleaded guilty to robbery and felony firearm charges. \n \n In 2005, Elliot filed a motion for release, saying that there was new evidence in his case — namely a 1994 letter from Charles Treece that attested to Elliot’s innocence. A state court denied his request. \n \n Elliot maintains he is innocent, according to the court documents. \n \n —– \n \n Inside woodtv.com: \n \n Michael Elliot escapes from Ionia Correctional Facility \n \n Former guard: Elliot’s escape a ‘mystery’ \n \n ‘Thorough’ investigation of escape promised \n \n Son ‘proud’ of Elliot’s carjack victim for staying calm \n \n Victim’s mother worried Elliot would kill again \n \n Life as a Level II prison inmate \n \n Share this: Email \n \n Print \n \n Facebook \n \n Twitter \n \n Google \n \n Pinterest \n \n More \n \n LinkedIn \n \n Tumblr \n \n \n \n Reddit', 'More Video... \n \n A source close to the investigation tells NewsCenter 16 convicted murderer Michael Elliot was arrested in LaPorte County after a chase Monday night. \n \n The manhunt for 40-year- old Elliot started Sunday night, after he escaped from Ionia Correctional Facility in Michigan. \n \n Elliot was convicted of four murders in 1993 and is serving five life sentences. \n \n Michigan Department of Corrections Director Dan Heyns says officers realized Elliot was gone during a routine count at about 9 p.m. Sunday. After looking at surveillance tapes, they realized he escaped somewhere between 6 p.m. and 7 p.m. \n \n Heyns says during the time of the escape, Elliot was dressed in a white kitchen uniform. It is unknown at this time how he got that uniform. Heyns says Elliot was not assigned to the kitchen. \n \n They believe it was the color of that uniform that had something to do with his ability to get by multiple security cameras and interior and perimeter fencing. \n \n After escaping, Elliot carjacked a woman using a box cutter. He held her hostage during the more than 100-mile drive to Elkhart County. \n \n They stopped for gas around 11 p.m. at a Marathon gas station near the intersection of SR 13 and CR 2, near Middlebury. The woman escaped Elliot at the station by asking for a cup for water, then locking herself in the bathroom and calling 911. \n \n Elliot fled in the victim\'s car before police arrived. \n \n Indiana State Police say the red Jeep Liberty he fled in was found in the 400 block of North State Street in Shipshewana Monday afternoon. A woman living in the neighborhood noticed the car matched the description of one given on the news, so she called police around 12:15 p.m. But, police say the car was seen in the area as early as 5:30 a.m. \n \n ""You can go a lot of places in seven hours,"" said Sgt. Ron Galaviz with the Indiana State Police. ""Especially if you have a mode of transportation. And, I\'m not suggesting he does. But, again, we\'re looking for stolen vehicle reports or anything of that nature to help follow up on, to help us pursue on that trail."" \n \n Police went door-to-door looking for any signs of Elliot in Shipshewana. Westview Schools were notified of the situation and placed on lock down. Students were later dismissed, with a heavy police presence on site to ensure their safety. Police say all students were accounted for and the schools were thoroughly searched. \n \n Indiana State Police say after searching the community, their hunt for Elliot in Shipshewana has been suspended and they have no new leads. They don\'t know if he is still in Michiana or has traveled elsewhere since abandoning the Jeep. \n \n ""What we\'re asking the public to do is to remain vigilant,"" Galaviz said. ""If you see something, say something. If something appears out of order, if a door seems unlocked, if a window is broken, don\'t investigate it. Call 911."" \n \n \\NBC affiliate WSMV in Nashville says early Monday morning, a woman thought she spotted Elliot at a Tennessee gas station. But, police say it was a false identification. Elliot has family in Tennessee. \n \n He is described as a 5\'8, 165-pound white male with brown hair and eyes. Elliot was wearing a blue and orange state prison uniform when he escaped, but he was last seen in black pants, a white t-shirt, white tennis shoes and a white beanie cap. \n \n Elliot should be considered armed and dangerous. Anyone who comes in contact with him, should contact law enforcement immediately. \n \n According to Grand Rapids-based WOOD-TV, Elliot was serving five life sentences for four murders and an armed robbery. He was convicted in 1993. He was also serving 13 years for setting a house on fire and two years for using a firearm during the commission of a felony.']",2,"– A convicted killer who escaped from a Michigan prison yesterday and carjacked a woman has been arrested after a car chase in rural LaPorte Country, Indiana, WNDU reports.

A woman spotted the car and called police, who said the vehicle had been seen in the area as early as 5:30am. Knowing Elliot ""can go a lot of places in seven hours,"" police went door-to-door and had schools locked down before releasing students under a heavy police presence. Then a call about a stolen vehicle came in to the LaPorte County Sheriff's Office, and a deputy saw the vehicle and attempted a traffic stop, WOOD-TV reports.

But the scale of the problems in Iraq and Afghanistan also reflects the toxic interplay of huge sums of money pumped into relatively small economies and an unprecedented reliance on contractors,"" the report said. \n \n Sen. James Webb, D-Virginia, who helped establish the commission three years ago, said Friday that its latest proposals deserve attention from Congress and the Department of Defense and called for a hearing on the matter. \n \n ""The report\'s specific recommendations to address the federal government\'s overreliance on contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan and failure to control the process underscore the importance of the Commission\'s charter,"" Webb said in a prepared statement. \n \n The report repeatedly criticized the federal government for turning to contractors for too many purposes, including monitoring other contractors. \n \n ""The government has abdicated its contracting responsibilities -- too often using contractors as the default mechanism, driven by considerations other than whether they provide the best solution, and without consideration for the resources needed to manage them,"" the report said. \n \n The commission is calling for major reforms to how the government awards and monitors contractors on military, reconstruction and training programs. \n \n ""When it comes to oversight of contingency contracting, we\'ve been driving beyond the reach of our headlights,"" Commission Co-Chairman Michael Thibault said in a statement released with the report. ""Reforms are badly needed."" \n \n The report says that contractors often face great risks. ""Between September 2001 and December 2010, over 2,200 contractor employees of all nationalities have died and over 49,800 were injured in Iraq and Afghanistan,"" the report says. ""These contractors\' deaths and injuries should not be ignored, but should be a part of the public debate on the cost of war."" \n \n Among the proposals to rein in contractors is the creation of special teams of full-time federal workers to be ready to deploy and monitor projects.

According to a new report by the non-partisan Commission on Wartime Contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan, tens of billions of those dollars have been wasted.The report\'s authors note that the ""waste, fraud, and abuse"" they have observed in these contract programs were caused by significant errors.

The judgment gave both sides an opportunity to claim victory. \n \n The EU court decision will help guide a U.K. tribunal handling a clash between Cadbury, the U.K.’s biggest chocolate maker, and Nestle over the Swiss company’s 2010 application to trademark the four-fingered chocolate bar, which brought in 40 million pounds ($61.7 million) a year between 2008 and 2010 in the U.K. Cadbury separately is fighting an EU trademark Nestle got for the shape of its chocolate bar in 2006 in a case that’s been pending in a lower EU court since 2013. Any decision will determine whether or not the trademark is valid. \n \n The KitKat was first sold in Britain in 1935 by Rowntree & Co., with the shape changing very little since then. Nestle, the world’s biggest food company, bought Rowntree Plc in 1998. \n \n The U.K. Trade Marks Registry turned down the application to protect the shape of the chocolate bar in the U.K. in 2013 following the opposition from Cadbury. \n \n The EU court Wednesday said trademark protection can’t be given if a shape “contains three essential features, one of which results from the nature of the goods themselves and two of which are necessary to obtain a technical result.” \n \n Vevey, Switzerland-based Nestle said it was “pleased with the decision” and “now looks forward to the decision of the U.K. High Court.” Mondelez International Inc., which owns Cadbury, said in an e-mailed statement that the court’s ruling “is in line with our contention that the shape of the KitKat bar is not distinctive enough to be protected as a trademark.” \n \n Nestle won a U.K. Court of Appeal ruling in October 2013 blocking Cadbury from obtaining a trademark for the color purple it uses to package its milk chocolate. \n \n The case is: C-215/14, Societe de Produits Nestle SA v. Cadbury UK Ltd.']",2,"– It started with a candy wrapper and ended (for now) in a courtroom. Nestle's attempts to trademark the shape of its ""four-fingered"" KitKat have been rejected by the European Court of Justice, which ruled that shape alone isn't enough to recognize it as a KitKat, the BBC reports. The decision was a setback for Nestle—which manages the brand overseas; Hershey is licensed to sell the brand here in the US—and a victory for Cadbury, which was trying to block the trademark. The ruling means that, for now, other candy companies can make similar-looking chocolate bars. Nestle, which reaped more than $60 million a year from 2008 to 2010 in the UK from KitKat, argued that the four-fingered design has become inextricably associated with the KitKat brand over the past eight decades, Bloomberg notes. But Cadbury said the shape wasn't enough to make a consumer automatically think ""KitKat,"" and the court agreed. The BBC even notes that in Norway, a lesser-known chocolate bar called Kvikk Lunsj (""quick lunch"") has been around for nearly as long as KitKat. The fight between the two confectionary giants is the second major brouhaha they've had in recent years: In 2013, Nestle managed to block Cadbury's attempts to trademark its signature purple-colored chocolate wrappers, per Bloomberg. KitKat case now heads back to the UK High Court, which will render a final decision. (Claims of excess lead in Nestle noodles led to a major recall in India.)"

99,"['PAHOA, Hawaii (Reuters) - Residents on the Big Island of Hawaii were alerted on Thursday to rising levels of toxic gas from lava-oozing fissures, and geologists warned that new areas east of the erupting Kilauea volcano may be at risk of molten rock bursting from the ground. \n \n Hawaii County authorities sent a text message to residents of the southeast corner of the island warning them of a wind change that would bring rising levels of sulfur dioxide gas, which can be fatal if inhaled in large quantities. \n \n “It’s just horrible. You can’t breathe in there,” said evacuated resident Robynn Stagg, 58, who drove through the thick, orange sulfur dioxide haze earlier this week in a failed attempt to check on her home. \n \n Hawaii’s governor has warned that mass evacuations may be required as more fissures open in the ground and spew lava and gas into semi-rural residential areas on the east flank of Kilauea, one of the world’s most active volcanoes. \n \n During an evening meeting with community members, an official with the United States Geological Survey’s Hawaii Volcano Observatory said that while no new fissures have opened during the last 24 hours, there has been “quite a bit” of ground cracking over the last day and that they were releasing steam. \n \n “Because the lava intrusion is still active and earthquakes are still occurring, we still think there’s a decent chance of new eruptive activity at the surface,” Steven Brantley said. \n \n Authorities on Thursday completed the removal of highly flammable chemicals from a nearby geothermal power plant that was in the path of creeping lava. \n \n The latest upheaval at Kilauea began last week after the crater floor of a long-active side vent collapsed suddenly in a cloud of ash, triggering a similar plunge in the molten lake inside the larger crater at the volcano’s summit. \n \n What followed was a flurry of earthquakes as huge volumes of magma — the term for lava beneath the surface — drained back through deep-underground passages that carried the molten rock far downslope. The lava then forced its way back to the surface through large cracks, or fissures, that opened at ground level in a residential area miles (km) away. \n \n (GRAPHIC: Scorched earth - tmsnrt.rs/2IldVyS) \n \n ‘BALLISTIC BLOCKS’ \n \n Geologists said Kilauea may be entering a new phase of explosive eruptions not seen in nearly a century that could hurl “ballistic blocks” weighing up to 12 tons for half a mile (800 meters), and rain pebble-sized fragments for another mile or two (1.8 to 3.2 km). \n \n Deposits are seen on a road in Puna, Hawaii.

Big Island residents have been warned that a change in the wind is expected to increase the risk of vog, which contains potentially deadly sulfur dioxide gas, Reuters reports. Gov. David Ige has warned that more mass evacuations will be needed as new cracks in the ground send lava and toxic gas into new neighborhoods near the volcano. Ige has asked President Trump to declare a disaster in the state so that federal money can be used in the event of large-scale evacuations by air and sea, the AP reports. Forecasters say Big Island residents are likely to face higher levels of sulfur dioxide Friday, which is especially dangerous for children, the elderly, and those with respiratory conditions, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Trade winds are expected to ease conditions by Saturday morning. Amid fears that the volcano, one of the world's most active, could erupt explosively, flammable pentane has been removed from a geothermal plant near two neighborhoods that had to be evacuated because of lava and gas. Kilauea is surrounded by Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, which closed Thursday night until further notice. Scientists had warned that if the volcano erupts, park visitors within a mile or so of the crater were at risk of being hit by refrigerator-sized boulders."

Experts say the lone star tick appears to be spreading from its home base in the southeastern US. Whereas other ticks can spread ailments such as Lyme disease, the lone star tick is bothersome because it is believed to trigger a potentially life-threatening and apparently lifelong meat allergy with its bite. The tick doesn't technically make people allergic to meat, but rather to a sugar molecule found in red meat known as alpha-gal. This alpha-gal allergy has typically been limited to the southeastern US, where the lone star tick is prevalent, but no more, reports Wired. Cases—in which the consumption of meat can result in hives, difficulty breathing, or death—have been reported in Minnesota, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and New York, per Inverse. Long Island has seen at least 100 cases in the last year. Researchers suspect the spread of the allergy coincides with the spread of lone star ticks, though it's also possible that other ticks are responsible. Either way, ""the nuisance level [for lone star ticks] is much higher than the black-legged tick,"" an expert tells the Weston Forum. ""It is aggressive and very abundant."" Researchers are currently studying the effect of a lone star tick bite on mice to determine why it triggers the allergy. (A toddler died after a tick bite.)"

Inventors have the chance of winning $30,000, and have until Dec. 20 to submit their best “space poop” ideas. \n \n “I can tell you that space flight is not always glamorous,” said astronaut Rick Mastracchio, a veteran of Space Shuttle Soyuz, and Space Station missions speaking in a video promoting NASA’s call to action. “People need to go to the bathroom even in a spacecraft.” \n \n During spaceflight astronauts can be in their suits for more than 10 hours at a time. But with NASA planning on sending humans deeper into space, future missions will require the advancement of new technology to keep the astronauts alive and well. \n \n Currently, crews wear an absorbent diaper but these would not be suitable for flights longer than a day, according to a description on the contest’s website HeroX. While it goes without saying that nobody in their right mind would want to wear a diaper for a week, the issue is more than a matter of squeamishness, it’s a matter of life or death. \n \n Mastracchio said it is vital that the waste needs to be treated otherwise it could harm or even kill the astronaut. “Given enough time, infection, and even sepsis can set in. This is the problem we are asking you to help us with.” \n \n NASA said it aims to test the winning ideas in the next year and roll out successful systems in the next three.', 'NASA vowed to award up to three $30,000 prizes for the most promising in-suit waste management systems When you\'ve got to go, but you\'re out there in space, zipped up in a spacesuit, with no toilet in sight and a crew of other astronauts around, what do you do? \n \n NASA has launched a contest for inventors to solve this uncomfortable issue, and promises to award $30,000 to the best ""space poop"" solutions. \n \n Inventors have until December 20 to submit designs for a personalized waste-wicking system that will handle everything, hands-free, for a period of up to six days. \n \n ""The old standby solution consisted of diapers,"" said the description of contest details at www.herox.com/SpacePoop. \n \n ""However, the diaper is only a very temporary solution, and doesn\'t provide a healthy/protective option longer than one day."" \n \n Sometimes, astronauts have to wait even longer. The two men and one woman who packed themselves into a Russian Soyuz space capsule last week had to wait two full days between launching from Kazakhstan and arriving at the International Space Station. \n \n The Soyuz is equipped with a portable toilet, which looks like an air-powered pee jug. \n \n On future missions to deep space destinations like an asteroid or Mars, NASA suspects it could take up to 144 hours, or six days, to get to a proper toilet. \n \n In emergency situations, astronauts may need to zip themselves into a fully pressurized, bulky orange spacesuit, complete with helmet and gloves. \n \n ""While sealed, it is impossible for an astronaut to access their own body, even to scratch their nose,"" NASA said. \n \n That\'s where the inventors come in. Astronauts need some way to clear away urine, fecal matter and menstrual blood efficiently, or they risk infection. \n \n The problem is that in weightlessness, fluids can blob up and stick to surfaces, while solids float in the air. \n \n ""You don\'t want any of these solids and fluids stuck to your body for six days,"" NASA said, recalling how easy babies can get diaper rash. \n \n Currently, while at the International Space Station, astronauts use a toilet contraption that includes a vacuum and a tube to help evacuate fecal matter. \n \n To urinate, they use a funnel attached to a hose that can be adapted for a sitting or standing position, and uses air to move urine away. \n \n NASA vowed to award up to three $30,000 prizes for the most promising in-suit waste management systems. \n \n The goal is to test them within a year and fully implement them within three years. \n \n NASA says the first human missions to Mars could take place by the 2030s. \n \n Explore further: Soyuz capsule docks with International Space Station', 'These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

(Reuters) \n \n North Korea tried but failed to launch an intermediate-range missile Friday, American and South Korean military officials said, dealing the regime an embarrassing blow on the most important day of the year on the North Korean calendar. \n \n To mark the 104th anniversary of the birthday of the country’s ""eternal president,"" Kim Il Sung, North Korea launched a missile from its east coast at about 5:30 a.m. local time. But it deviated from a ""normal"" trajectory, an official from South Korea\'s Joint Chiefs of Staff told reporters in Seoul. \n \n “North Korea appears to have tried a missile launch from the East Sea [Sea of Japan] area early morning today, but it is presumed to have failed,” the official said. \n \n But South Korea\'s military is still on high alert. ""We are preparing against the possibility that the North could carry out heavyweight provocations at any time, including the fifth nuclear test,"" a military official said, according to the Yonhap News Agency. \n \n [North Korea unveils homemade engine for missile capable of striking U.S.] \n \n A U.S. defense official said that the U.S. Strategic Command systems had also “detected and tracked” the missile. “We assess that the launch failed,” he said. \n \n Initial analysis suggested that the missile was a Musudan, also known as a BM-25, the kind that South Korean authorities had detected being moved Thursday near Wonsan on North Korea’s east coast. \n \n The Musudan is an intermediate-range ballistic missile capable of traveling 1,500 to 2,500 miles — putting the U.S. territory of Guam within reach — and of carrying a 1.3-ton nuclear warhead, according to the Nuclear Threat Initiative. \n \n North Korea has displayed the Musudan at its military parades and is believed to have supplied assembly kits for the missile to Iran, but it had never tested this model of missile before. \n \n \n \n Jeffrey Lewis, head of the East Asia program at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies in California, said the failure would “reinforce the persistent denial” about North Korea’s capabilities. \n \n “But in fact, they will have learned a lot from this launch. Not as much as they would have learned if it had succeeded, but still something,” Lewis said. \n \n The Musudan uses the same sort of engine as the submarine-launched ballistic missile that North Korea tested last year but that also failed. \n \n “Clearly they have a problem, but maybe next time it will work. It took them a couple of launches to get the Taepodong-2 going,” Lewis said, referring to the ballistic-missile technology that has now put two North Korean satellites into orbit. \n \n At the same time, North Korea has been making a series of claims about technological advances, from building solid-fuel rocket engines to miniaturizing nuclear warheads. The regime recently claimed that it could send a \xadnuclear-tipped missile to the U.S. mainland. \n \n [North Korea claims it could wipe out Manhattan with a hydrogen bomb] \n \n Although this has not been proved, U.S. military officials and nonproliferation experts say that North Korea is clearly working toward this goal. The Musudan test could be part of this program. \n \n At a hearing of a Senate Armed Services subcommittee this week, Brian McKeon, a senior Pentagon official, said North Korea’s weapons and missile programs pose a growing threat to the United States and its allies in East Asia. \n \n North Korea is “seeking to develop longer-range ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons to the United States and continues efforts to bring [a road-mobile intercontinental ballistic missile] to operational capacity,” he said. \n \n Although an untested long-range missile was unlikely to be reliable, North Korea’s successful satellite launches showed it was mastering the technologies that would be needed, McKeon said. \n \n China’s official Xinhua News Agency said North Korea’s failed firing of a mid-range ballistic missile Friday was “the latest in a string of saber-rattling that, if unchecked, will lead the country to nowhere.” \n \n Since Kim Jong Un ordered his military to conduct a fourth nuclear test in January — which North Korea claimed was a hydrogen-bomb explosion, although outside experts are highly skeptical — there has been a steady stream of projectiles emanating from North Korea. \n \n 1 of 50 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × What life looks like inside North Korea View Photos Scenes from the hermit kingdom.

REUTERS/KCNA \n \n The U.S. Defense Department called the test of the road-mobile missile, which came as North Korea celebrated the birthday of Kim’s grandfather and North Korea’s founding father Kim Il Sung, a “fiery, catastrophic” failure. \n \n The test, on North Korea’s so-called “Day of the Sun,” followed its fourth nuclear test in January and a long-range rocket launch in February, which led to new U.N. sanctions that have failed to halt Pyongyang’s weapons programs. \n \n South Korean officials and international experts said the failed test heightened the possibility that North Korea would conduct a fifth nuclear test, possibly within weeks. \n \n The U.S.-based 38 North website, which specializes in North Korea, said there has been activity at the country’s nuclear site based on satellite imagery and on Wednesday said the possibility of a fifth nuclear test “could not be ruled out.” \n \n U.S. officials said the missile tested on Friday never got off the launch pad but further tests were expected. \n \n “We’re still assessing the specifics of it but I can tell you that it was a fiery, catastrophic attempt at a launch,” Pentagon spokesman Captain Jeff Davis told a briefing. “It was not successful.” \n \n Davis said the U.S. military thought the device was a road-mobile missile because the launch occurred at a coastal site where Pyongyang ordinarily does not test rockets. \n \n He said North Korea, which regularly threatens to destroy South Korea and the United States and often fires missiles during periods of tension, remained a security concern in spite of the failure. \n \n “We know that this is a capability that they are aiming towards,” he said. It’s ... a missile system that they’ve displayed on multiple occasions and that is why we have a ballistic missile defense system that we have invested in very heavily to be able to outpace that threat as that threat develops further.” \n \n CHINA ANGERED \n \n The White House strongly condemned the latest launch attempt and said Washington would work with China and other countries to put pressure on North Korea, which faced the prospect of further isolation. \n \n China, North Korea’s most important economic and diplomatic backer, has been angered by Pyongyang’s nuclear tests and rocket launches and has backed U.N. sanctions. \n \n “The firing of a mid-range ballistic missile on Friday by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), though failed, marks the latest in a string of saber-rattling that, if unchecked, will lead the country to nowhere,” China’s official Xinhua news agency said in an English language commentary. \n \n “... Nuclear weapons will not make Pyongyang safer. On the contrary, its costly military endeavors will keep on suffocating its economy.” \n \n Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said the U.N. Security Council was clear on North Korean rocket launches. \n \n “At present, the situation on the peninsula is complex and sensitive,” he told reporters. “We hope all parties can strictly respect the decisions of the Security Council and avoid taking any steps that could further worsen tensions.” \n \n In 2012, Kim Il Sung’s birthday was also marked by an attempted long-range rocket launch, which also failed. \n \n The missile was likely a Musudan, South Korea’s Yonhap news agency said, an intermediate-range ballistic missile with a design range of more than 3,000 km (1,800 miles) that can be fired from a road mobile launcher but which has never been flight-tested. \n \n Experts see North Korea’s Musudan test as part of an effort to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach the mainland United States. The Musudan theoretically could reach the U.S. Pacific island of Guam. \n \n North Korea is to hold a congress of its ruling Workers Party - the first such meeting in 36 years - in early May, at which Kim Jong Un is likely to trumpet his achievements in building up Pyongyang’s weapons prowess. \n \n South Korean officials and experts say he will be keen to go into that with a show of strength, not a failed rocket launch, making the possibility of another nuclear test more likely. \n \n North Korean leader Kim Jong Un watches the ballistic rocket launch drill of the Strategic Force of the Korean People's Army (KPA) at an unknown location, in this undated file photo released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) in Pyongyang on March 11, 2016.

He is awaiting trial on charges that he attacked and attempted to kill a woman in Fairfax City in 2005; authorities have said that they found Matthew’s DNA under one of the victim’s fingernails. \n \n Graham, a U-Va. sophomore who graduated from West Potomac High School, disappeared after a night out in Charlottesville on Sept. 12. Police said she had been socializing with friends earlier in the night but left the group with plans to meet up with them later. She never showed up and apparently became disoriented while walking through Charlottesville. \n \n Police said witnesses saw Matthew with his arm around Graham at a downtown mall about 1 a.m. Sept. 13, and surveillance video recordings show the two walking together. Witnesses also saw the two together outside a restaurant, the last reported sighting of Graham.""]",2,"– After four years of mapping our planet's gravity, the European Space Agency's GOCE satellite has plunged back to Earth. The GOCE—Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer—was last heard from 75 miles over Antarctica, Reuters reports. It is believed to have burned up on re-entry, with hundreds of pounds of surviving debris scattering somewhere in the Western Pacific. Its gradiometer, the instrument used to make gravity measurements, is made of materials tough enough to survive the fall to Earth, the BBC notes. GOCE—the planet's lowest-flying scientific satellite—mapped Earth's gravitational field in never-before-seen detail, revealing how gravity's pull is uneven across the world. The satellite's fall to Earth, which was inevitable after it ran out of fuel a few weeks ago, was the ESA's first uncontrolled re-entry in decades. But since GOCE was relatively light at 1.2 tons, it didn't attract the same attention as other recent re-entries, including the crash of a failed Russian probe last year."

110,"['Lean asynchronous computer mediated communication is often considered poor for communicating emotion, yet individuals continue to use it for business, personal, and even romantic communication. We used a lab experiment to investigate the influence of media (email and voicemail) and task type (romantic and utilitarian) on both the psychophysiological responses of senders and the content of the resulting messages. Message senders had more arousing physiological responses when sending emails than when leaving voicemails. An interaction exists between media and task such that the content of romantic email messages was more positive than romantic voicemails; while the opposite was true for utilitarian tasks. Thus the choice of media triggers different emotional responses in the sender and leads to different message content.', 'Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

So report researchers at Indiana University Bloomington in the journal Computers in Human Behavior after analyzing both the messages being sent and the physical state of those doing the sending. Contrary to previous research and conventional wisdom suggesting that a voicemail message is more intimate than email, this study finds that, at least among the 72 college-age millennials analyzed, the act of writing produced in the sender far more emotional arousal and greater use of emotional language. The effect endures, too, since people tend to respond to messages using the same medium, thus the recipient may in turn experience similarly heightened emotions when replying, reports Pacific Standard. ""When writing romantic emails, senders consciously or subconsciously added more positive content to their messages, perhaps to compensate for the medium's inability to convey vocal tone,"" Dennis and Wells wrote in the paper. ""Senders engage with email messages longer and may think about the task more deeply than when leaving voicemails. This extra processing may increase arousal."" What's more, the students they studied have, they feel, adapted to the medium. ""If you look at the new generation of millennials, and that's who we studied, they've grown up with email and text messaging,"" one researcher says. ""So it may not be as unnatural a medium as we at first thought."" Or, perhaps, voicemail is just more awkward. (Check out how men and women tend to differ during breakups.)"

He’s accused, among other things, of torturing and killing kittens and being romantically linked to notorious sex killer Homolka, though in a 2007 newspaper report he denied this last allegation. \n \n The police hunt follows the discovery Tuesday of a headless torso inside a brown suitcase next to a pile of rubbish at a dingy Montreal apartment building. Police say a foot and hand mailed to Ottawa belonged to the body. \n \n Late Wednesday, CTV News was reporting there was a note in the box containing the severed foot sent to the Conservative headquarters. The note reportedly said it was the first of six body parts, and it indicated the killer would kill again, according to CTV. \n \n In another shocking twist, a grotesque video has emerged on the Internet that appears to show a man stabbing a naked and bound victim dozens of times with an ice pick, defiling the corpse and cutting off the head and limbs. \n \n Montreal police said they are investigating the video, which sources say appears to be authentic. \n \n Though the actual Montreal crime scene appears similar to the one shown in the murder video, police have not confirmed that the video does indeed show the murder of the man whose body parts were mailed to Ottawa. \n \n However, a police source said, “Everything looks like this is the person we’re talking about.” \n \n More: Second body part discovered in Ottawa after severed foot sent to Conservative party headquarters \n \n The sources added there is a “very strong possibility” that the man whose body parts were sent to Ottawa is an Asian male who was reported missing by family members several days ago. \n \n “The suspect and victim knew each other,” Montreal police Cmdr. Ian Lafrenière confirmed. He didn’t identify the victim. \n \n A source said the victim apparently attended the suspect’s apartment willingly. \n \n “I’ve been doing this job for close to 30 years now and I’ve never seen and never heard of something like this,” Lafrenière said. “It’s like watching a very bad movie. \n \n “It’s important to stay sensitive to these things. Some people might say ‘this happens’ in society. I don’t think so. It’s something very shocking.” \n \n The macabre discovery on Tuesday of a severed foot, delivered to the downtown Ottawa headquarters of the Conservative Party of Canada, set alight confusion and concern on Parliament Hill and made international headlines. \n \n Hours later, Ottawa police confirmed a hand had been found in a package at a Canada Post processing facility. It had apparently been addressed to the Liberal party headquarters. \n \n On Wednesday, the situation escalated as Montreal police said they believed the body parts belonged to the same victim. They asked for the public’s help in finding Magnotta. \n \n The suitcase was reportedly sitting in the rubbish pile since last Friday. The video was posted online on May 25. \n \n Videos from the Toronto Star. \n \n Police spent much of Tuesday combing through the grimy second-floor studio apartment where the torso was found. Its windows look on to a major Montreal expressway. \n \n A poster from the 1942 film Casablanca is visible from outside. The poster can also be seen in photos posted on the Internet appearing to feature Magnotta. \n \n Neighbours had reported a strong foul odour emanating from the studio. Inside, the bed sheets and mattress were soaked with blood. \n \n “There was blood all over the bed,” said building manager Eric Schorer, 59. \n \n There was also a pool of what appeared to be blood on the bottom shelf of the refrigerator. Traces were found too in the freezer. \n \n Inside the closet, a message scribbled in red ink reads: “If you don’t like the reflection, don’t look in the mirror. I don’t care.” \n \n Magnotta arrived in Montreal and rented the furnished apartment about four months ago for $490 a month, Schorer said. His rent was paid up to June 1. \n \n “He came from Toronto and wanted to start a job as a caregiver and to be closer to his child,” Schorer recalled. \n \n According to Schorer and other neighbours, Magnotta kept to himself, slept late into the day, going out in the late afternoon, perhaps to work. \n \n Neighbour Derek Mackinnon, 56, said Magnotta spoke to no other neighbours except himself, “maybe because I was gay too.” \n \n “He’s probably one of the coldest people you’ve ever met in your life,” Mackinnon said. \n \n Mackinnon, a former actor who starred in the 1980 horror film Terror Train, said Magnotta asked him how to make the transition from porn into legitimate acting. “He said his porn career was over.” \n \n He said he saw Magnotta bring home a male five nights ago, an unusual sight because he never previously saw the young man with anyone. He saw Magnotta leave the building the next morning wearing a red wig. “I thought, ‘What is going on with that?’ ” \n \n Mackinnon then began to cry, as he revealed that Magnotta had asked him to come to his apartment to see him, also five days ago. \n \n “I wonder,” he whispered, “if that could have been me.” \n \n The suspect legally changed his name in 2006. His birth name is Eric Clinton Newman. Police said he also goes by the pseudonym Vladimir Romanov. \n \n An online profile pegs him as a bisexual porn actor. He has been targeted as a cat torturer and killer by animal rights activists, who have posted horrific videos to support their accusations. In one, a cat is placed in a plastic bag and the air is sucked out with a vacuum. \n \n The suspect’s Facebook page lists a variety of heroes, from Madonna to Joseph Stalin. \n \n “There is such things as Monsters, Demons and Ghosts,” says a quote typed onto that page. “They live inside of us, and sometimes they win.” \n \n He also appears in an online blog posting about necrophilia. And a piece under Magnotta’s name posted in 2009 is titled, “How to Completely Disappear and Never Be Found.” \n \n “When making the decision to disappear, it is very important to understand that this is not a process that can be successfully accomplished overnight,” the article explains. \n \n Two top Conservative ministers denounced the posting of the body parts as a “criminal” act. \n \n “Bizarre and completely horrifying,” said Immigration Minister Jason Kenney, saying it was clearly a “completely disgusting criminal act.” \n \n Conservative Party spokesman Fred DeLorey said the package, when it arrived at headquarters on Tuesday, was brought to Jenni Byrne, a former senior adviser to Prime Minister Stephen Harper and the campaign manager in the 2011 election, “because it looked suspicious.” \n \n “It was opened.

He is believed to be from Toronto and to have repeatedly used aliases and changed his name over the years. \n \n His new name, Luka Rocco Magnotta, has a prolific presence in the darkest corners of the Internet.

His multiple identities were confusing enough that even police had to issue a second press release Wednesday after originally identifying him as ""Rocco Luka."" \n \n The geographic epicentre of their investigation is a grimy apartment building in Montreal\'s west end. \n \n Magnotta was renting Apartment 208 in the brick mid-rise, by the bustling Decarie Expressway.

Ian Lafreniere told reporters. ""It isn\'t linked to organized crime."" \n \n It apparently took a few days for anyone to find a body part. A resident in the building described the scene in the trash-filled laneway behind the complex. \n \n ""I saw the suitcase and I was tempted to go get it,"" said Richard Payette, 60. ""It didn\'t look too damaged. I said, \'Maybe I\'ll go down and get it.\' But I changed my mind."" \n \n The grisly discovery was made later, by someone else living nearby. \n \n Police were milling about the second-floor apartment Wednesday, where there were still traces of blood and, reportedly, still some body parts stored. Payette said the door of Apartment 208 was left open for part of the day, and the smell of rotten meat was drifting out into the hallway. \n \n The building manager said Magnotta had lived there for four months but hadn\'t been seen around in a while. He said there were never any complaints about noise in the unit, and that Magnotta passed a credit test to rent there. \n \n ""He seemed like a nice guy,"" said the manager, Eric Schorer. \n \n Police said Magnotta has no criminal record. \n \n What isn\'t clear is why body parts were mailed to Ottawa, including a foot received at the offices of the Conservative party and a hand found at a Canada Post warehouse. \n \n Finding him might not be easy. \n \n ""When making the decision to disappear, it is very important to understand that this is not a process that can be successfully accomplished overnight,"" said the online disappearance tips, penned under Magnotta\'s name. \n \n ""For best results under normal circumstances, a minimum of four months is really necessary to successfully carry out the heroic actions necessary to leave your old life behind. \n \n ""This is certainly not an undertaking to be entered into lightly.""', 'Montreal police say Luka Rocco Magnotta is wanted in a homicide investigation in connection to the delivery of a human foot to the Conservative Party of Canada headquarters in Ottawa, and body parts discovered in both cities. \n \n Police said Magnotta, 29, is wanted on a Canada-wide warrant and police are asking for the public\'s help to find him. \n \n Magnotta is also known as Eric Clinton Newman and as Vladimir Romanov.

""Mr. Limbaugh’s recent comments went beyond political discourse to a personal attack, and do not reflect our values as a company,"" said a statement from online florist ProFlowers, which became the seventh advertiser yesterday to yank its ads. ProFlowers was the target of a petition drive urging the company to stop advertising with Limbaugh after he called Sandra Fluke a slut and a prostitute when she spoke out in favor health coverage for birth control, reports the Los Angeles Times. Quicken Loans, Sleep Train, Sleep Number, Citix Systems, Inc., Carbonite, and LegalZoom also yanked their ads. The CEO of Carbonite, a company that provides backup systems for computer files, said the firm would not renew its advertising, despite Limbaugh's apology. “No one with daughters the age of Sandra Fluke, and I have two, could possibly abide the insult and abuse heaped upon this courageous and well-intentioned young lady,"" said CEO David Friend. ""Mr. Limbaugh overstepped any reasonable bounds of decency. Even though Mr. Limbaugh has issued an apology, we have nonetheless decided to withdraw our advertising. We hope that our action will ultimately contribute to a more civilized public discourse.”"
113,"['Two police reports written the night that George Zimmerman shot Trayvon Martin said that Zimmerman had a bloody face and nose, according to police reports made public today. \n \n The reports also note that two witness accounts appear to back up Zimmerman\'s version of what happened when they describe a man on his back with another person wearing a hoodie straddling him and throwing punches. \n \n It has been such a contentious case that even the evidence is being disputed. \n \n The police report states that Trayvon Martin\'s father told an investigator after listening to 911 tapes that captured a man\'s voice frantically callling for help that it was not his son calling for help. \n \n But Tracy Martin, Trayvon\'s father, claims that is not true. The Martin family lawyer Ben Crump told ABC News that Tracy Martin initially listened to a distorted version of the 911 calls and said he could not identify the voice. But when he listened to a second tape that had been ""cleaned,"" ""He immediately broke down in tears because he knew it was his son calling for help,"" Crump said. \n \n The new information is part of a trove of documents released by the Florida State Attorney today in the case against Zimmerman, who is charged with second degree murder for the Feb. 26 killing of Martin, an unarmed 17-year-old African American male. \n \n Surveillance video of Martin in a store purchasing skittles right before the fatal incident was also released today. \n \n Zimmerman, 28, is a multi-racial Hispanic man who volunteered for the neighborhood watch committee who claimed that he shot Martin in self-defense after the 6-foot tall, 160 pound teenager knocked him to the ground, banged his head against the ground and went for Zimmerman\'s gun. \n \n The documents start with a criticism of Zimmerman\'s decision to follow the teenager, who Zimmerman said was looking suspicious. \n \n ""The encounter between George Zimmerman and Trayvon Martin was ultimately avoidable by Zimmerman, if Zimmerman had remained in his vehicle and awaited the arrival of law enforcement,"" an investigating officer wrote. \n \n Zimmerman claims he got out of his vehicle to find a house number to let police know where he saw the allegedly suspicious person, and while returning to his car was knocked down by a punch in the nose and attacked by Martin. \n \n Two police officers reported that when they arrived at the scene of the shooting, Zimmerman seemed to have a battered nose and bloodied face. One wrote that his ""facial area was bloodied,"" and the back of his clothing was soiled with wet grass. \n \n ""Zimmerman was also bleeding from the nose and the back of his head,"" Officer Ricardo Ayala wrote. \n \n Another officer wrote, ""I saw that Zimmerman\'s face was bloodied and it appeared to me that his nose was broken."" \n \n Witnesses, whose names were redacted from the report, also lent support to Zimmerman\'s version of what happened. \n \n ""He witnesses a black male, wearing a dark colored \'hoodie\' on top of a white or Hispanic male and throwing punches \'MMA (mixed martial arts) style,\'"" the police report of the witness said. ""He then heard a pop. He stated that after hearing the pop, he observed the person he had previously observed on top of the other person (the male wearing the hoodie) laid out on the grass."" \n \n A second witness described a person on the ground with another straddling him and throwing punches. The man on the bottom was yelling for help, the witness told police. \n \n The documents state that Zimmerman can be heard yelling for help 14 times on a 911 call recorded during the fight. \n \n Yet another witness described the confrontation in emotional terms. \n \n The witness heard ""someone yelling, almost crying. Then I heard a gunshot."" The witness wrote that he or she ""saw a man on top of a guy laying on the ground. He was putting his hands on his neck or chest."" \n \n The man asked the witness to call 911. \n \n ""He stood up and took a couple steps away and put his hands on his head and then walked back over to the guy on the ground. He looked at him for a minute, then started to walk away toward the road. That is when the police walked up,"" the witness wrote. \n \n The lead investigator on the case, Officer Christopher Serino, wrote that Zimmerman could be heard ""yelling for help as he was being battered by Trayvon Martin."" \n \n Martin\'s death sparked public outrage after police released Zimmerman without any criminal charges for the killing. Zimmerman was later charged with second-degree murder, and the killing provoked widespread debate about racial profiling. \n \n The autopsy also shows that Zimmerman shot Martin from a distance of between 1 inch and 18 inches away, bolstering Zimmerman\'s claim that he shot Martin during a close struggle. \n \n Martin\'s autopsy report also revealed that there was a quarter-inch by half-inch abrasion on the left fourth finger of Martin, another indication of a possible struggle. \n \n The teen, who lived in Miami, was in Sanford while serving a suspension for an empty marijuana bag discovered in his possession. Martin had THC, the drug found in marijuana, in his blood on the night of his death, according to the autopsy. His family told ABC News that it was ""trace amounts"" of THC.', 'Story highlights Martin would be alive if Zimmerman stayed in his vehicle, police said \n \n Trayvon Martin was pronounced dead 3 minutes after firefighters and EMS arrived \n \n Evidence of THC, an ingredient in marijuana, was found in Martin\'s blood, tests show \n \n Firefighters find forehead ""abrasions"" and ""bleeding"" from Zimmerman\'s nose \n \n Just over two weeks after the fatal shooting, and less than a month before an arrest was made, police in Sanford, Florida, urged prosecutors to take George Zimmerman into custody after arguing his killing of Trayvon Martin was ""ultimately avoidable."" \n \n This disclosure came out Thursday, part of a wealth of information released that is related to the case, including the medical\'s examiner\'s finding that the 17-year-old Martin had traces of drugs in his system in an autopsy conducted hours after his death. \n \n Overall, the newly released material paints the most complete picture yet of how investigators built the case, as well as its complexity. The police perspective was most succinctly stated in a March 13 ""capias request"" -- a request that someone be taken into custody -- sent to the state\'s attorney. It speaks to the fact that Zimmerman ignored a police dispatcher\'s advice not to chase Martin, as well as his communications with Martin prior to the shooting. \n \n ""The encounter between George Zimmerman and Trayvon Martin was ultimately avoidable by Zimmerman, if Zimmerman had remained in his vehicle and awaited the arrival of law enforcement, or conversely if he had identified himself to Martin as a concerned citizen and initiated dialog (sic) in an effort to dispel each party\'s concern"" the request said. ""There is no indication that Trayvon Martin was involved in any criminal activity."" \n \n In his 911 call just before the shooting, Zimmerman had speculated that the teen looked like he was ""up to no good or he\'s on drugs or something."" \n \n But Martin\'s defenders have portrayed Zimmerman as the aggressor, accusing him of profiling the African-American teen. Plus, one expert notes the traces of the marijuana-related substance found in the teen\'s system, as measured hours after his death, don\'t necessarily speak to any level of intoxication, while another adds that marijuana use typically doesn\'t make people prone to aggression. \n \n JUST WATCHED Does new evidence change Trayvon case?

The autopsy was conducted February 27, the day after the teenager was shot dead. \n \n Toxicology tests found elements of the drug in the teenager\'s chest blood -- 1.5 nanograms per milliliter of one type (THC), as well as 7.3 nanograms of another type (THC-COOH) -- according to the medical examiner\'s report. There also was a presumed positive test of cannabinoids in Martin\'s urine, according to the medical examiner\'s report. It was not immediately clear how significant these amounts were. \n \n No precise levels on the urine were released. \n \n Dr. Michael Policastro, a toxicologist, cautioned against reading too much into the blood THC levels, adding that one cannot make a direct correlation between those findings and a level of intoxication. \n \n He also noted levels of THC, which can linger in a person\'s system for days, can spike after death in certain areas of the body because of redistribution. \n \n And Dr. Drew Pinsky, an addiction specialist who hosts a show on CNN\'s sister network HLN, added that marijuana typically does not make users more aggressive. \n \n Concentrations of THC routinely rise to 100 to 200 ng/ml after marijuana use, though it typically falls to below 5 ng/ml within three hours of it being smoked, according to information on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration\'s website. \n \n While some states have zero-tolerance policies for any drug traces for driving while impaired, others set certain benchmarks, the website of California\'s Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs notes. In Nevada, that equates to 2 ng/ml for THC and 5 ng/ml for THC-COOH, also known as marijuana metabolite. The cutoff level in Ohio is 2 ng/ml for THC and 50 ng/ml for THC-COOH. \n \n According to the medical examiner\'s report, which was one of several documents on the case released Thursday by the office of special prosecutor Angela Corey, Martin died from a gunshot wound to chest fired from ""intermediate range,"" within 36 inches. \n \n The autopsy report lists the manner of death as a homicide. \n \n JUST WATCHED Medical report lists Zimmerman injuries Replay More Videos ...

Krop High School in Miami. \n \n According to records obtained by the Miami Herald, Martin had been suspended from school three times: once for writing graffiti on a door, another time for school truancy and the last time due to drug residue being found in his backpack. \n \n Speaking of her son\'s suspension to CNN\'s Anderson Cooper, Sybrina Fulton said, ""Whatever he had dealings with the school, it was not criminal, it was not violent, he\'s never been arrested."" \n \n Just before the shooting, Zimmerman called 911 to complain about a suspicious person in his neighborhood. \n \n In the call Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, said he was following Martin after the teen started to run, prompting the dispatcher to tell him, ""We don\'t need you to do that."" \n \n Zimmerman apparently disregarded that advice. \n \n Much has been made about whether Zimmerman during that call used a racial epithet in referring to Martin. But an FBI analysis, released Thursday, determined that the word could not be definitively identified ""due to weak signal level and poor recording quality."" \n \n A screaming voice could be heard on other 911 calls placed by neighbors, with some speculating those screams came from Martin and others that they belonged to Zimmerman. The FBI did not make a final determination either way, citing several reasons including the fact they came during ""an extreme emotional state,"" there weren\'t enough words to make a good comparison and the sound quality was low and distant. \n \n Zimmerman claimed, according a police report released earlier, that he\'d been ""assaulted (by Martin) and his head was struck on the pavement."" \n \n According a report from the Sanford Fire Department , released Thursday, Zimmerman had ""abrasions to his forehead,"" ""bleeding/tenderness to his nose,"" and a ""small laceration to the back of his head"" when emergency personnel arrived at the scene at 7:27 p.m., six minutes after they were first called. \n \n By that time, Martin had no apparent pulse, according to the fire and EMS report. Emergency personnel attempted mouth-to-mask resuscitation and chest compressions, to no avail. He was pronounced dead at 7:30 p.m. \n \n Prosecutors have said Zimmerman, who is a white Hispanic, killed the unarmed teenager unjustly after profiling him. Zimmerman, who has pleaded not guilty, has said that he shot Martin in self-defense. \n \n The start of the trial hasn\'t been set. \n \n The case put a spotlight on race relations, spurring protests nationwide and drawing prominent civil rights leaders to central Florida denouncing the actions of Sanford police and calling for Zimmerman\'s arrest. Special prosecutor Angela Corey announced he\'d been charged on April 11, weeks after Sanford police initially declined to do so. \n \n It also raised questions about gun laws, as well as the merits of the ""Stand Your Ground"" law in Florida, and similar laws in other states that allow people to use deadly force anywhere they feel a reasonable threat of serious injury or death.']",2,"– Get ready for a deluge of information in the Trayvon Martin/George Zimmerman case, as prosecutors today released a cache of related documents. Some early samples: Pro-Zimmerman: His lawyers surely hope lots of attention will be paid to the fact that Trayvon apparently smoked pot at some point before the altercation. (It's not clear when or how much.) The autopsy found traces of the drug THC in his system, the active ingredient in marijuana, reports CNN. Also, ABC News notes that two witness accounts given to police ""appear to back up Zimmerman's version"" of events.

114,"['This is probably not the first day on the job that Sean Spicer imagined it would be. \n \n Already he has done a merry-go-round of morning show appearances since it was announced Thursday that he will serve as our nation’s next White House Press Secretary, set to take office with the Trump administration next month. However, his first day is off to an, uhh, let’s call it interesting start; during an off-air conversation this morning with Mika Brzezinski of MSNBC, the President-elect surprisingly said of nuclear proliferation, “Let it be an arms race, we will outmatch them at every pass. And outlast them all.” \n \n Spicer a half hour later told TODAY’s Matt Lauer, “There is not going to be” an arms race, forced to clarify Trump’s comments that the MSNBC morning show reported on earlier in the day. \n \n Then, remarkably, an hour later on CNN’s New Day, Spicer shrugged off the Brzezinski report altogether; during his interview with Alisyn Camerota, Spicer sheepishly admitted, “That was a private conversation. I was not privy to that.” He promptly shifted the focus of his response, telling the CNN anchor, “He is somebody who gets things done,” discussing the recent conversations over Carrier jobs in Indianapolis. \n \n What’s unclear is if Trump’s comments to Brzezinski, then, were ever intended to be reported on, or if they were — as Spicer alleged on New Day — just a private comment made over the phone. Although Spicer himself appeared on Morning Joe earlier in the day, during a commercial break he spoke on the phone with Mr. President-elect who was then handed over to Brzezinski. It was then that he reportedly made his comment, “Let it be an arms race,” which the MSNBC anchor promptly reported on as breaking news when the show came back on air. Morning Joe ran “BREAKING NEWS” chyrons about the ‘arms race’ admission throughout the rest of the program. \n \n We have reached out to MSNBC for comment. Watch Spicer’s comment to CNN above. \n \n UPDATE 9:22 a.m. EST: A MSNBC spokesperson has confirmed to Mediaite that Trump’s comments to Brzezinski were reportable. \n \n — \n \n [image vis screengrab] \n \n Have a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com', 'A Russian Topol-M intercontinental ballistic missile with a range of some 11,000 kilometres (6,800 miles) and capable of carrying a warhead of up to one megaton, the equivalent of one million tons of TNT explosive (AFP Photo/DMITRY KOSTYUKOV) \n \n Moscow (AFP) - Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday called for the country to reinforce its military nuclear potential and praised the army\'s performance in its Syria campaign. \n \n In a speech that recapped military activities in 2016, Putin said the army\'s preparedness has ""considerably increased"" and called for continued improvement that would ensure it can ""neutralise any military threat"". \n \n ""We need to strengthen the military potential of strategic nuclear forces, especially with missile complexes that can reliably penetrate any existing and prospective missile defence systems,"" the Kremlin strongman said. \n \n ""We must carefully monitor any changes in the balance of power and in the political-military situation in the world, especially along Russian borders, and quickly adapt plans for neutralising threats to our country."" \n \n He said Russia\'s military had successfully demonstrated its capabilities in Syria, showcased its technology to potential arms buyers and helped the Syrian army make considerable advances. \n \n ""The Syrian army received considerable support, thanks to which it carried out several successful operations against militants,"" he said. \n \n ""The effective use of Russian weapons in Syria opens new possibilities for military-technical cooperation. \n \n ""We must take maximum advantage of this. We know there is interest in modern Russian weapons from foreign partners."" \n \n Russia began its bombing campaign in Syria in September 2015 in support of President Bashar al-Assad, with its special forces also operating on the ground in the country. \n \n Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said the military had used ""162 types of modern armaments during the military campaign in Syria,"" including its Sukhoi warplanes and MiG and Kamov helicopters. \n \n ""They have shown to be highly effective,"" he said. \n \n - \'35,000 fighters\' - \n \n Shoigu produced figures for the entire campaign in Syria but did not mention any estimate of civilian casualties. \n \n Russian warplanes have ""liquidated 725 training camps, 405 weapon factories and workshops, 1,500 pieces of terrorist equipment, and 35,000 fighters, including 204 field commanders,"" he said. \n \n The Russian airforce has conducted a total of 18,800 sorties and carried out 71,000 strikes since the start of its campaign, Shoigu said. \n \n ""In general, the operation has allowed (us) to solve several geopolitical problems,"" he said. \n \n ""We have considerably damaged international terrorist organisations in Syria, stopped their expansion... (and) prevented the breakup of Syria."" \n \n Russia is prioritising its Asian partners including India and China for arms sales, he added. \n \n Shoigu said NATO activities along Russia\'s western borders have grown eight-fold over the past decade, forcing Moscow to send more warplanes to prevent breaches of Russian airspace. \n \n Next year, four additional S-400 anti-missile defence systems will be delivered to the army, and Russia will pay particular attention to its Western flank and the Arctic, he said. \n \n ""First and foremost, we will continue to increase military capabilities... take measures to reinforce troops in the western, southwestern and Arctic strategic sectors,"" Shoigu said.', 'Conservative provocateur James O\'Keefe hasn\'t done much worth crowing about since he took down ACORN with misleadingly edited secret videotapes. He was feted as a right-wing celebrity. He got arrested for trying to sneak into a senator\'s office under false pretenses. And then he had his attempted prank of a CNN reporter backfire when the reporter backed out after discovering that he planned to lure her onto a boat and ""seduce"" her. O\'Keefe has responded , finally, to this last embarrassment. Unsurprisingly, he has no regrets, and the liberal media is the real guilty party. \n \n O\'Keefe\'s defense -- posted, of course, on Andrew Breitbart\'s ""Big Government"" -- rests on us believing that the prank-outlining document obtained by CNN was a draft that O\'Keefe did not plan on actually following. He says ideas for stunts are sent to him all the time (like a fancy Hollywood producer!) and sometimes he approves of the idea behind a prank without endorsing everything about it. \n \n As you can imagine in our line of work, we get lots of leads, ideas, schemes and “punked” style plans sent to us all the time. If you were to roam through my personal emails there are many outrageous plans, some parts of which I may approve of in principal with an “I like it” in an email thread. But I may well object to a host of things about the plan, though I like the objective. When the CNN idea was pitched to me, I’ll admit that I liked the basic absurdity of meeting Abbie Boudreau on a boat and the idea of counter-seduction satire executed in a tame, humorous, non-threatening manner. After all, as all liberal reporters do, she was trying to “seduce” (a metaphor) me so she could get more for her story. It would be fun, I thought, to turn the tables in jest. However, I was repulsed by the over-the-top language and symbolism that was suggested in the memo that was sent to me, and never considered that for a moment. \n \n The gross document in question wasn\'t submitted by a fan. It was drafted by Ben Wetmore, with whom O\'Keefe has worked for years. O\'Keefe has called Wetmore his mentor. O\'Keefe and his attempted phone-tampering buddies crashed at Wetmore\'s Louisiana house the month of the Landrieu office incident. \n \n The rest of O\'Keefe\'s defense lies in still not understanding why unwanted ""seduction,"" on a boat, under false pretenses, while being secretly filmed, might not just be considered harmless fun. \n \n In my version, the reporter was never going to be placed in a threatening situation. She would have had to consent before being filmed and she was not going to be faux “seduced” unless she wanted to be. If a CNN reporter would be willing to engage in such a folly, it might even be more newsworthy than Rick Sanchez’s firing. (CNN also has Elliot Spitzer on payroll. He’s done more outrageous things than anything I’ve ever gotten in my in-box). The sexually explicit document CNN is now “reporting” on was never going to be implemented as written. She saw how I was dressed that day, with my usual blazer and collared shirt. In the document she reported as being “authentic,” I was supposed to have been dressed with my chest exposed, slicked backed hair, with gold chains. That ought to have been a red flag the document was not a reflection of my true intentions. Ms. Boudreau was never going to be put in the bizarre situations outlined in the document CNN reported. There were no mirrors, sex tapes, blindfolds, fuzzy handcuffs, posters of naked women, or music. Sorry, you were not going to see my face saying the words “Bubble Headed Beach Blonde who comes on at 5” into a video camera. Those are Don Henley lyrics – and we know, thanks to Chuck DeVore, how much Henley loathes parody. \n \n Not seduced unless she wanted to be! I mean, his ""prank"" as described here makes even less sense as a ""political"" act than the plan Wetmore wrote. He was going to lure her onto a regular boat with nothing outrageous or unusual about it, dressed conservatively, get her consent to film her, and then only ""pretend"" to ""seduce"" her if he somehow determined that she would be into that? \n \n O\'Keefe accomplice Izzy Santa seemed to think -- on the day of the planned punking -- that O\'Keefe\'s boat was full of strawberries and champagne, and that the plan was to creep Boudreau out. There\'s no point to getting her on the boat and filming her if you\'re not going to be gross. Even if O\'Keefe found elements of Wetmore\'s idiotic script objectionable, the idea behind it remains the same. \n \n (As for O\'Keefe\'s dress: Even if he was in his usual uniform of blazer and collared shirt that day, history suggests that footage of O\'Keefe in the ""funnier"" get-up -- perhaps surrounded by ""funnier"" decor on the ""sex boat"" -- would have ended up in the completed video.) \n \n The rest of O\'Keefe\'s post can be summarized thusly: ACORN liberal bias Planned Parenthood ACORN Charlie Rangel ACORN.', 'Rep. Aaron Schock: \'Hottest freshman\' in Congress pushes beyond his media-friendly profile \n \n Already busy in committees, Schock \'has already established himself as a leader,\' House GOP whip says \n \n Aaron Schock hasn\'t wanted for attention since being elected to the House of Representatives last fall as a 27-year-old from Illinois. He has bounced from Stephen Colbert\'s show to CNN, while his own videos go viral on YouTube. \n \n WASHINGTON — He is the Republican ""Dream Date,"" a smooth-speaking, polished product of Peoria, as comfortable with Facebook as a face-to-face. John McCain\'s daughter gushed over him as the future of the party. Readers of the liberal Webzine Huffington Post voted him the hottest freshman in Congress. TMZ trails him like a pop star. \n \n Much of the interest stems from his unlined face and full head of brown hair. (He recently brushed aside a request from host Howard Kurtz on CNN that he take off his jacket and show more of his physique.) \n \n Schock offers an alternative to the GOP tent poles, such as McCain, House Republican leader John Boehner and Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate. \n \n Other GOP fresh faces include Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and Rep. Eric Cantor of Virginia. But Schock can top them all in one respect: He\'s Capitol Hill\'s first Reagan Baby, born while the Republican lodestar was in his first term. Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.), the House\'s longest-serving member, had been in Congress for 26 years when Schock was born. At 82, he\'s 55 years Schock\'s senior. \n \n Congress is one place where the simple quality of being young is newsworthy. The average age of a member of Congress this session is 57. But away from the Beltway, the young dominate the culture. The NBA\'s LeBron James is 24. Golfer Tiger Woods is 33. Arguably the hottest author in America, Stephanie Meyer of the ""Twilight"" series, is 35. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is 24. Millionaires, all. \n \n But in his world, Schock remains an outlier. And he is prepared to take full advantage of that. Other politicos might be mortified -- or feel trivialized -- if they are ambushed by TMZ\'s cameras or win a ""most attractive"" poll. But for the media-centric Schock, it\'s all about keeping the channel open. \n \n ""First, you\'ve got to get their attention,"" Schock said last week outside the House chamber before he entered for a vote on the budget. ""Step one in getting anyone\'s vote is getting their attention."" \n \n That may be part of the long-term plan. Schock\'s Internet reputation belies his serious, even wonky approach to his new job. On Thursday, he hosted a conference call for reporters to discuss his plan for a payroll tax holiday for small businesses. At his request, he serves on three committees, more than most freshmen are allowed in their first term. \n \n He has joined the Republican Study Committee, a home for deficit hawks. This week, he will go on his first overseas congressional trip. (The location is undisclosed because of security concerns.) \n \n Cantor, the House\'s rising Republican strategist and party whip, named Schock a deputy whip, making him part of the leadership team. Already, he has campaigned for other Republicans, such as Jim Tedisco in the special congressional election held in upstate New York last week. (Balloting in that race was so close that the winner is not yet known.) \n \n Cantor calls Schock one of his ""young guns"" and said, ""In only a few short months in Washington, he has already established himself as a leader.""']",4,"– Donald Trump woke everyone from their pre-Christmas slumber Thursday with a tweet calling for a strengthened and expanded US nuclear arsenal. His tweet followed remarks made earlier by Vladimir Putin in which he called for his country's ""need to strengthen the military potential of strategic nuclear forces,"" per Yahoo. On Friday, Trump doubled down on his previous remarks during what Politico calls an ""off-air conversation"" on MSNBC's Morning Joe. ""Let it be an arms race … we will outmatch them at every pass and outlast them all,"" he said. (Politico notes some flip-flopping on nuclear issues, citing a March New York Times interview in which he said, ""It's a very scary nuclear world. Biggest problem, to me, in the world, is nuclear, and proliferation."") Not in on his latest stance, apparently: his own team. Per a transcript posted by NBC's Katy Tur on Twitter, Trump's new White House counselor Kellyanne Conway told Rachel Maddow Thursday night ""we're getting ahead of ourselves"" when Maddow mentioned a ""new nuclear arms race."" And, per a tweet by CNN's David Wright, incoming White House press secretary Sean Spicer insisted on Today Friday that ""there is not going to be"" an arms race and that ""we will all be just fine."" A short time later on CNN's New Day, Spicer said the remarks Trump made to Morning Joes' Mika Brzezinski ""was a private conversation. I was not privy to that,"" per Mediaite.

Rick Perry once forgot he wanted to eliminate the Department of Energy, because President-elect Donald Trump is nominating him to lead the agency. \n \n Perry, who served 14 years as governor of energy-rich Texas, blanked on the Department of Energy\'s name during a televised gaffe in a 2011 debate that was probably the most high-profile moment of his troubled 2012 presidential run.

But in an early sign of the electorate\'s anti-establishment mood, he and several other multiple-term governors dropped out of the race in its early stages, while Trump, a man with no prior political experience, rushed to the head of the Republican primary pack. \n \n Perry was critical of Trump, warning that he was a ""cancer on conservatism,"" but he eventually endorsed him. \n \n In a statement, Trump said Perry would carry out his goal to ""take advantage of our huge natural resource deposits to make America energy independent and create vast new wealth for our nation."" \n \n In one of the many only-in-2016 twists, the former Texas governor appeared on Dancing With The Stars this fall as the onetime-Apprentice star contended for, and ultimately won, the White House: \n \n If confirmed, Perry would oversee a broad-reaching department with ties in everything from funding energy research and providing loans for alternative energy efforts, to tracking and analyzing American energy production and consumption, to securing the safety of America\'s nuclear weapons. \n \n (Despite the popularity of Netflix\'s summer hit Stranger Things, the Department of Energy does not explore parallel universes. It actually put out a statement about this during the show\'s cultural peak.) \n \n The current energy secretary, Ernest Moniz, a nuclear physicist, played a major role in negotiating and crafting the Obama administration\'s controversial nuclear deal with Iran. Under Obama, the department has been a big booster of alternative energy like wind and solar power. \n \n A questionnaire the Trump transition team sent to Department of Energy employees is raising a lot of questions about how the incoming administration would change the department\'s priorities. As NPR reported: \n \n ""It wants to know who at the Department of Energy attended domestic and international climate talks. It wants emails about those conferences. It also asks about money spent on loan-guarantee programs for renewable energy. ... The Trump team questionnaire also asks about the Energy Department\'s role in the Iran nuclear deal, which Trump has called \'stupid.\' And it asks for the 20 highest paid employees at the department\'s national laboratories."" \n \n The questionnaire alarmed Democrats, like Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey, who sent a letter to Trump raising concerns that ""this request suggests that your administration may intend to retaliate against career employees who faithfully executed their responsibilities."" \n \n Trump has repeatedly expressed skepticism about wind power\'s cost and effectiveness. But under Perry, Texas heavily promoted wind. Massive wind farms dot the Texas landscape, and wind energy now produces more than 10 percent of the energy the state consumes.', ""“Heart-wrenching!” the Shandong provincial prosecutor’s office wrote on Weibo, China’s version of Twitter. “Put down your phone.

All the crew are safe and well,” and EU naval statement said. \n \n However the state-run RIA news agency, citing an unnamed Russian navy official, said the Russians had killed one pirate and captured 10. \n \n A spokesman for Russia’s Foreign Ministry, Igor Lyakin-Frolov, confirmed that some pirates had been captured, but said it was unclear if there were casualties among them. \n \n “The captured pirates will most likely be handed over to the authorities of countries in the region,” he told Reuters. \n \n The tanker would most likely continue on its planned voyage to China, he said. \n \n Somali pirates are still able to seize ships despite the presence of an international fleet of warships in the busy shipping lanes linking Europe with Asia. Shipowners and insurers have paid out tens of millions of dollars in ransoms. \n \n The successful rescue operation will please the Kremlin, which has been seeking to revive Russia’s naval muscle despite limited resources. \n \n Russia has been sending warships to patrol and protect Russian crews and cargoes off the Horn of Africa since the hijacking of the Ukrainian-owned cargo ship MV Faina in 2008 and the death of its Russian captain.

The New York Times runs through some of the differences with AirAsia Flight 8501: Unlike with Flight 370, there has been no sign that anybody on Flight 8501 intentionally disabled any onboard systems, meaning that investigators should have the normal automatic transmissions from the flight to help the search. Flight 370 disappeared on a clear night, while Flight 8501 was believed to have encountered stormy weather, with weather agencies having reported lightning strikes along its route. The AirAsia pilot's last communication with air traffic control was a request ""to avoid clouds by turning left and going higher to 38,000 feet."" Flight 370's pilot was very experienced, with more than 18,000 hours of flying time, while the combined experience of Flight 8501's pilot and co-pilot is believed to be less than half that. Neither Flight 370 nor Flight 8501 issued an emergency distress call, but, as the AP notes, ""pilots are trained to focus first on the emergency at hand and then communicate only when free,"" and there's no sign that the AirAsia flight diverted sharply from its intended course the way the Malaysia Airlines flight did. Another major difference is the search area for Flight 8501, which is much smaller and shallower than the vast area that has been searched for Flight 370. ""We are not talking about the deep Indian Ocean here,"" says CNN aviation correspondent Richard Quest. ""We are talking about congested airspace around Southeast Asia. There will be much better radar coverage. There's certainly better air traffic control coverage."""

The president and I also disagree on the extent of the entitlement problem and what is necessary in order to solve it.” \n \n Boehner insisted that “the House cannot pass a bill that raise taxes on job creators. The House can only pass a debt-limit with spending cuts larger than a hike in the debt limit, as well as real restraints on future spending.” \n \n The Ohio Republican also called for passage of a balanced-budget amendment. That proposal will be taken up by the House next week. \n \n “This boil downs to two things - the president insists on raising taxes, and they’re just not serious enough fundamental entitlement reform to solve the problem for the near and intermediate future… It takes two to tango, and they’re just not there yet.” \n \n Boehner denied ever discussing any tax increases during his private talks with Obama, a position that he and his aides have repeatedly stated since pulling the plug on those negotiations last weekend. Boehner said his idea was to simplify and reduce tax rates, which would result in new economic growth and more revenue for the federal government. Boehner clearly would prefer that alternative, but opposition from Cantor and Senate Republicans forced Boehner to retreat on such an agreement.']",2,"– Police are no longer seeking the whereabouts of a blue Porsche after a quadruple murder in an upscale Washington, DC, neighborhood—but they've released video of a ""person of interest"" who may have been driving it before it was found burning behind a church.

Gutierrez says Savvas Savopoulos gave conflicting information in different messages and sounded unlike himself. ""It was something very suspicious because I felt his voice was really tense,"" she tells the Post. ""And it was different than what he had said to me before."" She says she also found it strange that Savopoulos said Figueroa was spending the night at the home, something she had never known to happen before.

118,"[""Login credentials for as many as 117 million LinkedIn accounts have been put up for sale online by someone who is seeking more than $2,200 for the haul, a security researcher said. \n \n Further Reading 8 million leaked passwords connected to LinkedIn, dating website The credentials—which include e-mail addresses and passwords hashed using the woefully weak SHA1 function—appear to come from a 2012 breach of the career networking site, researcher Troy Hunt said in a series of tweets. LinkedIn officials have since verified that the 2012 hack was the source and said they are working to invalidate any passwords that may still be actively used on compromised accounts. According to LeakedSource, a site that maintains a database of more than 1.25 billion compromised accounts, the new batch contains data for 167 million accounts. 117 million of the records in the batch include a password field. \n \n The discovery means that the 2012 LinkedIn breach was much bigger than previously believed. At the time, researchers found almost 6.5 million credentials belonging to site users. It's not clear if the new number of affected accounts is news to LinkedIn. In the days following discovery of the 2012 breach, company officials implemented a mandatory password reset for affected users. A statement from company officials on Wednesday saying that they're working to change any passwords still in use leaves open the possibility that they were unaware the number was so high. \n \n According to posts on social media sites, the data was advertised on a dark Web site known as The Real Deal by someone with the user name peace_of_mind. It offers data for 167 million accounts for five bitcoins, which at current exchange rates is worth about $2,200. \n \n In an e-mail, LinkedIn officials wrote: \n \n In 2012, LinkedIn was the victim of an unauthorized access and disclosure of some members' passwords. At the time, our immediate response included a mandatory password reset for all accounts we believe were compromised as a result of the unauthorized disclosure. Additionally, we advised all members of LinkedIn to change their passwords as a matter of best practice. Yesterday, we became aware of an additional set of data that had just been released that claims to be email and hashed password combinations of LinkedIn members from that same theft in 2012. We are taking immediate steps to invalidate the passwords of the accounts impacted, and we will contact those members to reset their passwords. We have no indication that this is a result of a new security breach. We take the safety and security of our members' accounts seriously. For several years, we have hashed and salted every password in our database; and we have offered protection tools such as email challenges and dual factor authentication. We encourage our members to visit our \n \n safety center to ensure they have two-step verification authentication and to use strong passwords in order to keep their accounts as safe as possible. \n \n The LeakedSource post breaks down the most commonly used passwords and they reveal a stunning lack of care on the part of end users—and more to the point, on the part ofr LinkedIn for allowing them in the first place. The most widely used passcode was 123456, with 753,305 accounts. It was followed by linkedin with 172,523, password with 144,458, 123456789 with 94,314, 12345678 with 63,769, and 111111, with 57,210. Many sites are reluctant to forbid the use of such weak passwords out of a fear of alienating users. The leak underscores just how much a new approach is needed."", ""Quite literally, every day someone gets hacked. Whether that's a telecommunications company having its customer data stolen, or another chain of businesses being ripped for all the credit cards it processes, today one hack just seems to melt into another. \n \n In our series Another Day, Another Hack, we do short posts giving you what you need to know about the hack, so you can figure out whether your bank account, website logins or anything else might be at risk. Because, even if the hack might not be the most sophisticated, real people are still getting fucked over somewhere, and should know about it. \n \n A hacker is trying to sell the account information, including emails and passwords, of 117 million LinkedIn users. \n \n The hacker, who goes by the name “Peace,” told Motherboard that the data was stolen during the LinkedIn breach of 2012. At the time, only around 6.5 million encrypted passwords were posted online, and LinkedIn never clarified how many users were affected by that breach. \n \n Turns out it was much worse than anybody thought. \n \n Peace is selling the data on the dark web illegal marketplace The Real Deal for 5 bitcoin (around $2,200). The paid hacked data search engine LeakedSource also claims to have obtained the data. Both Peace and the one of the people behind LeakedSource said that there are 167 million accounts in the hacked database. Of those, around 117 million have both emails and encrypted passwords. \n \n “It is only coming to the surface now. People may not have taken it very seriously back then as it was not spread,” one of the people behind LeakedSource told me. “To my knowledge the database was kept within a small group of Russians.” \n \n A screenshot of the listing on The Real Deal \n \n LeakedSource provided Motherboard with a sample of almost one million credentials, which included email addresses, hashed passwords, and the corresponding hacked passwords. The passwords were originally encrypted or hashed with the SHA1 algorithm, with no “salt,” which is a series of random digits attached to the end of hashes to make them harder to be cracked. \n \n One of the operators of LeakedSource told Motherboard in an online chat that so far they have cracked “90% of the passwords in 72 hours.” \n \n Troy Hunt, a security researcher who maintains the breach notification site “Have I Been Pwned?,” reached out to some of the victims of the data breach. Two of them confirmed to Hunt that they indeed were users of LinkedIn and that the password he shared with them was the one they were using at the time of the breach. Motherboard was able to confirm a third victim. \n \n One of the victims told Motherboard that the password in the sample was their current one, though he changed it as soon as Hunt reached out no notify him of the breach. \n \n “Having a password out there feels like someone being able to let themselves in to your private space whenever they like, without you knowing,” the victim, who asked to remain anonymous, said in an email. \n \n When reached for comment on Tuesday, LinkedIn spokesperson Hani Durzy told Motherboard that the company’s security team was looking into the incident, but that at the time they couldn’t confirm whether the data was legitimate. Durzy, however, also admitted that the 6.5 million hashes that were posted online in 2012 were not necessarily all of the passwords stolen. \n \n “We don’t know how much was taken,” Durzy told me in a phone call. \n \n The lesson: For LinkedIn, the lesson is the same as four years ago: don’t store passwords in an insecure way. As for LinkedIn users, if you didn’t already change your password four years ago, change it again, especially if you use it on other services (and please stop reusing passwords). \n \n “The prevalence of password reuse means we’ll see that unlock other accounts too,” Hunt told me. \n \n Another lesson is that even old hacked data can sometimes be valuable, given that some of these passwords might still be valid. \n \n UPDATE, May 18, 12:32 p.m. ET: LinkedIn confirmed on Wednesday that the new data is legitimate. \n \n “Yesterday, we became aware of an additional set of data that had just been released that claims to be email and hashed password combinations of more than 100 million LinkedIn members from that same theft in 2012,“ the company's chief information security officer Cory Scott wrote in a blog post. “We are taking immediate steps to invalidate the passwords of the accounts impacted, and we will contact those members to reset their passwords. We have no indication that this is as a result of a new security breach.“ \n \n Scott also encouraged users to use two-factor authentication and use strong passwords."", 'A LinkedIn hack from back in 2012 is still causing problems for its users. The company announced this morning that another data set from the hack, which contains over 100 million LinkedIn members’ emails and passwords, has now been released. In response to this new data dump, LinkedIn says it’s working to validate the accounts and contact affected users so they can reset their passwords on the site. \n \n As you may or may not recall, given how much time has passed, hackers broke into LinkedIn’s network back in 2012, stole some 6.5 million encrypted passwords, and posted them onto a Russian hacker forum. Because the passwords were stored as unsalted SHA-1 hashes, hundreds of thousands were quickly cracked. \n \n Now, according to a new report from Motherboard, a hacker going by the name of “Peace” is trying to sell the emails and passwords of 117 million LinkedIn members on a dark web illegal marketplace for around $2,200, payable in bitcoin. In total, the data set includes 167 million accounts, but of those, only 117 million or so have both emails and encrypted passwords. \n \n As this data set also originates from the 2012 hack, these passwords are encrypted in the same way – with “no salt” – meaning they are more easily cracked. In fact, Motherboard states that 90 percent of the passwords were cracked within 72 hours. Several of the victims were still using their same password from 2012, the report also said. \n \n Whether or not current LinkedIn users should be concerned comes down to a handful of factors: did you have an account during the time of the 2012 breach, have you changed your password since, and has that password been reused on other websites? \n \n If you’re not sure, a best practice would be to change it anyway, as well as on other critical sites where you may be using that same password such as your banking website, email, or Facebook, for example. \n \n LinkedIn says that it has increased its security measures in the years since the breach, by introducing stronger encryption, email challenges and two-factor authentication. But this hack was from an earlier era, before these protections were in place. They would also not necessarily protect users from hackers who had obtained email and password combinations. \n \n The full text of LinkedIn’s statement is below:']",3,"– In 2012, hackers posted 6.5 million stolen LinkedIn passwords to a Russian forum, TechCrunch reports. It turns out, that security breach was much bigger and much worse than possibly anyone realized. According to Motherboard, 117 million LinkedIn emails and passwords taken as part of the same breach were just put up for sale by a hacker named ""Peace,"" who is seeking $2,200 for them on the dark web. LinkedIn has confirmed the emails and passwords are legit and is working on contacting affected users. Back in 2012, LinkedIn never specified how many accounts had been compromised by hackers. Ars Technica reports it's possible even the company didn't know how many passwords had been stolen initially. Hackers have apparently had no trouble with the lightly encrypted passwords. One source claims hackers cracked 90% of the stolen passwords within 72 hours. Ars Technica argues many of the passwords should never have been allowed by LinkedIn in the first place. More than 750,000 users had the password ""123456."" More than 170,000 used ""linkedin."" Other popular passwords were ""password"" and ""111111."" People who were using LinkedIn in 2012, still have the same password, and use that password for other websites should be concerned, according to TechCrunch, which says it's best to change your password on LinkedIn (and anywhere else you used it) just in case."

Stories like these, which have come to light over the past few years, have underscored that there are elements of sexual harassment in the Forest Service that have existed and continue today.” \n \n It continues: “While we have taken significant actions over the past several years to address sexual harassment in the Forest Service, we acknowledge that we have more work to do. These are critical issues that the Forest Service must continue to take on to increase our efforts to protect our fellow employees so they know they can speak up and speak out, without any fear of retaliation or reprisal. We continue to consult with outside experts and focus internal resources to help us better support victims of harassment during investigations. Victims must know that there will be accountability for persons who engage in sexual harassment and reprisal.

The group, discovered by two British divers late Monday, are on a dry rock ledge around 2.5 miles from the mouth of the cave, and the Thai military says it could be months before it can get them out, unless the boys learn to dive, the BBC reports. The cave in northern Thailand often remains flooded until the end of the rainy season in September or October, meaning the youth soccer team and their coach may need to have food and other supplies sent in for the next four months. Experts warn that it could be very difficult to get the boys, ages 11 to 16, to safety through miles of dark, narrow, flooded tunnels.

Period trends in rates of suicide were estimated using negative binomial regression incidence rate ratios (IRRs). \n \n Results The overall suicide rate among children aged 5 to 11 years remained stable between 1993 to 1997 and 2008 to 2012 (from 1.18 to 1.09 per 1 million; IRR = 0.96; 95% CI, 0.90-1.03). However, the suicide rate increased significantly in black children (from 1.36 to 2.54 per 1 million; IRR = 1.27; 95% CI, 1.11-1.45) and decreased in white children (from 1.14 to 0.77 per 1 million; IRR = 0.86; 95% CI, 0.79-0.94). The overall firearm suicide rate (IRR = 0.69; 95% CI, 0.57-0.85) and firearm suicide rate among white boys (IRR = 0.72; 95% CI, 0.59-0.88) decreased significantly during the study. The rate of suicide by hanging/suffocation increased significantly in black boys (IRR = 1.35; 95% CI, 1.14-1.61), although the overall change in suicide rates by hanging/suffocation or other suicide methods did not change during the study. \n \n Conclusions and Relevance The stable overall suicide rate in school-aged children in the United States during 20 years of study obscured a significant increase in suicide incidence in black children and a significant decrease in suicide incidence among white children. Findings highlight a potential racial disparity that warrants attention. Further studies are needed to monitor these emerging trends and identify risk, protective, and precipitating factors relevant to suicide prevention efforts in children younger than 12 years.', 'The overall suicide rate among children between the ages of five and 11 was stable during the 20 years from 1993 to 2012, but that stability obscured racial differences that show an increase in suicide among black children and a decrease among white children. \n \n For a study published by JAMA Pediatrics, researchers led by Jeffrey A. Bridge, Ph.D., of the Research Institute at Nationwide Children’s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, analyzed 20 years of nationwide mortality data. \n \n The researchers found that 657 children between the ages of five and 11 died by suicide between 1993 and 2012 — an average of nearly 33 children each year. They also found that 553 (84 percent) of the children were boys and 104 (16 percent) were girls. \n \n Hanging/suffocation was the predominant method of suicide, accounting for 78.2 percent (514 of 657) of the total suicides, followed by firearms (17.7 percent; 116 of 657) and other methods (4.1 percent; 27 of 657), according to the results. \n \n The analysis showed that the overall suicide rate remained stable during the 20-year period, going from 1.18 per one million to 1.09 per million. \n \n However, the researchers found that that stability resulted from divergent trends in suicide for black and white children during those 20 years. \n \n The suicide rate increased in black children from 1.36 per one million to 2.54 per one million, while the suicide rate decreased in white children from 1.14 per one million to 0.77 per one million. \n \n The statistically significant racial differences were confined to both black and white boys, with an increase in the suicide rate among black boys (1.78 to 3.47 per one million) and a decrease in the suicide rate among white boys (from 1.96 to 1.31 per one million). \n \n Although the changes were not statistically significant among girls, the suicide rate among black girls increased from 0.68 to 1.23 per one million during the 20-year period, while the suicide rate among white girls remained stable from 0.25 to 0.24 per one million, according to the study’s findings. \n \n According to the researchers, the findings prompt questions about what factors might influence increasing suicide rates among young black children, such as disproportionate exposure to violence and traumatic stress, aggressive school discipline, and an early onset of puberty. \n \n However, the researchers said it remains unclear if any of these factors are related to increasing suicide rates. \n \n “The stable overall suicide rate among U.S. children aged five to 11 years during 20 years of study masked a significant increase in the suicide rate among black children and a significant decline in the suicide rate among white children,” the authors write. \n \n “From a public health perspective, future steps should include ongoing surveillance to monitor these emerging trends and research to identify risk, protective and precipitating factors associated with suicide in elementary school-aged children to frame targets for early detection and culturally informed interventions.” \n \n Source: The JAMA Network Journals']",2,"– It has to rank among the saddest of studies: a new look at suicides among young children. Researchers reviewed two decades of CDC data, from 1993 to 2012. Though they write in JAMA Pediatrics that ""suicide is a leading cause of death among school-aged children younger than 12 years,"" they found that suicides among those ages 5 to 11 are very rare, reports the AP: There were 657 during the period studied, or one roughly every week-and-a-half (per the CDC, the daily average for all ages is 105 suicides). But while the suicide rate remained stable during that time, ""that stability obscured racial differences,"" observes Psych Central. The suicide rate decreased in white children, but increased significantly in black children, from from 1.36 to 2.54 per 1 million between the study's first five years and its last five. (In white children, the shift was from 1.14 to 0.77.) That shot suicide up from No. 14 on the list of causes of death among black kids of this age to No. 9; it's No. 11 for white kids. The researchers noted that 84% of those who committed suicide were boys and just 16% girls, and the rate worsens when viewed through a gender lens as well. For black boys, the rate climbed to 3.47 per million. The findings represent a big shift, per lead author Jeffrey Bridge. ""Historically, the suicide rate among US black individuals has been lower than that of white individuals across age groups,"" reads the study. ""To our knowledge, this is the first national study to observe higher suicide rates among US black individuals compared with white individuals."" Hanging and suffocation were the main methods for young children. Bridge advises parents to look for warning signs like prolonged unhappiness and withdrawing from favorite activities.

Lambach would allegedly seek out women with drug addictions and post their pictures online, then arrange meetings with clients. Some of these meetings took place in Van Wert's apartment in a senior facility. Van Wert offered his apartment in return for cash or drugs. The Berkshire Eagle reports that the police investigation began last spring in response to citizen complaints about increased prostitution across the city.

At least one woman said Lambach drove her to an ""appointment"" across state lines. Police estimated one of the victims was 15 years old. They were also told that some of the women were Lambach's former foster children.

(Associated Press) \n \n NEW YORK (AP) — The FBI is warning state officials to boost their election security in light of evidence that hackers breached related data systems in two states. \n \n In a confidential ""flash"" alert from its cyber division, first reported by Yahoo News and posted online by others, the FBI said it\'s investigating the pair of incidents and advised states to scan their systems for specific signs of hacking. \n \n The FBI said Monday that it doesn\'t comment on specific alerts, but added that it routinely sends out advisories to private industry about signs of cyber threats that it comes across in its investigations. \n \n The FBI didn\'t name the states that were breached. State election websites in Arizona and Illinois experienced hack-related shutdowns earlier this summer. In both cases, the parts of the websites attacked involved online voter registration. \n \n The FBI\'s Aug. 18 warning also came just days after Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson hosted a call with secretaries of state and other state election officials to talk about cybersecurity and election infrastructure. \n \n In that call, Johnson said that while DHS isn\'t aware of any particular cyber threat against election-related computers, it\'s ""critically important"" to make sure that election systems are secure amid a rapidly changing threat landscape, according to a DHS summary of the call. \n \n Federal officials are becoming increasingly concerned about the possibility that hackers, particularly those working for Russia or another country, could breach U.S. elections systems and wreak havoc on the November presidential election. \n \n Some experts, along with Democrat Hillary Clinton\'s campaign, believe that Russia was behind the embarrassing email hack of the Democratic National Committee right before its national convention last month. The hacked emails showed an apparent lack of neutrality in the primary race between Clinton and Bernie Sanders, with some party officials disparaging Sanders. \n \n ___ \n \n Tucker reported from Washington. \n \n ___ \n \n Follow Bree Fowler at https://twitter.com/APBreeFowler.

That's the latest theory being floated to explain the mysterious ailments suffered by staffers at the American embassy in Cuba. But now a pioneering scientist in that field thinks the idea—based on a principle called the microwave auditory effect—is bogus. Kenneth Foster is a professor of bioengineering at Penn who explained the auditory effect in a 1974 study. At Scientific American, he assesses what's known about the Cuban ailments and lays out why it's ""wildly implausible"" that microwaves are to blame. For one thing, any such weapon powerful enough to cause brain damage would almost certainly burn the victims, too, and that didn't happen. Instead, Foster suggests that a much simpler explanation is likely. ""It is reasonable to guess the sounds were inadvertently produced by ultrasound devices, possibly even spytech, but without malicious intent against the embassy personnel,"" he writes. Foster cites this earlier investigation from the AP revealing the sounds that the victims are believed to have heard, and he says the sounds are consistent with ultrasound devices interacting with each other. It makes sense to him that the Cubans might have been trying to listen in on Americans with these relatively common gizmos. ""The incidents occurred about the time of the 2016 US election, and the Cubans undoubtedly were desperate for intelligence about US intentions."" A Cuban scientist, meanwhile, agrees that the microwave theory is far-fetched. ""First, it was sonic weapons, now microwave,"" he told CNN. ""What's next, kryptonite?"""

The president's latest financial disclosure forms, released yesterday, reveal that he and Michelle had total assets worth somewhere between $1.8 million and $7 million in 2013, the AP reports. (That's just like 2012.) Most of that is in US Treasury notes, which are worth between $1 million and $5 million. Other assets include Vanguard retirement funds and college saving funds. Current financial disclosure rules only require politicians to list their assets within a broad range, so it's hard to pin down exactly how much Obama has, the New York Times explains. Besides his presidential salary, Obama makes most of his money off royalties from his books, though the market seems to believe he peaked as a writer in the '90s. His latest, 2010's Of Thee I Sing, A Letter to My Daughters, earned between $5,001 and $15,000, compared to $50,001-$100,000 for 1995's Dreams From My Father.

Yet, until recently, no one could decide on when exactly Her Majesty would make history. Dates ranging from Sept. 9 to Sept. 11 were posited. The calculations themselves give different results, depending on whether days alone are counted, or years and days, or years, months and days. \n \n When Martin Willis, a professor of Victorian literature at the University of Westminster in London put his own extensive calculations online—he went for Sept. 10—he was stunned to realize his post was being read, and commented on, by people around the world. In late November, he got an email out of the blue from Buckingham Palace. They’d seen his work and were emailing to notify him that the Royal Archives had done its own more exhaustive investigation, using the number of days and, yes, hours for both queens. \n \n When contacted by Maclean’s, the palace confirmed the information given Willis.

Last year, AMPAS executives were worried that Banksy, director of the nominated documentary ""Exit Through the Gift Shop,"" would try to take the stage in disguise. \n \n Speaking of a conversation he had with representatives for the elusive graffiti artist, Academy president Tom Sherak said, ""We suggested to them that it might be a good idea that if he did win, one of them would accept in his place – that it would not be dignified for the Academy to have somebody come up wearing a monkey\'s head."" \n \n (Angry reps for Banksy disputed that he ever wore a monkey mask in public.) \n \n Also read: Steve Pond\'s Oscar Picks: \'The Artist\' Will Win, but Should It? \n \n The Academy wasn\'t amused in 2000, when Best Song nominees Trey Parker and Matt Stone (""South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut"") showed up in knockoffs of the famous awards-show gowns worn by Jennifer Lopez and Gwyneth Paltrow. \n \n Parker and Stone had not cleared their plan with the Academy before that show – and, they said, they got plenty of dirty looks (plus a thumbs-up from Michael Caine) as they walked the red carpet. \n \n Baron Cohen was reportedly planning to do something similar, wearing his ""Dictator"" outfit for an in-character trip down the red carpet and then changing into a tux for the show. \n \n Using an Oscar appearance to promote an upcoming film is not, of course, completely unknown. This year\'s host, Billy Crystal, did just that in 1991 when he made his entrance on a horse before the release of ""City Slickers,"" and Ben Stiller appeared onstage in his ""Starsky and Hutch"" costume in 2004. \n \n But those were onstage, where it was sanctioned and controlled.

And you know, I don’t know if anyone explained to her you have to spend 3 nights a week in Columbus. So, how does that work out for you? Umm, I waited until I was 48 til my kids were raised, and at least adults, before we took the opportunity to try.’ \n \n He questioned my intelligence, insinuating I was not aware of the requirements of the State Representative Position. Mr. Patton also specifically implied that I am precluded from running for office until my kids were adults. \n \n The decision to run for State Representative is one that my family and I took very seriously when we made it. We realize the sacrifice that is involved in holding such a position. \n \n However, Tom Patton has crossed a line by trying to turn the fact that I am a mother of two children, into a negative campaign issue. It’s insulting for my opponent to suggest that “motherhood” is a liability. In fact, my experience as a Mom is perhaps my greatest strength. \n \n There are numerous examples of women with children who have admirably served our nation. Sarah Palin was on the Presidential ticket in 2008. At the time she had 5 non adult children, including a newborn. Cathy McMorris Rodgers is the 4th highest ranking member of the Republican Leadership in the in the US House of Representatives, and has had two children while in office. Lieutenant Governor Mary Taylor has two sons she has raised while serving in her current role, as well as during her time in the Ohio House and as State Auditor. Ohio House Representative Christina Hagan just welcomed her daughter last December and is now back serving her constituents. \n \n I would also be remiss if I did not recognize the men who also serve while they have children at home. For example, our own Governor John Kasich has two teenage daughters. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan’s three children have all been born while he has been in Congress. He commutes weekly between Washington D.C. and his home in Janesville, Wisconsin. \n \n So I ask Mr.Patton, by your logic, are you saying that 2 Vice Presidential nominees, the highest ranking woman in The House Leadership Team, our sitting Governor and Lieutenant Governor and a colleague in the Ohio Legislature are all unfit to serve? Further, are your colleagues in the Ohio Legislature, the majority whom have had young children while serving, aware of your views? Do you draw a distinction between whether that representative is a mother or a father who is serving? \n \n I call on The Cuyahoga County Republican Party, The Ohio Republican Party, and any other organizations endorsing a candidate in this race to seriously consider whether Tom Patton’s comments reflect your own values. By choosing to my support my opponent, you are tacitly endorsing his beliefs regarding the inability of parents of children to also serve in the legislature. In a district that is composed of over 50% women, with many parents who successfully balance demanding jobs as well as a family, there is no place for this kind of anti-working parent mentality. \n \n And once last thing, Tom, only one man in my life is allowed to call me “sweetie.” From now on, I respectfully ask you to refer to me as Jen, Jennifer, Ms. Herold, or your opponent.” \n \n Ms. Herold encourages those who denounce Tom Patton’s comments to make their voices heard by signing our petition at http://www.ipetitions.com/petition/ISupportJen.

The tree cuts so sad and forlorn a figure that it has been nicknamed Spelacchio, or Mangy. \n \n Spelacchio arrived in Rome early this month from the Trentino region, near Italy’s border with Austria, and what with transport expenses and decorations, the 70-foot fir is estimated to have cost Italian taxpayers 48,000 euros, or $57,000. It’s not clear what has ailed it. Maybe Spelacchio was unsettled by the trip; perhaps it was ill on departure. By way of explanation, Antimo Palumbo, a tree historian who was standing by Spelacchio’s side on Friday morning, pointed at the concrete all over its roots. “You see that?” he told me. “They decided to pour the concrete to keep it steady, but that killed it instead.” \n \n There isn’t enough time, money or political will to replace the tree, and so Spelacchio the Mangy will stay in Piazza Venezia through the holidays, and for many locals it has already become a metaphor for what’s wrong with the city, and the country. \n \n Traffic in Rome is chronically congested, public transport is inefficient, trash collection is slow and sporadic.

The New York Times reports that the 72-foot-tall Norway spruce erected in the Piazza Venezia and nicknamed ""Spelacchio,"" or ""Mangy,"" will cost the city about $57,000 in all—and locals are outraged that so much money was outlayed for a tree that one expert says ""has clearly been traumatized.""

Others defend the tree, saying it looks OK when it's lit up at night. ""We are all Spelacchio!"" one supporter told a local paper. Per the Times, the tree even has a few Facebook accounts and a Twitter handle in its name, with one tweet proclaiming: ""I have more followers than branches."" A consumer rights group that calls the tree a ""shameful spectacle for citizens and tourists"" is lobbying to have the tree taken down and has asked a local court to scrutinize the tree's costs.

138,"['WASHINGTON — Two and a half weeks after Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta announced an inquiry into e-mail exchanges between Gen. John R. Allen of the Marines and a socialite in Tampa, Fla., some 15 investigators working seven days a week in the Pentagon inspector general’s office have narrowed their focus to 60 to 70 e-mails that “bear a fair amount of scrutiny,” a defense official said. \n \n The official did not disclose the content of the e-mails, but senior Pentagon officials have described the voluminous correspondence between General Allen, the top NATO commander in Afghanistan, and the socialite, Jill Kelley, as potentially “inappropriate communication.” Law enforcement officials say the e-mails number in the hundreds and cover a period of two and a half years starting in 2010, when General Allen was the deputy commander of Central Command, based in Tampa. \n \n The investigation, which is delaying and could derail General Allen’s appointment to be the NATO supreme allied commander in Europe, is on a fast track but is unlikely to be completed before the end of the year. Investigations of senior officers in the inspector general’s office usually take about seven months on average, although normally there are only two or three investigators assigned to a case. \n \n The defense official, who asked not to be named because of the nature of the inquiry, said investigators were trying to determine whether the e-mails violated Defense Department policy, government regulations or military law. They were discovered in the course of an F.B.I. investigation into anonymous e-mails to Ms. Kelley warning her to stay away from David H. Petraeus, then the C.I.A. director. The F.B.I. found that the e-mails had been sent by Paula Broadwell, Mr. Petraeus’s biographer; he admitted to having had an affair with Ms. Broadwell and resigned on Nov. 9. \n \n Like General Allen, Mr. Petraeus, a retired four-star general, was a social acquaintance of Ms. Kelley when he was stationed at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, headquarters of the Central Command. \n \n The e-mails between General Allen and Ms. Kelley were sent to the Pentagon by the F.B.I. on Nov. 11. “They just forwarded the evidence,” the official said, referring to the F.B.I. “People have to go through and decide if they fit one of three potential violations.” Those violations include misconduct, which could range from inappropriate language on a government computer to adultery, prohibited under military law; more than an incidental use of government property for personal matters; and security breaches. \n \n The defense official said there was no evidence so far that there had been security violations. General Allen, who is in Kabul planning the drawdown of American forces from Afghanistan, is cooperating with the investigation and has said through associates that he did not commit adultery. The inquiry does not appear to have progressed to interviews with General Allen, 58, who is married and the father of two, or Ms. Kelley, 37, the wife of a cancer surgeon and the mother of three. \n \n Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., who has been nominated to succeed General Allen as part of a regular military rotation, is expected to be confirmed by the Senate before the end of the year and to be in Kabul by February. General Allen is expected to return to the United States at that time, but it is unclear what he will do. \n \n There have been conflicting accounts of the nature of the e-mails between him and Ms. Kelley. A law enforcement official has described some of them as sexually explicit. Pentagon officials briefed on the matter say they have been told that half a dozen are embarrassing. But General Allen’s associates say they are innocuous and contain little beyond language like “you’re a sweetheart.” \n \n Although Ms. Kelley’s e-mail correspondence with General Allen has not been made public, dozens of her e-mails to Mayor Bob Buckhorn of Tampa have been released under Florida’s public record laws and refer to her friendship with both General Allen and Mr. Petraeus. \n \n A year ago, after inviting the mayor to a birthday party for one of her children, she added a casual P.S.: “I’ll be in DC this weekend with Petraeus, but let’s set up a double date when I return!” Last January, she wrote to a mayoral aide, “I’m up in DC having dinner tonight with Gen. Petraeus and Gen. John Allen.”', 'A test to determine if elderly patients will die within 30 days of being admitted to hospital has been developed by doctors to give them the chance to go home or say goodbye to loved ones. \n \n Health experts say the checklist will prevent futile and expensive medical treatments which merely prolong suffering. \n \n The screening test looks at 29 indicators of health, including age, frailty, illness, mental impairment, previous emergency admissions and heart rate and produces a percentage chance of death within one month and 12 weeks. \n \n Researchers say the aim of Critera for Screening and Triaging to Appropriate aLternative care, or CriSTAL for short, is to kick-start frank discussions about end of life care, and minimise the risk of invasive ineffective treatment. \n \n “Delaying unavoidable death contributes to unsustainable and escalating healthcare costs, despite aggressive and expensive interventions,” said lead author Dr Magnolia Cardona-Morrel, a researcher at the University of New South Wales. \n \n “These interventions may not influence patient outcome; often do not improve the patient’s quality of life; may compromise bereavement outcomes for families; and cause frustration for health professionals.” \n \n Earlier this week Professor Sir Mike Richards, the Chief Inspector of Hospitals for the Care Quality Commission, warned that dying patients are receiving wide variations in care because of hospital failure to replace the Liverpool Care Pathway. \n \n The controversial end-of-life plan was scrapped after a review of the regime found that hospital staff wrongly interpreted its guidance for care of the dying, leading to patients being drugged and deprived of fluids in their last weeks of life. \n \n The Health Select Committee is currently examining palliative and end of life care in the wake of the LCP controversy. \n \n However the new test aims to provide a ‘starting point’ for ‘honest communication with patients and families about recognising that dying is part of the life cycle’ \n \n Researchers looked at 112 peer-reviewed studies to find out which tests and questions were the best predictors of death. \n \n They claim the test will help doctors and nurses who are often under great pressure from family members and society to prolong the life of patients at all costs. \n \n “While there are accepted policies for de-escalating treatment in terminally ill patients, there are also inherent and societal pressures on medicine to continue utilising technological advances to prolong life even in plainly futile situations,” said Dr Cardona-Morrel. \n \n “Training for nurses and doctors in the use of the screening tool and in approaching patients and families with concrete information about inevitability of death and lack of benefit of further intensive treatment are paramount.” \n \n Most patients end up dying in hospital, even though that is not their stated preference, when asked. \n \n Caroline Abrahams, Charity Director at Age UK, said:“The best time to begin discussing end of life issues and an older person’s wishes, is well in advance, when they are fit and well, but we acknowledge that this isn’t always possible. \n \n “The ability to accurately identify people entering hospital who are nearing the end of their lives ought to help ensure they receive high quality care, appropriate to their needs, so we welcome this development. However, in practice, access to good end of life care services remains extremely variable and discussions with older people and their families about this most difficult of subjects are not always handled sensitively and well. \n \n “So as well as improved analysis and triage of people’s needs, better training and support for medical staff in speaking compassionately with older people and their families about end of life care is also required. “ \n \n By giving families and patients some options about the preferred place of death, the test could also help terminally ill elderly people choose to go home, the authors said. \n \n The checklist is yet to be tested but the researchers hope it will eventually be used for all hospital admissions. \n \n The research was published in the BMJ Open publication Supportive & Palliative Care.']",2,"– The Pentagon inspector general’s office didn't take the Gen. John Allen-Jill Kelley email exchange lightly, assigning 15 investigators toiling seven days a week to review the thousands of pages of documents. They've now sussed out between 60 and 70 emails that ""bear a fair amount of scrutiny,"" according to a defense official, who didn't elaborate on what those emails might contain. The New York Times reports the purpose of the investigation, which likely won't conclude until 2013, is to determine if one of three violations occurred: misconduct (ie, adultery or inappropriate language), substantial use of government property for personal matters, or a security breach. Those investigators aren't the only ones getting busy. A previously silent Kelley is now defending herself, through her attorney. Abbe Lowell, a big-time Washington lawyer who has represented Bill Clinton and John Edwards, yesterday released emails, phone recordings, and more evidence that, he says, prove Kelley did not try to exploit her relationship with David Petraeus. He also sent out three letters connected to the scandal, the AP reports: He asked the US Attorney's Office in Tampa why Kelley's name was released in the first place, adding that federal privacy laws could apply. He wrote another letter to a businessman Kelley was trying to help make a deal with South Korea, before she lost her honorary consul status. The businessman, Adam Victor, has said in interviews that Kelley was not a skilled negotiator, and Lowell says he defamed her in an attempt to bask in his ""15 minutes of fame."" In a letter to the Attorney Consumer Assistance Program (which fields complaints about lawyers), Lowell accuses attorney Barry Cohen of talking publicly about conversations he had with Kelley in 2009, thus breaking attorney-client privilege."
139,"['Sept. 6, 2017: A recently filed lawsuit in Dallas County District Court blames negligence on behalf of the Boy Scouts of America for the death of Reid Comita, a Fort Worth teen. (Photo: WFAA) \n \n DALLAS-- A recently filed lawsuit in Dallas County District Court blames negligence on behalf of the Boy Scouts of America for the death of a Fort Worth teen three months ago. \n \n Reid Comita,15, died from heat stroke while hiking at Buffalo Trail Scout Ranch in June. \n \n ""The Boy Scouts of America are responsible for my son\'s death. It\'s that simple. They are responsible,"" John Comita told WFAA in a sit-down interview. \n \n The new lawsuit outlines a series of allegations surrounding Reid\'s death, namely that he was ""...sent on an extremely aggressive hike"" in temperatures hovering around 100 degrees with a heat index well over that. \n \n The Comita family had specifically signed Reid up for an introductory backpacking class, under adult supervision, because they felt it was the safest option for their son. \n \n ""He wasn\'t an athlete. He wasn\'t prepared to go on an advanced hike,"" his father said. \n \n Photos from the camp\'s Facebook page show rugged, mountainous terrain meandering through Jeff Davis County in southwest Texas. \n \n The petition further contends that Reid didn\'t receive proper training at the camp before being sent out on the more advanced hike and that he was accompanied by only two other teenagers, not the required two adults. \n \n The circumstances have left Copper Comita, Reid\'s mother, baffled, angry and crushed. \n \n ""It doesn\'t take it away. It doesn\'t make it any better. It\'s just that much more pain,"" said Copper. \n \n The lawsuit also outlines communication issues, claiming the Comita family wasn\'t notified of his death for more than four hours. \n \n ""We were calling, and no one could give us a straight answer as to how he was,"" said Copper. \n \n The backpacking course would have been Reid\'s final task to accomplish Eagle Scout. His troop has since awarded him the honor posthumously. \n \n ""His friends, his troop, have been great,"" says John. ""But we haven\'t heard from the BSA or organization at all."" \n \n The BSA sent WFAA the following statement: \n \n “This remains a difficult time for our Scouting community, and we continue to keep the family in our thoughts and prayers. The health and safety of our youth members is of paramount importance to the BSA, and integral to everything we do. We strive to create a safe environment for youth to experience outdoor adventure."" \n \n For Copper, the loss of a son who excelled in studies and choir when he wasn\'t earning merit badges, is a void that simply can\'t be filled. \n \n ""He was very special,"" she said. \n \n John says he grew up participating in the Boy Scouts, and that he always felt it was something he could proudly share with his son. \n \n ""It was great bonding for us,"" he said.

""The Boy Scouts of America are responsible for my son's death. It's that simple,"" father John Comita tells WFAA. Reid's parents are suing Boy Scouts of America, accusing them of being negligent by sending the boy on an ""extremely aggressive hike"" through rugged terrain in southwest Texas on a day when temperatures were around 100 degrees.

John Comita says the family signed Reid up for the course—which was supposed to include two days of training followed by a three-day hike—because they thought it was the safest option, but he was immediately sent on the hike, reports the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. The lawsuit also faults the Boy Scouts for sending Reid on a hike with two other teenagers, a 14-year-old and an 18-year-old, instead of the two adults that regulations require.

140,"['Jihan Nassar, a homemaker in Corona, Calif., is listed as a $500 donor to the campaign of Florida Gov. Charlie Crist. But she insists she never gave a dime. \n \n \'\'I can\'t make any donations, financially,\'\' Nassar said Friday. ""We never made any donations, sir. I have no idea what you are talking about.\'\' \n \n Nassar and her husband, Waleed, are among more than three dozen California donors listed as giving to Crist\'s campaign on June 19, 2006 -- donations bundled by a controversial Delray Beach defense contractor now under scrutiny for contributions to GOP presidential candidate John McCain. \n \n On Thursday, the McCain campaign said it would return $50,000 in donations tied to businessman Harry Sargeant III, finance chairman of the Florida Republican Party and a college buddy of Crist\'s. Sargeant has said the California donors were solicited by a business partner, Mustafa Abu Naba\'a, a Jordanian with an apartment in Miami-Dade, records show. \n \n McCain -- a champion of campaign-finance reform in the U.S. Senate -- said he would return the donations after news articles in the Washington Post and the New York Times raised questions about their legitimacy. \n \n In a letter to the donors, the campaign warned that foreign nationals cannot donate money to U.S. campaigns and contributors cannot be reimbursed by another donor as a way to get around contribution limits. \n \n Some donors whose contributions are being returned by McCain\'s campaign were also listed as contributors to Crist on June 19, 2006. \n \n That day, Crist received more than $25,000 in contributions from California, records show, including $500 checks from two stereo stores and two Wienerschnitzel hot-dog restaurants outside Los Angeles. \n \n Zouhair El Srouji, a 40-year-old accountant in Wildomar, Calif., initially told a reporter on Friday that he had no memory of a $500 donation to the Florida governor. \n \n After reviewing campaign records, however, he said he recalled that a campaign contribution was requested by his employer -- though he couldn\'t recall who asked him to give. \n \n \'\'It took a lot of convincing, but they said he was a good man and needed our help, and I guess I\'m a sucker for helping good people,\'\' El Srouji said. \n \n Reached briefly to talk about his just-announced Dec. 12 wedding date with fiancee Carole Rome, Crist said he wasn\'t familiar with the specifics and referred questions to his former campaign manager, George LeMieux. \'\'It\'s all good,\'\' Crist said. \n \n Earlier in the week, he called Sargeant ""a great patriot.\'\' \n \n LeMieux said he would review the donations highlighted by The Miami Herald. \n \n He said every effort was made during the campaign to verify all donations and make sure they did not exceed campaign finance limits. Crist received more than 18,000 checks in the Republican primary, he said. \n \n \'\'With that volume of checks, we\'re not going to know everyone who gives money,\'\' LeMieux said. ""I remember many a long weekend trying to look up information about donors on the Internet.\'\' \n \n The controversy over the donations comes at an awkward time for Crist, one of several politicians auditioning to be McCain\'s vice-presidential candidate. \n \n Sargeant, a fraternity brother of Crist\'s at Florida State University, was one of the governor\'s biggest supporters in the 2006 campaign, and he has emerged in recent months as a top fundraiser for McCain as well. \n \n Sargeant is among 63 McCain fundraisers nationwide who have bundled more than $500,000 in checks each. Donations to presidential candidates are capped at $2,300, but bundlers get around the limit by collecting checks from friends, business associates and relatives. \n \n Sargeant also donated $30,000 of his own money to a joint McCain-GOP fund in May, records show. Before turning his attention to McCain, Sargeant also raised money for presidential candidates Rudy Giuliani and Hillary Clinton. \n \n On March 5 -- the same day President Bush received McCain at the White House as the GOP\'s presumptive nominee -- Sargeant hosted a fundraiser for McCain at his $8.3 million Delray Beach home. \n \n Sid Dinerstein, chairman of the Palm Beach County Republican Party, attended the affair at the waterfront home. He said McCain is \'\'bending over backwards\'\' by returning contributions. \n \n \'\'By giving the money back he is raising flags that weren\'t even there,\'\' Dinerstein said. ""John McCain puts the ethics bar higher than anyone in national politics.\'\' \n \n Sargeant could not be reached for comment on Friday, and a lawyer for his company did not respond to a list of e-mailed questions. \n \n Tallahassee lobbyist Brian Ballard, a top fundraiser for both Crist and McCain, said the reason Sargeant took the position as the state GOP\'s finance chairman was simple: Crist asked him to do it. \n \n Sargeant was not involved in President Bush\'s campaigns, which took the practice of bundling to new heights by designating its biggest givers as \'\'Rangers\'\' and ""Pioneers.\'\' \n \n \'\'Harry does politics now only because his friend of 30 years asked him to take this role,\'\' Ballard said. ""He\'s very much apolitical. He runs tankers and ports.\'\' \n \n Under Sargeant\'s leadership, the Republican Party of Florida raised $15 million in 2007, a record for a nonelection year. Chairman Jim Greer said he has no reason to review the checks Sargeant has delivered to the party. \n \n \'\'He continues to have my full support and appreciation for his service,\'\' Greer said. ""He\'s very dedicated and exhibited a high degree of integrity.\'\' \n \n For someone at the top of the fundraising heap, Sargeant has kept a low profile. Several activists and fundraisers who have been involved in Republican politics for years said they had never met him. \n \n But Sargeant\'s business has received some unwanted attention. \n \n Sargeant is a partner with Abu Naba\'a in International Oil Trading Co., a Boca Raton firm with Defense Department contracts to ship oil to the military in Iraq. Federal records show the company received $601 million in the 2007 budget year. \n \n In June, U.S. Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., head of a congressional oversight committee, sent a letter to Sargeant seeking records in a probe of alleged overcharging of the military for fuel costs. \n \n Sargeant and Abu Naba\'a have also been accused of fraud by the brother-in-law of the king of Jordan, who filed a lawsuit in West Palm Beach in April saying the pair cut him out of the Pentagon contracts after he helped them secure the deal. \n \n The ex-partner, Mohammad Al-Saleh, said he helped the company win the blessing of the Jordanian government to ship the oil through that country to Iraq -- a requirement of the Pentagon contracts, according to the suit. Al-Saleh said Sargeant and Abu Naba\'a failed to pay him at least $13 million. \n \n In court papers, lawyers for Sargeant and Abu Naba\'a denied any wrongdoing and said the suit should be moved to Jordan. Sargeant and his family also own domestic shipping and asphalt companies, records show.', 'You\'ve probably never heard of Marty Martin. He spent most of his life as an anonymous CIA operative. But he very recently came out of the closet as the man Bush put in charge of finding Osama bin Laden in the aftermath of 9/11, and guess what? It turns out the man Bush put in charge of finding bin Laden is an extremely shady and allegedly corrupt war profiteer. Who would have thought? \n \n Martin, of course, never succeeded in catching bin Laden. He ran the CIA\'s bin Laden unit from 2002 to 2004, a fact that we now know only because he emerged to grab some credit for bin Laden\'s death and celebrate the agency\'s discontinued torture program: ""We got beat up for it, but those efforts led to this great day,"" he told the Associated Press three weeks ago. Prior to that, he was just a nondescript former agency official who went into the security consulting business after retiring. The closest hint to just how key an official he was came from references to a ""Marty M.""—described as a sort of Jack Bauer of the bayou—in former CIA director George Tenet\'s memoir. \n \n Now that we know who Martin really is, we can get a sense of what kind of guy Bush turned to for arguably the most crucial job in the war on terror. \n \n 1. The Kind of Guy Who Bilks Taxpayers for His Own Enrichment \n \n In 2007, after leaving the CIA, Martin joined International Oil Trading Company, a Florida company that delivered fuel to U.S. forces in the Middle East. In 2008, congressional investigators accused it of ripping off the Pentagon to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars. This year, the Pentagon\'s own audit found that the company overcharged the government by as much as $204 million on a series of massive Iraq war fuel contracts. \n \n 2. The Kind of Guy Who Bribes Foreign Officials \n \n According to a Florida lawsuit against International Oil\'s owner Harry Sargeant III, Martin paid a $9 million bribe to the head of the Jordanian intelligence service back in 2007 to secure his company\'s exclusive rights to ship fuel across Jordan to U.S bases in Iraq. (That allegation comes from the Jordanian king\'s brother-in-law, Mohammad al-Saleh, who is suing Sargeant for purportedly screwing him out of a $100 million stake in the company.) \n \n 3. The Kind of Guy Who Helps Launder Illegal Political Contributions \n \n In 2008, the Washington Post reported that Sargeant, a billionaire, raised funds for John McCain\'s presidential campaign with help from an unnamed ""former head of the bin Laden unit"" who worked for him. The men reportedly skirted campaign finance laws by funneling the money through Arab-American ""straw donors."" McCain quickly returned $50,000 of Sargeant\'s lucre. The Post never named the ex-chief of the CIA bin Laden unit involved in the fundraising, but unless two former heads of the bin Laden unit were working for Sargeant at the time, that man was Marty Martin. \n \n 4. The Kind of Guy Who Gets Totally Psyched When People Die In a War He Profits From \n \n In a court filing last week, attorneys for al-Saleh quoted from an e-mail that Martin wrote to Sargeant in 2008 in which he appeared to gloat over the escalation of violence in Iraq: \n \n Fyi, word of a \'re-surge\' is floating around amidst shit hitting the fan in Iraq today. ☺ \n \n The ""shit hitting the fan"" was the Battle of Basra, the Iraqi Army\'s attempt in March 2008 to finally roll up militias loyal to Moqtada al Sadr. It was widely seen as a debacle and victory for al-Sadr, and many feared the conflict threatened to reignite the civil war. That month, 40 Americans died in Iraq. ☺! \n \n In other words, he\'s a former CIA agent. Anyway, that\'s Marty Martin, the guy Bush put in charge of the bin Laden hunt. Glad it worked out for him. \n \n Harry Sargeant\'s lawyers couldn\'t be reached for comment on this story. The CIA declined to comment. And Marty Martin\'s bin Laden-hunting predecessor, Michael Scheuer –- who served for two years as a special adviser to Martin\'s unit –- claims to have never heard of Marty Martin (which we can only presume is a CIA first-rule-of-Fight-Club omerta thing). Reached on his phone, Martin said: ""No no, man. I don\'t want to talk to you, man,"" and hung up before we had a chance to ask a question. \n \n [Image via AP]', 'A member of Jordan’s royal family is accusing an American oilman and former GOP fundraiser of bribing the Jordanian government to facilitate his fuel shipments through the country to U.S. forces in Iraq. \n \n The allegation emerged in a civil lawsuit pitting the billionaire American businessman, Harry Sargeant III, against an ex-business partner, Mohammad al-Saleh, the brother-in-law of Jordan’s King Abdullah II. \n \n Al-Saleh, the plaintiff in the case first reported by NBC News in May 2008, claims that he was cut out of a lucrative one-third share in Sargeant’s firm, the International Oil Trading Co., based in Boca Raton, Fla., and replaced by an ex-CIA official with deep contacts in the Jordanian government. \n \n The crux of the bribery allegation involves a $9 million wire transfer from Sargeant’s firm, directed to a mysterious figure in Jordan’s intelligence agency identified in court documents only as “Pasha.” \n \n Sargeant’s lawyers acknowledge that “Pasha” was “possibly” Gen.

A source inside the Jordanian government confirmed that. \n \n Kickback or legitimate payment? \n \n Al-Saleh’s lawyers argue in court documents that the money was a kickback to curry favor with the GID and secure Sargeant’s continued use of Jordanian thoroughfares to ship fuel to U.S. bases in western Iraq. \n \n Sargeant’s lawyers insist the $9 million was payment to a “quasi-government” Jordanian company that was a subcontractor for Sargeant’s firm and deny any wrongdoing by their client. \n \n Sargeant, a retired Marine pilot and former official of the Florida state GOP, was once among the Pentagon’s closest business partners, winning billions of dollars in fuel contracts in the Iraq war. But fallout from the contracts has eroded Sargeant’s reputation. \n \n A congressional probe led by Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., concluded in October 2008 that Sargeant had exploited his close ties with the Jordanian monarchy to win an exclusive license — a so-called letter of authorization that permitted his company to ship the fuel through Jordan to Iraq, as the contracts required. \n \n Sargeant used his “effective monopoly” over the supply routes to grossly overcharge the Pentagon, Waxman wrote in a letter to Defense Secretary Robert Gates. Waxman called it “the worst form of war profiteering.” \n \n Shortly after the probe, Sargeant resigned as the finance chairman of the Florida Republican Party. \n \n Last month, a Pentagon audit requested by Waxman found that Sargeant was overpaid by as much as $204 million for the fuel contracts, which were worth nearly $2.7 billion over six years. The Defense Department accepted Sargeant’s inflated prices because no other competitor could get the letter of authorization from the Jordanian government, the audit said. \n \n Ex-CIA agent hired \n \n Now Al-Saleh’s lawsuit is dredging up new information about Sargeant’s dealings with the Jordanian government. \n \n Among other things, court records indicate that Sargeant hired Marty Martin, a former member of the CIA’s Senior Intelligence Service, to help manage his oil firm in 2007. Martin — identified in court documents as a former Middle East CIA station chief — leveraged his contacts in the Arab world to cement Sargeant’s relationship with the Jordanian government, even as the king’s brother-in-law was being forced out of the oil company and defrauded, al-Saleh’s lawyers contend. \n \n The money transfer at the core of the bribery allegation is revealed in a November 2007 email from Martin to a representative of the Jordanian intelligence service. In it, Martin wrote that $4.5 million had been “transferred to the designated account for the Pasha’s attention.” \n \n Three days later, Martin wrote again to confirm that a “second tranche of $4.5 million should also hit your account today.” He added, “Please advise Pasha.” \n \n A high-placed source inside the Jordanian government confirmed that the “Pasha” alluded to in the emails was Dahabi, then head of the GID. The source, who requested anonymity, said the payments were “being made to the GID,” and added, “A simple trace on the wires will easily reveal who the beneficiaries were and the bank account details.” \n \n The GID is the Jordanian counterpart to the CIA, and the two agencies have reportedly cooperated in the secret rendition of terrorist suspects. In a report this year, Human Rights Watch portrayed the GID as a vast shadow force in Jordan, harassing dissidents and “influenc(ing) decisions in most aspects of Jordanian public life.” \n \n Violation of anti-bribery law alleged \n \n Al-Saleh’s lawyers allege in court documents that Martin’s payments to the GID may have violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. \n \n But Sargeant’s lawyers, Mark Tuohey and Roger Kobert, said the wires were destined for Taurus Trading Co., a Jordanian firm that provided ground services for Sargeant as a subcontractor. The lawyers characterized Taurus Trading Co. as a “quasi-government entity” and said the Jordanian government was a paid third party in Sargeant’s defense work. Taurus Trading Co. did not respond to emails requesting comment, nor did the Jordanian Embassy in Washington. \n \n Asked why the director of the GID would be involved in the wire transfers, Kobert responded, “You’d have to ask him.” \n \n Dahabi, who was the GID’s director in 2007, did not answer calls to his cellphone. \n \n Martin did not reply to emails or phone calls seeking comment. \n \n Sargeant’s lawyers accuse al-Saleh’s side of taking the wire transfers out of context. “They try to make something very mundane and boring sound sexy,” said Kobert. “It’s not sexy.” \n \n Al-Saleh’s lawyers have cited another email that they argue shows Martin plotting to cut al-Saleh out of his one-third stake in the oil firm.']",3,"– A CIA operative in charge of hunting down Osama bin Laden is a war profiteer who helped bilk the Pentagon out of some $200 million, reports Gawker. Marty Martin was put in charge of tracking down the terror mastermind from 2002-2004, and boasted to the AP that those early efforts ""led to this great day"" the day bin Laden was killed by Navy SEALs. After he left the CIA, Martin joined International Oil Trading Company, a Florida operation that delivered fuel to US forces in the Middle East, a company accused by both Congress and the Pentagon of grossly overcharging the government, to the tune of $204 million. Martin was also accused in a Florida lawsuit of paying a $9 million bribe to Jordanian officials to win exclusive fuel shipping rights, and has been linked to dirty campaign contributions given to (and returned by) John McCain during his bid for the presidency. Contacted by Gawker to comment on the various charges, Martin responded: ""No no, man. I don't want to talk to you, man."""

The Mormon church is taking another step in its push to be more transparent, and is releasing... (Associated Press) \n \n The new photos peel back another layer of secrecy for a relatively young world religion that has come under scrutiny for some of its beliefs as its numbers swelled in the Internet age. \n \n The pictures of the smooth, egg-sized rock are part of a new book that also contains photos of the first printer\'s manuscript of the Book of Mormon. Officials with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints unveiled the photos at a news conference in Salt Lake City. \n \n The religion\'s drive in recent years to open its vaults and clarify sensitive tenets is aimed at filling a void on the Internet for accurate information as curiosity increased while church membership tripled to 15 million over the past three decades, Mormon scholars said. \n \n Church historian Steven E. Snow acknowledged that dynamic, saying: ""The Internet brings both challenge and opportunities. We\'re grateful for the opportunity to share much of collection through the use of the Internet."" \n \n The church\'s campaign seems aimed at preventing current members from leaving and showing non-Mormons the faith has nothing to hide, said Terryl Givens, professor of literature and religion and the James Bostwick chair of English at the University of Richmond. \n \n As an American-born religion much younger than most world religions, the origins of Mormonism have come under greater scrutiny and put pressure on the church to prove its stories, Givens said. \n \n ""The other churches\' origins are concealed by the mist of history,"" Givens said. ""Mormonism is the first world religion in which the origins were exposed to public view, to documentation, to journalists and newspaper reporting."" \n \n The pictures in the new book show different angles of a stone that is dark brown with lighter brown swirls. The photos also show a weathered leather pouch where the stone was stored that is believed to be made by one of Joseph Smith\'s wives, Emma Smith. \n \n The church has always possessed the stone, which was transported across the country during Mormon pioneers\' trek from Illinois to Utah in the mid-1800s. But it decided to publish the photos to allow people who prefer visuals to words to better understand the religion\'s roots, said Richard Turley, assistant church historian. The stone will remain in the vault. \n \n ""The picture brings a kind of tangibility to something that has been previously been talked about just in words,"" Turley said. ""That helps people connect with the past."" \n \n Mormons believe that 185 years ago, Smith found gold plates engraved with writing in ancient Egyptian in upstate New York. They say God helped him translate the text using the stone and other tools, and it became known as the Book of Mormon. \n \n The manuscript in the new book belongs to the Community of Christ, a faith that was created by early Mormons who stayed behind when most members of the religion moved west to Utah. A Community of Christ leader joined LDS officials at the press event Tuesday in what both said demonstrated the two faiths have moved on from past squabbles. \n \n The church has been releasing books containing historical documents that shed light on how Smith formed the faith. It also has issued a series of in-depth articles that explain or clarify some of the more sensitive parts of the religion\'s history that it once sidestepped, such as its past ban on black men in the lay clergy and its early history of polygamy. \n \n The church paid a price for its past decisions to stay silent on topics or keep key artifacts in the vault, said Richard Bushman, a Mormon historian and emeritus professor at Columbia University. \n \n ""Their faithful members would stumble on information on the Internet. Not having heard about them, they were shocked and disillusioned,"" Bushman said. \n \n Today the church is taking a new approach by saying, ""We can face up to the facts. We don\'t have to make the picture prettier than it is,"" he said.', 'A ""series of miraculous events"" led to the Book of Mormon first being made available for the public to purchase on March 26, 1830. \n \n It takes an average of five years to translate and produce the Book of Mormon in another language, according to LDS Church Public Affairs. \n \n Yet as the Book of Mormon Translation topic page on lds.org states, Joseph Smith translated “almost all of the present Book of Mormon text” from the gold plates in just three months, from April to June of 1829 — long before computers, electronic encyclopedias and the Internet. \n \n That “series of miraculous events,” as the topic page refers to it, involved in the translation of the text came to a climax 185 years ago today on March 26, 1830, when the Book of Mormon was first made available for the public to purchase. \n \n Although all the details of exactly how Joseph translated the Book of Mormon are not known, Elder Neal A. Maxwell of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles pointed out in a 1997 Ensign article (“By the Gift and Power of God”) that this might have been intentional. \n \n “Perhaps the Lord wanted to leave the Book of Mormon in the realm of faith, though it is drenched with intrinsic evidence,” he wrote. \n \n Elder Maxwell indicated, however, that there is value in learning more about the Prophet Joseph, the translation process and those who assisted. \n \n “Our primary focus in studying the Book of Mormon should be on the principles of the gospel anyway, not on the process by which the book came forth,” Elder Maxwell wrote. “Yet because its coming so amply fulfilled Isaiah’s prophecy of a ‘marvellous work and a wonder,’ we may find strengthened faith in considering how marvelous and wondrous the translation really was.” \n \n \'By the gift and power of God\' \n \n Among those who have wondered about the specific details of the Book of Mormon\'s translation was Hyrum Smith, an older brother of the Prophet Joseph. \n \n According to “History of the Church,” Joseph responded to his brother\'s curiosity by saying that “it was not intended to tell the world all the particulars of the coming forth of the Book of Mormon” and “it was not expedient for him to relate these things.” \n \n “Thus what we do know about the actual coming forth of the Book of Mormon is adequate, but it is not comprehensive,” Elder Maxwell wrote. \n \n Robin Jensen, associate managing historian and project archivist for the Joseph Smith Papers, said in an interview with the Deseret News that because the Prophet Joseph didn’t leave a detailed account of the translation process, historians and members of the church must rely on the reminiscences of scribes and those who witnessed the translation in order to understand the mechanics. \n \n Jensen said that in his studying of the process, he has come to see the translation as a “development” with multiple “different phases” in which Joseph “grew and developed and better understood his role.” \n \n It was a “monumental task” as Joseph was asked to “render into his own language an entire volume of scripture amounting to more than 500 printed pages,” the lds.org topic page states. So “God prepared additional, practical help in the form of physical instruments” to aid in the different phases of the translation process. \n \n “The Book of Mormon tells us the way is prepared for this record to be translated, and that’s a very physical, very mechanical process, much more so than we perhaps might envision that,” Jensen said. \n \n The topic page refers specifically to two types of instruments. The first, known as the Urim and Thummim, was “a clear pair of stones bound together with a metal rim” that was found in the Hill Cumorah with the gold plates. \n \n “The Book of Mormon referred to this instrument, together with its breastplate, as a device ‘kept and preserved by the hand of the Lord’ and ‘handed down from generation to generation, for the purpose of interpreting languages,’” the topic page states. \n \n The second, known as a seer stone, was a “small oval stone” that Joseph “discovered in the ground years before he retrieved the gold plates,” according to the lds.org topic page, that he later learned could be used in the translation process. Jensen said the idea of seer stones was common during Joseph’s time. They were seen as “a way to confront the spiritual, supernatural world.” \n \n Witnesses of the translation process recorded that “when Joseph looked into the instruments, the words of scripture appeared in English,” according to the topic page. \n \n Joseph was in his early 20s at the time and had “very little formal education and was incapable of writing a book on his own, let alone translating an ancient book written from an unknown language,” according to the topic page. \n \n Joseph repeatedly testified that it was “by the gift and power of God” that he was able to complete the translation, a fact his wife, Emma, affirmed. \n \n “The Book of Mormon is of divine authenticity — I have not the slightest doubt of it,” Emma told their son Joseph III on one occasion. “I am satisfied that no man could have dictated the writing of the manuscripts unless he was inspired; for, when acting as his scribe, your father would dictate to me for hour after hour; and when returning after meals, or after interruptions, he would at once begin where he had left off, without either seeing the manuscript or having any portion of it read to him.” \n \n The topic page also asserts the idea that the original Book of Mormon manuscript, 28 percent of which has survived through the years, also supports statements that Joseph dictated the text from another language in a short period of time. \n \n “For example, it includes errors that suggest the scribe heard words incorrectly rather than misread words copied from another manuscript,” the topic page states. “In addition, some grammatical constructions that are more characteristic of Near Eastern languages than English appear in the original manuscript, suggesting that the base language of the translation was not English.” \n \n ‘Days never to be forgotten’ \n \n Joseph may have been the one called to translate the Book of Mormon, but Jensen emphasized that he was not completely alone in the process. \n \n “We have a lot of faithful individuals who believed in the Book of Mormon, believed in the power of the Book of Mormon and who were willing to put up with a lot of drudgery, and then of course later in church history, a lot of trial, a lot of hardship,” Jensen said. \n \n Jensen highlighted Joseph\'s scribes as examples of others who performed “time-intensive” work during the process. \n \n Oliver Cowdery is known as the primary scribe for the original manuscript of the Book of Mormon, but many others took up a quill to assist Joseph during the translation, according to Jensen. They include Martin Harris, a friend of Joseph’s who later was one of the Three Witnesses to the Book of Mormon and who financed the printing; Emma Smith; Samuel Smith, one of Joseph’s younger brothers; Reuben Hale, Joseph’s brother-in-law; and Christian Whitmer, one of the sons of the Whitmer family who allowed Joseph to finish translating in their home in Fayette, New York. Christian’s brother John Whitmer also may have served as scribe for a time, and there is handwriting of an additional unidentified scribe found in the original manuscript. \n \n After completing the first manuscript, Joseph also asked Cowdery to take charge on creating a second copy of the text to provide to E.B. Grandin’s printing office in Palmyra, New York. Although Hyrum Smith and another unidentified scribe assisted, Cowdery wrote the bulk of the scripture by hand twice, according to Jensen. \n \n “Think of the hand cramps that Oliver Cowdery had to endure,” Jensen said. \n \n But for Cowdery, the opportunity to assist with the translation and publication of the Book of Mormon was a treasured one. \n \n “These were days never to be forgotten — to sit under the sound of a voice dictated by the inspiration of heaven,” Cowdery said, according to the translation topic page. \n \n The “drudgery” that set the stage for the coming forth of the Book of Mormon extended into the realm of housework and farm chores. One person known for providing assistance with the everyday matters was Mary Whitmer, the mother of the Whitmer family. \n \n Jensen said Mary Whitmer’s grandson John C. Whitmer told of her being “bogged down” with the additional cooking, cleaning and other house chores that came as a result of Joseph and other visitors staying in her home during the translation process. One day while she was milking the cows, Mary Whitmer saw an angel who acknowledged her hard work and proceeded to show her the gold plates. \n \n “From that moment, my grandmother was enabled to perform her household duties with comparative ease, and she felt no more inclination to murmur because her lot was hard,” said John C. Whitmer, as cited in an article Jensen wrote titled “A Bit of Old String” on history.lds.org. \n \n Jensen also pointed out that contributions were even made by some who didn’t believe in the Book of Mormon as a book of divine origin, including John H. Gilbert, who was the principal typesetter at Grandin’s printing office. As Joseph dictated the translation to the scribes, he “did not call for punctuation.” Therefore, both the original manuscript and the printer’s manuscript were devoid of it, according to the topic page. The task of punctuating the Book of Mormon and setting the type, letter by letter, was left to Gilbert, a job he “took pride” in later in life, Jensen said. \n \n The Book of Mormon today \n \n The Book of Mormon has gone a long way since it first hit the shelves of Grandin’s bookshop in the small town of Palmyra, New York. More than 168 million copies have been distributed since March 1830, according to LDS Church Public Affairs, and an average of 4.5 million physical copies are distributed each year. With 110 different language translations of the book and digital translations available in 40 different languages on scriptures.lds.org and the Gospel Library app, the Book of Mormon continues to expand the church’s reach. \n \n “You could very much make the case that the LDS Church was founded on the publication of a book,” Jensen said. “Word of mouth only has a limited radius. It really was the publication of this book, and therefore this dissemination of this information through missionaries and others, that people began to hear about and then believe in Joseph Smith, his prophetic calling and the Restoration.” \n \n Email: wbutters@deseretnews.com, Twitter: WhitneyButters', 'Should the campus police at the University of Central Florida ever need a grenade launcher, one sits waiting in the department’s armory. Repurposed to fire tear-gas canisters, the weapon was used several years ago for training exercises, according to Richard Beary, the university’s chief of police. It hasn’t left storage since. \n \n At Central Florida, which has an enrollment of nearly 60,000 and a Division I football team, the device was acquired, a police spokeswoman said, for “security and crowd control.” But the university’s police force isn’t the only one to have come upon a grenade launcher. Hinds Community College—located in western Mississippi, with a student population of 11,000—had one too. (Campus police officers at Hinds declined to comment. A woman who worked for the department but declined to identify herself said that the launcher had been repurposed to shoot flares but that the college no longer possessed it.) \n \n Both institutions received their launchers from the same source: the Department of Defense. At least 117 colleges have acquired equipment from the department through a federal program, known as the 1033 program, that transfers military surplus to law-enforcement agencies across the country, according to records The Chronicle received after filing Freedom of Information requests with state governments (see table of equipment). \n \n Campus police departments have used the program to obtain military equipment as mundane as men’s trousers (Yale University) and as serious as a mine-resistant, ambush-protected vehicle (Ohio State University). Along with the grenade launcher, Central Florida acquired 23 M-16 assault rifles from the Department of Defense. \n \n Ask participants in the program, and they’ll say it provides departments, particularly those with limited budgets like campus police forces, with necessary gear at very little cost (colleges pay only for shipping). Responsible departments, advocates say, develop plans for specific instances in which the equipment will be used—crowd-control situations, say, or active-shooter incidents like the Virginia Tech massacre. Outside of those cases, community members are unlikely to know that the gear even exists. \n \n But on campus and off, there are detractors. Some argue that the procurement of tactical gear doesn’t help with the types of crimes that occur more frequently on college campuses, like alcohol-related incidents and sexual assault. Others worry that military equipment is an especially poor fit for college campuses, fearing that it may have a chilling effect on free expression. \n \n The 1033 program has received heightened scrutiny in the wake of protests in Ferguson, Mo. After the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, reporters and phone-wielding protesters captured images of police officers armed with military-grade guns, camouflage, and armored vehicles. Observers characterized the police response as heavy-handed and criticized officers for improperly using their weaponry. \n \n In Washington renewed attention to the transfer of military weapons has led some lawmakers to call for a review of the 1033 program. Sen. Claire McCaskill, a Democrat from Missouri who heads the oversight subcommittee for the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, led a hearing on Tuesday to consider revisions in the program. She suggested that local police departments that enjoy cost savings from free military equipment be required to receive 200 hours of training. \n \n “If we’re gonna give you money, we’re going to make you jump through a few hoops first,” she said. \n \n Hilary O. Shelton, director of the NAACP’s Washington bureau, told the committee that if the 1033 program is to be continued, it should be restructured to focus on “protecting and serving citizens.” \n \n Advertisement \n \n Sen. Carl Levin, a Democrat from Michigan and chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, has said he plans to review the 1033 program before the Senate considers reauthorizing the annual military-spending bill. President Obama has also called for a review. \n \n Ms. McCaskill, Mr. Levin, and Mr. Obama joined Sen. Rand Paul, a Republican from Kentucky, and Rep. Hank Johnson, a Democrat from Georgia, in questioning the program. In an announcement that he would formally draft a bill in September imposing limits on the transfer of certain equipment—including armored vehicles and large-caliber weapons—Mr. Johnson mocked Ohio State’s procurement of its heavy-duty vehicle, known as an MRAP, through the 1033 program. \n \n ""Apparently, college kids are getting too rowdy,"" Mr. Johnson said. \n \n Significant Savings \n \n The scrutiny may be increasing now, but the 1033 program has been available to colleges for quite some time. In 1990, Congress passed a version of the National Defense Authorization Act that allowed for the transfer of excess Department of Defense equipment to federal and state agencies if gear was deemed “suitable for use by such agencies in counter-drug activities.” In 1996 the law was reauthorized, with Section 1033 allowing for the transfer of equipment for terrorism-related purposes as well. \n \n Now more than 8,000 federal and state law-enforcement agencies—many campus police departments among them—are eligible to participate. Participating agencies don’t buy equipment; they are given it. They are prohibited from reselling or leasing the gear, and required to provide updates on the location of “tactical” gear, like armored vehicles and weaponry. When a police department decides a piece of equipment has outlived its usefulness, it is returned to the government. \n \n After the buildup and winding down of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, the amount of surplus equipment available to law-enforcement agencies increased drastically. At colleges, where terrorist attacks and shootouts with drug cartels are virtually unheard of, the active-shooter scenario became the primary justification for colleges to acquire tactical gear. \n \n Central Florida got eight of its M-16 assault rifles in 2011, and 15 more were transferred to the department in February of the following year. At campus police departments, much like their counterparts at the local, state, and federal level, the most popular weapon procured through the 1033 program is the M-16 assault rifle. \n \n At least 60 institutions have acquired M-16s through the program. Arizona State University holds the most, with 70 in its arsenal, followed by Florida International University and the University of Maryland with 50 M-16s each. Central Florida received its grenade launcher in 2008; Hinds acquired its in 2006. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Gear through the 1033 program is free to participating departments, with receiving agencies having to pay only delivery and maintenance costs. The University of Louisiana at Monroe paid $507.43 for 12 M-16 rifles; the University of Alabama at Huntsville paid $220.40 for the transfer and shipping of five M-16s. \n \n “For me, this is a cost savings for taxpayers,” said Jen Day Shaw, associate vice president and dean of students at the University of Florida and chair of the Campus Safety Knowledge Community, a forum for members of Naspa: Student Affairs Administrators in Higher Education. When police departments “have the ability to get equipment that will help them do their jobs at a greatly reduced price,” Ms. Shaw said, “it is a benefit for the whole campus.” \n \n “It is a force multiplier for us,” said David Perry, chief of police at Florida State University and president of the International Association of Campus Law Enforcement Administrators. “Typically, we are not staffed at optimum levels. We are not given budgets comparable to some large cities and municipalities, so we need to find ways to make it reach.” \n \n Indeed, many police departments use the 1033 program to acquire basic supplies along with tactical equipment. “Aside from body armor and weapons,” Mr. Perry said, “there is furniture, hand sanitizers, bandages. There are all types of equipment, materials, and supplies we need to support our overall mission.” \n \n \'Better to Be Prepared\' \n \n At Central Florida, Chief Beary said, M-16 rifles are stored in vehicles for emergencies, like the one his officers responded to at midnight on March 18, 2013. Answering a call for a pulled fire alarm, officers eventually raided the dormitory room of James Seevakumaran, 30, and found a handgun, an assault rifle, more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition, and four homemade bombs. Mr. Seevakumaran was also in the room, dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The police said the would-be gunman had intended to force students into the hall with the fire alarm, where he would be waiting with his weapons. \n \n “What was once the unthinkable has become the inevitable,” Mr. Beary said. “These bad guys have plans and are heavily armed, and law enforcement needs to be able to keep up with them. In order to do that, police officers need to be highly trained, well equipped, and ready to respond to any scenario.” \n \n Michael Qualls, an associate professor of criminal justice at Fort Valley State University, in Georgia, agrees. A retired Army officer, Mr. Qualls worked for several campus police departments before he began teaching. “If we continue on with the 1033 program, as those items become obsolete at the military level and if they become available, why not get ’em?” Mr. Qualls said. “It’s better to be prepared than not prepared.” \n \n But seeing that much firepower on college campuses is worrisome to some observers like Peter Kraska, a professor at Eastern Kentucky University’s School of Justice Studies. Mr. Kraska has studied police militarization since the late 1980s. \n \n “The typical college-campus chief of police might say, ‘Look, we’ve had serious incidents occur around the country on college campuses,’” said Mr. Kraska. “The flaw in that thinking is that they are not going to be able to respond, even if they have all of that stuff. Those incidents are usually over very, very quickly”—25 minutes, tops. Longer than that, Mr. Kraska said, and the campus police will be joined by local and state law-enforcement officials, who will have greater capability and firepower. \n \n For Mary Anne Franks, an associate professor of law at the University of Miami, the possibility that an extraordinary event could occur doesn’t justify the procurement of assault rifles and armored vehicles. The real danger Ferguson residents faced came not from a terrorist attack, she said, but from police officers armed with this sort of equipment. \n \n Advertisement \n \n “Mostly, I’m wondering why,” she said. “As much as one might wonder about why major cities are getting this type of equipment—which I think we should wonder about and ask questions about—it seems even stranger to talk about it happening in voluntary communities that don’t experience much violent crime.” \n \n Ms. Franks raised another concern: As students become aware of the military gear some police departments possess, she said, that may curtail their willingness to express themselves and protest. \n \n “It’s not just the question of what happens in any one particular incident, but the tone it sets about what an environment needs to be,” Ms. Franks said. “This presumption of danger—this presumption of hostility—is really toxic in many ways and avoids the problems that the community might actually be suffering from.” \n \n \'A Profound Cultural Impact\' \n \n To alleviate some of the apprehension surrounding the use of military weapons on a college campus, said Linda J. Stump, the University of Florida’s police chief, transparency is key. The University of Florida police department acquired an armored truck in 2007 under the 1033 program. Ms. Stump said the vehicle would be deployed only during an active-shooter situation and never for a civil disturbance. \n \n Campus police officers are professionals, with processes in place to maintain their training levels, she said, and communities will be better served if departments explain that. \n \n Administrative oversight and communication are also necessary, said Mr. Perry of Florida State. Administrators outside the police department should be briefed not only on what type of equipment is being acquired but also on the circumstances under which such gear would be used. \n \n When the Florida State police department acquired a Humvee through the 1033 program, Mr. Perry said, he briefed administrators on the instances in which the vehicle would be used—in active-shooter scenarios, for example, but also during a hurricane or at events for community outreach. \n \n When Ms. Stump talks about the value of transparency, she’s also tackling the issue of training: Are college police officers experienced enough to handle assault rifles and other military gear? \n \n Yes, as long as they’ve had the training required for departmental accreditation, said Mr. Perry. \n \n To earn accreditation from the International Association of Campus Law Enforcement Administrators, for example, an organization must show proof that officers have attended training to use any new weapon, vehicle, or tool they acquire, Mr. Perry said. Training must be proctored by third-party instructors who know how to use the gear proficiently. Neither the Department of Defense nor the association administers the training. The Department of Defense does not require any training to obtain or keep the gear. \n \n “At a nonaccredited school, there is not an expectation for formalized policies and procedures,” Mr. Perry said. The association’s website lists 40 accredited college departments. Another group, the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies, has accredited 70 college police departments, according to its website. \n \n The University of Virginia’s police department purchased 12 M-16 rifles through the 1033 program, and the university converted them to patrol rifles—guns that cannot be fired automatically. Officers who are issued patrol rifles receive three levels of training, said Mike Coleman, a captain in the department. Training sessions cover marksmanship, safety, decision making, and threat identification. The police department at the University of Virginia is accredited by the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies, as is the University of Florida. \n \n “The public is not aware of much of the training that university police officers receive,” Mr. Coleman said. “Our department not only attends the same police academy that municipal officers attend; they teach at that academy.” \n \n Professors like Mr. Kraska remain concerned about how the 1033 program could affect campuses. \n \n “It can have a profound cultural impact on a small police department when you start adding weaponry, battle-dress uniforms, all the advanced military technologies,” he said. “That small agency can go rapidly from one of protecting and serving to one of viewing the community as the enemy, and a potential threat.” \n \n Lance Lambert and Max Lewontin contributed to this article.']",3,"– To most people, it just looks like a smooth, egg-sized rock, but it was part of the founding of the Mormon church and photos of it have now been published for the first time. The images of the ""seer stone"" that Mormons believe founder Joseph Smith used to translate buried gold plates he said he found in upstate New York 185 years ago were released as part of what the church says is an effort to be more transparent about its past, the AP reports. The photos have been published in a book that also includes pictures of the ""printer's manuscript"" of the Book of Mormon—a handwritten copy of the original manuscript that was produced by one of Smith's scribes. The book, which Smith said he translated from ""reformed Egyptian"" with the stone, recounts a visit from Jesus Christ to North America, reports the Salt Lake Tribune. As for the translation, the church has this to say: ""Joseph placed ... the seer stone in a hat, pressed his face into the hat to block out extraneous light, and read aloud the English words that appeared on the instrument."" It says the translation occurred over three months in 1829 as part of a ""a series of miraculous events."" Indeed: In March, the Deseret News reported that the church says it takes roughly five years to translate and then produce the Book of Mormon in another language. The church says it is trying to make its history more ""tangible"" with the release, but Terryl Givens, professor of literature and religion at the University of Richmond, tells the AP that the church is also trying to show skeptics it has nothing to hide. ""Other churches' origins are concealed by the mist of history. Mormonism is the first world religion in which the origins were exposed to public view, to documentation, to journalists, and newspaper reporting."" (Last year, the church admitted that Smith had up to 40 wives.)"

In the long run, the new measures announced by the government will benefit the economy,” said Edward Bell, commodity analyst from Emirates NBD. \n \n As part of the new reforms announced on Monday, tourism will be encouraged and new industries will be set up. \n \n “We have developed a case of oil addiction in Saudi Arabia,” Saudi Deputy Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman said in an interview to Al Arabiya Television. “I think by 2020, if oil stops we can survive,” he added. \n \n The government is undertaking reforms as oil prices slump due to over production and weak demand. \n \n In a landmark decision in December, the Saudi government cut subsidies and raised fuel prices by 50 per cent. \n \n “Being dependent of just one source of income makes an economy incredible vulnerable to price shocks and makes forward planning very difficult,” said Ole Hansen, an analyst from Saxo Bank. \n \n He said using the oil wealth to diversify is the only way forward for the economy to survive in the long term. \n \n “A fast growing population and no history of paying tax and jobs making little or no meaning, requires changes in order to compete in the global market place.” \n \n According to a report issued by the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in December it may take many years for oil prices to recover and reach the level of more than $110 per barrel witnessed in June 2014, \n \n The oil producers group expects the price of its basket of crudes to rise to $70 a barrel in 2020 and $95 a barrel in 2040. \n \n Analysts predicted an average price of $40 in 2016 and $45 in 2017. Brent, the global benchmark was trading at less than $45 per barrel on Monday. \n \n “The price of oil will bounce further as we move towards the end of 2016 and into 2017. Billions of dollars of capex cut will eventually change the focus in the market from oversupply to the potential lack of supply,” Hansen added. \n \n In 2015, Saudi Arabia registered a budget deficit of 16 per cent of GDP and with government reforms announced December 2015, Saudi Arabia is expected to register a budget deficit of 13 per cent of GDP.', 'Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Most of Saudi Arabia\'s profits come from oil \n \n The Saudi cabinet has approved sweeping economic reforms aimed at moving the country away from its dependence on oil profits. \n \n Just over 70% of revenues came from oil last year but it has been hit by falling prices. \n \n One part of the plan will see shares sold in state-owned oil giant Aramco to create a sovereign wealth fund. \n \n Announcing the reforms, Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman described his country as being addicted to oil. \n \n Saudis react on social media \n \n The Vision 2030 plan, he told the Saudi-owned Al-Arabiya news channel, would ensure ""we can live without oil by 2020"". \n \n Among the reforms he announced in his interview were: \n \n Shares worth less than 5% of Aramco, a company he valued at up to $2.5tn (£1.7tn), will be sold \n \n Some of the proceeds will go towards a sovereign wealth fund worth $2tn \n \n A new visa system will allow expatriate Muslims and Arabs to work long term in Saudi Arabia \n \n Steps will be taken to diversify the economy, including investment in mineral mining and expanding military production \n \n Participation of women in the workforce to increase \n \n Even just selling 1% of Aramco would create the biggest initial public offering in history, the prince said, outstripping blockbuster sales like Facebook and Alibaba. \n \n The IMF called the Saudi plan an ""ambitious, far-reaching effort"" but warned implementation would be a challenge. \n \n The cost of oil: analysis by Andrew Walker, BBC economics correspondent \n \n Image copyright AP Image caption Saudi Arabia is the world\'s biggest crude exporter \n \n Oil has made Saudi Arabia a major economic force.

But the Saudi reserves are eroding and with almost three quarters of government revenue coming from oil, the price fall is making itself felt. \n \n For the long term, international efforts to combat climate change create huge uncertainty about demand for oil in the future. Oil will not lose its dominance of the market for transport fuel in the next few years, but further ahead the outlook is unknown. \n \n So Saudi Arabia needs to become less dependent on oil for government revenue and for the jobs and incomes of Saudi nationals. \n \n Oil prices are still less than half the peak of $115 a barrel seen in June 2014. But the prince said the reforms would go ahead regardless of prices. \n \n ""The vision has nothing to do with crude prices,"" he said. \n \n ""If the oil price goes back up it would greatly support the vision but it does not need high prices.

""We will not allow our country ever to be at the mercy of commodity price volatility or external markets,"" Prince Mohammed bin Salman told reporters gathered at a Riyadh palace Monday.

In broad terms, the prince would like to bring up its Public Investment Fund (PIF) capital to $2 trillion from $160 billion. Prince Mohammed says 5% of shares in the Aramco oil company would be sold to fund this $2 trillion nest (which he thinks could even rise to $3 trillion). Also part of the prince's game plan: setting up a ""green card"" system in five years' time to expedite Muslim and Arab expatriates' long-term residency, as well as boosting affordable housing and getting more women into the workforce.

VPC \n \n The electric car maker has sent through a software change to make its cars ride higher \n \n In this Wednesday, Nov. 6, 2013 photo provided by the Tennessee Highway Patrol, emergency workers respond to a fire on a Tesla Model S electric car in Smyrna, Tenn. (Photo: AP) Story Highlights The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has opened a probe into Tesla\'s Model S \n \n The probe of the electric car results from reports of battery fires \n \n Tesla CEO Elon Musk says he stands behind the car, but has ordered changes \n \n The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said today it has opened a formal investigation into the safety of the Tesla Model S electric car following two reports of battery fires after striking roadway debris. \n \n The agency said its safety investigation was prompted by recent ""undercarriage strikes"" in Washington state and Tennessee. In both cases, fires resulted after the cars both ran over debris on the road that pierced the battery compartment. After news of the probe broke, Tesla shares fell to $116 in pre-market trading but climbed back once the market opened. They closed 3.7%, or $4.51, up for the day at $126.09 a share. \n \n TESLA STOCK: Shares rise despite federal probe into fires \n \n Early Tuesday before NHTSA\'s announcement, Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that he taking three steps as a result of the fires, but added that he stands behind their safety. The steps were: \n \n •Higher ground clearance to make them less likely to strike road debris that can potentially penetrate the battery pack and ignite a blaze. \n \n •Asking federal safety regulators to ""conduct a full investigation as soon as possible into the fires."" Musk gave no hint that NHTSA was about to open an investigation. \n \n •Amending the cars\' warranty to cover damage due to fire. \n \n A NHTSA probe can lead to recall, but earlier this month Musk says he has no plans to order one because he doesn\'t think it is warranted. \n \n Musk announced the steps in a lengthy post on Tesla\'s blog. In it, he offers yet another strong defense of the car\'s safety, especially as it relates to protection from fire. ""We believe the evidence is clear that there is no safer car on the road than the Model S,"" he writes. His company expects to produce more than 20,000 of the electric cars this year, which sell for about $70,000 and up. \n \n He calls media reaction to the three fires a gross overreaction, especially given how thousands of conventional cars have been consumed by gasoline fires from ruptured tanks over the years. \n \n He says his battery-powered car is actually safer than just about any gas-powered car on the road. \n \n Elon Musk CEO of Tesla with a new Model S car outside the Tesla customer deliver area at the Tesla Fremont, Calif., factory (Photo: Jessica Brandi Lifland for USA TODAY) \n \n ""Since the Model S went into production mid last year, there have been over 400 deaths and 1,200 serious injuries in the United States alone due to gasoline car fires, compared to zero deaths and zero injuries due to Tesla fires anywhere in the world."" \n \n In the posting of its investigation, NHTSA noted that passengers in the Teslas that caught on fire were able to escape. ""In each incident, the vehicle\'s battery monitoring system provided escalating visible and audible warnings, allowing the driver to execute a controlled stop and exit the vehicle before the battery emitted smoke and fire,"" NHTSA writes. \n \n CLOSE Tesla stock fell after reports of the electric cars catching fire after striking road debris VPC \n \n Two of the Tesla fires were caused when the vehicle struck road debris that pierced the battery compartment. The third happened in Mexico when a Model S crashed. In each case, the occupants escaped unharmed. Musk says it\'s proof of the car\'s safety. \n \n But given the media outcry, Musk indicates he decided to act even though he already stands by the car. He says the plan to create more ground clearance under the cars has already been implemented. \n \n Tesla has already sent a signal to the computers in all Model S cars to tell them to increase the vehicle\'s ground clearance at highway speeds. he says the goal is to reduce the chance of hitting objects on the road. Another software update in January is aimed at letting drivers set their preferred road height for themselves and passengers. \n \n As for the NHTSA involvement in probing the three accidents that led to fires, Musk says that if regulators offers suggestions on how to improve fire safety in the Model S, he will immediately implement them. he has previously said he does not expect that the Model S will need to be recalled over the fires. \n \n When it comes to extending the warranty on the sedan, Musk says his decision will apply to Tesla models and be applicable even if the driver is held to be a fault for the fire. \n \n Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/I0PQdJ', 'Federal safety regulators opened a probe into a series of fires in Tesla Motors Inc. electric cars following crashes. \n \n The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Tuesday that it would investigate why two of the expensive Tesla Model S sporty hatchbacks have caught fire this year following accidents in which the battery casing that serves as the undercarriage of the car cracked open. \n \n LATEST: From the L.A Auto Show \n \n A third fire, which took place in Mexico, won’t be part of the investigation because it is outside the agency’s jurisdiction. \n \n NHTSA noted that in the two U.S. fires, one in Seattle and the other in Nashville, the battery monitoring system in the cars warned the drivers, allowing them to pull over and safely exit the vehicles before the battery emitted smoke and fire. \n \n The fires have become an issue for Tesla, contributing to 37% drop in the value of its stock since reaching a high of $193.37 on Sept. 30.

German authorities discovered their mistake after turning in desperation to a local Chinese restaurant to interpret for them, a Red Cross official said on Monday. \n \n Christoph Schlütermann, an official with the German Red Cross, which runs the home, told DPA news on Monday that the man “set machinery in motion that he couldn’t get out of”. \n \n “He spent 12 days trapped in our bureaucratic jungle because we couldn’t communicate,” he said. “Germany is unfortunately an extremely bureaucratic country. Especially during the refugee crisis I’ve seen how much red tape we have.” \n \n \n \n Yusra Mardini delights with butterfly heat win for Refugee Olympic Team Read more \n \n According to Schlütermann, the man said he had been robbed upon arriving in Stuttgart. \n \n \n \n A spokesperson on refugee issues at the Karlsruhe regional council said that on the afternoon of 4 July, the man arrived at the gates of the refugee reception centre in Karlsruhe as part of a group of seven Chinese people. Two days later, he signed an asylum application at the Patrick Henry Village processing camp outside Heidelberg, where it appears his passport was taken from him. \n \n She said he filed his papers in the presence of a Mandarin interpreter, and should therefore have been aware of the steps he was taking. He then travelled 220 miles (360km) to a refugee shelter in Dülmen, where he was given food and spending money like other refugees. \n \n More than one million refugees have arrived in Germany in the last year, fleeing war and poverty in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere. There has been only a tiny number of Chinese asylum seekers over the years, Schlütermann said. \n \n \n \n The man was fingerprinted and given a medical exam, but drew the attention of staff partly because he was well dressed. “But he [also] acted so differently to other refugees,” said Schlütermann. “He kept trying to talk to people to tell his story but no one could understand him. He kept asking to get his passport back, which is the opposite of what most refugees do.” \n \n With help from a translation app and then from a translator at a Chinese restaurant, it became clear that the man wanted to travel on to France and Italy, not seek asylum. It took German officials 12 days to put the story together and send him on his way, Schlütermann said. \n \n “It was an extraordinary moment for us all. He said Europe was not what he had expected,” said Schlütermann, adding that the man was happy to leave but not upset. “What would you expect if you had come to Europe as a tourist and spent 12 days sleeping on a camping bed in a refugee centre?” \n \n • This article was amended on 9 August 2016. An earlier version said that the Chinese man had been robbed in Heidelberg, where he then erroneously signed an asylum application at the town hall. The city council of Heidelberg has since issued a statement clarifying that there is no record with the police of the man having been robbed in the city. It is also impossible to apply for asylum at Heidelberg town hall.']",3,"– Tesla is facing more scrutiny following three car fires in six weeks. First, investors launched a lawsuit; now, the government is getting involved, USA Today reports. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is now investigating two of the fires, both of which occurred after Model S undercarriages hit debris on the road (the other happened during a crash). In a blog post, CEO Elon Musk says his company asked for the investigation and writes that ""if something is discovered that would result in a material improvement in occupant fire safety, we will immediately apply that change to new cars and offer it as a free retrofit to all existing cars."" But the NHTSA tells the LAT a different story: ""The agency notified the automaker of its plans to open a formal investigation and requested their cooperation, which is standard agency practice for all investigations."" Musk also says the company will increase the cars' ground clearance to help prevent them from hitting debris, and warranties will start covering fire damage, even in the event of driver error, ""to reinforce how strongly we feel about the low risk of fire in our cars."" To that end: ""We believe the evidence is clear that there is no safer car on the road than the Model S,"" Musk notes. ""Since the Model S went into production mid last year, there have been more than a quarter million gasoline car fires in the United States alone, resulting in over 400 deaths and 1,200 serious injuries ... compared to zero deaths and zero injuries due to Tesla fires. The media coverage of Model S fires vs. gasoline car fires is disproportionate by several orders of magnitude, despite the latter actually being far more deadly."""

The first study to explore brain responses in people who describe themselves as hypersexual suggests otherwise, reports UCLA. Researchers there showed the subjects—39 men and 13 women—sexual images, and discovered that their brains didn't respond in the same way that, say, a cocaine addict would respond to images of cocaine. “Most people describe high-frequency sexual problems as an ‘addiction’—that’s how the public and even many clinicians talk about it,"" one of the researchers tells Slate. ""But this data challenges the addiction model and forces us to reconsider how we think and talk about these problems.” The subjects have higher libidos, or sexual desire, but not necessarily a clinical medical problem.

Richards IV was charged with fourth-degree rape in 2009 after he admitted that he had raped his daughter almost a decade ago. \n \n \n \n News of the shocking leniency shown to Richards, 46, only emerged on Tuesday in the details of a lawsuit filed against him by his ex-wife Tracy. \n \n Robert H. Richards IV was charged with fourth-degree rape in 2009 after he admitted that he had raped his daughter almost a decade ago \n \n News of the shocking leniency shown to Richards emerged just last Tuesday in the details of a lawsuit filed against him by his ex-wife Tracy \n \n In her lawsuit, Tracy Richards charges that he penetrated his daughter with his fingers while masturbating, and subsequently also assaulted his toddler son as well. \n \n \n \n Tracy Richards, who along with the two children now live in a rental home, is seeking compensatory and punitive damages for assault, negligence, and intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress on his two children. \n \n \n \n Robert Richards is an unemployed heir living off his trust fund. He is the great grandson of du Pont family patriarch Irenee du Pont, a chemical baron. \n \n \n \n According to the lawsuit filed by Richards' ex-wife, he also admitted to sexually assaulting his infant son in addition to his daughter between 2005 and 2007. \n \n \n \n Richards was initially indicted on two counts of second-degree child rape, felonies that translate to a 10-year mandatory jail sentence per count. He was released on $60,000 bail while awaiting his charges. \n \n \n \n Judge Jan Jurden, right, said Roberts, the great grandson of Irenee du Pont, left, would benefit from participating in a sex offenders rehabilitation program rather than serving any prison time \n \n Richards hired one of the state's top law firms and was offered a plea deal of one count of fourth-degree rape charges - which carried no mandatory minimum prison sentencing. \n \n \n \n He accepted, and admitted to the assault, reports the Detroit Free Press. \n \n Superior Court Judge Jan Jurden sentenced Richards to eight years in prison but suspended that for Level II probation, which requires monthly visits with a case officer. \n \n In sentencing him, Judge Jurden said Richards would benefit from participating in a sex offenders rehabilitation program rather than serving any prison time. \n \n \n \n Currently on probation, Richards has never been charged with crimes against his son. \n \n The lawsuit claims that Richards raped his daughter, now 11, in 2005 when she was three. \n \n \n \n Lawyers for Tracy Richards, far right, hold up photos of where her husband lives, the $1.8m mansion on the right and where she and their children currently rent on the left \n \n Several times, he entered her bedroom at night while she slept and penetrated her with his fingers while masturbating, said the lawsuit, which includes documents from the criminal case. \n \n Abuse of the children occurred at both of Richards' homes, including the 5,800-square-foot Greenville mansion that he paid $1.8 million for. \n \n Richards, who is 6'4 and about 250 lbs, told the girl 'to keep what he had done to her a secret,' but in October 2007 she told her grandmother, who informed Tracy Richards, the lawsuit said. \n \n \n \n The girl was taken to her pediatrician, whom she told about the abuse, and New Castle County police arrested him that December. \n \n Abuse of the children occurred at both of Richards' homes, including the 5,800-square-foot Greenville mansion that he paid $1.8 million for, pictured \n \n The proven abuse of his daughter and alleged assault of his son has caused his children 'long-term injuries,' the lawsuit filed Tuesday said, perhaps including depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, sexual dysfunction and shame. \n \n His daughter also has 'repressed memories of some instances of the abuse she suffered,' and if the son was abused, the same is true with him, the suit said. \n \n \n \n With medical treatment, the lawsuit said, those memories will likely 'begin to surface.' \n \n 'Making matters worse this self admitted rapist and child abuser has not paid a single penny to these children for his crimes. There is no provision whatsoever for them for their future after they turn 18,' said Attorney Thomas Crumplar, who is representing Tracy Richards. \n \n \n \n At Tuesday's press conference he stood alongside Tracy and her mother Donna Burg. Burg, the maternal grandmother, is the one who alarmed Tracy of the abuse after talking to one of the grandchildren in 2007. \n \n \n \n Richards is a scion of two prominent Delaware families - the du Pont family who built the chemical empire and the Richards family who co-founded the prestigious corporate law firm Richards Layton & Finger. \n \n \n \n His father, Robert H.

Richards IV, who admitted to raping his 3-year-old daughter almost a decade ago, the Daily Mail reports. In a 2009 case that's only now coming to light, the News Journal reports that Delaware Judge Jan Jurden sentenced Richards to an eight-year prison term but suspended it for probation, plus a sex offenders rehabilitation program, because Richards ""will not fare well"" in prison and ""treatment needs exceed need for punishment."" The News Journal calls it ""a rare and puzzling rationale"" from a judge who is known for her tough sentencing, especially given that treatment is usually reserved for first-time drug offenders, drunk drivers, and the mentally ill. While some attorneys say such a sentence isn't unheard of, a public defender notes that the case raises questions about ""how a person with great wealth may be treated by the system."" A defense lawyer adds, ""I've never heard of the judge saying in general that he is not going to do well ... Who thrives in jail?"" A suit recently filed against Richards by his ex-wife is seeking damages for assaults on the couple's two children.

153,"['Mayor Rahm Emanuel on Monday won praise from some representatives of Chicago\'s immigrant community for going to court to block President Donald Trump\'s Department of Justice from withholding some police grant funding from so-called sanctuary cities. \n \n Some of those same activists, though, contend Emanuel should do even more to prevent police from helping federal officials deport Chicago immigrants who entered the country without the required legal documentation. The mayor also caught more flak from U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who in stepping up his rhetoric said ""no amount of federal taxpayer dollars will help a city that refuses to help its own residents."" \n \n The wide array of views coming from Emanuel\'s City Hall, the White House and immigrant protection groups is a sign of the complex debate the mayor has entered by filing the lawsuit. It\'s all further complicated by differing views on whether sanctuary city status fosters or hinders crime — as reflected in Sessions\' harsh words and the city\'s contention that the Trump ""administration\'s rhetoric is divorced from reality."" \n \n Emanuel\'s lawsuit, filed Monday in federal court, asks a judge to block the Trump administration from enforcing three new conditions it included last week in applications for Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant money. The city uses the grant to help buy police cars, purchase other equipment and fund an anti-violence program. Those applications are due Sept. 5, and the city wants a court order before the deadline, said Corporation Counsel Ed Siskel, the city\'s top attorney. \n \n The new conditions outlined by Sessions\' Justice Department: sharing immigration status information with federal officials enforcing deportation laws, providing unlimited police station access to those officials and giving them 48-hours notice of an arrested person\'s release in cases of potential immigration violations. \n \n City officials contend in the lawsuit that they do share immigration status information when they have it, but that\'s rare because the city doesn\'t keep it in the normal course of business. \n \n Providing unfettered station access would interfere with police department practices, delay release of people being held and violate the 10th Amendment by ""commandeering"" local government functions, the lawsuit states. And holding people for 48 hours without a warrant or probable cause that they have committed a crime would violate 4th Amendment search and seizure limitations, it adds. \n \n The suit also contends that the Justice Department has no authority to set conditions on the Byrne grant funding and is attempting to usurp the Congressional power of the purse. In short, the suit deems the conditions ""unlawful and unconstitutional."" \n \n This year, the city was counting on receiving $3.2 million from the grants in question, a relatively miniscule portion of the city\'s overall $9.8 billion budget. \n \n ""We are at a time when every bit counts and every resource matters in this fight,"" Siskel said. ""In addition, we are bringing this legal challenge because the rhetoric and the threats from this administration, embodied in these new restrictions placed on public safety grant funds, are breeding a culture and a climate of fear within the communities in our city."" \n \n City corporation counsel Ed Siskel talks at Dirksen Federal Building about the Emanuel administration lawsuit against the Donald Trump Justice Department about sanctuary city rules. Aug. 7, 2017 (John Byrne / Chicago Tribune) City corporation counsel Ed Siskel talks at Dirksen Federal Building about the Emanuel administration lawsuit against the Donald Trump Justice Department about sanctuary city rules. Aug. 7, 2017 (John Byrne / Chicago Tribune) SEE MORE VIDEOS \n \n Plus, the fate of Chicago\'s grant application also would affect other local Illinois governments that include their funding requests in Chicago\'s application, according to the lawsuit. They are Cook County, Bellwood, Calumet City, Chicago Heights, Cicero, Dolton, Evanston, Harvey, Maywood, Riverdale and Skokie. \n \n And the outcome of the suit could have ramifications for far-flung local and state governments with sanctuary laws on the books. They include New York, Philadelphia, Miami and the state of California. \n \n So it was no surprise that groups like Illinois Coalition for Immigration and Refugee Rights backed the mayor\'s move. ""We are all for defending Chicago\'s policy with respect to immigration,"" said Fred Tsao, the group\'s senior policy counsel. He also said ""the law is on the side of the city."" \n \n Yet Tsao\'s group is part of a broader coalition that for months has been pushing Emanuel to remove four exemptions from the city\'s Welcoming City Ordinance, which sets its status as a sanctuary city. \n \n That ordinance bars police from providing federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials access to people in local custody. It also prohibits allowing ICE agents to use police facilities for interviews or investigations, and bars on-duty officers from responding to ICE questions or talking to ICE officials prior to a person\'s release from custody. \n \n But it does allow police to provide ICE officials access to immigrants suspected of entering the country illegally who are wanted on a criminal warrant, face criminal charges, have serious criminal convictions or are listed on Chicago gang databases. \n \n The American Civil Liberties Union maintains those exemptions, which could result in holding in custody someone not guilty of a recent crime, ""expose the city to liability for violations of the 4th Amendment,"" according to a letter the ACLU sent to the mayor and aldermen last month. \n \n Ald. Carlos Ramirez-Rosa, 35th, has been pushing to get Chicago to join other cities that have eliminated similar exemptions, but the Emanuel administration so far has rebuffed his efforts, as recently as Friday by canceling a meeting on the issue. \n \n ""It\'s quite funny and hypocritical that at the same time as (Emanuel is) putting forward this lawsuit saying that we want to defend the Constitution, here the ACLU has said that our own sanctuary city policy is in violation of the supreme law of the land,"" said Ramirez-Rosa, who also stressed that he supports the lawsuit. \n \n Ramirez-Rosa\'s view runs counter to the image Emanuel has tried to portray on the issue in mostly Democratic Chicago, which has a significant Latino population that\'s become increasingly politically active.', ""After Rahm sues feds, A.G. Jeff Sessions blisters ‘lawless’ Chicago \n \n Mayor Rahm Emanuel, with Police Supt. Eddie Johnson (left) and U.S. Rep. Danny Davis (right) announces a federal lawsuit challenging the Justice Department's threats to withhold federal funding from sanctuary cities and states. | Nader Issa/Sun-Times \n \n Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Monday blasted the “political leadership of Chicago” and “the culture of lawlessness that has beset the city” just hours after Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s administration sued Sessions to bar him from cutting federal crimefighting funds to sanctuary cities. \n \n Rather than take a hands-off approach to the now-pending litigation, Sessions stepped up attacks on Chicago, the city that has been repeatedly bashed by President Donald Trump because of its ongoing problems with controlling crime. \n \n “To a degree perhaps unsurpassed by any other jurisdiction, the political leadership of Chicago has chosen deliberately and intentionally to adopt a policy that obstructs this country’s lawful immigration system,” Sessions said in a prepared statement. “They have demonstrated an open hostility to enforcing laws designed to protect law enforcement — federal, state, and local — and reduce crime, and instead have adopted an official policy of protecting criminal aliens who prey on their own residents. \n \n “This is astounding given the unprecedented violent crime surge in Chicago, with the number of murders in 2016 surpassing both New York and Los Angeles combined. The city’s leaders cannot follow some laws and ignore others and reasonably expect this horrific situation to improve. \n \n “The mayor complains that the federal government’s focus on enforcing the law would require a ‘reordering of law enforcement practice in Chicago.’ But that’s just what Chicago needs: a recommitment to the rule of law and to policies that roll back the culture of lawlessness that has beset the city.” \n \n Though the Trump administration has attempted to link sanctuary-city status to the city’s crime problem, the Chicago Sun-Times has reported that illegal immigrants have played no role in the overwhelming majority of the murders that have put the city in the national spotlight. \n \n “I have been a police officer for more than 30 years, and the federal government’s plans will hamper community policing and public safety,” Chicago Police Supt. Eddie Johnson said in response to Sessions. “Undocumented immigrants are not driving violence in Chicago, and that’s why I want our officers focused on community policing and not trying to be the immigration police.” \n \n With the filing of the lawsuit against Sessions, Chicago becomes the fourth city to wage a legal battle against the Trump administration bid to cut the crimefighting grants to sanctuary local governments. \n \n Other lawsuits to block the Justice Department from punishing cities shielding illegal immigrants from federal immigration agents have been filed in federal courts in Seattle, and in California: Santa Clara and San Francisco. \n \n And while each has its own unique facts and circumstances, Chicago’s legal team is tapped in to the loose network of lawyers that has formed for many of these sanctuary cities. \n \n “We are in regular contact with lawyers in cities and counties around the country related to these issues,” city Corporation Counsel Ed Siskel said – including from New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, New Orleans and Philadelphia. \n \n Chicago’s 46-page complaint asks U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber — assigned to the case Monday — to stop the Justice Department from enforcing new conditions it has attached to the grant funds. \n \n The city appears to be making a solid legal case, according to two experts from the University of Chicago Law School: Professor Aziz Huq and Assistant Professor Daniel Hemel. Both pointed out that, according to the city’s lawsuit, Congress did not give the Justice Department the power to create new conditions when it created the grant program. \n \n The Justice Department in recent days detailed the new rule and conditions sanctuary jurisdictions must follow. The first condition would require the city to give the feds, when they ask for it, a 48-hour heads up of the scheduled release date and time “of an alien in the jurisdiction’s custody.” \n \n The second would require the city to give the feds access to “any correctional or detention facility in order to meet with an alien . . . and inquire as to his or her right to be or remain in the United States.” However, the city points out in its lawsuit that Chicago does not have a jail — only 18 temporary police “lockup” facilities. \n \n The city claims the Justice Department is also asking it to again certify its compliance with a federal law barring local governments from not sharing immigration status information with the feds. It is asking to the city to do so “under the cloud of confusion” created by the new grant conditions, the city is alleging.""]",2,"– The war of words between Chicago and the federal government over ""sanctuary cities"" policy is heating up.

Sessions said Mayor Rahm Emanuel has complained that the federal government is demanding a ""reordering of law enforcement practice""—but that is what is needed to combat ""the culture of lawlessness that has beset the city."" ""It's this simple: Comply with the law or forgo taxpayer dollars,"" Sessions said.

(Associated Press) \n \n SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korean police found about 200 lapel pins bearing the image of late North Korean dictator Kim Jong Il strewn near the country's main international airport on Thursday, police officers said. \n \n Police were analyzing security cameras to find how the 196 lapel pins ended up in a flowerbed of a hotel close to Incheon International Airport, just west of Seoul, according to a local police officer who requested anonymity because he wasn't authorized to speak to the media on the matter. \n \n He gave no further details, but South Korean media said police were looking at a possibility that the lapel pins may have been carried by propaganda balloons that North Korea floated across the border. \n \n The possession of such lapel pins would be illegal in South Korea, where praising North Korea is punishable by up to seven years in prison. North Korea, for its part, enforces strict, state-organized public reverence of the Kim family, which has ruled the impoverished yet authoritarian country since its foundation in 1948. \n \n All North Koreans must wear lapel pins carrying the images of both Kim Jong Il and his father Kim Il Sung or the images of either of them. Portraits of the two Kims hang in public buildings and homes, and their birthdays are the two most important holidays in North Korea. \n \n South Korean officials said they haven't received any reports that North Korea has produced a lapel pin for current leader Kim Jong Un, who took power after his father Kim Jong Il's death in late 2011. \n \n A lapel pin with images of both Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il is considered more valuable than other pins because it's the one given to government and military officials and diplomats. Some ordinary citizens buy that pin at unauthorized street markets, according to defectors and activists in Seoul. A Kim Il Sung pin is more used by citizens than a Kim Jong Il pin, they said. \n \n The rival Koreas restarted Cold War-era psychological warfare after the North's fourth nuclear test in January. Seoul began blaring anti-Pyongyang broadcasts and K-Pop songs via border loudspeakers, and Pyongyang responded by its own border broadcasts and launches of balloons carrying anti-South leaflets. \n \n The rivals are divided along the world's most heavily fortified border since their war in the early 1950s ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty."", 'SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea is stepping up its propaganda campaign ahead of annual U.S.-South Korea war games next month, saying the peninsula is “on the verge of war.” \n \n Such rhetoric is common from Pyongyang at times of crisis; the current standoff began with the North’s fourth nuclear test in January and shows no signs of easing. Pyongyang has carried out a series of missile tests in recent months and made repeated threats that it is ready to attack South Korea and U.S. bases in the Pacific while pursuing the capability to hit the American mainland with a nuclear-tipped missile. \n \n South Korea accused Pyongyang of floating propaganda leaflets down the Han River earlier this week. The military discovered dozens of plastic bags, each carrying about 20 leaflets, near the river’s estuary, close to the tense Korean border last Friday, the South’s Defense Ministry said. \n \n Police also have launched an investigation after nearly 200 lapel pins bearing the image of late North Korean leader Kim Jong Il turned up in a flowerbed near Incheon International Airport. Police recovered the coin-sized pins Thursday morning after a hotel employee reported there were North Korean propaganda leaflets in the flowerbed, said an officer who asked to remain anonymous. \n \n Mere possession of the pins, which are mandatory accessories for all adults in North Korea, wouldn’t be considered a crime in the South; however, distribution of propaganda items would violate South Korea’s National Security Law, the officer said. \n \n Kim Jong Il, who ruled North Korea from 1994 until his death in 2011, was the son of the country’s founder, Kim Il Sung, and the father of current leader Kim Jong Un. \n \n The lapel-pin find comes a day after the 63rd anniversary of the signing of an armistice that ended fighting during the Korean War. Gen. Vincent Brooks, commander of U.S. Forces Korea, said during a Wednesday ceremony at the Demilitarized Zone that, without the armistice, many incidents that have happened over the years — such as the August maiming of two South Korean soldiers by a mine reportedly planted by the North just before the annual Ulchi Freedom Guardian exercises — could have reignited war on the peninsula. \n \n “Without the agreement and its buffers, we would almost have certainly seen several of the provocations, the provocative border skirmishes of the past six decades, spread like wildfire into larger battles,” he said. \n \n On Thursday, North Korea’s top diplomat for U.S. affairs, Han Song Ryol, told The Associated Press that Washington “crossed the red line” and effectively declared war by adding Kim to a sanctions list. \n \n Ryol said recent U.S. actions — likely including a decision to station a Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system, known as THAAD, in the southeastern region of Seongju — have put the peninsula on the verge of war, and that a vicious showdown could erupt if the U.S. and South Korea go ahead with annual war games planned for next month. \n \n The leaflets contained threats to launch missile attacks and a repeat of the North’s long-running propaganda, such as claims that it won the 1950-53 Korean War, according to a ministry official quoted by the AP. \n \n The propaganda incidents may be retaliation for South Korean propaganda broadcasts from loudspeakers at the border that resumed after North Korea’s fourth underground nuclear test in January. The North has been broadcasting its own propaganda across the DMZ and launching anti-South leaflets over the border via balloons, the AP reported. \n \n chang.kyong@stripes.com']",2,"– North Korea has apparently kicked off a new propaganda war ahead of planned war games between the US and South Korea next month. South Korea says its military found hundreds of propaganda leaflets floating down a river near the border last week, boasting that the North won the Korean War and threatening missile attacks, reports the AP. Some 200 flag-shaped lapel pins featuring a photo of Kim Jong Il were also discovered in a hotel flowerbed near Incheon International Airport on Thursday, reports Stars and Stripes. These are no ordinary pins: As Atlas Obscura explains, they're a patriotic symbol distributed by North Korea's Workers' Party to be worn by all adults on the left side of the chest. Some say Kim Jong Un's wife disappeared after failing to wear one in public. Other versions feature Kim Il Sung, and a rare few show both former leaders. These are only given to high-ranking government officials and military leaders, though ordinary citizens can get a knock-off version from China on the black market. North Koreans were even using the pins in place of cash before the Workers' Party made it illegal. Police are investigating how the pins got into the flowerbed as possession of such items is illegal in South Korea, but say they may have arrived via a propaganda balloon. Meanwhile, Pyongyang accuses the South of releasing snakes across the border ""as part of a 'cunning scheme' to challenge our unity,"" reports the Guardian. A diplomat also promises action if the war games go ahead as planned, noting the US ""crossed the red line"" when putting Kim on a sanctions list."

158,"['CORRECTS NAME AND TITLE TO LABIDI FROM LABIBI AND VICE PRESIDENT FROM PRESIDENT - Mohamed Labidi, the vice-president of the mosque where an attack happened, is comforted by Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard,... (Associated Press) \n \n QUEBEC CITY (AP) — A French Canadian suspect known for his far-right, nationalist views was charged Monday with six counts of first-degree murder and five counts of attempted murder in the shooting rampage at a Quebec City mosque that Canada\'s prime minister called an act of terrorism again Muslims. \n \n Alexandre Bissonnette made a brief court appearance and did not enter a plea in the attack that left six people dead during evening prayers Sunday. Wearing a white prisoner jump suit, his hands and feet shackled, he stared down at the floor and fidgeted, but did not speak. \n \n The 27-year-old suspect, who has espoused support for the French far-right party of Marine Le Pen and had liked U.S. President Donald Trump on his Facebook page, was known to those who monitor extremist groups in Quebec, said François Deschamps, an official with a refugee advocacy group. ""It\'s with pain and anger that we learn the identity of terrorist Alexandre Bissonnette, unfortunately known to many activists in Quebec for taking nationalist, pro-Le Pen and anti-feminist positions at Laval University and on social media,"" Deschamps wrote on the Facebook page of the group, Bienvenues aux Refugiés, or Welcome to Refugees. \n \n An anthropology and political science major at Laval University in Quebec City, Bissonnette had also expressed support on his Facebook profile for ""Génération Nationale,"" a group whose manifesto includes the rejection of ""multiculturalism."" \n \n More than 50 people were at the Quebec Islamic Cultural Centre when the shooting erupted. In addition to the six dead, 19 people were wounded — all men. Of the five victims who remained hospitalized, two were in critical condition, authorities said. The dead ranged in age from 39 to 60. \n \n Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard both characterized the attack as a terrorist act, which came amid heightened tensions worldwide over Trump\'s travel ban on seven Muslim countries. Le Pen, leader of the National Front in France, is known for her anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant positions and has won the endorsement and admiration of white supremacists. \n \n Canada is generally welcoming toward immigrants and all religions, but the French-speaking province of Quebec has had a long-simmering debate about race and religious accommodation. The previous separatist government of the province called for a ban on ostentatious religious symbols, such as the hijab, in public institutions. \n \n Trudeau said in Parliament the victims were targeted simply because of their religion and spoke directly to the more than 1 million Muslims who live in Canada, saying, ""We are with you."" \n \n ""Thirty-six million hearts are breaking with yours,"" Trudeau said. ""Know that we value you."" \n \n The prime minister later attended a vigil outside the mosque. \n \n The suspect was arrested in his car on a bridge near d\'Orleans, where he called 911 to say he wanted to cooperate with police. Authorities, who initially named two suspects, said the other man taken into custody was a witness to the attack and was released earlier Monday. They said they did not believe there were other suspects but were investigating. \n \n Police did not give a motive for the attack. \n \n Trump called Trudeau to express condolences to the Canadian people and to offer any assistance that might be needed. \n \n The White House pointed to the attack as an example of why Trump\'s policies were needed. ""We condemn this attack in the strongest possible terms. It\'s a terrible reminder of why we must remain vigilant and why the president is taking steps to be pro-active, rather than reactive when it comes to our nation\'s safety and security,"" White House spokesman Sean Spicer said. \n \n The victims were businessmen, a university professor and others who had gathered for evening prayers, said Mohamed Labidi, the vice president of the mosque. \n \n ""\'It\'s a very, very big tragedy for us,"" Labidi said tearfully. ""We have a sadness we cannot express."" \n \n He said the victims were shot in the back. ""Security at our mosque was our major, major concern,"" he said. ""But we were caught off guard."" \n \n The shooting took place just before 8 p.m. Sunday. Witnesses described chaos as worshippers scrambled to find friends and loved ones, as police responding to the scene called for backup. \n \n Couillard said he would ""not go there"" when asked if he blamed recent rhetoric in in the U.S. for the attack. \n \n ""Quebec is a good, generally loving society, but we have these devils as other societies have. We have to recognize that and fight them,"" Couillard said at a news conference in Quebec City at which he and Muslim leaders held hands in a display of solidarity. \n \n ""The Muslim community was the target of this murderous attack,"" Couillard said, adding that solidarity rallies would be held across Quebec later Monday. \n \n The mosque has been a target of hate crimes in the past, including last summer when pig\'s head was left on its doorstep during Ramadan, when Muslims fast from dawn to sunset. Practicing Muslims do not eat pork. \n \n Quebec City Mayor Regis Labeaume, appearing shaken, said: ""No person should have to pay with their life, for their race, their color, their sexual orientation or their religious beliefs."" \n \n Worshipper Ali Hamadi said he left the mosque a few minutes before the shooting and a friend, Abdelkrim Hassen, was killed. He said Hassen, who worked in information technology for the government, had three daughters and a wife, whom he had to notify of the death. \n \n Majdi Dridi of the Muslim Association of Canada said he knew two of the victims. One was a work colleague who was a father of three little girls, he said. \n \n ""I don\'t know what to say, I just hope that his family and his children can have the patience to accept what happened,"" Dridi said \n \n Trudeau had earlier reacted to Trump\'s visa ban for people from some Muslim-majority countries by tweeting Saturday: ""To those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada."" \n \n Trudeau also posted a picture of himself greeting a Syrian child at Toronto\'s airport in late 2015. Trudeau oversaw the arrival of more than 39,000 Syrian refugees soon after he was elected. \n \n The mayor of Gatineau, Quebec, near Canada\'s capital of Ottawa, said there would be an increased police presence at mosques around his city following the attack. The New York Police Department also said it was stepping up patrols at mosques and other houses of worship. \n \n ___ \n \n Gillies reported from Toronto. Associated Press writer Sean Farrell in Montreal contributed to this report.', 'Alexandre Bissonnette, the 27-year-old accused of opening fire on a Quebec City mosque, has been charged with six counts of first-degree murder and five counts of attempted murder while using a restricted firearm. \n \n During a brief court appearance Monday evening, Bissonnette, wearing handcuffs, frequently cast his eyes toward the ground and avoided turning toward the packed gallery. \n \n He will remain in custody until his next court appearance on Feb. 21. \n \n Provincial police are treating the attack as a terrorist act. RCMP spokeswoman Camille Habel said Bissonnette could later face terrorism-related charges, depending on the outcome of the ongoing investigation. \n \n Six men were killed and five people remain in hospital with injuries. \n \n Two of the surviving victims will need more surgery, while the other three are stable and may be discharged soon. Another 13 people with minor injuries have been released, according to a hospital spokeswoman. \n \n \'Introverted young man\' \n \n On Monday afternoon, Laval University confirmed that he is a student, and is now barred from all activities effective immediately until all judicial proceedings are over. \n \n His employer, Héma-Québec, issued a statement saying the organization is ""shocked"" to learn that he was among their employees. Bissonnette was a member of their call centre team. \n \n This screengrab from the suspect\'s Facebook page, taken before it went offline, shows Alexandre Bissonnette as a child wearing his cadet uniform. (Facebook) ""As an organization whose primary mission is dedicated to the gift of life, these events have sent a shock wave through the organization,"" the non-profit agency said. \n \n According to Bissonnette\'s Facebook page, which has since been taken down, Bissonnette is from the Quebec City suburb of Cap-Rouge. He was also a cadet as a child. \n \n Neighbours of Bissonnette\'s parents said he was renting an apartment with his twin brother near the Centre Culturel Islamique de Québec, where the shooting took place Sunday evening. \n \n Neighbour Réjean Bussière said Bissonnette was very introverted. \n \n ""He\'s a very closed-off young man,"" Bussière told CBC\'s French-language network, Radio-Canada. \n \n Only 1 suspected shooter \n \n Another man, Mohamed Belkhadir, was arrested outside the mosque within minutes of the shooting. He was released after police confirmed he was a witness and not involved in the shooting. \n \n He said he had been shovelling snow when he heard gunshots — when they stopped he entered the mosque to call 911. \n \n ""I saw the image of someone with a firearm, I didn\'t know it was police. I thought it was a shooter who\'d returned,"" Belkhadir told Radio-Canada. \n \n The man fled and police arrested him. He was released Monday. \n \n Shortly after noon Monday, provincial police said that man was no longer a suspect, but rather a witness to the attack. \n \n A half-hour after the shooting, Quebec City police Insp. Denis Turcotte said a second man called 911 indicating that he wanted to co-operate in the investigation. \n \n La SQ confirme qu’un seul des individus arrêté hier soir en lien avec l’<a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/attentat?src=hash"">#attentat</a> de <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/Qu%C3%A9bec?src=hash"">#Québec</a> est considéré comme suspect. —@sureteduquebec \n \n Turcotte said the man parked about five kilometres from the scene of the shooting, near the bridge to Île d\'Orléans, and waited for officers to arrest him. \n \n ""He was armed and spoke to us about his acts,\'\' said Turcotte. \n \n \'Pain and anger\' \n \n As Bissonnette\'s name began to circulate online, one Facebook group dedicated to welcoming refugees in the Quebec City area expressed ""pain and anger"" over the news. \n \n The suspect was ""unfortunately known to several activists in Quebec City for his pro-Le Pen and anti-feminist positions at Laval University and on social networks,"" wrote the Bienvenue aux réfugié.es - Ville de Québec Facebook group. \n \n Bissonnette\'s Facebook page seemed to confirm those political leanings. The suspect followed several profiles that espouse right-wing ideologies, including that of Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader of France\'s National Front. \n \n A search was conducted at the home of Bissonnette\'s parents on du Tracel Street in Cap-Rouge, as well as at a residence on des Quatre-Bourgeois Road, closer to the mosque. \n \n A woman who identified herself as a neighbour of Bissonnette\'s parents said the suspect had recently moved into an apartment that he was renting with his twin brother, not far from the mosque where the shooting occurred. \n \n ""He is a child,"" she said. ""You couldn\'t find one more calm than that. He never did anything, he always kept to himself. We never heard of anything."" \n \n ""I saw him last Wednesday; he was arriving at his parents\' home. I think he often went there,"" the neighbour, who wished to remain anonymous, told Radio-Canada. \n \n Another neighbour, Réjean Bussiè\u200bre, described Bissonnette as ""a young man who is extremely withdrawn."" \n \n Bissonnette and his brother were not the kind to bother others, Bussiè\u200bre said, ""but they were not social people."" \n \n On social media, many took issue with the categorization of Bissonnette as an introvert and a lone wolf, arguing that the suspect was spared of the term terrorist because he is white. Bestselling author J.K. Rowling was one of those voices. \n \n Earlier Monday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the attack a ""despicable act of terror.""', 'QUEBEC CITY/TORONTO (Reuters) - A French-Canadian university student was the sole suspect in a shooting at a Quebec City mosque and was charged with the premeditated murder of six people, Canadian authorities said on Monday, in what Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called “a terrorist attack.” \n \n Court documents identified the gunman in the attack on Sunday evening prayers as Alexandre Bissonnette, 27, and charged him with six murder counts and five counts of attempted murder with a restricted weapon. The slightly-built Bissonnette made a brief appearance in court under tight security wearing a white prison garment and looking downcast. \n \n Prosecutors said all of the evidence was not yet ready and Bissonnette, a student at Université Laval, was set to appear again on Feb. 21. No charge was read in court and Bissonnette did not enter a plea. \n \n “The charges laid correspond to the evidence available,” said Thomas Jacques, a representative of the prosecutor’s office, when asked why Bissonnette was not charged with terrorism-related offences. \n \n Among the six men killed were a butcher, a university professor, a pharmacist and an accountant, according to police and Canadian media. \n \n The government of Guinea said in a statement that two of its citizens were among those killed in the mosque attack. \n \n Police declined to discuss possible motives for the shooting at the Centre Culturel Islamique de Québec. \n \n “They consider this a lone wolf situation,” a Canadian source familiar with the situation said. \n \n In Washington, U.S. government security experts were leaning to the view that the gunman most likely was motivated by hatred for Muslims, a U.S. government source familiar with official reporting said. \n \n Trudeau, who has made a point of welcoming refugees and immigrants from Muslim-majority countries, told parliament in Ottawa: “Make no mistake, this was a terrorist attack.” \n \n “Last night this community experienced something that no community should ever have to know: Unspeakable cruelty and violence perpetrated on those who came together in friendship and in faith,” Trudeau said later at a vigil attended by hundreds who braved frigid temperatures in Quebec City. \n \n He added a personal message to Canada’s 1 million Muslims: \n \n “We stand with you. We love you and we support you and we will always defend and protect your right to gather together and pray today and every day,” Trudeau added. \n \n Alexandre Bissonnette, a suspect in a shooting at a Quebec City mosque, is seen in a Facebook posting. Facebook/Handout via REUTERS \n \n The attack was out of character for Quebec City, a city of just over 500,000 which reported just two murders in all of 2015. Mass shootings are rare in Canada, where gun control laws are stricter than in the United States. \n \n Incidents of Islamophobia have increased in Quebec in recent years. The face-covering, or niqab, became an issue in the 2015 Canadian federal election, especially in Quebec, where the majority of the population supported a ban on it at citizenship ceremonies. \n \n In addition to the six killed, five people were critically injured and 12 were treated for minor injuries, a spokeswoman for the Quebec City University Hospital said. \n \n Federal Safety Minister Ralph Goodale told reporters in Ottawa there was no change to “the national terrorism threat level” from medium because “there is no information known to the government of Canada that would lead to a change at this time.” \n \n U.S. President Donald Trump called Trudeau to express his condolences “and offered to provide any assistance as needed,” said Trudeau spokesman Cameron Ahmad. \n \n Over the weekend, Trudeau said Canada would welcome refugees, his response to an executive order by Trump on Friday to halt the U.S. refugee program and to temporarily bar citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States. \n \n Trump’s action, which the president said was “not about religion - this is about terror and keeping our country safe,” was widely condemned in the United States and abroad as targeting Muslims. \n \n On Monday, White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters that the Quebec shooting was “a terrible reminder of why we must remain vigilant, and why the president is taking steps to be proactive, rather than reactive, when it comes to our nation’s safety and security.” \n \n FATHER OF FOUR KILLED \n \n A father of four, the owner of a halal butcher near the mosque, was among those killed, said Pamela Sakinah El-hayet, a friend of one of the people at the mosque. \n \n The mosque concierge was killed, as was Ahmed Youness, a 21-year-old student, El-hayet told Reuters. One of El-hayet’s friends, Youness’ roommate, was in the mosque at the time of the shooting. He was unharmed, she said, but in total shock. \n \n A man of Moroccan descent who had also been arrested was now considered a witness, although his nationality was not immediately known, a Canadian source familiar with the situation said. \n \n Ali Assafiri, a student at Université Laval, said he had been running late for the evening prayers at the mosque, near the university in the Quebec City area. When he arrived, the mosque had been transformed by police into a crime scene. \n \n Slideshow (16 Images) \n \n “Everyone was in shock,” Assafiri said by phone. “It was chaos.” \n \n Vigils were planned for Montreal and Quebec City, the provincial capital, as well as in Edmonton. There was an outpouring of support for the mosque on social media.']",3,"– Authorities in Canada think Sunday night's mosque shooting that left six people dead is a ""lone wolf situation,"" reports Reuters, and they think they've got their shooter: Alexandre Bissonnette, 27, appeared in court Monday and was charged with six counts of first-degree murder and five counts of attempted murder, reports CBC News. So far, he does not face any terrorism-related charges. Bissonnette attended Laval University, near the Quebec City mosque, and studied political science and anthropology. The AP reports that he was known to espouse ""far-right nationalist views"" online, and the Toronto Globe and Mail reports that this didn't begin until March when nationalist leader Marine Le Pen visited Quebec City. ""I wrote him off as a xenophobe,"" says a fellow Laval student. ""He was enthralled by a borderline racist nationalist movement."" A member of a refugee advocacy group says Bissonnette had become a familiar name to those who monitor extremist groups. He was ""unfortunately known to many activists in Quebec for taking nationalist, pro-Le Pen and anti-feminist positions at Laval University and on social media,"" François Deschamps wrote on the Facebook page of the group Welcome to Refugees, per the Montreal Gazette. Five victims of the shooting remained hospitalized as of Monday evening."

By mid-morning, PECO figures already showed that the storm was among the utility\'s worst outage incidents ever. Gov. Tom Corbett said at a noon press conference that utility crews from out of state would be called in to help with the wide-spread outages. He said as Pennsylvania energy companies had received some 750,000 calls so far, but his office had yet to declare a state of emergency. ""We\'re going to continue to monitor the situation,"" Corbett said. ""Our major concern is that it is supposed to go below freezing tonight. It\'s going to refreeze tonight and we want everyone to be careful on the roads."" \n \n Emergency crews in Philadelphia, Montgomery, Bucks, Chester and Delaware counties were busy responding to calls most of the morning, with some hampered by slick roads, downed trees and live lines that had fallen to the ground. Utility crews restored power to some areas as others were going dark. \n \n Bucks County dispatchers said they were too swamped with calls to verify police radio reports of a tree that had fallen into a home in Warminster with possible injuries. \n \n Conditions varied widely with temperatures hovering near freezing -- a few degrees on either side. That appears to have made a difference. Suburbs north and west of Philadelphia faced slick conditions and widespread power outages, while South Jersey, although covered in plenty of ice, was warm enough that roads were mostly wet. \n \n ""Far north, far west, that\'s where you\'re having the biggest problems from the icing,"" Jeffrey Knueppel, a SEPTA deputy general manager, said at a news briefing. \n \n Postman John Woodring wasn\'t deterred by the conditions. Wearing a white pith helmet to keep the melting ice off his wool watch cap, Woodring trudged through what remained of the nearly 11 inches of snow that fell earlier in the week in Cheltenham, Montgomery County. \n \n He carefully avoided paved surfaces, favoring paths where he could hear the comforting crunch of snow underfoot. He was taking precautions to avoid slips, or worse, breaking a leg, he said. \n \n ""I\'ll be taking baby steps, dodging falling branches,"" Woodring said. ""I couldn\'t go fast if I wanted to!"" \n \n Power \n \n PECO\'s online outage map was showing that about 595,000 customers were without power in the Philadelphia area as of around noon.

That was followed by more than 180,000 customers impacted in Montgomery County, 138,000 in Bucks County, 67,000 in Delaware County and 27,000 in Philadelphia. \n \n Outages were fewer in South Jersey. PSE&G was reporting that Burlington County was the hardest hit, with about 8,000 customers there lacking power. \n \n Transportation \n \n Several SEPTA Regional Rail lines halted service this morning: The West Trenton Line is suspended due to a CSX train derailment, the Paoli-Thorndale and Cynwyd lines are suspended due to Amtrak power issues and the Warminster Line is suspended due to signal problems. Passengers should expect delays of up to 40 minutes on Regional Rail trains system-wide. \n \n Some SEPTA bus routes are being detoured. \n \n New Jersey Transit said rail, bus and light rail tickets would be cross-honored system-wide. \n \n Amtrak suspended Keystone Service between Philadelphia and Harrisburg due to numerous weather-related issues. \n \n Reduced speed limits are in place on the New Jersey Turnpike: 35 mph between exit 8 and the George Washington Bridge and 50 mph between exits 3 and 8. \n \n PennDOT imposed speed restrictions on major highways for much of the morning rush, but normal speed limits were restored around 9 a.m. \n \n Downed trees were causing traffic disruptions and lane closures on major roads throughout the morning. \n \n Several dozen flights were canceled or delayed at Philadelphia International Airport, according to FlightAware.com. \n \n As the lingering mounds of snow melt into already saturated ground, flooding was also a possibility in many areas. \n \n Schools \n \n School closures did not appear to be widespread. In those areas hardest hit by the ice some districts did close, such as Cheltenham. Philadelphia schools were already scheduled to be closed for classes with only staff expected to report. \n \n However, the Archdiocese of Philadelphia and many suburban school districts were opening later than usual. For example, Lower Merion Township. and Cherry Hill schools were opening two hours late. The archdiocese schools are operating on a one-hour delay. \n \n Some universities are also closing or operating on delayed schedules. Temple University, for instance, was opening at 10 a.m., and Rutgers campuses will open at noon.

Regional airline Cape Air alone cancelled more than 200 flights, including nearly every flight planned from airports in Massachusetts. \n \n Along with travel disruptions, the storm also cut electricity to hundreds of thousands of customers in the region. Nearly 750,000 customers in Pennsylvania were left in the dark by the storm\'s wrath, with a major utility company telling residents power could remain out until the weekend. \n \n In Connecticut, the start of the state\'s General Assembly annual session was delayed until Thursday due to the snow. Nearly a foot of snow buried Massachusetts, schools were largely cancelled across Rhode Island, and rail service out of Washington, D.C. on Wednesday afternoon was limited. \n \n Across the nation, residents struggled to carry on despite the storm. \n \n ""I wish that groundhog would have stayed in its hole,"" said Geoff Dunn, who took the bus to his downtown Columbus, Ohio, office, avoiding the messy roads but still having to navigate snowy sidewalks.

The entire door is ruined,” said the homeowner. \n \n That homeowner asked not to be identified, but the single mom with four kids says the family wasn’t home at the time of the break-in. \n \n “It’s scary to think about what if my kids and I would have been home,” she said. “It’s definitely terrifying you don’t want anything like that to happen.” \n \n Because the would be thieves didn’t actually steal anything, police suggested the criminals have may been scared away by the family’s pet pig, Dumplin. \n \n “The officers were guessing when the person broke in they were probably surprised I had a pig and were like, ‘We don’t want to deal with this,’” said the homeowner. “The cop was like we definitely think they got in and made it to where Dumplin was and thought, ‘Nope.

Snowfall will range between a few inches in some areas, including New York City and Pittsburgh, to more than a foot in the Catskills and parts of New England. The ""norm,"" per CNN, will be eight to 12 inches, with snowfall slowing in the afternoon. Ice is also expected in many areas, with New York City facing half an inch.

His bet with Joe Scarborough (who had dubbed him a ""joke"") only stoked the controversy further. \n \n As it turned out, Silver came through with flying colors, as Obama performed nearly exactly the way he said he would. The public recognition was immediate. \n \n ""You know who won the election tonight? Nate Silver,"" Rachel Maddow said on MSNBC. Even Fox News tipped its cap to Silver. \n \n Others said that the results could force a bit of a sea change in political journalism. \n \n ""What does this victory mean?"" Mashable\'s Chris Taylor wrote. ""That mathematical models can no longer be derided by ""gut-feeling"" pundits. That Silver\'s contention -- TV pundits are generally no more accurate than a coin toss -- must now be given wider credence."" \n \n For his part, Silver cheekily plugged his new book: \n \n Silver\'s wasn\'t the only forecast that had a good night:', ""The U.S. and South Korea are to blame for North Korea’s latest missile launch over Japan, and further sanctions on the regime will not ameliorate the situation, Russia said Tuesday. \n \n In defiance of U.N. resolutions banning its missile testing and fresh international sanctions drafted by the U.S., North Korea carried out another missile test on Tuesday morning, the fourth in as many days, this time directly over Japan for the first time. The regime has already traded barbs with President Donald Trump due to its repeated missile testing and expanding range, including a direct threat made at U.S. pacific territory Guam. \n \n That threat prompted the U.S. to rally its allies and, with China and Russia on side, impose new sanctions on the rogue state. \n \n Anticipating more of the same to follow, Russia’s Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told journalists on Tuesday that U.S. actions were pushing the regime toward more tests, not halting it, state news agency Itar-Tass reported. \n \n “If we go by how colleagues from the U.S. and other western countries have acted in the past, then of course we can expect new steps towards tightening the sanctions, but this will not solve the problem,” Ryabkov said. “It is now obvious to everyone that the resources for influencing North Korea with sanctions have run out.” \n \n Ryabkov referred to the joint military exercises the U.S. is currently holding with ally South Korea. The latest Ulchi Freedom Guardian activity involved computer-simulated warfare and took place over the weekend. The drill aims to strengthen the ability to respond to an potential attack from the North and continues until the end of August. The Russian minister called it “a trend of escalation,” a reiteration of China and Russia's previous arguments in favor of limiting U.S. military presence in the Asia Pacific neighborhood. \n \n The North regularly protests U.S. drills in the region, and in his statement Ryabkov appeared to refer to Ulchi Freedom Guardian directly, taking a more sympathetic approach to the North’s tests. \n \n Read More: After U.S. travel ban, North Korea is courting Russian tourists with new agency \n \n “We consider the joint drills that went ahead anyway, albeit in a lighter mode compared to the initial agenda, made an impact in terms of provoking Pyongyang to make the new launch.

Russian President Vladimir Putin will visit Chinese President Xi Jinping for a trade summit next month, where the pair will discuss North Korea.

Ansel and Helena also have birthdays next week, Tuesday and Saturday respectively. \n \n Verhaaren received a B.S. degree in accounting from Brigham Young University, magna cum laude, and a J.D. from the New York University School of Law. His most recent position was the Managing Director of Universal Equity Group Funds Arizona. \n \n According to Jay Larson, Verhaaren’s neighbor in Mesa, Ariz., Rob and Bridget were both avid cyclists and loved the sport because it kept them fit and healthy. \n \n “His whole family is awesome,” Larson said. “They would bend over backwards for anyone.” \n \n Just this past Monday, the Verhaaren family was out putting up flags in their neighborhood to celebrate Labor Day. \n \n Verhaaren was a beloved scoutmaster who wanted his scouts to have memorable experiences. One time, without permission, Verhaaren registered his troop into a lottery for a chance to go spend their summer camp on Catalina Island at Camp Emerald Bay. The troop was lucky and thanks to him, more than 30 boys had the opportunity to go to California this past summer. \n \n The Verhaaren family is no stranger to cycling accidents. Bridget crashed earlier this year, breaking her hand and separating her shoulder. \n \n Olympic BMX cyclist, Arielle Martin, wife to Rob’s brother Michael, was also in an accident recently. Her experience at the London Games ended before it truly began as she crashed during a practice run a few days before her event. Since then, Martin has undergone numerous surgeries to repair damage to her liver and one of her lungs. \n \n Dave Collins, one of Verhaaren’s training partners, nearly lost his life in 2009 during a cycling accident of his own. He collided with a car and went through one of the windows, severing his carotid artery. Luckily, an ER doctor was close by and was able to stop the bleeding before it was too late. \n \n Race spokesman Dave Bern says the 206-mile race also was marred by serious accidents in Idaho and Wyoming that sent two bicyclists to the hospital and by flat tires experienced by roughly 200 cyclists early on. \n \n He says it's the first fatality in the race's 30-year history. \n \n LOTOJA, the annual race from Logan, Utah to Jackson Hole, Wyoming is the longest single-day bike race in the country at roughly 206 miles and is sanctioned by USA Cycling.""]",3,"– The official results from Florida aren't in yet but it looks like Nate Silver—whose blog accounted for a fifth of the New York Times' web traffic Monday—correctly called 50 out of 50 states after getting 49 right in 2008.

(AP) — A bag carried to the moon aboard the Apollo 11 spacecraft and used for the first sample of lunar material is at the center a legal fight after the government mistakenly sold it during the criminal case against the former director of the Kansas Cosmosphere and Space Center. \n \n The white bag — which was flown to the moon on Apollo 11 in June 1969 and has lunar material embedded in its fabric — is ""a rare artifact, if not a national treasure,"" the government said. \n \n The dispute is the latest legal twist in the case of Max Ary, the founder and longtime director of the Cosmosphere in Hutchinson who was convicted in November 2005 for stealing and selling museum artifacts. \n \n At issue in his prosecution were hundreds of missing space artifacts and memorabilia. Some were on loan from NASA to the Cosmosphere. The lunar bag was discovered in 2003 during the execution of a search warrant in a box located in Ary\'s garage. \n \n On Wednesday, the U.S. Attorney\'s Office asked a federal judge to set aside the final forfeiture order and rescind the bag\'s sale, saying that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration was not properly notified of its forfeiture because the bag was misidentified. \n \n The bag was sold at a government auction on Feb. 15, 2015 for $995 to Nancy Carlson in Inverness, Illinois. NASA learned the Apollo 11 bag had been sold without notice or permission when Carlson sent it to NASA at the Johnson Space Center in Houston for authentication. Carlson separately sued NASA in June in a federal court in Illinois, seeking the return of the bag. \n \n Federal prosecutors want the federal judge in Kansas who handled Ary\'s criminal case and subsequent forfeiture to rescind the sale and refund Carlson her money. \n \n Apparently, two lunar bags were confused as one and the same after inventory identification numbers of them were combined on spreadsheets, the government said. \n \n The other bag was an Apollo 17 lunar sample bag that was flown to the lunar surface aboard the Lunar Module Challenger. That bag was sold by Ary at a 2001 auction for $24,150, and it was later recovered by the government during its investigation. \n \n Ary, who was president and CEO of the Cosmosphere from 1976 to 2002, was sentenced to three years in prison and ordered to pay $132,274 in restitution. He has since been released from prison after serving about 70 percent of his sentence. \n \n He has always maintained his innocence, saying he accidentally mixed museum artifacts with ones he collected and sold privately from his home.']",4,"– The biggest apology of the week came from Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, but it was hardly the only one to make headlines: Shamed: “I apologize from my heart to those who have died or been injured.

But sometimes it’s about the jeans. \n \n Seven-year-old Grayson Powell bowled the game of his life to win his team of three a youth bowling tournament in the Newfoundland city of St John’s on Saturday. But shortly after his 171-point game propelled Riverdale to the title, Grayson was disqualified, and was unable to collect his prize. \n \n The reason? He wore the wrong trousers. \n \n “The rule is you have to wear black pants,” Todd Powell, Grayson’s father, explained to CBC. Grayson was wearing faded black jeans – which were evidently not black enough. \n \n So as Grayson waited in line to collect his gold medal, Gord Davis, the provincial director at Youth Bowl Canada, informed Grayson’s parents that their son was to be disqualified for his sartorial breach. \n \n Powell Sr said he was distinctly unimpressed with Davis’s ruling. “If this is what sport is about when it comes to kids … shame on them.” \n \n But Davis’s organisation insists it did nothing wrong, and said the dress code for Provincial A tournaments had been in place “for decades”. In an impassioned defence on Facebook that ran to 2,600 words and seemed to have been written by Davis, Newfoundland & Labrador YBC rejected accusations of wrongdoing and said simply: rules were rules. \n \n “Mr Todd Powell knew full aware of the dress code, and sent his child to Provincials knowing that it was against the rules,” the post read. “Why is NL YBC in the wrong here, when parents knowingly broke the rules, and we are the bad guys? \n \n “We did nothing wrong. Stop blaming NL YBC and [president] Gord Davis for something that should never have had happened. Ignorance of a rule … is not the fault of the governing body.” \n \n Powell Sr pointed out to CBC that his son Grayson had been allowed to bowl throughout. Why wait until he had finished to disqualify him? “The problem I have with it … they allowed him to bowl prior. He owes these three kids a written apology.” \n \n YL NBC said additional opinions had been needed with other executive members before a ruling could be made. “I was not going to embarrass those kids by stopping play and making a scene,” Davis wrote. \n \n Later, on the same Facebook page, Gord Davis said that even though the decision could not be reversed, Grayson and his team would be presented with gold medals in a special ceremony because the situation had been “blown out of proportion for simple communication problems”. \n \n “I informed Todd that the kids had bowled magnificently and yes they deserve to be recognized for their accomplishments,” Davis wrote. \n \n “We will make sure these kids are taken care of first because that is what we are all about. We apologized for what decision we had to make and the fact that they were not relayed any information during the first or third game.” \n \n The governing body said it wished to move on from the controversy and simply concentrate on bowling. “Any kid can play this sport,” the post read. “Lots of kids won’t play sports because they feel they don’t belong and they are bullied, or just not good enough. Well, bowling is not like that: we treat all kids equally.” \n \n Providing, of course, they’re wearing the right pants.']",4,"– A 7-year-old bowler in Canada just learned a tough lesson about rules, or pants, or ... something.

In a long rebuttal, Gord Davis, provincial head of Youth Bowling Canada, insisted the organization ""did nothing wrong"" and is ""not to blame for how this went down."" The black jeans dress code has been in place ""for decades,"" he said, and rules are rules. The boy's dad smelled a rat. He accused Davis of disqualifying his son's team so the second- and third-place teams, which bowl at lanes owned by Davis, could take higher honors. Davis fired back that Powell was ""full aware of the dress code"" and sent his kid anyway. He pressed: ""What parent would do this?"" As the Guardian reports, one of Powell's complaints is that his son was disqualified only after bowling a 171-point game that propelled his Riverdale team to the title in the Newfoundland city of St. John's."" After the story made headlines in Canada, an odd-sounding compromise was reached. The disqualification stands, but the kids get their gold medals.

The carrier said the so-called “bug bounty” is a first for the airline industry. \n \n “If you think you have discovered a potential security bug that affects our websites, apps and/or online portals, please let us know,” the site reads. “If the submission meets our requirements, we’ll gladly reward you for your time and effort."" \n \n The maximum payout is 1,000,000 miles. \n \n ABOUT THE BUG BOUNTY: http://www.united.com/web/en-US/content/Contact/bugbounty.aspx \n \n Wiens says he poked through United’s online systems for about six hours recently to find a flaw. He says he thought the vulnerability was important, but not worthy of so many miles. \n \n “I did not expect to qualify for a full million,” he said. \n \n Wiens posted a picture on Twitter showing two deposits from United that arrived on Friday. One deposit was 999,999 plus another for one mile. Together, it’s a huge 1,000,000 mile windfall. \n \n What flaw did Wiens discover? He can’t say. \n \n One million miles will travel quite far.

In the early hours of March 18, 1990, two men dressed as cops were let into the Gardner Museum, where they tied up two security guards and absconded with the artwork and the museum's security footage, the Boston Globe reports. But the thieves, who have never been identified, may have missed one key thing. According to the FBI, surveillance footage from the day before the robbery shows a security guard letting a man into the museum—against protocol—through the same door later used in the robbery. The Globe reports it's unclear why this footage wasn't viewed by law enforcement earlier, but it could show a ""dry run"" of the heist. The newspaper identifies Richard Abath as the security guard in the footage, and the FBI is hoping the public can help identify the mystery man he lets in. Abath, a rock musician at the time who now lives in Vermont, has claimed he had no part in the robbery, but this new footage appears to contradict a number of his statements. No one has ever been charged with stealing the art—for which there is a $5 million reward—and no one ever will, as the statute of limitations has expired. Someone in possession of the paintings, however, could face charges. Their total value exceeds $500 million, reports AP."
166,"['The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act bans companies from paying foreign officials to get more business. The law has recently been targeted by lobbyists — including an arm of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce with ties to Wal-Mart — who criticize it as too broad and bad for business. \n \n The Times investigation found that Wal-Mart de Mexico paid more than $24 million in bribes to win construction permits. When a whistleblower alerted top Wal-Mart executives in 2005, they launched an investigation that found evidence of the bribery but then shut down the inquiry. The company failed to report any of the information to law enforcement at the time, the Times story said. \n \n The revelations threaten to blemish the cleaned-up image Wal-Mart has carefully put together in recent years after facing criticism that it paid workers too little and put mom-and-pop stores out of business. \n \n As officials in recent years have stepped up their enforcement of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the Chamber has been pushing for the law to be scaled back. \n \n The U.S. Chamber Institute for Legal Reform, an arm of the Chamber that has been a leader in criticizing the law, listed two Wal-Mart executives as board members in its 2010 tax form: Jeff Gearhart, Wal-Mart’s general counsel, and Thomas Hyde, a former Wal-Mart corporate secretary who stepped down in August 2010. \n \n Hyde was among the company executives who received initial reports of the alleged bribery in 2005, according to the Times story. \n \n “We take compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) very seriously and are committed to having a strong and effective global anti-corruption program in every country in which we operate,” David Tovar, Wal-Mart’s vice president of corporate communications, said in a statement Saturday. “Many of the alleged activities in The New York Times article are more than six years old. If these allegations are true, it is not a reflection of who we are or what we stand for.” \n \n A spokesman for Justice Department declined to comment. The people who confirmed the department’s investigation spoke on the condition of anonymity because the probe is ongoing. \n \n Wal-Mart’s shares slid nearly 5 percent Monday, and the company faced more questions about how much it knew about the corruption and why it did not tell authorities. Reps. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) and Henry A. Waxman (D-Calif.) sent a letter to Wal-Mart chief executive Michael Duke requesting an in-person meeting about the bribery allegations. \n \n Labor critics again raised alarms about the company’s practices. \n \n “The reported cover-up by Walmart executives at the highest levels exposes a core truth: Walmart cannot be taken at its word,” Joe Hansen, international president of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, said in statement. \n \n One in five Wal-Mart stores is in Mexico. Wal-Mart de Mexico is the company’s largest foreign subsidiary. \n \n Staff writer Tom Hamburger contributed to this report.', 'Chinese tech billionaire Jack Ma\'s promise to create 1 million new US jobs is the latest casualty of the trade war. \n \n The Alibaba (BABA) chief grabbed attention at the start of last year when he made the highly ambitious pledge following a meeting with Donald Trump, who was president elect at the time. \n \n But in an interview published late Wednesday by China\'s official news agency, Xinhua, Ma said the waves of new tariffs imposed by Washington and Beijing in recent months have undermined the plan. \n \n ""This promise was on the basis of friendly China-US cooperation and reasonable bilateral trade relations, but the current situation has already destroyed that basis,"" Ma said. ""This promise can\'t be completed."" \n \n A spokeswoman for Alibaba, China\'s biggest e-commerce company, confirmed Ma\'s comments to CNN. \n \n Analysts had already expressed serious doubts about the pledge, which Alibaba announced after Trump and Ma met at Trump Tower in New York in January 2017. \n \n ""Jack and I are going to do some great things,"" Trump said at the time. \n \n Ma\'s vague promise wasn\'t based on Alibaba investing in the United States to build factories or fulfillment centers. Instead, he talked about stimulating trade by helping American small businesses sell their products to consumers in China and elsewhere in Asia. \n \n Alibaba held a big conference in Detroit last year to encourage American small businesses and farmers to sell their products to Chinese consumers through its platforms. The company didn\'t immediately respond to a request Thursday for information on how many US jobs those efforts have created so far. \n \n In the Xinhua interview, Ma said Alibaba ""will not stop promoting the healthy development of China-US trade."" \n \n A strong advocate of globalization, he has expressed growing fears about the trade war, telling investors earlier this week that it could drag on for as long as 20 years. \n \n ""It\'s going to last long, it\'s going to be a mess,"" Ma said Tuesday in Hangzhou, the city where Alibaba is based. \n \n The 54-year-old tycoon, who set up Alibaba in his apartment nearly two decades ago, announced this month that he will step down as executive chairman of the company next year. Daniel Zhang, the current CEO, will succeed him. \n \n Ma, a former English teacher, said he wants to return to education. \n \n -- Yong Xiong and Sherisse Pham contributed to this report.']",2,"– Walmart is under criminal investigation by the Department of Justice over allegations that it doled out millions in bribes to Mexican officials in order to grow its business there more quickly, sources tell Bloomberg and the Washington Post.

But a State Department official said that the fact the money wasn\'t transferred on Jan. 1 doesn\'t mean it was frozen. ""There are still deliberations taking place, and we have until mid January to decide what we are going to do,” the official said. \n \n The Trump administration has frozen $125 million in funding for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, which provides aid to Palestinian refugees, according to three Western diplomats who were informed of the move. They said the funding, one third of the annual U.S. donations to the agency, was supposed to be transferred by Jan. 1 but was withheld. \n \n The details: The diplomats, who asked to speak on conditions of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter, said the funding was frozen until the Trump administration finishes its review of U.S. aid to the Palestinian Authority. \n \n The move comes after the Palestinian Authority suspended their contacts with the Trump administration in response to its decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. A senior White House official said no decision have been made yet, but confirmed that a review of the U.S. assistance to the Palestinians is underway ""in light of the Palestinians\' recent conduct."" \n \n The diplomats added that U.S. officials told U.N. officials in the last two days that President Trump is considering totally cutting the part of the funding which was frozen, and is even considering cutting up to $180 million, which amounts to half of the U.S. funding to UNRWA. \n \n The impact: The Western diplomats said freezing or cutting of such a big part of the U.S. funding would be catastrophic for the organization, would hamper its work and might lead to negative consequences for the Palestinian refugee camps in Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan and Lebanon. \n \n U.N. secretary general António Guterres has spoken with senior U.S. official about the UNRWA funding and also consulted with foreign ministers from other donor countries, according to the diplomats. \n \n The Israeli security establishment and the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories — the Israeli organization that oversees government activities in the West Bank and Gaza — are concerned about possible freezing or cutting of U.S. funding to UNRWA, fearing the escalation of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. \n \n “The humanitarian situation in Gaza is complicated enough and harming UNRWA funding will only make it more complicated,"" a senior Israeli security official told me. \n \n What we\'re hearing: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is not enthusiastic about the cutting of U.S. funding to UNRWA, but is politically pressed by conservative ministers in his cabinet and by the fact he can\'t be more dovish on the Palestinian issue than President Trump. \n \n Officials in the prime minister\'s office told diplomats from several western countries that Israel does not object to the cutting of U.S. funding to the Palestinian Authority, but prefers that the U.S. doesn\'t cut funding to UNRWA due to the fact it also serves Israeli security interests. \n \n A senior Israeli official told me Netanyahu is in touch with the White House on the UNRWA funding issue, and conveyed the message that Israel prefers “gradual disengagement"" with UNRWA by the U.S. and not a big funding cut. \n \n The prime minister\'s office said in a statement: ""Netanyahu supports President Trump\'s critical attitude towards UNRWA and believes practical steps need to be taken in order to change the fact that UNRWA is being used to entrench the Palestinian refugee problem instead of solving it.""', 'Tweet with a location \n \n You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

He added that Trump ""has every right to express his view of any case."" \n \n The latter comment refers to Trump\'s tweets dismissing special counsel Robert Mueller\'s probe into the Trump campaign\'s alleged collusion with Russia during the 2016 election. Most recently, Michael Flynn, the president\'s former national security adviser and campaign aide, pleaded guilty on Friday to lying to the FBI, and one day later, Trump\'s Twitter account posted a comment that could help bolster a case of obstruction: \n \n “I had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI. He has pled guilty to those lies. It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful. There was nothing to hide!” Trump posted, the first time he suggested he knew Flynn lied to investigators. \n \n The tweet could be seen as evidence of obstruction of justice because Trump later reportedly asked then-FBI Director James Comey to “let” the Flynn thing “go."" \n \n Dowd said that he wrote the tweet. Not that it matters, because the president can\'t be found guilty of obstruction, the lawyer claims. \n \n It’s not clear which section of the Constitution\'s Article II Dowd was referencing, though Section Two does read: “ The president] may require the Opinion, in writing, of the principal Officer in each of the executive Departments, upon any Subject relating to the Duties of their respective Offices.” \n \n Keep up with this story and more by subscribing now \n \n But according to Dowd, the tweet was the furthest thing from an admission of guilt or obstruction. \n \n ""The tweet did not admit obstruction. That is an ignorant and arrogant assertion,” Dowd told Axios. \n \n Dowd’s comments hark back to former President Richard Nixon’s defense of his actions in office. Nixon, who resigned in August 1974 before he could be impeached, famously said during his interviews with British journalist David Frost in 1977 that “when the president does it, that means it is not illegal.” \n \n REUTERS/James Lawler Duggan \n \n In Nixon’s case, he was talking about the cover-up in the Watergate scandal, while Trump’s case involves the president’s powers over the Justice Department. Trump lamented in November that the “saddest thing” about being president is that he is “not supposed to be involved with the Justice Department” and the “FBI.” \n \n Trump then asked why the Justice Department was not going after his former presidential opponent, Hillary Clinton, and her private email server scandal. He also wondered why the department was not investigating Clinton’s campaign for hiring the company that created the infamous Trump-Russia dossier that has dogged Trump’s first year in office.', 'Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption David Cameron: ""There\'s not going to be a G8 summit this year in Russia"" \n \n The G8 summit will not take place in Russia this year, UK Prime Minister David Cameron has said. \n \n Speaking in the Netherlands, Mr Cameron said it was ""absolutely clear"" the planned June meeting of world leaders in the Russian resort of Sochi would not happen owing to events in Ukraine. \n \n The EU and US have imposed sanctions on Russian officials after Russia\'s annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. \n \n Moscow has also been warned of further action if it does not change course. \n \n The announcement that the Sochi meeting had been effectively cancelled came after Russian troops seized control of the last major military base in Crimea. \n \n Mr Cameron, US President Barack Obama and other G8 leaders are attending a nuclear co-operation summit in The Hague, to which Russian President Vladimir Putin was not invited. \n \n \'Illegal annexation\' \n \n ""We should be clear there\'s not going to be a G8 summit in Russia,"" Mr Cameron said, urging Russia to ""change course"". \n \n The G7 leaders plus EU representatives issued a declaration after their meeting in The Hague noting that ""international law prohibits the acquisition of part or all of another state\'s territory through coercion or force"". \n \n Image copyright AFP \n \n ""To do so violates the principles upon which the international system is built,"" they said. \n \n ""We condemn the illegal referendum held in Crimea in violation of Ukraine\'s constitution.

""The tweet did not admit obstruction,"" Dowd says. ""That is an ignorant and arrogant assertion."" Plus, the Constitution has Trump's back, per Dowd. ""[The] president cannot obstruct justice because he is the chief law enforcement officer under [the Constitution's Article II] and has every right to express his view of any case,"" he claims. Newsweek notes it's not clear which section of Article II Dowd refers to, though it speculates on one part involving the president seeking the opinion ""of the principal Officer in each of the executive Departments, upon any Subject relating to the Duties of their respective Offices."" Allen notes that with this pronouncement, Trump's legal team is ""setting the stage"" to keep Trump insulated from obstruction of justice or collusion charges in the Russia probe—meaning, Allen speculates, that his lawyers may be nervous charges are coming down the pike. But one of Barack Obama's former counsels notes ""it is certainly possible"" for Trump to have obstructed justice, and Allen points out Richard Nixon's Articles of Impeachment were jump-started with the assertion that Nixon ""has prevented, obstructed, and impeded the administration of justice."" But whether Trump can or can't be held responsible for such a transgression may be moot, Allen adds. ""The one thing everyone agrees on is that the House of Representatives, with its impeachment power, alone decides what is cause for removal from office,"" he writes.

Is it suggesting the Ukrainian SU-25 (despite its technical limitations) shot down the passenger jet in mid-air? \n \n And why? The plane would seem to have been travelling in the wrong direction for Ukrainian forces to have perceived it as a hostile aircraft coming from Russia, and the rebels don\'t have an air force. \n \n So are they seriously suggesting the Ukrainians deliberately moved their missiles on to rebel-held territory and shot the airliner down as part of some sort of nefarious plan to frame the rebels and turn world opinion against them? \n \n But then Russia doesn\'t need to prove its case - all it needs is to create one, to insist that there are different versions of events, that there is credible claim and counter-claim. \n \n In much the same manner as a criminal defence barrister, Russia doesn\'t have to demonstrate that its alleged client is innocent - just to establish enough doubt in the minds of the jury - in this case the international community - that they can\'t be completely sure.', 'Published on Apr 6, 2015 \n \n The Fate of the Furious: The Album available now - https://atlantic.lnk.to/f8 \n \n \n \n Download the new Furious 7 Soundtrack Deluxe Version on iTunes here: http://smarturl.it/furious7deluxe \n \n \n \n See Wiz on tour http://wizkhalifa.com/tour \n \n \n \n Tag #SeeYouAgain on Shazam and get an exclusive behind the scenes look at the music video! \n \n \n \n Get official merch here: http://atlr.ec/OfficialWKMerchYT \n \n \n \n Stream Furious 7 on Spotify: http://smarturl.it/streamFurious7 \n \n \n \n Directed by: Marc Klasfeld \n \n \n \n Follow Wiz: \n \n ►Subscribe to channel: http://goo.gl/y3Bnno \n \n ►Twitter - https://twitter.com/wizkhalifa \n \n ►Facebook - https://facebook.com/wizkhalifa \n \n ►Instagram - https://instagram.com/mistercap \n \n ►Soundcloud - https://soundcloud.com/wizkhalifa \n \n ►Website: http://wizkhalifa.com \n \n ►Taylor Gang: http://taylorgang.com \n \n \n \n Follow Charlie Puth: \n \n ►Subscribe to channel: https://www.youtube.com/charlieputh \n \n ►Twitter - https://twitter.com/charlieputh \n \n ►Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/charlieputh \n \n ►Instagram - http://instagram.com/charlieputh \n \n ►Soundcloud - https://soundcloud.com/charlieputh \n \n ►Website: http://charlieputh.com/ \n \n \n \n Wiz Khalifa - See You Again ft.

Officials have been searching for Wall since her disappearance on Aug. 10, when she boarded Madsen's sub, which then sank off of Denmark's Refshaleoen island. Madsen initially claimed he had dropped Wall off after they'd cruised around for about three hours, but in a police statement cited by the Local, that story has since been modified. ""The accused has told police and the court that an accident occurred on board the submarine which caused Kim Wall’s death, and that he subsequently buried her at sea at an unspecified location somewhere in Koge Bay,"" reads the statement in the closed-door case. Madsen's explanation was released after a defense and prosecution request. Although the statement also notes that ""current charges remain in place,"" it's unclear what those charges are: Deutsche Welle notes that Madsen was originally charged with negligent manslaughter, but it's now reporting a new charge of aggressive manslaughter, which it says can lead to a prison sentence of up to eight years. A search for Wall's body in the newly pinpointed area is now underway."

Most of the displaced were women and children. While some have begun to return home, others remain concerned for their safety. \n \n “Humanitarian partners have activated our contingency plan for Juba and are mobilising assistance for people affected by these tragic events,” said Mr. Owusu, “We urgently call on all concerned to guarantee safe and unhindered access for humanitarian organisations to ensure that we are able to reach all people in need, including in locations hardest-hit by the fighting.” \n \n During the clashes, some humanitarian facilities, compounds and warehouses - including a maternity ward in a Protection of Civilians site - were hit by shelling and gunfire. “I have stressed this before, and I must stress it again: destruction and damage to humanitarian facilities and violence against aid workers are unacceptable and must stop” said Mr. Owusu. \n \n Prior to the eruption of fighting in Juba, the humanitarian situation in South Sudan was already dire, with unprecedented levels of food insecurity and one in five people displaced. The 2016 Humanitarian Response Plan for South Sudan is currently just 40 per cent funded - $508 million received out of $1.3 billion required – and additional resources are urgently required to respond to the growing needs. \n \n “I urge major donors to step up and support humanitarian action and the large numbers of people in South Sudan who are in dire need of assistance,” said Mr. Owusu. \n \n For further information, please contact: \n \n Guiomar Pau Sole, Public Information Officer, UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in South Sudan (pausole@un.org / +211920100411) OCHA press releases are available at www.unocha.org/south-sudan or www.reliefweb.int.']",2,"– Marijuana enthusiast Snoop Dogg launched a website yesterday, and of course it's all about weed.

172,"['BANGKOK (AP) — A man in Thailand upset with his wife hanged their 11-month-old daughter on Facebook Live and then killed himself, police said Tuesday. \n \n Police Col. Jirasak Siemsak said officers found the bodies of 20-year-old Wuttisan Wongtalay and the baby in an abandoned hotel in Phuket province after receiving reports of the video. \n \n ""He felt neglected by his wife because they had been fighting so he took his 11-month-old daughter to the site of the crime which is the abandoned hotel,"" Jirasak said. ""Then we found the bodies hanging off the hotel."" \n \n The man made the broadcast Monday evening, and the video was made inaccessible by Facebook late Tuesday afternoon. \n \n ""The mother of the child was crying and was very sad,"" Jirasak said. ""I am also very sad. It is a personal dispute and they were still very young."" \n \n The incident came less than two weeks after a man in Cleveland, Ohio, in the United States broadcast himself on Facebook Live shooting a man to death. A series of other offensive broadcasts, including sexual assaults, has caused Facebook to seek ways to block such videos as quickly as possible. \n \n Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said last week that his company has ""a lot of work"" to do on the problem. \n \n The chief investigator in the Phuket case, Lt. Jula-at Suwannin, said police have yet to question Wuttisan\'s 20-year-old widow because they are giving her time to grieve. \n \n In Thailand, the potential for problems with Facebook Live became an issue last May when local media used the platform to broadcast live video of a university lecturer who was locked in a six-hour standoff with police who were seeking him in the shooting deaths of two colleagues. After negotiations for his surrender failed, he fatally shot himself with a handgun, a moment that was shown live.', 'In Thailand, there was broad anger over the crime, which the police said appeared to have been driven by jealousy. Mr. Wongtalay had fought with his wife the night before the killing after searching her phone and accusing her of having another relationship. \n \n The video showed Mr. Wongtalay fixing a noose around his daughter’s neck and then dropping her off the side of a building. After a burst of crying, he climbed over the side to retrieve her body. His subsequent suicide was not shown online. \n \n A second video of the police taking both of the bodies down that night remained on Facebook. \n \n Facebook has been under scrutiny for what role it should play in overseeing the billions of posts and videos that are uploaded on its site each day. Facebook’s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, addressed the issue at a company conference this month in response to a case in which a man in Cleveland posted a video of himself shooting and killing a 74-year-old stranger. \n \n The deaths in Thailand highlight the global scope of the problem. As Facebook has pushed to further ensconce itself in the lives of its users, it has urged them to share their most intimate experiences on its site. That has resulted in a flood of posts and videos in different languages, cultural contexts and time zones across the world. Accidents and crimes have also occasionally shown up, and patrolling that has proved difficult. \n \n Last summer, an Italian wing-suit base jumper streamed his own death in an accident, while in January, three men in Sweden were arrested and accused of raping a woman and broadcasting it to a private Facebook group. In February, two journalists were fatally shot during a Facebook Live broadcast in the Dominican Republic.', 'Sources tell ABC News that the Inspector General for the Department of Defense has been preparing a report in which Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence Michael Vickers is criticized for giving sensitive information to the filmmakers behind "" Zero Dark Thirty."" \n \n Specifically, Vickers is said to have disclosed to the filmmakers the identity of a member of SEAL Team Six - though not a member of the team that conducted the raid on Osama bin Laden\'s compound. Names of members of that team are not to be disclosed because of the potential for violent retaliation. \n \n Some in the Pentagon think the Inspector General is holding the report until after the current Secretary of Defense, Leon Panetta, retires so as to not sully or embarrass him. \n \n A senior defense official disputed that. ""It\'s wrong for anyone to suggest the investigation has been held up for political reasons or to avoid embarrassment,"" the official said. ""The investigation simply hasn\'t concluded. These things often take time."" \n \n The official added that Pentagon officials ""really don\'t think this will amount to anything."" \n \n Documents released in May, after the conservative government watchdog group Judicial Watch obtained them through the Freedom of Information Act, revealed that in a July 14, 2011 meeting, Vickers told the filmmakers he would provide them with the name of a ""planner, SEAL Team 6 Operator and Commander."" \n \n ""The only thing we ask is that you not reveal his name in any way as a consultant because . . . he shouldn\'t be talking out of school."" Vickers said. ""This at least, this gives him one step removed and he knows what he can and can\'t say, but this way at least he can be as open as he can with you and it ought to meet your needs."" \n \n The senior defense official said that Vickers was asked by the Pentagon to talk to ""the \'Zero Dark Thirty\' filmmakers and others in the entertainment industry to provide unclassified information on the bin Laden operation. He wasn\'t doing this on his own. It\'s appropriate for department officials to work with the entertainment industry to try to inform how stories are told - especially those associated with one of the greatest intelligence and military successes of a generation."" \n \n The official said that ""Vickers is one of America\'s top defense and intelligence professionals who has closely guarded secrets for decades, and is highly respected in the Department of Defense and the Intelligence Community."" \n \n -Jake Tapper']",3,"– A 20-year-old man streamed himself hanging his 11-month-old daughter on Facebook Live before killing himself Monday evening in a vacant hotel in Thailand, the AP reports.

At the time, Hanyecz believed that the coins he had ""mined"" on his computer were worth around 0.003 cents each. \n \n Bitcoin mining involves solving a complex mathematical solution with the miner being rewarded in bitcoin. This is how Hanyecz got his initial coins. \n \n The cryptocurrency has many doubters as it continues to be associated with criminal activity, but it has still seen a stunning rally. Here are two facts, on Bitcoin Pizza Day, however, that highlight this: \n \n While being worth $30 at the time, Hanyecz pizzas would now cost $22.5 million at current bitcoin prices. \n \n If you bought $100 of bitcoin at the 0.003 cent price on May 22, 2010, you\'d now be sitting on around $75 million. \n \n A number of factors have been driving the rally: \n \n Recently passed legislation in Japan that allows retailers to start accepting bitcoin as a legal currency has boosted trading in yen, which now accounts for over 40 percent of all bitcoin trade \n \n Political uncertainty globally has driven demand for bitcoin as a safe haven asset \n \n A debate within the bitcoin community about the future of the underlying technology behind bitcoin known as the blockchain has been taking place. There was fear at one point this could lead to the creation of two separate cryptocurrencies but those worries have largely subsided with an alternative, more palatable option now being put forward. \n \n For an in-depth look at the factors driving bitcoin, click here.', 'Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Bitcoin\'s value has fluctuated sharply over the last four years \n \n The value of Bitcoin has hit a new high with each individual coin now worth more than $2,100 (£1,615). \n \n The valuation caps a strong month for the virtual currency, with its value growing by more than 65% in a month. \n \n The steady rise in value is believed to be linked to policy changes in Japan and China that have made it easier for speculators to trade in bitcoins. \n \n Many other virtual currencies have also enjoyed a sustained rise in value over the last few weeks. \n \n Bitcoin first broke the $1,000 (£768) barrier in November 2013 but its value has fluctuated wildly since then. For instance, in early 2014 one bitcoin was worth only $280 (£215). \n \n And at the end of 2016, each one was changing hands for about $900 (£690). \n \n Unsustainable bubble \n \n Bitcoin emerged in 2008 and is a digital currency based around cryptography. Individual coins can be split into smaller denominations and many people involved with the currency use computers to verify the globally-held log, known as the blockchain, of who spent what where. \n \n Verifying transactions involves solving a complicated mathematical problem and the first person to do so gets rewarded with bitcoins. \n \n Rising interest in bitcoin has sparked the creation of many other crypto-currencies. These have proved popular as the technology underlying bitcoin has struggled to cope with its popularity and growth. One estimate suggests bitcoins now make up only 47% of all traded crypto-currencies. \n \n Rivals such as Ethereum and Ripple have been gaining value far faster than bitcoin over the last few months. \n \n The surging valuations has led some commentators to suggest that an unsustainable crypto-currency bubble is developing. \n \n ""The question is not if but when the market will turn,"" said an editorial in The Economist.', 'Walk the walk. And talk the talk. But don’t do the two simultaneously, unless you want to risk veering off course, according to a study by Stony Brook University researchers. \n \n Although it’s widely accepted that texting and talking on cell phones while driving can lead to accidents, researchers found texting will throw people off course and interfere with memory– even when walking. \n \n Although it may be self-evident that texting while walking will lead to distractions, Stony Brook researchers measured the impact. \n \n Related stories \n \n They said they were looking at how the brain handles, or runs into problems, handling the two simultaneous activities. \n \n “We were surprised to find that talking and texting on a cell phone were so disruptive to one’s gait and memory recall,” said Eric M. Lamberg, co-author of the study and clinical associate professor in the Department of Physical Therapy at Stony Brook University’s School of Health Technology and Management. \n \n The study, by Lamberg and Lisa M. Muratori, a clinical associate professor in Stony Brook’s Department of Physical Therapy, was published in Gait & Posture titled “Cell phones change the way we walk.” \n \n “We were looking at whether texting had more disruptions than talking on a cell phone,” Lamberg said. \n \n Researchers asked participants to walk to a point 8 feet away and then asked them to return and repeat the exercise while texting, as well as talking on cell phones. \n \n The researchers found “gait velocity is reduced when using a cell phone while talking or texting,” that “navigational errors occur when texting while walking” and “texting while walking produces greater interference than talking on a cell phone.” \n \n “Cell phone use among pedestrians leads to increased cognitive distraction, reduced situation awareness and increases in unsafe behavior,” according to the abstract of the study in Gait and Posture online. “Performing a dual-task, such as talking or texting with a cell phone while walking, may interfere with working memory and result in walking errors.” \n \n Participants who texted while walking “veered off course, demonstrating a 61 percent increase in lateral deviation and 13 percent increase in distance traveled.” \n \n Lamberg said this shows the impact such distractions have on walking, an activity that seems automatic. \n \n “We are using the findings to help physical therapy patients improve true functional walking,” he said, noting some tasks may affect their gait or certain aspects of memory. “In rehabilitation, we should use this as a tool to prepare our patients to be more ready to function in a natural environment.” \n \n He said patients going through rehabilitation might even be told to text or talk while walking as they seek to regain their stride. \n \n “We think using dual-task methodology is a way to challenge people during rehabilitation,” Lamberg said, noting, at a minimum, people might be prepared for this dual tasking. “Using cell phone use as part of a gait-training paradigm isn’t common in physical therapy.” \n \n Reports surfaced last year that Philadelphia banned texting while walking, although city officials quashed those rumors. \n \n And texting while walking causes a fair number of collisions, although not like those while driving. \n \n While she was texting while walking last summer in the Berkshire Mall in Reading, Pa., Cathy Cruz Marrero tumbled into the mall fountain. \n \n The video system at the mall, where she worked, captured that moment. The video was posted on YouTube, generating nearly 4 million views. \n \n “We want to raise awareness that a real disruption occurs because of texting,” Lamberg said of the bigger picture. “Texting disrupts your ability much more than does talking.” \n \n Should texting while walking be banned? That’s not the idea behind the research. \n \n “Absolutely not,” Lamberg said. “I think it’s just to raise an awareness to this issue, that it does disrupt your ability to walk naturally.” \n \n More breaking news']",3,"– Monday was Bitcoin Pizza Day, the anniversary of the day in 2010 when developer Laszlo Hanyecz paid 10,000 bitcoins for two pizzas in the online currency's first recognized transaction.

181,"['Resources Thank the PFMC for Protecting the West Coast Ecosystem \n \n The Pacific coast of North America supports one of the most vibrant and diverse marine ecosystems on Earth, largely because of the presence of thick schools of small prey fish such as Pacific sardines. Unfortunately, this crucial forage fish appears to be in the midst of a severe population decline. Its absence will be felt by dozens of species of West Coast seabirds, whales, sharks, dolphins, and commercially important fish such as salmon and tuna that depend on sardines as a major food source. In addition, because sardines have been a staple of commercial purse-seine fishing on the West Coast, their decline raises the potential for fishing pressure to shift to similar, but more abundant, schooling species of forage fish. \n \n \n \n The Pacific Fishery Management Council, which manages fishing in federal waters off California, Oregon, and Washington, should do two things to help maintain a healthy Pacific Ocean: \n \n Set conservative catch limits on sardines when the population is so low. \n \n Fulfill its September 2013 commitment to prohibit unregulated fishing on forage fish species such as sand lance, saury, and lanternfish that are not currently managed or monitored. \n \n \n \n Cause for concern \n \n Populations of forage fish along the West Coast fluctuate widely, so a species can be abundant one year and dwindle unexpectedly the next. That’s because forage fish are highly dependent on the upwelling of cold nutrient- rich waters to stimulate the growth of phytoplankton, their primary food source. \n \n The Pacific sardine fishery, immortalized in John Steinbeck’s novel Cannery Row, collapsed notoriously the 1950s. The November 2013 population estimate of 378,000 tons is the lowest in more than a decade, far below the peak of 1.5 million tons estimated in 2000 and a major decline by historical standards. Geological records of fish scales deposited off Southern California indicate that the unfished sardine population fluctuated naturally between a low of 400,000 tons to as much as 16 million tons. \n \n \n \n Keeping an eye on the big picture \n \n Forage fish account for more than one-third of the global catch of marine fish and are mostly used for industrial purposes such as feed for livestock, poultry, and farmed fish rather than being directly eaten by people. Most forage fish landed on the West Coast are exported for purposes such as bait in tuna longlining in Asia or as feed for farmed fish. In 2012, the Lenfest Forage Fish Task Force, a group of eminent scientists from around the world, calculated that forage fish worldwide are worth twice as much when left in the water—about $11.3 billion—as they are when caught because of their value as food for commercially important predators. \n \n For further information, please visit: pewenvironment.org/pacificfish \n \n \n \n Write the Pacific Fishery Management Council at: pfmc.comments@noaa.gov', 'The sardine fishing boat Eileen motored slowly through moonlit waters from San Pedro to Santa Catalina Island, its weary-eyed captain growing more desperate as the night wore on. After 12 hours and $1,000 worth of fuel, Corbin Hanson and his crew returned to port without a single fish. \n \n ""Tonight\'s pretty reflective of how things have been going,"" Hanson said. ""Not very well."" \n \n To blame is the biggest sardine crash in generations, which has made schools of the small, silvery fish a rarity on the West Coast. The decline has prompted steep cuts in the amount fishermen are allowed to catch, and scientists say the effects are probably radiating throughout the ecosystem, starving brown pelicans, sea lions and other predators that rely on the oily, energy-rich fish for food. \n \n If sardines don\'t recover soon, experts warn, the West Coast\'s marine mammals, seabirds and fishermen could suffer for years. \n \n The reason for the drop is unclear. Sardine populations are famously volatile, but the decline is the steepest since the collapse of the sardine fishery in the mid-20th century. And their numbers are projected to keep sliding. \n \n One factor is a naturally occurring climate cycle known as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, which in recent years has brought cold, nutrient-rich water to the West Coast. While those conditions have brought a boom in some species, such as market squid, they have repelled sardines. \n \n If nature is responsible for the decline, history shows the fish will bounce back when ocean conditions improve. But without a full understanding of the causes, the crash is raising alarm. \n \n An assessment last fall found the population had dropped 72% since its last peak in 2006. Spawning has taken a dive too. \n \n In November, federal fishery managers slashed harvest limits by more than two-thirds, but some environmental groups have argued the catch should be halted outright. \n \n ""We shouldn\'t be harvesting sardines any time the population is this low,"" said Geoff Shester, California program director for the conservation group Oceana, which contends that continuing to fish for them could speed their decline and arrest any recovery. \n \n The Pacific sardine is the ocean\'s quintessential boom-bust fish. It is short-lived and prolific, and its numbers are wildly unpredictable, surging up and down in decades-long cycles in response to natural shifts in the ocean environment. When conditions are poor, sardine populations plunge. When seas are favorable, they flourish in massive schools. \n \n It was one of those seemingly inexhaustible swells that propelled California\'s sardine fishery to a zenith in the 1940s. Aggressive pursuit of the species transformed Monterey into one of the world\'s top fishing ports. \n \n And then it collapsed. \n \n By mid-century sardines had practically vanished, and in the 1960s California established a moratorium on sardine fishing that lasted 18 years. The population rebounded in the 1980s and fishing resumed, but never at the level of its heyday. \n \n Since the 1940s scientists have debated how much of the collapse was caused by ocean conditions and how much by overfishing. Now, researchers are posing the same question. \n \n ""It\'s a terribly difficult scientific problem,"" said Russ Vetter, director of the Fisheries Resources Division at NOAA\'s Southwest Fisheries Science Center. \n \n Separate sardine populations off Japan, Peru and Chile fluctuate in the same 50- to 70-year climate cycle but have been more heavily exploited, Vetter said. West Coast sardines are considered one of the most cautiously fished stocks in the world, a practice that could explain why their latest rebound lasted as long as it did. The West Coast\'s last sardine decline began in 1999, but the population shot back up by the mid-2000s. \n \n In recent years scientists have gained a deeper understanding of sardines\' value as ""forage fish,"" small but nutrition-packed species such as herring and market squid that form the core of the ocean food web, funneling energy upward by eating tiny plankton and being preyed on by big fish, seabirds, seals and whales. \n \n Now, they say, there is evidence some ocean predators are starving without sardines. Scarcity of prey is the leading theory behind the 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up along beaches from Santa Barbara to San Diego in early 2013, said Sharon Melin, a wildlife biologist at the National Marine Fisheries Service. \n \n Melin\'s research indicates that nursing sea lion mothers could not find fatty sardines, so they fed on less nutritious market squid, rockfish and hake and produced less milk for their young in 2012. The following year their pups showed up on the coast in overwhelming numbers, stranded and emaciated.']",2,"– The West Coast sardine population was down 72% since 2006 per a fall assessment—the worst crash since the mid-20th century, and one with far-reaching implications, particularly since the steep decline is expected to continue. One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing. Last month, Pew Charitable Trusts warned that dozens of species, including whales, sharks, dolphins, salmon, and tuna, could feel an impact."

John Kasich on Wednesday announced he has postponed Ronald Phillips\' execution date until next summer in order to investigate whether the convicted killer\'s organs can be donated to family members. \n \n The governor\'s decision came one day before the 40-year-old Summit County man was scheduled to be put to death under a newly approved lethal-injection drug cocktail. \n \n Phillips, sentenced to death in 1993 for raping and killing the 3-year-old daughter of his girlfriend, sought the delay in order to see whether he would be a viable organ donor to his mother, who has kidney disease, and his sister, who has a heart condition, according to the Associated Press. \n \n Phillips is also willing to donate organs to other people if he couldn\'t help his relatives, his attorney, Lisa Lagos, told the AP. Lagos said the request wasn\'t a delaying tactic but an attempt by Phillips to make a final gesture for good. \n \n The Department of Rehabilitation and Correction had denied Phillips\' request earlier this week, citing logistics and security concerns, according to the AP. \n \n The DRC isn\'t aware of any other time that an Ohio death-row inmate has made an organ donation, according to spokeswoman JoEllen Smith. However, Smith noted that it has happened in other states such as California. \n \n In a statement, Kasich said he realized the situation ""is a bit of uncharted territory"" for Ohio. \n \n ""But if another life can be saved by his willingness to donate his organs and tissues, then we should allow for that to happen,"" he said. \n \n Under DRC policy, state prison officials will conduct the initial compatibility tests. \n \n If a transplant of any non-vital organs is feasible, Phillips would undergo an operation at Ohio State University Medical Center before returning to death row, the governor\'s office said in a release. His execution has been rescheduled for July 2, 2014 at Southern Ohio Correctional Facility in Lucasville. \n \n Phillips\' execution has drawn increased attention because he was scheduled to be the first person put to death in Ohio using a new and untried lethal-injection cocktail consisting of midazolam, a sedative, and hydromorphone, a morphine derivative. \n \n The new method was announced last month because of a shortage of pentobarbital caused by European manufacturers\' reluctance to sell the drug for executions. \n \n With Phillips\' execution postponed, Dennis McGuire may become the first inmate put to death using the new cocktail. McGuire, a Preble County man convicted of raping, choking and stabbing a pregnant woman in 1989, is scheduled to die Jan. 16, 2014. \n \n Under the DRC\'s new protocol, the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility warden must notify department Director Gary Mohr within 14 days of McGuire\'s execution date whether he has enough pentobarbital to carry out the execution or if the new cocktail must be employed instead.', 'Convicted child-killer Ronald Phillips was in the Death House and had ordered his last meal when he got the word yesterday: Gov. John Kasich had postponed his execution set for today to determine whether his “nonvital” organs could be harvested as he requested. \n \n His execution now is scheduled for July 2. \n \n “His first words were, ‘God is good.’ He feels immense gratitude to the governor,” said Tim Sweeney, the condemned man’s Cleveland attorney. \n \n Kasich’s action is unprecedented in the nation in the case of an imminent execution, a death-penalty expert said. \n \n The Republican governor said he halted Phillips’ execution “so that medical experts can assess whether Phillips’ nonvital organs or tissues can be donated to his mother or possibly others.” \n \n “Ronald Phillips committed a heinous crime for which he will face the death penalty,” Kasich said in a statement less than 18 hours before the condemned man was to be lethally injected using two drugs never before used in combination. “I realize this is a bit of uncharted territory for Ohio, but if another life can be saved by his willingness to donate his organs and tissues, then we should allow for that to happen.” \n \n The governor said if Phillips “is found to be a viable donor to his mother or possibly others awaiting transplants of nonvital organs, such as kidneys, the procedures would be performed and then he would be returned to Death Row to await his new execution date.” \n \n There was no immediate comment from Akron Prosecutor Sherry Bevan Walsh, who handled the case. \n \n Phillips, 40, was to be executed at 10 a.m. today at the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility near Lucasville for the 1993 beating, rape and murder of 3-year-old Sheila Marie Evans, the daughter of his girlfriend at the time. He had exhausted all legal appeals and was moved yesterday to the Lucasville prison, where executions take place. Last night, he was returned to Death Row at the Chillicothe Correctional Institution. \n \n Sweeney said his client was motivated “by love for his mom and for the desire to do something good. He’s been very remorseful for what he did, thoughtful and reflective over the past couple weeks.” \n \n He wants to donate a kidney to his mother, who is on dialysis treatment for kidney disease, but is willing to donate to others if that is not possible. \n \n Sweeney said he wasn’t sure what Phillips can donate, but he said it might include his kidneys, lungs, liver or bone marrow. \n \n Prisons policy requires that the cost of transplant surgery be paid by Phillips or the organ recipients, not by Ohio taxpayers, spokeswoman JoEllen Smith said. The policy also requires that Phillips’ surgery be performed at the Wexner Medical Center at Ohio State University. \n \n It is the first time in the United States that an execution was stopped to permit an inmate’s organs to be harvested, said Richard Dieter of the Death Penalty Information Center in Washington, D.C. He said a Delaware inmate, Steven Shelton, was allowed to donate his kidney in 2005, but he was not facing immediate execution. \n \n Phillips had ordered, but did not have time to eat, his “last meal,” which included pizza with mushrooms, onions and double cheese, spaghetti, corn chips, Dr Pepper, rocky road ice cream and Oreo cheese cake. \n \n ajohnson@dispatch.com \n \n @ohioaj']",2,"– A convicted child killer just got a last-minute reprieve from Ohio's governor, thanks to the inmate's unusual request to be an organ donor.

Video of a portion of the Saturday night incident went viral after one of the students, Isaiah Butterfield, posted it on Twitter; Butterfield tells BuzzFeed News that before he started filming, the white man in the video walked past him and his friends and through the building's entrance. ""Then he turned and he said, ‘You aren’t getting in here if you don't have a key,'"" Butterfield says. ""We were shook because we hadn’t said anything to him."" He says the man then came back outside and started harassing the group, at which point another white person walked up and started defending the black students. Butterfield then started filming. The white bystander, who had a key to the building, let the group inside; the first white man then insisted they not get on the elevator with him and asked repeatedly whether they had a key to the building. As the group attempted to enter the elevator, the man pulled out a gun. ""He made sure we saw that he had a gun so we didn't get in the elevator,"" says Butterfield, who notes that the group had earlier questioned whether the man actually lived in the building, since it is student housing and he looked older than most residents. (At one point in the video, the man can be heard saying, ""Where am I going? I am going upstairs to get laid."") The students, who were ultimately let into the building by their friend, reported the incident to police the following day.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. \n \n Scientists are reporting on a new virus, never seen before anywhere, that apparently killed a Kansas man last year. \n \n They’re calling it Bourbon virus, after the county in Kansas where the previously healthy man lived. He’d been bitten by ticks before he got sick so doctors believe the virus is carried by ticks. \n \n “We were not looking for a new virus,” said Charles Hunt, Kansas state epidemiologist, who helped report on the new virus. \n \n “We are surprised. We really don’t know much about this virus. It’s important to find out more from a public health perspective. It is possible that other persons have been infected with this and not known it?” \n \n “It took months to find out this a novel virus that belonged to a genus of viruses called Thogotovirus."" \n \n The research team is not giving details on the man other than that he was healthy, under the age of 50 and working outdoors on his property in eastern Kansas last spring when he came inside with tick bites and one fat tick still on his shoulder. \n \n A few days later, he developed nausea, diarrhea and felt weak. By the third day, he had fever, muscle aches and chills and went to the doctor, who prescribed an antibiotic called doxycycline which can treat several tick-borne infections, including one that causes Lyme disease. \n \n But by the fourth day, the patient was drifting in and out of consciousness and was taken by ambulance to the hospital. He just got sicker, and blood tests cleared him of the usual tickborne illnesses such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Lyme disease, or ehrlichiosis. \n \n His heart started to fail and then his kidneys, and he died 11 days after first becoming ill, the researchers report in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases. \n \n Doctors tested his blood for all sorts of infections, from tularemia and Q fever to fungal infections such as aspergillosis. The medical team finally decided to check for another new mystery virus called Heartland virus, another tickborne virus that had only turned up in 2011. \n \n Hunt passed the samples along to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s lab in Fort Collins, Colorado, which is looking for cases of Heartland virus. \n \n Technicians there ran all sorts of tests that came back negative, says the CDC’s Dr. Erin Staples. CDC microbiologist Olga Kosoy noticed a virus growing on the patient’s blood sample. Her colleague Amy Lambert sequenced the virus’s genome using advanced molecular detection. It wasn\'t anything that had been seen before. \n \n “It took months to find out this a novel virus that belonged to a genus of viruses called Thogotovirus,” Staples told NBC news. \n \n “Thogotoviruses have been described throughout the world.” But they rarely cause human disease, and the closest relative to the virus ever seen in the U.S. was a sample found in a bird’s nest in Aransas Bay, off the coast of Texas. \n \n Staples thinks the new virus may have occasionally infected people, but they never knew what they had. Scientists only recently have possessed the tools and facilities needed to make this kind of identification. \n \n “I think it has probably been present for a while,” Staples said. \n \n When the weather warms up, scientists will visit the area looking for ticks, mosquitoes and perhaps animals that might be carrying the virus. They may also take a look at the blood of people with illnesses that were never definitively diagnosed to see if they have antibodies to Bourbon virus. \n \n “I think it has probably been present for a while."" \n \n In the meantime, people should not worry, but it does give people yet another reason to avoid ticks by wearing long sleeves and using insect repellant outside, Staples and Hunt both said. \n \n The best-known is tickborne disease is Lyme disease, which infected about 30,000 people in the U.S. in 2010. Other infections include anaplasmosis and ehrlichiosis, which affect about 1,000 people each a year, and babesiosis, which infects about 1,100 people a year. Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever infects about 2,500 people a year. \n \n As of March 2014, eight cases of Heartland virus disease have been identified among residents of Missouri and Tennessee, CDC says. \n \n Heartland virus was first noticed in 2009 when two men in Missouri developed high fevers, diarrhea, fatigue and a severe drop in the number of their white blood cells, immune cells that fight infection. The symptoms are very similar to those caused by Bourbon virus in the Kansas man.', '(CNN) Kenyan rangers killed a lion that pounced on a man in a crowd after it escaped from a park in the capital of Nairobi. \n \n The man, who was hospitalized with deep lacerations and bruises, had joined hundreds of bystanders surrounding the animal. \n \n The death of Mohawk, a majestic 13-year-old big cat so named because of the shape of his black mane, sparked an outcry among Kenyans. Citizens used hashtag #JusticeforMohawk to ask why rangers did not tranquilize him instead. \n \n \'Last resort\' \n \n Kenya Wildlife Service spokesman Paul Udoto said the lion escaped from the Nairobi National Park on Wednesday and ended up in Isinya town, 12 miles away. \n \n Veterinary teams headed to Isinya after they got word on Mohawk\'s whereabouts. \n \n But noise and commotion from bystanders agitated the animal, prompting it to attack the man. In order to save lives, rangers shot it to death before veterinarians arrived with tranquilizers, Udoto said. \n \n ""This action was taken as a last resort after an escalation of the situation and a concern for public safety,"" the Kenya Wildlife Service said. \n \n Lion selfies \n \n The Nairobi National Park has had several lion escapes in recent weeks .

190,"['Variants of apolipoprotein E have been studied extensively as risk factors for many different conditions. For example, APOE alleles have been shown to influence the risk of cardiovascular diseases. People who carry at least one copy of the APOE e4 allele have an increased chance of developing atherosclerosis, which is an accumulation of fatty deposits and scar-like tissue in the lining of the arteries. This progressive narrowing of the arteries increases the risk of heart attack and stroke. \n \n The APOE e2 allele has been shown to greatly increase the risk of a rare condition called hyperlipoproteinemia type III. Most people with this disorder have two copies of the APOE e2 allele, leading researchers to conclude that the e2 allele plays a critical role in the development of the condition. Hyperlipoproteinemia type III is characterized by increased blood levels of cholesterol, certain fats called triglycerides, and molecules called beta-very low-density lipoproteins (beta-VLDLs), which carry cholesterol and lipoproteins in the bloodstream. A buildup of cholesterol and other fatty materials can lead to the formation of small, yellow skin growths called xanthomas and the development of atherosclerosis. \n \n APOE gene variants have also been studied as a potential risk factor for age-related macular degeneration, an eye disease that is a leading cause of vision loss among older people worldwide. Some studies have suggested that having at least one copy of the APOE e4 allele may help protect against this disease or delay the onset of vision loss, while having at least one copy of the APOE e2 allele may increase the risk of this disease or cause symptoms to appear earlier. However, other studies have not found these associations. More research is needed to clarify what role, if any, APOE gene variants play in the development of age-related macular degeneration.', ""The gene comes in three varieties, known as the e2, e3 and e4 variants. Since everyone inherits one version of the gene from each parent, there are six possible combinations.

Researchers also have found that adults with e2 variants have more plaques in their brains but are less likely to have symptoms of dementia.""]",2,"– You have one of six possible variations of the APOE gene, having inherited one variant—e2, e3, or e4—from each parent. Reporting in the journal Neuron, University of Hawaii researchers found that the brain development of children as young as preschool age with two copies of e4 or one of e4 and one of e2 seem most adversely affected—an intriguing find in light of previous research that has linked the e4 variant to Alzheimer's. Researchers scanned the brains of 1,187 healthy people between the ages of 3 and 20 and found, for instance, that the size of the hippocampus tends to be smaller in those with the e2/e4 combination. They also found some kids with e4 didn't perform as well on tests of memory, though they caught up with their peers by age 10, reports HealthDay News. And while brain researcher Rebecca Knickmeyer, who didn't participate in the study but wrote an accompanying editorial, says the variants aren't necessarily predictive and people shouldn't start testing their kids, the research suggests that Alzheimer's may in fact be a developmental disorder, not strictly an aging one, reports the Los Angeles Times. That raises the possibility that adjustments to ""diet or cognitive training"" early on could change someone's ""trajectory,"" per Knickmeyer. Three in four people have at least one copy of e3, which seems to offer a protective effect. About 14% of people have an e4 variant, which has been linked with an elevated risk of Alzheimer's, but Knickmeyer points out that there are many Alzheimer's patients without e4, and many with e4 who never develop Alzheimer's. (Some research suggests that memories lost to Alzheimer's are actually retrievable.)"

192,"['Scientists have learned that upwards of 25 percent of all people who become infected with Ebola show none of the typical symptoms. The finding suggests the recent West African Ebola Epidemic was more widespread than previously thought, and that new methods need to be developed to diagnose and contain the dreaded virus during an outbreak. \n \n \n \n Typically, Ebola produces a panoply of symptoms, including fever, unexplained bleeding, headache, muscle pain, rash, vomiting, diarrhea, breathing problems, and difficulty swallowing. As is well documented, this virus is particularly deadly, killing between 10 to 80 percent of people who exhibit these symptoms (the statistical spread reflects the divide between those who have access to intensive care and those who don’t). \n \n But as a new study published in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases shows, a significant portion of people who contract Ebola don’t show any of the typical signs, meaning they’re asymptomatic, or their symptoms are relatively mild and not wholly reflective of how the virus affects most people. In other words, they have “minimally symptomatic infections.” \n \n Prior to the new study, scientists suspected that Ebola, like many other viruses, might not always manifest in the same predictable way. The new study, led by Gene Richardson, a PhD candidate in anthropology at Stanford University and a former fellow in the Division of Infectious Diseases and Geographic Medicine, now confirms this suspicion, while providing an actual estimate for the rate of asymptomatic and minimally symptomatic infections in Ebola patients. \n \n Following the recent West African Ebola Epidemic, Richardson and his colleagues went back to the rural village of Sukudu in Sierra Leone, a major hotspot for the outbreak. The village, which is home to 900 residents, recorded 34 cases of Ebola during the epidemic, including 28 deaths. Working with a local physician, Richardson’s team tested 187 men, women, and children from Sukudu who had likely been exposed to Ebola, either because they lived in the same household or shared a public toilet with a person known to have had the disease. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Of these, 14 were found to carry an antibody to Ebola—a sure sign that they were infected at some point. A dozen of these villagers said they had no symptoms of the disease, while two recalled having a fever at the time of the outbreak. \n \n It’s now certainly possible that some of these villagers had full-blown symptoms but were fearful of admitting the truth to doctors. Consequently, more research with a larger sample pool will have to be performed. However, Richardson and his colleagues think they’re onto something, and that the villagers were probably telling the truth. \n \n Importantly, the researchers aren’t sure if an asymptomatic person with Ebola can transmit the virus. “They were not passing it along in the usual way, through vomiting or diarrhea,” noted Richardson in a statement. “It’s unclear if they can pass it along it sexually.” \n \n Advertisement \n \n More research is needed to determine if Ebola can be spread by a person who shows no or very few symptoms, but it’s a very distinct possibility. A person with an infection still has Ebola particles in their body, which could find a way to “jump” to another person. But without the typical symptoms, it’s certainly much more difficult. As Richardson noted, the virus might be transmitted sexually, though that still needs to be proven in an asymptomatic individual. \n \n Richardson and his colleagues are now working in other villages in Sierra Leone to get a better handle on the true number of people affected during the crisis. But if the figure of 25 percent is correct—and if Ebola can spread via asymptomatic people (that’s still a big if)—that presents a massive headache for health officials. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Adding insult to injury, the Ebola virus mutated into a deadlier form during the last outbreak, showing an ability to quickly adapt to human biology and become even more virulent. Taken together, these new findings show that Ebola spreads more rapidly and more broadly through a population, highlighting the need for new detection and containment techniques for when the next outbreak hits. \n \n \n \n [PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases]', 'Between 2013 and 2016, tens of thousands of people in West Africa contracted Ebola virus disease, making the epidemic the largest and longest on record. But the number of reported cases -- roughly 28,000 -- may be an underestimate of the total number of people infected, since it includes only people who showed symptoms of disease. Researchers reporting in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases have discovered individuals in Sierra Leone who showed no signs of the disease but have evidence of prior Ebola infection in their immune systems. \n \n An estimated 10-80 percent of people who show symptoms of Ebola virus disease (EVD) die, depending on their access to intensive care. However, researchers have also seen some evidence that a minority of people may catch the Ebola virus without developing symptoms. During the 2013-2016 outbreak, however, these so-called ""minimally symptomatic infections"" were not considered epidemiologically relevant to models, projections, or intervention efforts so were not studied or tracked in detail. \n \n From October 2015 through January 2016, a year after the peak of the Ebola epidemic, Eugene Richardson, of Partners In Health, and colleagues conducted a survey of people living in Sukudu, Kono District, Sierra Leone, a village of 900 inhabitants which had been a major ""hotspot"" of Ebola. The team identified 193 adults and children over age 4 who had lived with or shared a latrine with a confirmed case of Ebola during the period of active transmission but were never identified as EVD cases. The researchers collected blood from 187 of these individuals. They then tested the blood samples -- as well as positive and negative controls from known Ebola cases and people not exposed to the virus -- for Ebola glycoprotein antibodies, the presence of which indicates a past Ebola infection. \n \n Of the 187 exposed individuals, none of whom were previously known to have Ebola virus disease, the researchers identified 14 who tested positive for Ebola antibodies. Two of these 14 admitted having a fever while being quarantined, while the other 12 denied any signs or symptoms. However, the study could not pinpoint the timing of any past infection, nor guarantee that any individuals were not prevaricating about a lack of symptoms.

Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts and a sponsor of the bill. “Oftentimes family members notice the symptoms in their loved ones, but it’s only years later that they get diagnosed or understand what resources are available.” \n \n The most striking addition to the guidelines concerns methods that assess brain changes involved in Alzheimer’s, including brain scans and tests of cerebral spinal fluid. Such methods measure what are called biomarkers, physiological indicators that someone is likely to develop dementia eventually, just as cholesterol and blood pressure are biomarkers of impending heart disease. \n \n For now, the guidelines specify that Alzheimer’s biomarkers — including abnormal levels of the proteins amyloid and tau, and shrinkage of certain brain areas — should not yet be put into widespread use, but used only with patients enrolled in clinical trials. \n \n That is because scientists cannot yet standardize the results of the tests, or know “what measure is truly abnormal and what measure is not,” said Marilyn Albert, director of the Johns Hopkins Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center, and a leader of one working group that developed the new guidelines. \n \n As many as a third of people with amyloid plaques in their brains, for example, have not developed Alzheimer’s symptoms by the time they die. The guidelines also urge caution because there is currently no drug known to halt or significantly delay the onset of symptoms, so people told they are likely to get Alzheimer’s have no effective medication to take. \n \n “We don’t have enough information about what to tell people,” said Dr. Steven DeKosky, dean of the University of Virginia medical school, who participated in one of the working groups. “Until you can tell a clinician, ‘If you do this test you have X amount of reliability and to do that will make a difference in the life of your patient’ — until then, it remains in the lab.” \n \n But the guidelines reflect a sense in the medical community that the moment when science will have more specific knowledge about biomarkers is not that far off. They are intended to encourage more research so that drugs can be developed to attack early brain changes and to identify people who might benefit from such drugs when they become available. \n \n The goal, said William Thies, chief medical and scientific officer for the Alzheimer’s Association, is “extending the range of our ability to investigate this disease and eventually find the treatment that is going to be so necessary to avoid the epidemic of Alzheimer’s disease that we see facing us over the next 40 years.” \n \n In the short term, the biggest impact is likely to be seen with people who fall into the middle phase, those with mild cognitive impairment linked to Alzheimer’s. Experts say there are at least as many people experiencing this phase as the 5.4 million people estimated to have Alzheimer’s dementia. And they expect others to now ask their doctors if they are showing signs of mild impairment, which include experiencing some difficulty or inefficiency with memory, attention or other mental faculties, while still being able to function independently. \n \n Dr. Albert said that if patients with symptoms of mild cognitive impairment wanted to “increase the certainty” of the diagnosis by getting a brain scan or spinal fluid test, they should obtain such tests in a research trial so they have a better chance of getting accurate results. \n \n The guidelines also clarify diagnosis criteria for people with dementia symptoms, distinguishing Alzheimer’s from other dementias, including vascular, fronto-temporal and Lewy body. And they note that the earliest symptom of Alzheimer’s dementia is not always memory loss, but could be mood changes or problems with language, spatial perception or reasoning. \n \n Dr. Pierre Tariot, director of the Banner Alzheimer’s Institute in Phoenix, who was not involved in drafting the guidelines, called them “a step in the right direction” that he hoped would not be “misconstrued” as a sign that biomarker tests are further along than they are. He added, “The notion that Alzheimer’s disease is a continuum that has an extensive pre-symptomatic phase is a very important message to get out.” \n \n Dr. Phelps said it would hardly be the last word from the medical community on Alzheimer’s. \n \n “We’re not drawing a line and saying this is it,” Dr. Phelps said. “What we’re saying is this is the best of our knowledge and we’re not going to wait 27 years to revisit these again.”']",3,"– Ebola doesn't always show itself through fever, vomiting, and diarrhea. A new PLOS study finds that some people with the virus show mild or no symptoms at all—a potential concern for preventing its spread. Researchers who visited the village of Sukudu in Sierra Leone, a hot spot in the recent West African Ebola outbreak, found up to 25% of Ebola infections ""may have been minimally symptomatic,"" meaning ""a significant portion of Ebola transmission events may have gone undetected"" in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, NBC News reports. At least 28,000 people are known to have been infected during the epidemic, at least 11,000 of whom died. In Sukudu, there were 34 known Ebola cases, including 28 deaths among 900 residents, reports Gizmodo. A year after the worst of the outbreak was over, Stanford University researchers tested the blood of 187 people in Sukudu who'd lived with or shared a toilet with someone infected with Ebola, per a release. They found 14 had Ebola antibodies, suggesting they'd previously been infected, while 12 said they didn't recall feeling sick or having a fever. Believing them to be truthful as health workers kept an eye on villagers during the outbreak, researchers now plan to visit other villages ""so we can begin to answer the question of what was the true burden of disease,"" the study author says. ""We expect to find a lot more undocumented survivors."" It's not clear if asymptomatic patients are contagious. ""They were not passing it along in the usual way, through vomiting or diarrhea,"" he says. ""It's unclear if they can pass it along sexually."" (This Ebola-like disease can shut down organs.)"
193,"['Topics: War Room, Politics News \n \n The verdict is in: The individual mandate at the heart of President Obama’s healthcare law is not long for this world. \n \n At least that seemed to be the early consensus of the journalists who were allowed to witness the second day of Supreme Court arguments over the constitutionality of Obamacare on Tuesday. Even before the proceedings wrapped up, they began spreading the word that Obama’s solicitor general, Donald Verrilli, had seemed ill-prepared and incapable of defending the law against an onslaught of pointed questions from skeptical justices, and that the critical swing voter on the court – Anthony Kennedy – had all but stated that he considers the mandate unconstitutional. \n \n CNN’s Jeffrey Toobin branded the proceedings “a train wreck for the Obama administration” and predicted that “this law looks like it’s going to be struck down,” while Mother Jones’ Adam Serwer declared on Twitter that “If the justices decided the constitutionality of laws on performance, Obamacare would go down like a flaming zeppelin.” Mike Sacks of the Huffington Post said that opposition to the law seemed “almost unequivocal” from Kennedy, whom Toobin called a “lost cause” for the administration. \n \n It’s worth keeping in mind that all of this alarmism may well amount to nothing. \n \n The stakes of this case and the court’s notorious opacity encourage tea leaf-reading and overreaction. It’s clear from objective reports from inside the court that the administration was repeatedly put on the defensive by Kennedy, Antonin Scalia, Samuel Alito and Chief Justice John Roberts. Along with Clarence Thomas, who rarely speaks but almost always sides with his fellow Republican-appointed justices, they form the court’s conservative majority – with Kennedy the most likely to break ranks. So it’s noteworthy that they (and Kennedy in particular) exhibited such aggressive skepticism. The individual mandate won’t stand unless at least one of them sides with the administration.', 'CONCORD, N.H. (AP) — So much for sharing the good news about a newborn calf named Pitcher Diego. \n \n A New Hampshire farm that posted a video of the Scottish Highland calf is coming under fire from animal rights supporters who don\'t want the animal to be slaughtered. \n \n The video, posted on Facebook, has gotten nearly 13 million views and sparked a heated debate about eating meat. Many of the comments against the video are from people angry because they think the calf will be slaughtered or had been ripped away from its mother. \n \n The Concord Monitor reports Yankee Farmer\'s Market in Warner posted the video of Pitcher Diego, who was born during a snowstorm. In it, the calf — tied up with a red rope — stares into the cameras as he is warmed by an off-screen hair dryer. He appears to quietly moo during the 21-second video. \n \n Some people are trying to drive down the farm\'s reviews using Facebook\'s rating system. Several also have offered to adopt the calf. \n \n ""I\'m not sure how you get that much negativity out of a picture of a baby cow,"" said Farm owner Brian Farmer, who has 30 head of Scottish Highland cattle and 60 head of American buffalo. \n \n Farmer said he was taken aback by the negative reaction, given his animals roam and graze freely in pastures and are raised without antibiotics or hormones. He says the calf has been returned to its mother, and its thick neck, strong body and gentle disposition make it a good candidate for breeding — rather than a trip to the butcher. \n \n Farmer said Pitcher Diego will be registered as a breeding animal as part of the farm\'s effort rebuild its herd of Scottish Highland cattle that have been raised on his other farm, Pitcher Mountain Farm in Stoddard, for five decades. The herd had dwindled from 80 to 12 but has since rebounded to 30 after Farmer took over the farm in 2013. The cattle spend the bulk of their time at three locations on 300 acres. \n \n ""We are trying to do it the right way and not mass producing animals. We are trying to give them the best life possible,"" Farmer said. ""When you raise them that way, they are healthy and happy.

So the Akron PeaceMakers, an anti-violence youth group, brainstormed with the local PD to come up with a double-sided crib sheet of tips for kids to follow when interacting with cops, NPR reports. The ""You and the Law"" cards, set to be doled out to all Akron middle school and high school students—and possibly to adults, and internationally, in the future—feature 15 bullet points outlining ""basic rights and responsibilities,"" as well as suggestions to ensure safety during an encounter. ""Do not 'bad-mouth' or walk away from the law-enforcement officials,"" ""control your emotions,"" and ""do not resist arrest for any reason"" are some of the tips. The top of each card mentions the ""easiest way to avoid conflict with law enforcement officials is simply to stay out of trouble."" The cards have sparked a debate over whether the police are escaping their own responsibility in confrontations, NPR notes. But the kids involved say the point is to de-escalate the situation, not let cops off the hook—and there are phone numbers on the back to report police misconduct. ""Instead of cussing [a police officer] out, I can just say, 'OK. Let me calm down,' and then at a later time, call the police station,"" one student tells NPR. Akron Mayor Don Plusquellic says the cards serve as a common-sense refresher.

We demand Justice for Andy Lopez, his family and his community.” \n \n During Saturday’s protest in Santa Rosa, volunteers were in the process stories from attendees about their own experiences with police brutality, Arechiga said. \n \n “A lot of people are afraid to come forward, but in light of the Lopez family’s courage and these community gatherings, there’s a lot of stories being told,” said Arechiga, whose cousin Ernest Duenez, Jr. was shot and killed by a police officer in Manteca two years ago. \n \n In Oakland Saturday afternoon, more than 100 protesters took part in the national day of action, marching from the Fruitvale BART station to the Alameda County Sheriff’s Office, said Answer Coalition organizer Michelle Schudel. \n \n Schudel said people came from throughout the East Bay to protest Andy’s killing and to stand in solidarity with his family and others who have lost loved ones to police fire. \n \n She said the killing is similar to what people “have to deal with in Oakland and in San Francisco, where police are brutalizing and targeting our families, our communities for being African American or Latino.” \n \n Organizers said more than 100 protesters gathered for about an hour Saturday afternoon at the 24th and Mission BART station in San Francisco to speak out against Andy’s death. \n \n (Copyright 2013 by CBS San Francisco and Bay City News Service.

""As such, he was lawfully acting in defense of himself or others."" The finding followed a five-month investigation and protests around California, including a ""National Day of Action for Andy Lopez"" organized by a statewide group opposing police brutality, CBS San Francisco reports. Andy was walking through rural Sonoma County last October, holding a BB gun resembling an AK-47, when deputies on patrol saw him and told him to drop the weapon. Ten seconds later, Gelhaus had put seven bullets in the boy. ""The family and my office are greatly disappointed with the decision,"" said the Lopez family's attorney. ""If there was ever a case where charges were warranted, it was this one."" But Ravitch said her office pored over more than 1,000 pages of reports and spoke to numerous experts to consider ""every interpretation of the facts."" Now the Lopez family's civil suit, held up by the criminal probe, will ""have to run through the legal process,"" an official said.

Joanne Southerland, Clayton County (Ga.) Police Department \n \n Police had received information that the child did not want to be there and had been physically abused. \n \n Porter, Southerland and Officer Daniel Day focused on how they found Gregory. The boy\'s birth mother called 911 and told them her son was being held at the home against his will. When police went to investigate, his father and stepmother said they didn\'t know the child, and didn\'t know why police were coming to their home. They granted police access to search the home. Police found nothing. \n \n Gregory was able to reach his mother again through a MagicJack app. She, again, called 911. When Southerland, who worked several years in the Crimes Against Children Unit, heard the specifics of that 911 call, she insisted they return to the house. \n \n ""We weren\'t going to leave until we found him,"" she said. \n \n After police left following the first visit, the incident report says the boy ""was thrown down the stairs and punched several times ...

The space included just wooden beams and insulation. \n \n ""A space where no person should be living,"" Porter said. He wouldn\'t go into specifics about how long and how often the boy was kept there, but there was a bedroom he shared at the home with the other children. \n \n Porter wouldn\'t answer specific questions about why the mother had not contacted police earlier, calling it a ""unique case."" He did confirm Gregory was not officially listed as missing with any police agency. \n \n On Sunday, a judge denied bond for Jean, 37, and Davis, 42. Davis is on probation for child cruelty. She\'s also accused of striking the boy with a stick across the back of his legs, back and buttocks. \n \n ""It concerns me as a police officer and a father,"" Porter said. \n \n Court records show in 2004, Davis heated a pair of scissors on the stove and used them to burn her 6-year-old son on his neck and hand, before cutting off a piece of his tongue. She was ordered in 2006 to 10 years probation and anger management classes. \n \n Police won\'t say whether the child at the center of that case was one of the three teenagers arrested at the house, but officers say they are all Davis\' children. \n \n Police say the 13-year-old found had been abused that night by both Davis and one of her children and he told police he had been physically punished in the past for trying to leave. \n \n The missing boy\'s mother, Lisa Smith, says she did not know exactly where her son was located, and neither did the court in Allen County, Ind.

She told police her son was being abused at a home in Jonesboro and was being hidden in a garage. Porter said the boy\'s mother told police he had been missing for four years, and she had been trying to reunite with him during that time. \n \n Those details and others in the case emerged during a press conference at Clayton County Police headquarters. Police declined to say whose phone the boy used, how he knew to contact his mother or which parent had legal custody of the boy. Porter said he didn\'t want to compromise the investigation. \n \n Two officers who responded initially couldn\'t find the boy after searching and shouting out for him inside the garage. They left, but were told to go back by a supervisor, Porter said. \n \n As police resumed their search shortly after midnight, the boy used an app to send his mother text messages, including a photo of the home\'s garage according to the initial police report. She then passed those updates to police, who continued questioning the other residents of the house and searching. \n \n The boy\'s stepmother eventually directed officers to a closet on the home\'s third floor, according to the report, where Sgt.

Southerland said she helped him out of the concealed compartment and calmed him down. She said the space where the boy had been hidden was bounded by the home\'s exterior siding, and he was enclosed within the wooden frame of the house and garage. \n \n The boy then thanked officers for helping him, and later posed for photos with police while smiling widely. \n \n The boy\'s 37-year-old birth father and 42-year-old stepmother face charges of false imprisonment, cruelty to children and obstruction.

Porter said police have not found the boy was enrolled in public schools. It was not clear whether the mother had previously reported her son missing. Porter said he did not appear to be listed on any registries of missing children. \n \n Julie Pizarro, who lives nearby, said the boy seemed quiet but she never thought anything was wrong.

And although Gregory Jean Sr., 37, and Samantha Joy Davis, 42, didn't bar police from searching the home, ""there was a lot of deception,"" Clayton County Police Sgt. Joanne Southerland told reporters, as per CNN. In fact, the first officers on the scene—sent after a 911 call from the boy's mother—came up empty-handed and left after Jean and Davis said they knew nothing. After the police left, young Gregory contacted his mom again through the magicJack app and she redialed 911; when Southerland, who had worked in a Crimes Against Children unit for several years, heard that call, she made police go back and search again. ""We weren't going to leave until we found him,"" she tells WXIA.

200,"['It focuses on a notorious act of white police brutality against mostly Black citizens, in a July 1967, siege at the Motor City’s Algiers Motel, where racism met frustration and blood was wantonly shed. Three young Black men were left dead and many questions were left unanswered. The mostly white Detroit Police Department emerged officially exonerated but not blameless. \n \n The incident is set against the larger story of the Detroit riots of the same year, which left 43 people dead, nearly 1,200 injured and 7,200 arrested, as the National Guard along with city and state police combined to enforce law and order in a city literally burning from racial tensions. \n \n No one would accuse the cops in Detroit of being “too nice,” although Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal — who previously teamed for Zero Dark Thirty and Oscar-winning The Hurt Locker — are careful not to demonize every authority figure. Many of the police and soldiers in the film are appalled by the acts of racism and violence they’re witnessing, among them the commanding officer of trigger-happy young patrol officer Philip Krauss, who is played by cherry-cheeked Will Poulter (The Revenant). \n \n Despite civil-rights advances and eight years of an African-American U.S. president, the colour of a person’s skin can still determine everything from employment opportunities to treatment by police — who were recently encouraged by President Donald Trump to “please don’t be too nice” when dealing with crime suspects, wink, wink. \n \n The injustice and anger behind it all feels like current reality, even a half-century on, making Detroit urgent viewing regardless of its character-development flaws. \n \n Being appalled, however, isn’t the same as taking full ownership. The commander severely reprimands Krauss for fatally shooting a fleeing looter. He then allows the unrepentant patrolman to return to the streets. \n \n Krauss later becomes the central antagonist of the Algiers Motel siege, which is sparked by a teen’s reckless firing of a starter’s pistol at a passing group of National Guardsmen. As cops and soldiers converge on the seedy establishment, seeking the sniper they believe hides inside, fate has also drawn in multiple unlucky bystanders, who thought they’d escaped the riots. \n \n Among them are rising R&B singer Larry Reed (Algee Smith) and his friend Fred Simple (Jacob Latimore); private security guard Melvin Dismukes (John Boyega); a Vietnam vet named Greene (Anthony Mackie); and two white visitors from Ohio (Hannah Murray and Kaitlyn Dever), who picked a bad time and place to party. \n \n That’s a lot of characters, and there are more, and here you have the central deficiency of Boal’s script: it tries to tell us everything about the circumstances without telling us much about the people. The film is less a character study and more of a situational one; a post-script notes that the Algiers Motel incident has never been fully explained. \n \n Detroit opens with a roughly animated history lesson about how poor southern Blacks moved to white-dominated northern cities while affluent whites fled to the suburbs, taking the best jobs with them. The resulting powder keg of inequities exploded not just in Detroit, but across America. \n \n And it led to situations like the motel standoff, which Bigelow and cinematographer Barry Ackroyd powerfully depict cinéma vérité style as a cascading series of bad choices, evil intentions and escalating violence. \n \n Krauss and his fellow racist cops torture the rounded-up motel guests by beating them and threatening to shoot them one by one until the identity of the alleged sniper is disclosed. \n \n Watching it unfold over the bulk of the film’s 143-minute running time makes for a grim sit, made all the more so by James Newton Howard’s minimalist score, which at times disappears altogether. Bigelow deserves credit for not trivializing the drama with a soundtrack packed with driving Motown tunes, although a version of Martha and the Vandellas’ “Nowhere To Run” is briefly heard in the film at one point. \n \n You don’t need a big backbeat to drive images like these home; Detroit’s deep fury and essential message sears the eye and brain.', 'There is no nice or pretty way to tell a story about the systemic oppression and mistreatment of black people in the United States. It\'s fitting then that Kathryn Bigelow\'s "" Detroit ,"" an account of the murders of three unarmed black men that took place in the Algiers Motel in late July 1967, is neither — it is an all-out assault on your senses and soul. \n \n It\'s hard to overstate just how visceral and harrowing an experience it is. ""Detroit"" is a well-made and evocative film that is also numbingly brutal with little to no reprieve. And while it might be the only true way to tell this story, it\'s also one that is not going to be for everyone. The stomach-churning horror begins immediately and does not let up for 2 hours and 23 minutes. \n \n To set the stage for the Algiers Motel, Bigelow begins by speeding through the history of black people in United States with animated acrylics and pounding music — emancipation, the great migration, white flight and the racist zoning practices that led to the overcrowding of black residents in urban pockets. Tensions have already reached a tipping point, and then in the summer of 1967, Detroit police bust an after-hours club in what would become the inciting incident for the riots. \n \n Three days after the riots begin, a local singing group called The Dramatics are about to go on stage at a big, crowded theater hoping to get their big break, but are interrupted and sent home due to the events outside. The men exit the theater in their sparkly suits into what looks like a war zone. As they run through the streets they assure every cop who isn\'t already beating someone with a night stick that they\'re just on their way home. Bigelow shows all of this with handheld, ground level docudrama realism. There is no orienting yourself to the bigger picture, only what is right in front of you. \n \n The charismatic lead singer Larry (Algee Smith) and his buddy Fred (Jacob Latimore) decide to peel off and get an $11 room at the Algiers and wait out the night. There they meet two white party girls, a veteran, Greene (a terrific Anthony Mackie), and a provocateur, Carl (Jason Mitchell), who plays around with a starter pistol that eventually catches the attention of the police in the area. The officers, who we\'ve already learned are rotten, storm the motel on the hunt for the sniper they presume is there. \n \n The local police, led by a maniacal, hotheaded racist, Krauss (played by the English actor Will Poulter), kills Carl immediately and then continue to terrorize the guests relentlessly with inhuman torture tactics in what seems like an endless sequence of horror upon horror until two more end up dead and they call it a night. \n \n Bigelow collaborated again with screenwriter Mark Boal on ""Detroit,"" which is perfectly evocative of this specific time and place, but lacking the perspective and illumination that one might hope a 50-year-old event would warrant. Perhaps they wanted to leave conclusions and interpreting to the audience, and as the film notes at the end, no one knows for certain what happened in the Algiers Motel and some of the scenes were pieced together and imagined by the filmmakers. \n \n There is some nuance — in the National Guard officer who is horrified by the situation and the local security officer (John Boyega) who only wanted to ease tensions — but not nearly as much as Bigelow and Boal have previously achieved in ""Zero Dark Thirty"" and ""The Hurt Locker."" \n \n Also very little insight is given to the victims\' lives outside of this event. Maybe that\'s not the point, though. Maybe anger is all you\'re supposed to feel when you step outside the theater. Maybe not feeling satisfied with ""Detroit"" is the point. \n \n This was America, you think. This is still America. And the movies can\'t offer a resolution that history hasn\'t. \n \n ""Detroit,"" an Annapurna Pictures release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America for ""strong violence and pervasive language.""

202,"[""SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch)—There’s still time to get that special tortilla baby blanket from SkyMall, of course, but the in-flight catalog’s bankruptcy filing is just the latest black eye for an industry that has lost ground for more than a decade. \n \n The mail-order industry generated $71.4 billion in revenues last year, down 6% from five years ago, according to estimates from analysts at IBISWorld. The analysts predicted a drop to $61 billion in revenues, or 14%, by 2019. \n \n The main reason? A dwindling customer base and the relentless competition from the likes of Amazon.com Inc.

In many cases, e-commerce companies offer more convenience, quicker transactions and more thorough product information than traditional mail order catalogs, IBISWorld analysts said. \n \n Not to mention price: the yeti sculpture is actually cheaper at SkyMall’s site than on Amazon, but broadly speaking, e-retailers’ prices are “highly competitive,” the analysts said. \n \n Mailing costs have also increased, coinciding with a growing consumer backlash against unsolicited mail and concerns about paper waste. \n \n SkyMall and parent company Xhibit Corp. US:XBTC executives couldn't be reached for comment. The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Thursday, and in filings in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Phoenix, acting Chief Executive Scott Wiley cited e-commerce as one of the reasons for his company’s financial dire straits. \n \n In addition, air travelers increasingly snubbed SkyMall’s catalogs in favor of their electronic devices, he said. SkyMall is looking for a buyer and will attempt to a scaled-down business operating during the process. \n \n Don’t dismiss mail-order businesses just yet. The industry has thrived for decades, and some companies have embraced online retail and mobile platforms to expand their customer bases, IBISWorld said. \n \n Survival will hinge on their ability to identify a target audience through demographic data and advertise their niche products to specific customers through catalogs and digital methods, the analysts said."", 'SkyMall, whose in-flight shopping catalogs have long been a staple of airline travel, has filed for bankruptcy protection, blaming changing consumer habits and the loss of contracts from two major carriers, Delta and Southwest. \n \n Xhibit Corp XBTC.PK, SkyMall\'s parent, on Friday said it hoped to sell its main assets, including the SkyMall online retail business, in April through a court-supervised auction, and then complete an ""orderly wind-down"" of its affairs. \n \n It also said it suspended its retail catalog operations on Jan. 16, laying off 47 of its 150 employees. \n \n Xhibit and SkyMall filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors on Thursday night in the U.S. bankruptcy court in Phoenix, their hometown.

208,"['Study Highlights: \n \n A commonly used heartburn medication caused blood vessel cells to age faster in laboratory testing. \n \n These findings could help explain recent reports linking long-term use of heartburn medication to several serious illnesses, including heart disease, kidney disease and dementia. \n \n Clinical studies still are necessary to determine if the drugs damage blood vessel cells within the body. \n \n Embargoed until 3 p.m. CT / 4 p.m. ET Tuesday, May 10, 2016 \n \n DALLAS, May 10, 2016 — A popular over-the-counter medication for heartburn, caused laboratory blood vessel cells to age quicker, according to new research in Circulation Research, an American Heart Association journal. \n \n Reflux, often called heartburn, occurs when stomach acid backs up into the esophagus, causing irritation and damage. Mild reflux is fairly common, but frequent, severe occurrences, known as GERD for gastroesophageal reflux disease, can cause significant discomfort and may require treatment. Many people find relief by using over-the-counter medications called proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), which reduce acid produced by the stomach. In fact, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration estimates that 1 in 14 Americans have used PPIs. \n \n After recent evidence linking long-term PPI use to several serious illnesses, including heart disease, kidney disease and dementia, researcher sought to identify how PPIs increase risk by studying their effects on blood vessel cells. \n \n Now, researchers at Houston Methodist Research Institute (HMRI) say they have discovered that long term exposure to PPIs “accelerated biological aging in human endothelial cells which line the inside of blood vessels. When healthy, human endothelial cells create a Teflon-like coating that prevents blood from sticking. When older and diseased, the endothelium becomes more like Velcro, with blood elements sticking to the vessel to form blockages.” \n \n They also found that long-term PPI exposure impairs acid production by the lysosomes in the cells lining the blood vessel walls. They noted that the lysosome — the part of the cell that typically clears waste products — did not produce enough acid to clear waste. In turn, the buildup of waste caused the cell to age rapidly. Notably, another type of antacid known as an H2 antagonist, did not have this adverse effect. \n \n “Lysosomes are like the garbage disposal of cells,” said John P. Cooke, M.D., Ph.D., study lead author and professor and chair of the Department of Cardiovascular Sciences at the HMRI and director of the Houston Methodist Research Institute Center for Cardiovascular Regeneration in Texas. “They need to generate acid to get rid of cellular rubbish, and when cellular rubbish accumulates the cells age faster.” \n \n Although PPIs can be effective for short-term use, they are not meant for extended treatment, researchers said. PPIs do not require a prescription or doctor’s supervision, which can lead to overuse. \n \n “With the knowledge that PPIs are being used by millions of people for indications and durations that were never tested or approved, it may be time for the pharmaceutical industry and regulatory agencies to re-visit the specificity and the safety of these agents,” Cooke said. “Unless otherwise indicated, physicians should consider PPIs only for short-term use for relief of symptoms of GERD, since we now have a ‘smoking gun’ that helps explain the consistent observational evidence of increased risk.” \n \n Cooke added that there are other approaches to long-term treatment that might be considered for GERD including H2 antagonists, lifestyle modifications, and in severe cases, surgical approaches. \n \n The current one has several limitations. Although two different PPIs were tested, only one of these esomeprazole (brand name Nexium) is commercially available. In addition, it did not show how PPIs actually impair the lysosome’s ability to produce enough acid to clear waste. Finally, since this study was in a laboratory setting, it could not show whether PPIs act in the same way within the human body, and long-term clinical trials are necessary. \n \n Co-authors are Gautham Yepuri, Ph.D.; Roman Sukhovershin, Ph.D.; Timo Z.

In fact, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), which are used to treat acid reflux and heartburn, are among the most prescribed drugs in the country, with millions taking them, and they're becoming more widely available over-the-counter, reports CNN. But a preliminary report just released by the American Heart Association is concerned that the drug—already associated with a higher risk of heart attack and other vascular problems, as the AHA reported earlier this year—may also increase one's risk of ischemic stroke, the most common type caused when a clot cuts off blood flow to the brain. ""At one time, PPIs were thought to be safe, without major side effects,"" the study's lead author says. “This study further questions the cardiovascular safety of these drugs."" Researchers followed nearly a quarter-million patients in Denmark who were suffering from stomach pain and indigestion and had an endoscopy. Their average age was 57, and six years later those taking one of four PPIs (Prilosec, Protonix, Prevacid, or Nexium) had a 21% higher risk of stroke than those not taking one. Lowest-dose PPIs didn't increase the risk much if at all, while highest-dose increased it, from 30% for Prevacid to 94% for Protonix. Another type of acid-lowering meds called H2 blockers (think Pepcid and Zantac) showed no elevated risk. ""As a culture, we tend to want a pill to deal with our problems, when a lot of people could reduce their heartburn by eating smaller meals, drinking less alcohol, or not smoking,"" one doc told CNN in 2010.

That\'s because her first was born on Aug, 8, 2008, her second on Sept. 9, 2009 and her most recent on Oct. 10, 2010. Yes, that\'s 8-8-08, 9-9-09 and 10-10-10. The Rockford, Mich., mom and husband Chad weren\'t thinking about dates when their children were born. Their doctor had to give drugs to start labor for the couple\'s first daughter, Chloe Corrin Soper, who was born full term on Aug. 8 at Spectrum Health\'s Butterworth Hospital in Grand Rapids, Mich. Their son was a surprise all around. ""He wasn\'t a planned baby at all, he was a miracle,"" says Barbara Soper. He was due on Sept. 20, 2009, but because sister Chloe\'s birth had caused some hemorrhaging, their doctor, Andrew Van Slooten, suggested he come out a little early so he\'d be smaller. Soper was started on drugs to induce labor on Sept. 8, but it took 24 hours before Cameron Dane Soper made his way into the world, arriving on 9-9-09. Soper says she and her husband had thought it would be ""neat"" if their third child was born on 10-10-10 but because her due date wasn\'t until Nov. 4, it seemed unlikely. But it ended up being ""kind of a mandatory eviction,"" says Soper. She developed blood clots in her legs and three weeks before her due date doctors told her the baby needed to be delivered. The induction was begun on 10-9-10, but it wasn\'t until 6:53 on Sunday night, 10-10-10, that Cearra Nicole Soper arrived. Despite being three weeks early, ""she\'s feeding well,"" says mom. ""She\'s a trooper."" While the dates might seem ""incredibly rare,"" they\'re really not. Such a lineup can only happen in the first 12 years of the century and at least 10 months apart, says Shannon McWeeney, a professor of biostatistics at the Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland. ""Given that the first birth occurred in that window, the probability is not as astronomical as you might be compelled to think,"" she says.In fact, it\'s not that high a number at all, says Philip Stark, a professor of statistics at the University of California, Berkeley. ""The \'chance\' you get depends on the assumptions you make,"" he says. One set of assumptions gives a chance of about 1 in 50 million. More realistic assumptions — including allowing at least 11 months between births — increases it to about 1 in 2,500. Since thousands of women in the United States had kids in 2008, 2009 and 2010, this suddenly seems a little less extraordinary. But humans ""like to look for patterns, to make sense of things"" he says.For the Sopers, three is simply their lucky number — ""we don\'t have any more planned,"" says Barbara.

Baby number two came on 9-9-09, and, yes, Sunday was 10-10-10. \n \n It\'s an almost impossibly cool coincidence -- especially when you consider her third baby wasn\'t due until November of this year but came early, and she didn\'t schedule C-sections with any of the kids. \n \n But let\'s do a little math of our own here, shall we? \n \n Barbara Soper has been either pregnant or recovering from giving birth since late 2007. It is now late 2010. \n \n Can we send her some condolence cards along with those congratulatory bouquets? \n \n Many women who have had their kids in quick succession tout the advantages to getting their childbearing over in one fell swoop: having little to no break in between the kids means they\'re closer in age and can play with each other on almost the same level; once you potty train one you can start the next one and escape the diaper stage faster; and of course you don\'t have the ""lost baby weight, now I\'m pregnant again"" conundrum. \n \n But there\'s a reason doctors discourage the practice. \n \n Pregnancy and childbirth both do a number on the body -- especially the uterus, your baby\'s house for the next nine months. It takes a minimum of six weeks after delivery to return to its normal size, but it still needs time to recover to again be a hospitable home for a fetus. \n \n New studies have likewise found women really DO need to lose that baby weight before embarking on a new pregnancy. As counter-intuitive as it sounds, there\'s less strain on the body (and less risk to the fetus) if your body has gone back down to a healthy weight before the next pregnancy begins. \n \n Add to that, if you\'re planning to nurse your kids for longer than nine months, it\'s possible to do it -- but it\'s needlessly complicated when babies are born one on top of another. \n \n Barbara and Chad Soper say she never planned for this to happen. Her son was a surprise pregnancy, and her second and third children were born earlier than their due dates -- she was due on September 20, 2009 with Cameron, who was born September 9, and little Cearra born this month was actually due November 4. \n \n Congrats to the family on their mathematical surprises! \n \n Does anyone have tips for them on three kids under 3? \n \n Image via Spectrum Health']",2,"– Barbara Soper managed a feat that seems like it should be impossible: She had her three children on 8/8/08, 9/9/09, and 10/10/10.

Of course, along come the statisticians to make the story a lot less magical: “The probability is not as astronomical as you might be compelled to think,” says one. Another says the chance of such a series of births is about 1 in 2,500—not all that “extraordinary,” he says, since thousands of women in the US gave birth during those years.

211,"['Image copyright I Khalil, S Misra Image caption Sperm-inspired robots ""swim"" when they are made to wiggle by a moving magnetic field \n \n Engineers have built a sperm-like robot that they can control with magnets. \n \n The simple design has a metal-coated head and a flexible body about six times longer than a human sperm. \n \n Using a magnetic field no stronger than a fridge magnet, the team made the robot ""swim"" forward and steered it towards a fixed point. \n \n They hope the findings, published in the journal Applied Physics Letters, will be useful in medical and manufacturing applications. \n \n ""We have built a biologically inspired micro-robot that looks like a sperm cell but is completely fabricated in the lab,"" said Dr Sarthak Misra, a robotics engineer at the University of Twente in the Netherlands. \n \n Sperm, like some bacteria, use a whip-like ""flagellum"" to propel themselves through fluid. \n \n Other studies of this process have included coupling a magnetic tail to a red blood cell, or controlling real sperm by steering them in metal microtubes. \n \n The new gadget is made from a strong but flexible polymer, with a metal layer painted onto its head using a technique called electron beam evaporation. \n \n That metal element is forced in different directions when the device is placed into a moving field, produced by the coils of an electromagnet. \n \n Precise navigation \n \n ""The magnetic head is used to orient it in a certain direction and then, just by flapping its tail, it starts to move forward,"" Dr Misra told the BBC. ""The flapping happens because we change the current in the coils."" \n \n Image copyright I Khalil, S Misra Image caption The simple robots consist of a flexible tail and a head with an added metallic layer \n \n For its size, the robot can hardly compete with its biological inspiration for pace: it wiggles along at up to 0.5 body lengths per second, whereas a human sperm can cover several times its body length in that time. \n \n Importantly, however, Dr Misra and his colleagues also showed that they could steer the robot with some precision. By adjusting the magnetic field changes with a computer, they navigated their creation towards a fixed point. \n \n This means the little robots could be useful for positioning materials in nanomanufacturing, or for medical purposes. ""It opens up a lot of applications, from targeted drug delivery to in vitro fertilisation - where you want to reach precise locations,"" Dr Misra said. \n \n For these ideas to work, the researchers need to test the technique in more complicated environments. They are moving on to those experiments, as well as working on making their ""MagnetoSperm"" smaller and faster. \n \n Image copyright SPL Image caption Human sperm are another six times smaller than the tiny robots that were modelled on them \n \n Dr Matthew Baker, who studies molecular motors at the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute in Sydney, told BBC News the work was ""very cool"" but commented that the tiny contraptions are not robots in the sense that most of us would imagine. \n \n ""It\'s just a piece of metal and it\'s the field that\'s doing the hard work,"" Dr Baker explained. ""The clever part is the oscillating, small, tunable magnetic field."" \n \n This out-sourcing of power and navigation is what allows the gadget to be so small, according to the new study\'s first author Dr Islam Khalil. ""As technology progresses and many products get smaller, it becomes difficult to assemble objects on nano- and micro-scales,"" he said in a press statement. \n \n ""MagnetoSperm can be used to manipulate and assemble objects at these scales, using an external source of magnetic field to control its motion.""', 'Sorry, this zipcode is not in our deliverable area for this subscription service. \n \n Re-enter zip code or sign up for digital access. \n \n Get digital access']",2,"– After just short of 20 years, the murder of JonBenet Ramsey is as much of a mystery as ever—especially in light of a new examination of DNA evidence.

At the time, Lacy concluded that DNA evidence found on JonBenet's underwear and long johns belonged to a male intruder who was not part of the Ramsey family. But now three forensic experts who examined the DNA test results and lab reports used by Lacy say they do not support her conclusion. For one thing, a sample on her underwear identified as coming from ""Unknown Male 1"" may in fact be a composite from multiple people and thus ""worthless as evidence,"" says the news report. Another revelation that further muddles the picture: DNA samples on her long johns appear to come from JonBenet and at least two other people, not one, a fact that has never been revealed before. What's more, the independent experts say all of the unknown DNA may be the result of ""inconsequential contact with other people,"" reports the Camera. With the exoneration, ""I was trying to prevent a horrible travesty of justice,"" Lacy tells ABC. (The interview was done before these latest revelations.)

Call the police’ \n \n Baltimore man who called 911 for help dies after being punched by police \n \n A 21-year-old man died in a hospital near Baltimore on Wednesday, after an altercation with county police officers who repeatedly punched him as they responded to a call for an ambulance. \n \n Keith Scott shooting: video emerges of fatal encounter with Charlotte police Read more \n \n Tawon Boyd was pronounced dead after doctors failed to revive him following his encounter with the police. An autopsy has not been completed. \n \n According to initial accounts by the Baltimore County police department, officers were responding to a 911 call placed by Boyd’s girlfriend, Deona Styron. But a lawyer for Boyd’s family, Latoya Francis-Williams, told a different story. She said Boyd called 911 himself because he was feeling disoriented and needed an ambulance. \n \n “They really were supposed to be there to get him to the nearest healthcare facility,” Francis-Williams said. \n \n After being questioned on the discrepancy, the police department updated its account, saying: “Police originally thought the girlfriend was the caller because the information passed on to police from the dispatcher said ‘female yelling on the phone’.” \n \n According to the police incident report: “The call stated that there is a female yelling in the background. 911 added that a female keeps saying ‘Tell them hurry up’.” \n \n Boyd repeatedly asked officers to enter his home, the report said, and asked a neighbor to call the police. Boyd told officers that Styron, who lived with him, “got him intoxicated and is secretly recording him while someone else is in the home”. The author of the police report described Boyd as “confused and paranoid”. Boyd asked officers to go into the house and find out who was inside. \n \n According to the report, Boyd attempted to enter two police cars and then ran to a neighbor’s house and banged on the door, calling: “Help! Call the police!” \n \n “It was obvious suspect Boyd was under the influence of a narcotic and/or suffering [REDACTED] and needed to be taken to the hospital for emergency evaluation,” the report noted. \n \n By the time medics loaded Boyd into the back of an ambulance, he reportedly had physical injuries imposed by officers. \n \n The report does not describe Boyd as violent or threatening, saying Boyd seemed to scratch the author’s neck and accidentally kick another officer, named Garland, “while trying to stand”. Boyd grabbed a third officer’s face, the report said, describing his hand slipping down to the officer’s badge and microphone. That officer, Bowman, “delivered two closed fist strikes to the suspect’s face with his right fist”. \n \n Francis-Williams said: “He is literally attacked. And by attacked, I mean the witness [Styron] is describing that he [was] struck many times and struck to the ground. \n \n “Officer Bowman is the one that when he arrived, really started wailing on Mr Boyd, meaning Mr Boyd was on the ground in a prone position and Bowman sat on him, almost straddled his back, and put his left arm under Boyd’s neck and pulled his head up in a choking fashion.” \n \n This is not too far from the language used in the incident report, which says “officers were able to get him under control by using our body weight to keep him on the ground. Officer Bowman controlled Suspect Boyd’s head and arms by holding him down with his arms while [the report author] held Suspect Boyd down by leaning on his buttocks/thigh area with my knees and using my arms.” \n \n Boyd’s grandmother, Linda Burch, told the Baltimore Sun: “I kept telling them stop before they hurt him because I told them they could kill him like that. They told me to go across the street before they lock me up.” \n \n Betty Shelby released on $50,000 bail in Terence Crutcher shooting Read more \n \n Styron could not be reached for comment. Of her own conversation with Styron, Francis-Williams said: “According to the witness, Mr Boyd was screaming, ‘Stop, stop, I can’t breathe.’ That could have been from the choking but at the same time, officer Bowman is punching and striking Mr Boyd in the face and in the neck area. \n \n “The witness described that after a little she’s screaming, ‘Stop,’ and Mr Boyd is kind of foaming at the mouth or spitting and his body goes limp.” \n \n According to the incident report, Boyd became so calm that Bowman “asked a medic to check the suspect for a pulse”. The report noted that the “medics advised that the suspect did have a heartbeat prior to being transported”. \n \n The report ends with a redacted list of minor injuries sustained by the officers. Boyd ended up in intensive care. \n \n Though an autopsy has not been released, Francis-Williams said there was “swelling on the brain and fluid on the brain because the doctors attempted to drain that. \n \n “My understanding is his kidneys end up failing and at some point, his heart stops,” she said. \n \n Police officials said the autopsy report could take as long as a month to complete.', 'Baltimore County police and fire officials are investigating the circumstances behind the death of 21-year-old Tawon Boyd, who died Wednesday, three days after police struggled with him while responding to a disturbance call. \n \n A medic who was called to the scene gave Boyd medication to calm him down. Autopsy results are a critical component in this case, because they might reveal whether the drug haloperidol, which sources said medics gave the victim to calm him down, contributed to his death. Police confirm a key element of this case will be the impact the calming drug may have had on Boyd. \n \n ""The autopsy is a crucial piece of evidence,"" said A. Dwight Pettit, an attorney representing the Boyd family. \n \n Instead of a wedding and baby shower, Boyd\'s family is planning a funeral. \n \n ""I just want my son back. They could have Tased him.

Officers reported that when they tried to take him to a hospital for an emergency evaluation, Tawon Boyd ran, screaming, knocking on neighbors\' doors, asking them to call police. Officers said he resisted all attempts to restrain him. \n \n ""Police were on his shoulders and had him face-down on the ground. They was (sic) holding him.

They trying (sic) to kill me, grandma,\'"" Burch said. \n \n It will be at least seven days before autopsy results are available. \n \n Baltimore County authorities said there were two 911 calls. The calls have not yet been released. The Baltimore County 911 Center received the first call at 3:06:45 (it ends at 3:20:11), and Tawon Boyd is the caller. Police originally thought the girlfriend was the caller because the information passed on to police from the dispatcher said, ""Female yelling on the phone."" \n \n The caller, assumed to be Tawon Boyd, is understandable at various moments, but the tape consists mostly of screaming from Tawon Boyd and the girlfriend, and is difficult to understand. Tawon Boyd does not call for medical help. Based on this call, police were dispatched to a disturbance. \n \n The second call came at 3:25:49 and ended at 3:33:58.

But Boyd started trying to get into police cars and resisted attempts to restrain him, resulting in minor injuries to three officers. Based on the police report, it doesn't appear Boyd was trying to hurt the officers. He was holding onto one of the officer's shirts when the officer punched him twice in the face. At that point, the family's lawyer, Latoya Francis-Williams, says Boyd was ""literally attacked"" by officers.

Police say the 50-year-old, who has a developmental delay and functions at a child's level, has spent the last 30 years living in St. Catharines, around 80 miles from where he disappeared, CTV reports. From what investigators can piece together, Latulip took a bus to Niagara Falls in September 1986 and ended up in St. Catharines, where he suffered a head injury and ""effectively forgot who he was"" until this year, when he told a social worker he remembered. Before his disappearance, Latulip had attempted suicide at least once, leading to fears he may have killed himself. Police officer Duane Gingerich, who investigated the disappearance, tells the Guelph Mercury that he's thrilled that Latulip has turned up alive. ""I had hopes that he was out there somewhere,"" he says. ""For us as investigators, this is great, this is awesome. It's satisfying because most of these cases don't turn out this way. You expect the worst when a person is missing for that period of time."" A DNA test confirmed Latulip's identity and police say a reunion with his mother, who moved to Ottawa years ago, is being arranged. In a 2014 interview, she told the Mercury she was still haunted by the disappearance. ""This is always at the back of my mind. Having an answer would mean closure,"" she said.

219,"['Senior U.S. commanders argued that increasing electricity through the “Kandahar Bridging Solution” would be an important part of the overall American military effort to beat back the Taliban in Kandahar province. Those commanders asserted that more power to operate lights, television sets and fans would please residents and lead many of them to throw their support behind the Afghan government. \n \n But other civilian and military officials have questioned that logic. When U.S. Army Maj. Gen. Kenneth Dahl was the deputy commander of U.S. forces in Kandahar last year, he said he could not find any evidence that the additional electricity was yielding greater employment, stability or support for the government. “This is a bridge to nowhere,” he declared to his staff in 2011. \n \n Back then, Dahl also noticed a disturbing disparity: The installation of the turbine at the dam, which will not occur for at least two more years, will produce significantly less power than the city receives from the generators. Since the Afghan government will not have the financial ability to buy diesel for the generators, that means the city’s power supply will inevitably ebb once the turbine is operational and U.S. funding for diesel ends. \n \n That gap was seized upon by the inspector general. “While the Kandahar Bridging Solution may achieve some immediate [counter\xadinsurgency] benefits because — as stated by USAID officials — ‘people like having their lights on,’ the U.S. government may be building an expectations gap that cannot be met in a timely manner,” the report states. \n \n The inspector general’s report also questions whether a new $23 million road in Helmand province will have adverse effects because the Afghan government has not compensated landowners for the destruction of their property. In addition, the report reveals that four electricity projects — costing a total of more than $300 million from the infrastructure fund — have not yet been awarded to contractors, despite claims from the military and USAID that they will have important counterinsurgency benefits. \n \n Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.), a frequent critic of Afghan reconstruction efforts, said the report raises fundamental questions about the strategic rationale of U.S. development programs in the war-torn nation. “There’s no data that shows these major projects have changed the security environment in the country,” she said. “We cannot just throw money at a country like this and expect it to have a good ending.” \n \n In its response to the report, the U.S. Embassy defended the importance of large-scale development initiatives. “These critical infrastructure projects have signaled to Afghan populations the U.S. government’s long term commitment to Afghanistan.” \n \n Although the United States has spent almost $90 billion on Afghan reconstruction and development over the past decade, such examinations traditionally had not been conducted by the special inspector general’s office, which was more interested in contracting waste and fraud. This report was approved by a new inspector, former federal prosecutor John F. Sopko, who took charge of the office this month.

The Ebola outbreak is now the largest recorded in history. \n \n President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, who is skipping a summit of African leaders in Washington this week amid the crisis, also called for the closure of markets in an area near the borders with infected countries Guinea and Sierra Leone. \n \n ""My fellow Liberians, Ebola is real, Ebola is contagious and Ebola kills,"" she warned. ""Denying that the disease exists is not doing your part, so keep yourselves and your loved ones safe."" \n \n Fear and panic over the mounting death toll has prompted some rural communities to accuse foreign aid workers of bringing the deadly virus. Others have kept people with Ebola symptoms at home instead of bringing them to quarantine centers. In anger, one man recently set fire to part of the health ministry building in the Liberian capital, Monrovia, after his teenage brother reportedly died of Ebola. \n \n Sirleaf said that security forces would enforce the new precautions taken a week after an American man of Liberian descent boarded a plane in Monrovia and flew to Nigeria, where authorities said he died of Ebola. The fact that he was able to board a plane and traveled through a major airport transit hub in Togo has only heightened fears about Ebola\'s possible spread in the region. \n \n The airline involved, ASKY, has suspended its flights to both the capitals of Liberia and Sierra Leone, and said passengers departing from Guinea would be carefully screened. \n \n Ebola has no vaccine and no specific treatment, with a fatality rate of at least 60 percent. But experts say the risk of travelers contracting it is considered low because it requires direct contact with bodily fluids or secretions such as urine, blood, sweat or saliva.

The report from the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, a US government watchdog agency, uncovered numerous examples of poor construction work: One base has no water supply, a second is experiencing sewage overflow, some are missing drainpipes, others have leaking fuel lines or broken doors. One even includes a well house being used as … a chicken coop. The US Army Corps of Engineers says it is working on fixing the issues. The report also finds that the US plan to fund hundreds of millions of dollars worth of infrastructure projects in the country is extremely behind schedule—and that some of the ambitious plans may actually hurt the country, the Washington Post adds. The report raises concerns about the 2014 withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan and questions whether local forces are prepared to take over security duties—and whether this new infrastructure can be successfully maintained by a country with limited resources. The Post digs into a $220 million electricity project in Kandahar that it cites as a prime example."

But the city has seen an exodus of tourists, expatriates and many Japanese, who fear a blast of radioactive material. \n \n ""I\'m leaving because my parents are terrified. I personally think this will turn out to be the biggest paper tiger the world has ever seen,"" said Luke Ridley, 23, from London as he sat at Narita international airport using his laptop. \n \n ""I\'ll probably come back in about a month."" \n \n Though there has been alarm around the world, experts have been warning there is little risk of radiation at dangerous levels spreading to other nations. \n \n The U.S. government said ""minuscule"" amounts of radiation were detected in California consistent with a release from Japan\'s damaged facility, but there were no levels of concern. \n \n Amid their distress, Japanese were proud of the 279 nuclear plant workers toiling in the wreckage, wearing masks, goggles and protective suits sealed by duct tape. \n \n ""My eyes well with tears at the thought of the work they are doing,"" Kazuya Aoki, a safety official at Japan\'s Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, told Reuters. \n \n G7 INTERVENTION FOR YEN \n \n The Group of Seven rich nations succeeded in calming global financial markets in rare concerted intervention to restrain a soaring yen. \n \n The dollar surged to 81.98 yen on Friday after the G7 moved to pour billions into markets buying dollars, euros and pounds -- the first such joint intervention since the group came to the aid of the newly launched euro in 2000. \n \n The dollar later dropped back to under 81 yen, but it was still far from the record low of 76.25 yen hit on Thursday. \n \n ""The only type of intervention that actually works is coordinated intervention, and it shows the solidarity of all central banks in terms of the severity of the situation in Japan,"" said Kathy Lien, director of currency research at GFT in New York. \n \n Japan\'s Nikkei share index ended up 2.7 percent, recouping some of the week\'s stinging losses. It lost 10.2 percent for the week, wiping $350 billion off market capitalization. \n \n The plight of the homeless worsened following a cold snap that brought heavy snow to the worst-affected areas. \n \n Nearly 290,000 households in the north were still without electricity, officials said, and the government said about 940,000 households lacked running water. \n \n Aid groups say most victims are getting help, but there are pockets of acute suffering. \n \n ""We\'ve seen children suffering with the cold, and lacking really basic items like food and clean water,"" Stephen McDonald of Save the Children said in a statement on Friday. \n \n (Additional reporting by Linda Sieg, Nathan Layne, Elaine Lies, Leika Kihara, Jon Herskovitz, Joseph Radford and Chris Gallagher in Japan; Fiona Ortiz in Madrid; Scott DiSavino in New York; Writing by Andrew Cawthorne; Editing by Robert Birsel)', 'YAMAGATA, Japan -- Emergency workers seemed to try everything they could think of Thursday to douse one of Japan\'s dangerously overheated nuclear reactors: helicopters, heavy-duty fire trucks, even water cannons normally used to quell rioters. But they couldn\'t be sure any of it was easing the peril at the tsunami-ravaged facility. \n \n (SCROLL DOWN FOR LIVE UPDATES) \n \n Three reactors have had at least partial meltdowns, but an even greater danger has emerged. Japanese and U.S. concerns were increasingly focusing on the pools used to store spent nuclear fuel: Some of the pools are dry or nearly empty and the rods could heat up and spew radiation. \n \n It could take days and ""possibly weeks"" to get the complex under control, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission Chairman Gregory Jazcko said. He defended the U.S. decision to recommend a 50-mile evacuation zone for its citizens, a much stronger measure than Japan has taken. \n \n A senior official with the U.N.\'s nuclear safety agency said there had been ""no significant worsening"" at the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant but that the situation remained ""very serious."" Graham Andrew told reporters in Vienna that nuclear fuel rods in two reactors were only about half covered with water, and in a third they were also not completely submerged. \n \n If the fuel is not fully covered, rising temperatures and pressure will increase the chances of complete meltdowns that would release much larger amounts of radioactive material than the failing plant has emitted so far. \n \n Low levels of radiation have been detected well beyond Tokyo, which is 140 miles (220 kilometers) south of the plant, but hazardous levels have been limited to the plant itself. Still, the crisis triggered by last week\'s earthquake and tsunami has forced thousands to evacuate and drained Tokyo\'s normally vibrant streets of life, its residents either leaving town or holing up in their homes. \n \n President Barack Obama appeared on television to assure Americans that officials do not expect harmful amounts of radiation to reach the U.S. or its territories. He also said the U.S. was offering Japan any help it could provide, and said he was asking for a comprehensive review of U.S. nuclear plant safety. \n \n Japanese and American assessments of the crisis have differed, with the plant\'s owner denying Jazcko\'s report Wednesday that Unit 4\'s spent fuel pool was dry and that anyone who gets close to the plant could face potentially lethal doses of radiation. But a Tokyo Electric Power Co. executive moved closer to the U.S. position Thursday. \n \n ""Considering the amount of radiation released in the area, the fuel rods are more likely to be exposed than to be covered,"" Yuichi Sato said. \n \n Workers have been dumping seawater when possible to control temperatures at the plant since the quake and tsunami knocked out power to its cooling systems, but they tried even more desperate measures on Unit 3\'s reactor and cooling pool. \n \n Two Japanese military CH-47 Chinook helicopters began dumping seawater on Unit 3 on Thursday morning, defense ministry spokeswoman Kazumi Toyama said. The choppers doused the reactor with at least four loads of water in just the first 10 minutes, though television footage showed much of it appearing to disperse in the wind. \n \n Chopper crews flew missions of about 40 minutes each to limit their radiation exposure, passing over the reactor with loads of about 2,000 gallons (7,500 liters) of water. Another 9,000 gallons (35,000 liters) of water were blasted from military trucks with high-pressure sprayers used to extinguish fires at plane crashes, though the vehicles had to stay safely back from areas deemed to have too much radiation. \n \n Special police units with water cannons were also tried, but they could not reach the targets from safe distances and had to pull back, said Yasuhiro Hashimoto, a spokesman for Japan\'s nuclear safety agency. \n \n Unit 3\'s reactor uses a fuel that combines plutonium, better known as an ingredient in nuclear weapons, and reprocessed uranium. The presence of this mixed oxide fuel, or MOX, means potentially that two very harmful radioactive products could be released into the environment. \n \n Tokyo Electric Power said it believed workers were making headway in staving off a catastrophe both with the spraying and, especially, with efforts to complete an emergency power line to restart the plant\'s own electric cooling systems. \n \n ""This is a first step toward recovery,"" said Teruaki Kobayashi, a facilities management official at the power company. He said radiation levels ""have somewhat stabilized at their lows"" and that some of the spraying had reached its target, with one reactor emitting steam. \n \n ""We are doing all we can as we pray for the situation to improve,"" Kobayashi said. Authorities planned to spray again Friday, and Kobayashi said: ""Choices are limited. We just have to stick to what we can do most quickly and efficiently."" \n \n Work on connecting the new power line to the plant was expected to begin Friday and take 10 to 15 hours, said Nuclear Safety Agency spokesman Minoru Ohgoda. But the utility is not sure the cooling systems will still function. If they don\'t, electricity won\'t help. \n \n Four of the plant\'s six reactors have seen fires, explosions, damage to the structures housing reactor cores, partial meltdowns or rising temperatures. Officials also recently said temperatures are rising even in the spent fuel pools of the other two reactors. \n \n The troubles at the nuclear complex were set in motion by last Friday\'s 9.0-magnitude earthquake and tsunami, which knocked out power and destroyed backup generators needed for the reactors\' cooling systems. That added a nuclear crisis on top of twin natural disasters that likely killed well more than 10,000 people and left hundreds of thousands homeless. \n \n Mario V. Bonaca, a physicist sits on an advisory committee to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said he believes the focus of the effort has shifted to the spent fuel pools. ""I understand that they\'ve controlled the cooling of the cores,"" said Bonaca, who said he was basing his understanding on NRC and industry sources. \n \n The storage pools need a constant source of cooling water. Even when removed from reactors, uranium rods are still extremely hot and must be cooled for months, possibly longer, to prevent them from heating up again and emitting radioactivity. \n \n While a core team of 180 emergency workers has been rotating in and out of the complex to avoid exposure, experts said that anyone working close to the reactors was almost certainly being exposed to radiation levels that could, at least, give them much higher cancer risks. \n \n Experts note, though, that radiation levels drop quickly with distance from the complex. While elevated radiation has been detected well outside the evacuation zone, experts say those levels are not dangerous. \n \n U.S. officials were taking no chances. In Washington, the State Department warned U.S. citizens to consider leaving the country and offered voluntary evacuation to family members and dependents of U.S. personnel in the cities of Tokyo, Yokohama and Nagoya. \n \n The first flight left Thursday, with fewer than 100 people onboard, Undersecretary of State Patrick Kennedy said. Plans also call for airlifting several thousand family members of U.S. armed forces personnel as well as nonessential staff stationed in Japan in the coming days. \n \n The U.S. evacuation zone is far bigger than that established by Japan, which has called for a 12-mile zone and has told those within 20 miles to stay indoors. Daniel B. Poneman, U.S. deputy secretary of energy, said at the briefing that his agency agreed with the 50-mile zone - but said Japan\'s measures were also prudent. \n \n Nearly a week after the earthquake and tsunami, police said more than 452,000 people were staying in schools and other shelters, as supplies of fuel, medicine and other necessities ran short. Both victims and aid workers appealed for more help, as the chances of finding more survivors dwindled. \n \n Noriko Sawaki lives in a battered neighborhood in Sendai that is still without running water and food or gasoline supplies and that, she said, makes life exhausting. ""It\'s frustrating, because we don\'t have a goal, something to strive for. This just keeps on going,"" said the 48-year-old. \n \n In the town of Kesennuma, people lined up to get into a supermarket after a delivery of key supplies, such as instant rice packets and diapers. \n \n Each person was only allowed to buy 10 items, NHK television reported. \n \n With diapers hard to find in many areas, an NHK program broadcast a how-to session on fashioning a diaper from a plastic shopping bag and a towel.', 'Smoke billowed from a building at Japan\'s crippled nuclear power plant Friday as emergency crews worked to reconnect electricity to cooling systems and spray more water on overheating nuclear fuel at the tsunami-ravaged facility. \n \n ALTERNATE CROP OF TOK870 OF MARCH 17, 2011 - In this photo taken on Wednesday afternoon, March 16, 2011 and released on Thursday, March 17 by Tokyo Electric Power Co.

(Associated Press) \n \n Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant is pictured before helicopters dump water on the stricken reactor to cool overheated fuel rods inside the core in Okumamachi, Fukushima Prefecture, Japan, Thursday... (Associated Press) \n \n Four of the troubled Fukushima Dai-ichi plant\'s six reactor units have seen fires, explosions or partial meltdowns in the week since the tsunami. While the reactor cores where energy is generated are a concern, water in the pools used to store used nuclear fuel are also major worries. Water in at least one fuel pool _ in the complex\'s Unit 3 _ is believed to be dangerously low, exposing the stored fuel rods. Without enough water, the rods may heat further and spew out radiation. \n \n ""We see it as an extremely serious accident,"" Yukiya Amano, the head of the U.N.\'s International Atomic Energy Agency, told reporters Friday just after arriving in Tokyo. ""This is not something that just Japan should deal with, and people of the entire world should cooperate with Japan and the people in the disaster areas."" \n \n Frantic efforts were made Thursday to douse a number of units with water, and authorities were preparing to repeat many of those efforts. \n \n Friday\'s smoke came from the complex\'s Unit 2, and its cause was not known, the nuclear safety agency said. An explosion had hit the building on Tuesday, possibly damaging a crucial cooling chamber that sits below the reactor core. \n \n Last week\'s 9.0 quake and tsunami in Japan\'s northeast set off the nuclear problems by knocking out power to cooling systems at the reactors. The unfolding crises have led to power shortages in Japan, forced auto and other factories to close, sending shockwaves through global manufacturing and trade, and triggered a plunge in Japanese stock prices. \n \n Low levels of radiation have been detected well beyond Tokyo, which is 140 miles (220 kilometers) south of the plant, but hazardous levels have been limited to the plant itself. Still, the crisis has forced thousands to evacuate and drained Tokyo\'s normally vibrant streets of life, its residents either leaving town or holing up in their homes. \n \n The Japanese government has been slow in releasing information on the crisis, even as the troubles have multiplied. In a country where the nuclear industry has a long history of hiding its safety problems, this has left many people _ in Japan and among governments overseas _ confused and anxious. \n \n ""I feel a sense of dread,"" said Yukiko Morioka, 63, who has seen business dry up at her lottery ticket booth in Tokyo. ""I\'m not an expert, so it\'s difficult to understand what\'s going on. That makes it scarier."" \n \n A senior official with the U.N. nuclear agency said Thursday there had been ""no significant worsening"" at the nuclear plant but that the situation remained ""very serious."" Graham Andrew told reporters in Vienna that nuclear fuel rods in two reactors were only about half covered with water, and they were also not completely submerged in a third. \n \n Edano said Friday that Tokyo is asking the U.S. government for help and that the two are discussing the specifics. \n \n ""We are coordinating with the U.S. government as to what the U.S. can provide and what people really need,"" Edano said. \n \n At times, the two close allies have offered starkly differing assessments over the dangers at Fukushima. U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission Chairman Gregory Jazcko said Thursday that it could take days and ""possibly weeks"" to get the complex under control. He defended the U.S. decision to recommend a 50-mile (80-kilometer) evacuation zone for its citizens, wider than the 30-mile (50-kilometer) band Japan has ordered. \n \n Crucial to the effort to regain control over the Fukushima plant is laying a new power line to the plant, allowing operators to restore cooling systems. The operator, Tokyo Electric Power Co., missed a deadline late Thursday but said Friday that workers hoped to complete the effort in 10 to 15 hours, said nuclear safety agency spokesman Minoru Ohgoda. \n \n But the utility is not sure the cooling systems will still function. If they don\'t, electricity won\'t help. \n \n The official death toll from the disasters stood at 6,405 as of Friday morning, with 10,259 missing, the national police agency said. \n \n President Barack Obama appeared on television to assure Americans that officials do not expect harmful amounts of radiation to reach the U.S. or its territories. He also said the U.S. was offering Japan any help it could provide. \n \n A utility official said Wednesday that the company has been unable to get information such as water levels and temperatures from any of the spent fuel pools in the four most troubled reactors. \n \n Workers have been dumping seawater when possible to control temperatures at the plant since the quake and tsunami knocked out power to its cooling systems, but they tried even more desperate measures on Units 3 and 4. \n \n On Thursday, military helicopters dumped thousands of gallons of water from huge buckets onto Unit 3, and also used military firefighting trucks normally used to extinguish fires at plane crashes. \n \n Officials announced Friday they would not continue with the helicopter drops _ televised footage appeared to show much of that water blowing away _ but would continue spraying from the trucks. \n \n Police said more than 452,000 people made homeless by the quake and tsunami were staying in schools and other shelters, as supplies of fuel, medicine and other necessities ran short. Both victims and aid workers appealed for more help, as the chances of finding more survivors dwindled. \n \n At the Fukushima Dai-ichi plant, a core team of 180 emergency workers has been rotating out of the complex to minimize radiation exposure. \n \n The storage pools need a constant source of cooling water. Even when removed from reactors, uranium rods are still extremely hot and must be cooled for months, possibly longer, to prevent them from heating up again and emitting radioactivity. \n \n In Washington, the State Department warned U.S. citizens to consider leaving the country and offered voluntary evacuation to family members and dependents of U.S. personnel in the cities of Tokyo, Yokohama and Nagoya. \n \n ___ \n \n Yamaguchi reported from Tokyo. Associated Press writers George Jahn in Vienna, Elaine Kurtenbach, Shino Yuasa, Jeff Donn and Tim Sullivan in Tokyo contributed to this report.']",3,"– Japan is considering burying its troubled nuclear plant in sand and concrete—the same move made in Chernobyl 25 years ago, Reuters reports. “It is not impossible to encase the reactors in concrete. But our priority right now is to try and cool them down first,” said an official, as authorities work to restore power. Smoke has been rising from the No. 2 reactor at the plant, and authorities aren’t sure of the cause—though it may be linked to the explosion there Tuesday, notes the AP. New damage has been discovered in the fuel pool at the plant’s No. 4 reactor, hampering cooling efforts to refill it with water (click for more on the alarming situation). US data-collecting flights suggest that radiation hasn’t expanded outside a 19-mile area—but Japan has raised its threat level from 4 to 5 out of 7, pointing to danger that extends beyond the local. The crisis could continue for weeks, said a US official. Meanwhile, the Huffington Post notes, authorities are using every cooling method available, from fire trucks to water cannons."
224,"['Oxytocin, a hormone often referred to as the ""cuddle chemical"" for its role in helping to foster intimate relationships—particularly between mothers and their newborns—may help people with autism to read and react to social cues, according to the preliminary results of a small study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Individuals with autism spectrum disorders often have trouble engaging and interacting in social situations, frequently avoiding eye contact, for example, and previous research has also shown that people who are autistic often have lower levels of the hormone oxytocin. In this recent study, researchers from France\'s Center of Cognitive Neuroscience used nasal inhalers to give oxytocin to 13 individuals with high-functioning autism or Asperger\'s syndrome. Afterwards, the researchers examined the study participants\' reactions to social stimuli. They found that, after the oxytocin, the subjects showed significant improvement on social tasks—including making more eye contact when shown pictures of faces, and responding to other players in a ball tossing game. \n \n Oxytocin, sometimes referred to as the ""love hormone"", is one powerful chemical: during physical intimacy, it increases for both men and women; it acts as a hormone to help induce labor and lactation in mothers; and it also serves as a nuerotransmitter in the brain—research suggests that it influences everything from our ability to fall in love, to our tendency toward monogamous relationships and ability to trust others. Should these initial findings be confirmed, they may suggest a potential therapeutic use of oxytocin for individuals with autism spectrum disorders. What\'s more, it could even increase opportunities for early intervention for children diagnosed with autism. As Angela Sirigu, lead author of the study, told the Washington Post, ""It\'s possible it can become a cure, if it\'s given early when the problems are detected in the little kids...

Animals comprise a mere 2 GT C, of which half are arthropods—including insects, spiders, and crustaceans. And although humans weigh in at just 0.06 GT C—on par with krill and termites—our impact on biomass since the beginning of civilization has been huge, scientists say. Humans and their cattle, pigs, and other livestock outweigh wild mammals by more than 20-fold; similarly, domesticated fowl surpass all other birds. Humans have also had an impact on plant biomass, which has been cut in half in the past 10,000 years. \n \n To figure out the biomass of each creature, quantitative biologists spent 3 years combing the scientific literature. But their ultimate goal wasn’t to figure out how much life weighs—it was to discover the most abundant protein on the planet.

(AP Photo/Michael Probst, File) When you weigh all life on Earth, billions of humans don\'t amount to much compared to trees, earthworms or even viruses. But we really know how to throw what little weight we have around, according to a first-of-its-kind global census of the footprint of life on the planet. \n \n Humans only add up to about one ten-thousandth of the life on Earth, measured by the dry weight of the carbon that makes up the structure of all living things, also known as biomass. \n \n The planet\'s real heavyweights are plants. They outweigh people by about 7,500 to 1, and make up more than 80 percent of the world\'s biomass, a study in Monday\'s Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences said. \n \n Bacteria are nearly 13 percent of the world\'s biomass.

Iran says its program is peaceful and is for advances in medical research and power generation. \n \n Last week, Iranian diplomats met in Geneva with negotiators from the United States, Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany. Iran hopes to ease the crippling economic and oil sanctions placed on its government over its contested nuclear program. \n \n Iran currently runs more than 10,000 centrifuges which have created tons of fuel-grade material that can be further enriched to arm nuclear warheads. Tehran also has nearly 440 pounds (200 kilograms) of higher-enriched uranium in a form that can be turned into weapons much more quickly. Experts say 550 pounds (250 kilograms) of 20 percent-enriched uranium are needed to produce a single warhead \n \n Among key concessions wanted by the West, according to two diplomats who spoke with The Associated Press, is that Iran stop enriching uranium to 20 percent.

David Morse Rice, a drifter and unemployed steelworker, was found guilty of those killings. \n \n Anti-Semitic incidents and online harassment rising, ADL says \n \n The ADL said the attack Saturday comes at a time when both anti-Semitic incidents and online harassment are on the rise. \n \n Jewish people were the victims of more reported hate crimes than any other religious minority in 2016, according to the most recent year of FBI statistics. \n \n In that year , 684 anti-Jewish incidents were reported. That\'s more than the rest of religiously motivated hate crimes combined, records reveal. \n \n Tracking such crimes can be nuanced and difficult. The motivations aren\'t always clear, and the crimes are often not reported by victims and police. \n \n Robert Bowers, 46, faces 29 charges in all, including 11 counts of using a firearm to commit murder and multiple counts of two hate crimes: obstruction of exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death and obstruction of exercise of religious beliefs resulting in bodily injury to a public safety officer. \n \n ""The crimes of violence are based upon the federal civil rights laws prohibiting hate crimes,"" US Attorney Scott W. Brady and Bob Jones, FBI special agent in charge of Pittsburgh office, said in a statement. \n \n The FBI, which calls an offense a hate crime when there\'s an added element of bias, is leading the investigation into the attack. \n \n Bowers told a SWAT officer that he wanted all Jews to die and also that Jews were committing genocide to his people, according to CNN affiliate WTAE, citing a police criminal complaint filed Saturday evening in Pittsburgh. \n \n Last year, The Anti-Defamation League reported, anti-Semitic incidents rose almost 60% , the largest single-year increase on record. \n \n The ADL found 1,986 cases of harassment, vandalism or physical assaults against Jewish people or institutions in 2017.

(AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar) (Associated Press) \n \n PITTSBURGH (AP) — During the week, anyone who wanted to get inside Pittsburgh\'s Tree of Life synagogue had to ring the doorbell and be granted entry by staff because the front door was kept locked. Not so on Saturday — the Jewish Sabbath — when the building was open for worship. \n \n A gunman who had expressed hatred of Jews exploited that vulnerability, so common in so many houses of worship across the country, in a singularly horrific way. \n \n Armed with a rifle and three handguns, Robert Bowers walked into the synagogue during Saturday morning worship and began shooting, killing 11 and wounding six before police took him into custody, officials said. It was the deadliest attack on Jews in U.S. history, according to the leader of the Anti-Defamation League. \n \n Bowers traded gunfire with police and was shot multiple times but survived. He was charged late Saturday with 29 federal counts, including weapons offenses and hate crimes. Law enforcement officials planned to discuss the massacre at a news conference Sunday morning. \n \n Four police officers were among the wounded. \n \n The nation\'s latest mass shooting drew condemnation and expressions of sympathy from politicians and religious leaders of all stripes. With the midterm election just over a week away, it also reignited a longstanding and bitter debate over guns. President Donald Trump said the outcome might have been different if the synagogue ""had some kind of protection"" from an armed guard, while Pennsylvania\'s Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf, up for re-election, noted that once again ""dangerous weapons are putting our citizens in harm\'s way."" \n \n Calling the shooting an ""evil anti-Semitic attack,"" Trump ordered flags at federal buildings throughout the U.S. to be flown at half-staff in respect for the victims. He said he planned to travel to Pittsburgh, but offered no details. \n \n In the city, thousands gathered for a vigil Saturday night. Some blamed the slaughter on the nation\'s political climate. \n \n ""When you spew hate speech, people act on it. Very simple. And this is the result. A lot of people dead. Senselessly,"" said Stephen Cohen, co-president of New Light Congregation, which rents space at Tree of Life. \n \n The shooting raised immediate alarm in Jewish communities around the country. Authorities in New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Philadelphia and other cities sent extra patrols to synagogues and other houses of worship. \n \n Little was known about Bowers, who had no apparent criminal record but who is believed to have expressed virulently anti-Semitic views on social media. Authorities said it appears he acted alone. \n \n Worshippers ""were brutally murdered by a gunman targeting them simply because of their faith,"" said Bob Jones, head of the FBI\'s Pittsburgh office, though he cautioned the shooter\'s full motive was not yet known. \n \n Scott Brady, the chief federal prosecutor in western Pennsylvania, pledged that ""justice in this case will be swift and it will be severe."" \n \n It wasn\'t clear if Bowers had an attorney to speak on his behalf. \n \n The gunman targeted a building that housed three separate congregations, all of which were conducting Sabbath services when the attack began just before 10 a.m. in the tree-lined residential neighborhood of Squirrel Hill, about 10 minutes from downtown Pittsburgh and the hub of Pittsburgh\'s Jewish community. \n \n The synagogue door was unlocked on the Sabbath ""because people are coming for services, and the bell would be ringing constantly. So they do not lock the door, and anybody can just walk in,"" said Marilyn Honigsberg, administrative assistant for New Light. ""And that\'s what this man did."" \n \n Michael Eisenberg, the immediate past president of the Tree of Life, said synagogue officials had not gotten any threats that he knew of before the shooting. But he said security was a concern, and the synagogue had started working to improve it. \n \n ""You know, you\'re always worried that something would happen,"" said Myron Snider, head of the cemetery committee for New Light. Snider just got out of the hospital on Thursday and missed Saturday\'s service. \n \n ""But you never dream that it would happen like this,"" Snider added. ""Just never ever dream that it would happen like this."" \n \n Zachary Weiss, 26, said his father, 60-year-old Stephen Weiss, was inside the synagogue but was unharmed. Weiss said his father told him that he and Tree of Life\'s rabbi helped congregants take shelter and follow the active shooter response training they\'d received months earlier. Stephen Weiss made it out of the building and used a janitor\'s cellphone to call his family at home. \n \n The attack, his son vowed, ""will not define our congregation and will not define our city."" \n \n ___ \n \n Breed reported from Raleigh, North Carolina, and Lauer reported from Philadelphia. Contributing to this report were Associated Press writers Mark Gillispie and Gene Puskar in Pittsburgh, Eric Tucker and Michael Balsamo in Washington, Marc Levy in Harrisburg, Michael Kunzelman in Silver Spring, Maryland, and Michael Rubinkam in northeastern Pennsylvania. \n \n ___ \n \n For AP\'s complete coverage of the Pittsburgh synagogue shootings: https://www.apnews.com/Shootings']",2,"– The Anti-Defamation League says the shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh is thought to be the deadliest attack specifically targeting Jews ever in the US—by far. CNN reports the previous attack to have that label occurred in 1985, when Seattle lawyer Charles Goldmark, his wife, and two sons were killed. (The Washington Post notes it ""was actually a case of mistaken religious identity,"" as the family was not Jewish.) The toll in Saturday's shooting stands at 11. The AP reports police on Sunday said the victims were eight men and three women. In an arrest affidavit made public, police say that while treating alleged shooter Robert Gregory Bowers for injuries he sustained after being shot by police, he said Jews were ""committing genocide to his people"" and that he wanted them all to die. The AP separately reports on a ""vulnerability"" the shooter took advantage of: an unlocked door. While the Tree of Life synagogue required guests to ring a bell to gain access during the week, on the Jewish Sabbath the building was open to all guests for Shabbat services. The Post quotes the FBI special agent in charge as saying it was ""the most horrific crime scene I’ve seen in 22 years."" Federal hate crime charges were filed against Bowers on Saturday: 29 charges in all, including 11 counts of using a firearm to commit murder. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reports Pittsburgh police also filed charges on Saturday: 11 counts of criminal homicide, six counts of attempted homicide, six counts of aggravated assault, and 13 counts of ethnic intimidation.

There is a second location with eyes on with all the right equipment to capture exactly what the shot was,"" another military source said. \n \n A military insider told The Globe: ""This is an incredible feat. It is a world record that might never be equalled."" \n \n The world record was previously held by British sniper Craig Harrison, who shot a Taliban gunner with a 338 Lapua Magnum rifle from 2,475 metres away in 2009. \n \n Previously, Canadian Corporal Rob Furlong had set the world record in 2002 at 2,430 metres when he gunned down an Afghan insurgent carrying an RPK machine gun during Operation Anaconda. \n \n Weeks before, Canadian Master Cpl. Arron Perry briefly held the world\'s best sniper record after he fatally shot an insurgent at 2,310 metres during the same operation. Both soldiers were members of the 3rd Battalion Princess Patricia\'s Canadian Light Infantry. \n \n JTF2 special forces are primarily tasked with counterterrorism, sniper operations and hostage rescue. Much of the information about this elite organization is classified and not commented on by the government. The unit\'s snipers and members of Canadian Special Operations Regiment, who are carrying out the main task of training Kurdish forces, have been operating in tough conditions in Iraq. \n \n Story continues below advertisement \n \n The Trudeau government pulled CF-18 fighter jets out of Iraq in 2016 but expanded the military mission, which will see the number of Canadian special forces trainers climb to 207 from 69 in an assist, train and advise mission. Canadian commandos are not supposed to be involved in direct combat, but are authorized to go up to the front lines on training missions with Kurdish Peshmerga fighters and to paint targets for coalition air strikes. \n \n For operational security reasons, sources would not reveal the names of the elite Canadian sniper and his partner, nor the location where the action took place. \n \n A sniper and his observer partner are often sent to remote and dangerous locations to hunt down insurgents while having to carry heavy equipment. Once they have located the target, snipers follow the same methodical approach before each shot. Breathe in, out, in, out, find a natural pause and then squeeze the trigger. \n \n Canada has a reputation among Western military forces for the quality of its snipers, despite the small size of the Canadian Armed Forces compared to the United States and Britain. \n \n ""Canada has a world-class sniper system.

And from that distance you actually have to account for the curvature of the Earth."" \n \n U.S. Sergeant Bryan Kremer has the longest confirmed sniper kill shot by a U.S. soldier. He killed an Iraqi insurgent with his Barrett M82A1 rifle at 2,300 metres in 2004.', 'The distances are mind-boggling: in 2002, Master Cpl. Arron Perry from the Princess Patricia’s Canadian Light Infantry took aim at an Afghan insurgent from a distance of 2,300 metres and hit his target, setting the world record for the longest confirmed kill shot in military history. Not long after, Cpl. Rob Furlong, in the same operation, bested his brother-in-arms with a confirmed kill at 2,430 metres. His record would stand longer, until 2009, when a British sniper, Craig Harrison, made a shot from 2,475 metres. \n \n On June 21, Harrison’s record was shattered by another Canadian, an elite special forces sniper, who, according to the Canadian military, killed an ISIS fighter in Mosul from an incredible 3,540 metres. \n \n Let’s put that in perspective: if you stacked six CN Towers end to end, you would still be more than 200 metres short. The bullet, according to military experts, would have travelled for nearly 10 seconds before hitting its target. The shooter not only would have had to take into consideration wind conditions, but at that distance, also the curvature of the earth. \n \n More astonishing, perhaps, is the fact that over the last 15 years, the active-combat sniping record has been broken four times, and three of those have been by Canadians. \n \n That’s no coincidence, says Furlong, who now runs a marksmanship academy in Edmonton. \n \n “I’ve been saying this forever,” he tells Maclean’s by telephone. “Canadian snipers are the best in the world. The sniper training program has been around for a long time. It’s the foundation, and it’s been retooled from lessons learned in Afghanistan. We’ve built it to be the best.” \n \n This latest record, Furlong adds, has taken sniping “to a different level.” Canadian snipers are considered some of the best in the world in part because they are not simply taught to hit their targets. Like much of the Canadian military, many are trained with skills above their existing rank, in the sniper’s case as Unit Master Snipers, meaning they have the skills to design and run complex operations if the need ever arises. That in itself may not make them better snipers but the gestalt of sniper-training and command-thinking combined could explain their skill. \n \n The practice of equipping soldiers with more than the skills they will need on the battlefield has served the Canadian military well. In Afghanistan, the results were clear. Maclean’s witnessed firsthand how soldiers out on patrol, sometimes for days in enemy territory, operated as closely knit teams. Command decisions were made with input from different ranks, offering multiple perspectives to patrol commanders. \n \n The level of training Canada provides its soldiers, particularly its elite JTF2 commandos, is the driving force behind Canada’s reputation for fielding a highly skilled and intellectually capable military. \n \n “This is a very important point,” says Chris Kilford, a retired Canadian artillery officer and now a fellow at the Queen’s University Centre for International and Defence Policy. “I have been very impressed with the young people in our special forces that I have interacted with overseas. Corporals and master corporals: bright and articulate. I also think that in general our people are often capable of working at a higher level than the rank on their shoulder.” \n \n Furlong agrees, adding that Canadian soldiers are more “cross-trained” than many other soldiers in the world, and Canada’s snipers specifically are given every opportunity to pursue leadership training that refines their mental capabilities, a key component to the psychologically demanding job they do. \n \n Still, there are the naysayers. Warrant Officer Oliver Cromwell, an instructor at the infantry school at CFB Gagetown in New Brunswick* who has taught sniper courses, cautions that more information is needed before the 3,450 meter distance is confirmed. \n \n “There is a difference between slant angle range and true range,” he says. “Slant angle range—if the shooter is at an elevated position relative to the target—may appear longer that the true range, sometimes twice the true distance. I don’t want to be a naysayer but those are just the facts.” \n \n Some online message boards have have also questioned the validity of the new record. In one case a contributor to a military discussion suggested the sniper likely fired into a crowd of ISIS fighters and happened to hit one. \n \n But Furlong points out that these types of distances, 3,000 metres and more, are regularly achieved on the shooting range. \n \n “It’s not an impossible distance,” he says. “The difference is between a shooting range and a battlefield. They are two completely different environments. The pressure these guys are under is huge. So to the naysayers I would just say, this can be done.” \n \n As for the men who accomplished it—snipers work in pairs, including a spotter—Furlong says they probably didn’t realize what they had done until later. “When we broke the record, we didn’t know until we got back to base,” he says. “To be honest, I didn’t really care, neither when I broke it or when mine was broken. Records are made to be broken.” \n \n Still, unless there are major advances in equipment, Furlong adds, this one should stand for a long time. \n \n CORRECTION, June 29, 2017: This story originally stated the location of CFB Gagetown.

But ""at the end of the day, long-range shooting, it\'s your best guess."" \n \n ""There\'s so much that goes into this, but at the same time, when you\'re in that environment, operating in that way, a lot of these things become second nature,"" Mitic said in an interview with CBC News. \n \n Jody Mitic, a former Canadian Forces sniper and now an Ottawa city councillor, says a long-distance shot must take many factors into consideration, and even then \'It\'s your best guess.\' (CBC) \n \n Mitic, who was badly injured by a land mine in Afghanistan in 2007, expects the sniper team would have been working in the area for a while and would have known the conditions and terrain extremely well. He said teams like this have long been a vital part of Canada\'s military operations. \n \n ""We\'re called \'force multipliers,\'"" Mitic said. \n \n ""If you have a well-trained, well-equipped group of snipers in an area, that frees up about a hundred other troops to go and do other things."" \n \n Canadian sniper history \n \n Canadians have held the record for longest kill shot before. \n \n Former corporal Rob Furlong shot a Taliban fighter in Afghanistan in 2002 from a distance of 2,430 metres. He broke the record set just a few days earlier by another Canadian, former master corporal Aaron Perry, who shot an insurgent from a distance of 2,286 metres. \n \n The history of snipers in the Canadian military goes back much further. Cpl. Francis Pegahmagabow, an Ojibwa member of the 1st Canadian Infantry Battalion, was the deadliest sniper of the First World War, with a record of 378 kills.

Jonathan Vance revealed Canadian troops were operating inside Mosul. \n \n In a statement confirming the sniper\'s successful shot, the Canadian Forces insisted its mission in Iraq is still to merely ""advise and assist"" Iraqi forces. \n \n ""This takes the form of advice in planning for their operations and assistance to defeat Daesh [ISIS] through the use of coalition resources,"" the statement said.']",3,"– An amazing, if grisly, feat continues to resonate after a report in Thursday's Globe and Mail of Toronto. The newspaper, quoting military sources, says a Canadian sniper in Iraq killed an ISIS militant from the mind-boggling distance of 3,540 meters, or 2.2 miles. The Canadian military has not confirmed what would be the longest kill shot by a sniper in history, but the story has in the meantime drawn attention to something else: the remarkable prowess of Canadian snipers in general. Some coverage: The training: If confirmed, that means the sniper record has been broken four times in the last 15 years, three of those times by Canadians, notes Maclean's magazine. One reason, it says, is because Canadian snipers ""are not simply taught to hit their targets."" The training goes beyond their shooting duties, making sure they're able to ""design and run complex operations"" if necessary. ""That in itself may not make them better snipers but the gestalt of sniper-training and command-thinking combined could explain their skill."" Long history: The CBC examines the history of Canada's military marksmanship, noting that Cpl. Francis Pegahmagabow of the 1st Canadian Infantry Battalion had 378 kills, making him deadliest sniper of World War I. A military historian says the skill carried into WWII. ""The best snipers were usually country boys who knew how to hunt."" Official statement: The Canadian military has not confirmed the kill, but it did confirm the shot. ""A member of the Joint Task Force 2 successfully hit a target from 3,540 meters,"" it says in an email to NPR, adding that it won't divulge further details for troop safety. Really? The Globe and Mail says the shot was verified by video and data, but that hasn't emerged yet, and some are skeptical. The Washington Post talks to former US snipers who say that even seeing a human target would be difficult from that distance, even with advanced scopes. A theory floated by a former Marine shooter: ""A spotter with an advanced optical device was able to verbally walk the sniper onto the target and correct his aim.” Yes: Canadian Cpl. Rob Furlong, who once held the record himself at 2,430 meters, counters the skeptics: “It’s not an impossible distance,” he says. “So to the naysayers I would just say, this can be done.” It's a ""hell of a shot,"" adds former Canadian sniper Jody Mitic, who was written a book called, of course, Unflinching: The Making of a Canadian Sniper. A critic: In a post at Stuff.co.nz, John Edens thinks the shot was possible, given high-tech gizmos to account for everything from wind speed to the curvature of the earth. Plus, the gun used, a McMillan TAC-50 rifle, employs a 50-caliber bullet the size of a ""large cigar."" His beef, though, is with media coverage that he thinks glorifies war.

A 2-year-old Chinese boy stuck a chopstick in his nose last year and it penetrated three inches into his brain. Doctors spent four hours carefully removing it. Also, last year a 12-year-old Chinese boy was running across a school playground when he fell over onto a pair of chopsticks in his hand.

Ulbricht, 29, collected tens of millions of dollars in commissions, investigators said, and twice ordered people killed in a bid to protect his empire. \n \n LATEST SFGATE VIDEOS Now Playing: Now Playing Audio: Southwest Flight 1380 emergency landing via Broadcastify \n \n Warriors prepare for Game 2 against the San Antonio Spurs San Francisco Chronicle \n \n NBA Playoffs Game 2 – Getting Ready Scott Strazzante / The Chronicle \n \n NBA Playoffs Game 2 – Fans Jessica Christian / The Chronicle \n \n Time lapse of Salesforce Tower being built Alex Orellana \n \n 3821 Alemany Blvd San Francisco CA San Francisco Chronicle \n \n Hailstorm strikes Oakland and East Bay Twitter \n \n Klay Thompson San Francisco Chronicle \n \n Motorists drive through hailstorm in Oakland Twitter / @taibori \n \n 3239A Louise Street Oakland Presented By Daniel Winkler San Francisco Chronicle \n \n The Texas native and San Francisco transplant didn\'t resist as he was taken into custody Tuesday at the Glen Park library branch, officials said. \n \n In a complaint filed in New York and a parallel grand jury indictment handed down in Maryland, federal prosecutors accused him of charges including narcotics trafficking, money laundering and attempting to murder a witness. \n \n They said his business, while operating in a dark corner of the Internet, was penetrated by undercover agents. \n \n The FBI said Ulbricht ran Silk Road from San Francisco, where he had been living for the past year, including at a cafe not far from his former Hayes Valley home. Since at least 2011, authorities said, he had facilitated the sale of heroin, cocaine and other drugs as ""Dread Pirate Roberts"" - a reference to a character in the film ""The Princess Bride"" who turns out to be not one man but rather a series of men passing down the title. \n \n Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., who in 2011 asked federal agents to take down the site after it began to get media attention, applauded the arrest. \n \n ""Sayonara to Silk Road,"" Schumer said. ""The country is safer now that this open market for lawbreaking has been shuttered."" \n \n Change in goals \n \n Ulbricht has in the past railed against government control. After studying solar cells as a graduate student in Pennsylvania, he wrote on his LinkedIn profile that his goals had changed. \n \n ""The most widespread and systemic use of force is amongst institutions and governments, so this is my current point of effort,"" he said. ""I am creating an economic simulation to give people a first-hand experience of what it would be like to live in a world without the systemic use of force."" \n \n That simulation, the government alleged, is Silk Road. \n \n Federal authorities had seized the website by the time Ulbricht appeared Wednesday in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, where he was remanded into custody pending a hearing Friday. His attorney declined to comment. \n \n Undercover buys \n \n The charges were the result of an investigation during which law-enforcement officials made more than 100 undercover purchases of drugs from Silk Road vendors from 10 countries, authorities said. The site itself didn\'t sell drugs, but connected sellers with buyers, who would generally ship items through the mail. \n \n FBI Special Agent Christopher Tarbell described the website in an affidavit as a ""sprawling black-market bazaar."" Users could only access Silk Road using the Tor network - technology that was first developed by the U.S. Navy and conceals communications. Tor browser software can be downloaded for free on the Internet. \n \n To pay for items, buyers used Bitcoins, an anonymous digital currency with no central bank or authority. Bitcoins - whose value plunged after news spread of Ulbricht\'s arrest - aren\'t illegal and are used in many legitimate ways, but the FBI noted that they\'ve been used by ""cyber-criminals for money-laundering purposes."" \n \n The Silk Road site had many of the trappings of popular online retail sites, like user comments, which sought to ward off shady dealers and undercover cops. It featured wares like ""amphetamine paste"" and ""high quality #4 heroin."" One commenter wrote after making a purchase that he ""had to snort almost triple the amount of this new stuff to get where I was with the old."" \n \n $1.2 billion in sales \n \n Over the past two years, Silk Road had been used by ""several thousand drug dealers and other unlawful vendors"" to sell ""hundreds of kilograms"" of illegal drugs, generating the Bitcoin equivalent of $1.2 billion in sales and $80 million in commissions, Tarbell wrote. At one point, Ulbricht hid behind the username ""altoid"" to marvel about Silk Road, describing it as an ""anonymous Amazon.com,"" investigators said. \n \n Authorities also alleged that Ulbricht sought to use violence to protect his domain. \n \n The Maryland grand jury indictment said a federal agent began communicating with Ulbricht in April 2012 while posing as a drug smuggler. Then in January, prosecutors said, Ulbricht paid the agent $80,000 to torture and kill a Silk Road employee who had stolen Bitcoins and had been arrested, prompting fears he would become a government witness. \n \n Ulbricht allegedly wrote to the agent that he had ""never killed a man or had one killed before, but it is the right move in this case."" \n \n In February, the agent sent staged photographs of the employee being tortured and a picture of the purported dead body, prosecutors said. \n \n Another try \n \n They said they found out later that Ulbricht soon sought to kill again. In March, Tarbell wrote, Ulbricht offered $150,000 to a Silk Road user ""to execute a murder-for-hire of another Silk Road user, who was threatening to release the identities of thousands of users of the site"" unless he was given $500,000. \n \n ""I wouldn\'t mind if he was executed,"" Ulbricht allegedly wrote. \n \n Ulbricht was again given a picture of the purportedly dead victim, a resident of British Columbia, but there were no reports of anyone having been killed there, the FBI said. \n \n ""Your problem has been taken care of,"" the reported hit man wrote in a message to Ulbricht, authorities said. ""Rest easy though, because he won\'t be blackmailing anyone again. Ever."" \n \n Ulbricht ""has acted as a law unto himself in deciding how to deal with problems affecting Silk Road, and that he has been willing to pursue violent means when he deems that the problem calls for it,"" Tarbell wrote. \n \n San Francisco operation \n \n Authorities said they identified Ulbricht by tracing his online activity. They said that in June he was living with a friend on Hickory Street in San Francisco\'s Hayes Valley, just 500 feet from an Internet cafe on Laguna Street ""from which someone logged into a server used to administer the Silk Road website."" \n \n By July, he had moved to 15th Street in San Francisco, where U.S. Department of Homeland Security agents visited him to see why a package for him that they had intercepted contained nine fake identification documents, all with his picture on it, authorities said. \n \n Ulbricht refused to discuss the counterfeit papers, the affidavit said, but ""volunteered that \'hypothetically\' anyone could go onto a website named \'Silk Road\' on \'Tor\' and purchase any drugs or fake identity documents the person wanted.""', 'The owner of the underground drug market Silk Road was a 29-year-old Libertarian engineer living in San Francisco raking in over $80 million in 2 years, according to the indictment revealed today. Who is the man behind the biggest underground drug market, and how did he get caught? The indictment lays out a detailed account of how Silk Road grew and how FBI agent Christopher Tarbell took it down. \n \n According to the indictment, Silk Road was bigger than anyone had suspected: It boasted over $1.6 billion in sales from 2011-2013, which resulted in $80 million in commissions. (Researchers had previously estimated that Silk Road was doing about $22 million in total sales per year.) According to the indictment, which claims that FBI agents obtained a mirror of the server that housed Silk Road\'s business from law enforcement in an unidentified foreign country, Ulbricht ""alone has controlled the massive profits generated from the operation of the business."" He used some of the profits to pay a team of administrators as much as $2,000 a week each. And yet, he only paid $1,000 a month in rent for his San Francisco apartment, according to the indictment. \n \n The most bizarre and spectacular allegation in the indictment is that Ulbricht solicited a murder-for-hire against a Silk Road user who was attempting to blackmail him. The user, FriendlyChemist, told Ulbricht—whose alleged online persona was ""Dread Pirate Roberts,"" or DPR, a reference to the film The Princess Bride—that he had obtained a list of thousands of Silk Road users and was going to release them unless DPR paid off his $500,000 debt to another user, RedandWhite. Instead of paying the debt, DPR contacted RedAndWhite and paid him $150,000 in Bitcoins to off Friendly Chemist. \n \n ""In my eyes, FriendlyChemist is a liability and I wouldn\'t mind if he was executed,"" DPR wrote. DPR even tried to bargain down FriendlyChemist, messaging: ""Don\'t want to be a pain here, but the price seems high. Not long ago, I had a clean hit done for $80K."" DPR gave redandwhite the address of FriendlyChemist in British Columbia, and the indictment reports that redandwhite sent back photo evidence of the deed. But according to the indictment there is no indication the hit actually happened—""Although I believe the foregoing exchange demonstrates DPR\'s intention to solicit a murder-for-hire,"" Tarbell wrote, ""I have spoken with Canadian law enforcement authorities, who have no record of there being any Canadian resident with the name DPR passed to redandwhite as the target of the solicited murder-for-hire. Nor do they have any record of a homicide occurring in White Rock, British Columbia on or about March 31, 2013."" \n \n Currently the most-discussed aspect of the case on the Darknet is speculation on how Ulbricht got caught. Silk Road was hosted using the privacy-protecting Tor Network, and its brazen customers believed their digital tracks were hidden. But it appears that Ulbricht was tripped up by some security mistakes while promoting Silk Road in the early days. Tarbell found that the two earliest mentions of Silk Road were forum posts by a user called Altoid on the drug forum Shroomery.org and the semi-official Bitcoin Forum. Both were obvious astroturfing efforts to promote the Silk Road: \n \n ""Has anyone seen Silk Road yet?"" goes one. ""It\'s kind of like an anonymous Amazon.com. I don\'t think they have heroin on there, but they are selling other stuff. Let me know what you guys think."" Altoid was easily connected to Ulbricht by a post on the Bitcoin forum in which Altoid solicits programming help for a ""venture backed bit coin startup"" using the email address: Rossulbricht@gmail.com. From there, agents surveilled Ulbricht in real life and were able to match up his locations to locations used to log into the DPR account. They noticed that both Ulbricht and DPR were fans of the Libertarian Ludwig Von Mises Institute. And a key used to log into Silk Road\'s administrator account was linked to another email address Ulbricht had used. \n \n The feds also managed to gain access to servers belonging to Silk Road. They spied on the traffic in real time, determining that from Feb 2011 to July 2013 there were 2013 1,229,465 transactions on the site, and 957,079 total registered users. This raises the question of exactly how much information they have on Silk Road\'s users, and whether more busts are to come. (Agents made over 100 undercover transactions throughout the investigation, according to the indictment.) \n \n Browsing Ulbricht\'s social media accounts show a pretty normal, nerdy guy. Ulbricht graduated from the University of Texas in 2006 with a degree in Physics and went to the University of Pennsylvania Pennsylvania State University for grad school, where he studied engineering and wrote a master\'s thesis on ""Growth of EuO Thin Films by Molecular Beam Epitaxy."" According to property records, he owned a home in State College, PA, which he sold in 2010 for $187,0000. Curiously, the indictment misidentifies his grad school as the University of Pennsylvania. \n \n He\'s got a Facebook page full of beer pong pics and, of course, was a vocal supporter of Ron Paul, donating $200 to his campaign in 2007. ""He doesn\'t compromise his integrity as a politician and he fights quite diligently to restore the principles that our country was founded on,"" Ulbricht told the Penn State student newspaper in 2008. \n \n Last year in a YouTube video for the storytelling project StoryCorps with his friend Rene Pinnell. Pinnell, speaking to the Verge, was adamant about his friend\'s innocence: ""I don\'t know how they messed it up and I don\'t know how they got Ross wrapped into this, but I\'m sure it\'s not him,"" he said.']",2,"– Alleged Silk Road mastermind Ross Ulbricht was no ordinary drug boss—he paid $1,000 a month for a San Francisco apartment he shared with two roommates, used an alias from the Princess Bride, and was arrested in the sci-fi section of his public library. But the FBI says the 29-year-old not only raked in around $80 million from his online drug marketplace's $1.6 billion turnover over two years, he ordered at least two killings to protect his operation, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. The FBI says Ulbricht, aka ""Dread Pirate Roberts,"" was provided with a photo of the supposed victim in one killing he ordered but there's no indication the killing actually took place. The other hit man he tried to hire was an undercover agent. Ulbricht, a Texas native, appears to be a ""normal, nerdy guy"" in his social media postings, Gawker finds. He went to grad school at Pennsylvania State University, where he studied solar cells. On his LinkedIn profile, he complained about government control and said his goals had changed after graduation. ""The most widespread and systemic use of force is amongst institutions and governments, so this is my current point of effort,"" he wrote. ""I am creating an economic simulation to give people a first-hand experience of what it would be like to live in a world without the systemic use of force."""
237,"['Officer Lameen Barnes prepared the official incident report that night on what happened to Mr. Dixon, writing that he had tried to throw an “unknown liquid substance” at the officers, and in response, they had searched his cell for contraband. When they entered, the report said, Mr. Dixon refused to come out, insulted them and would not follow their orders. He was restrained and handcuffed to a gurney. \n \n “Once on his feet, inmate Dixon was eventually escorted to the main clinic for medical examination without any further incident of force used,” Mr. Barnes wrote. \n \n That is nothing like what actually happened, according to accounts from three people who were there. Two requested anonymity because they said they feared retaliation from officers as well as their employer, Corizon, which has a contract with the city to provide health care at the jail. For the third witness, The Times was provided a copy of the clinician’s email to superiors about the incident, on the condition that the sender’s name be withheld. \n \n According to their accounts, a group of correction officers wheeled Mr. Dixon into an examination area without a security camera. “Don’t leave me,” he kept yelling to the medics and social workers. “They’re going to kill me.” \n \n About a half-dozen guards were crowded around the gurney, and one kept punching Mr. Dixon in the head. \n \n Next, the correction officers brought in Mr. Lane, who had also splashed guards with a liquid. Mr. Lane was known as a disruptive inmate. He had been in and out of Rikers, and much of his most recent stint had been spent in solitary confinement. Born to a mother who was a crack addict, he spent most of his time growing up in foster homes and had a lengthy history of mental health problems, with diagnoses for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression and attention deficit disorder. \n \n “They punched me in the face and they kept punching me and punching me and punching me,” Mr. Lane recalled in an interview at Elmira Correctional Facility, where he recently completed a two-year sentence for a credit card theft conviction.', ""Sen.

Four percent of voters favor a different candidate and 21 percent remain undecided. \n \n The survey comes as O'Rourke continues to gain momentum in his quest to unseat Cruz. \n \n ADVERTISEMENT \n \n While Texas has not elected a Democrat to the Senate in three decades, polls continue to show that the race between O'Rourke and Cruz will be tight.

According to the survey, the three-term congressman is viewed favorably by 37 percent of registered voters. \n \n O'Rourke leads Cruz among voters in the 18–34 and 35–54 age ranges. On the other hand, Cruz has the advantage among voters between 55 and 74 and over the age of 75. \n \n The Emerson College survey was conducted from Aug. 22 to 25 among a population of 550 voters. The margin of error is 4.4 percentage points.""]",2,"– Guards at Rikers Island don't just neglect the mentally ill or let them bake to death, they also routinely brutally beat them, often without suffering any repercussions, a New York Times investigation has discovered. The Times uncovered a secret report compiled by a city department this year that found that 129 Rikers inmates suffered ""serious injuries"" in altercations with staff members over an 11-month span last year; 77% of those inmates had a mental health diagnosis. In most cases, the inmates were beaten while handcuffed. The Times investigated the incidents individually, and offer some disturbing details: When guards found Jose Bautista trying to hang himself, they saved him, but then allegedly threw him to the ground and punched him with such force that they perforated his bowel. It was one of five beatings noted in the report that followed a suicide attempt. Bautista needed emergency surgery, but guards took nine hours to drive him to the hospital—which is only 15 minutes away. When Andre Lane threw water or urine at guards, they allegedly handcuffed him to a gurney, wheeled him to a clinic that wasn't monitored by security cameras, and beat him so violently that the walls and cabinets were covered with his blood. After Brian Mack complained that guards were stealing inmates' food, a guard captain allegedly hit him in the eye with his radio, while another officer punched him in the jaw. He came away with a broken eye socket and jaw. Correction officials said he'd been in a fight with another inmate, but investigators noted no such fight was logged in prison records. None of the guards involved in any of the cases have faced criminal charges—or even administrative ones. Rikers has been under pressure to reform its treatment of mentally ill inmates—in January, for example, it announced it would stop putting the ""seriously mentally ill"" in solitary, though the Times notes that classification applies to a small segment of the population. Last week an oversight board said the newly-appointed city jail commissioner had in June illegally sent as many as 47 mentally ill Rikers inmates to solitary without consulting clinicians, the AP reports."
238,"['His grandfather had lovingly given him his name, hoping that one day he would grow up into a ‘positive’ human being. Some 25 years later, the marine engineer from Jamshedpur in Jharkhand is despondent on being forced to bear the burden of his name. \n \n Two years after passing out as a marine engineer from Tamil Nadu’s Noorul Islam University, Saddam Hussain says he has failed to find a job because of his namesake: the former Iraqi ruler executed in 2006. Saddam Hussein was a dictator blamed for atrocities on his subjects until toppled by the US in 2003. \n \n “People are scared to hire me,” laments Jamshedpur’s Saddam. His job application has been rejected each of the 40-odd times he has appeared for interviews with multinational shipping companies. His batchmates around the world have secured employment, but Saddam remains unemployed despite ranking second in his batch of 2014. \n \n For the initial six months, Saddam was unable to decipher why he was being rejected. “I then inquired with the HR departments of the companies and some of them told me my name was the problem,” he recounts. He was told that having a crew member with a name that arouses instant suspicion could be an operational nightmare. \n \n A top executive of Delhi-based TeamLease Services, a leading recruitment consultant, agrees. “If the issue involves crossing the borders, then nothing can be done as border patrol and airport authorities are very process-driven and if there is a red flag, they will check out. If the person’s job involves frequent travel abroad, he might just keep getting stuck or the company has to pull him out of the sticky situation, making the hire cumbersome,” he points out. \n \n “Even Shah Rukh Khan gets detained at US airports. What is this Saddam in comparision?” he asks. \n \n Getting rid of the name is proving to be a bigger nightmare. \n \n Once it hit him that his name was the impediment, Saddam legally got his name changed into Sajid and procured all relevant documents, including passport, voter ID and driving licence, under the name. \n \n But his woes did not end there. \n \n Prospective employers ask for his educational certificates, but his university has refused to change the name until he got his Class 10 and 12 exam certificates changed first. He approached the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) for a name change, but the authorities have not acted yet. \n \n Driven to desperation, Saddam, now Sajid, moved the Jharkhand high court with a plea to direct the CBSE to change his name. But since unscrupulous people often abuse the system by frequently changing names, the court acted with caution. Last week, it set the date for a considered hearing on May 5. \n \n Saddam remains fond of his grandfather, though he feels he is paying for his folly. As one by one his batchmates set sail after securing jobs, Saddam is left to spend sleepless nights. “I am an innocent victim of somebody else’s crimes,” he says. \n \n First Published: Mar 21, 2017 07:52 IST', 'Image copyright AP Image caption Saddam may no longer be around, but many of his namesakes do not have an easy time \n \n More than 10 years after being executed, Saddam Hussein remains a huge presence in the life of one man. \n \n The marine engineer in India does not blame his grandfather for giving him the Iraqi dictator\'s name 25 years ago. \n \n But after being refused a job some 40-odd times, he has concluded employers are loath to hire him - even if his name is marginally different - spelt Hussain, not Hussein. \n \n So he went to court to become Sajid. But the wheels of bureaucracy are turning slowly - and so is his search for a job. \n \n It may never have opened many doors in India - and has raised eyebrows and grins elsewhere - but one thing was guaranteed: a name like Saddam Hussain was not likely to pass unnoticed. \n \n Two years after graduating from Tamil Nadu\'s Noorul Islam University, the man from Jamshedpur in Jharkhand is feeling the strain. \n \n He did well at college, and his classmates have already found jobs, but shipping companies turn him away. \n \n ""People are scared to hire me,"" Saddam-turned-Sajid is quoted by Hindustan Times as saying. \n \n He says they fear complications from an encounter with immigration officials across international borders. \n \n Saddam thought he might easily get around this obstacle, by getting a new passport, driving licence and more. \n \n But his job applications are still not proceeding smoothly as he cannot provide proof, under his new name, that he went to school - and this is proving to be a time-consuming exercise. \n \n Another court hearing beckons on 5 May, this time to force authorities to change the name on his secondary school certificates, after which his graduation papers will need amending. \n \n Sajid is not alone in his plight - but he may feel more aggrieved than the numerous Saddam Husseins of Iraq, who feel cursed with a name that was originally given in tribute to a leader whose legacy is one of a brutal dictator. \n \n Being Saddam in Iraq \n \n One Saddam, a journalist working in Ramadi, a Sunni city in the desert province of Anbar, said his father was fired from his government job because he could not convince his superiors he was not a member of the dictator\'s Ba\'ath party. \n \n He had named his son Saddam, after all - what greater allegiance could he have shown to the ousted president, they argued. \n \n Others had more terrifying stories - one said he was captured by a Shia militia, set down on his knees and had the barrel of a gun placed against the back of his head. Somehow, thanks to sheer luck, the weapon jammed, and the militia eventually released him. \n \n One friend told me how, as a Kurdish schoolchild in Baghdad, he had known a fellow classmate named Saddam Hussein. \n \n While playing football with the boy, they would often shout at him: ""It is not only us who hate you, the entire country hates you."" \n \n Read Prashant Rao\'s BBC article']",2,"– Saddam Hussain's name is making it difficult for him to get a job. ""People are scared to hire me,"" the 25-year-old Indian marine engineer tells the Hindustan Times. Hussain was, yes, named for that Saddam Hussein; the name was given to him by his grandfather. It turned out to be a poor choice, as the young man has been unable to find a job since graduating university two years ago, despite having done very well in school. And he's applied for dozens of positions. He says he's spoken with some of the HR departments of companies he's applied with, and they told him his name was the problem, because it could cause ""suspicion."" One recruitment expert points out that this would be a problem especially if a job requires travel abroad, during which he might get stopped by airport or border authorities: ""He might just keep getting stuck or the company has to pull him out of the sticky situation, making the hire cumbersome,"" the expert says. Hussain got his first name legally changed to Sajid, but though he got all his official documents changed to reflect his new name, his original name still poses a problem because it's listed on educational certificates, which prospective employers want to see. He's working on getting those certificates changed as well, but the process is moving slowly, the BBC reports. (Meanwhile, in America, a guy is trying to change his name to Hitler.)"
239,"[""SOCHI, RUSSIA -- Three points from Portugal and Spain's remarkable 3-3 draw at Fisht Stadium in which Cristiano Ronaldo scored a sublime hat-trick. \n \n 1. Ronaldo's three goals earn Portugal a point \n \n For a guy whose deeds are so often defined by numbers, whether it's the fact that he has more goals than games for Real Madrid or the fact that nobody has more Ballon d'Or awards stashed away in his trophy cabinet, there was one that seemed out of sync before this World Cup began: three, as in the number of goals that Cristiano Ronaldo had scored in the World Cup to date. \n \n Yet he remedied that perceived dearth against Spain Friday, nabbing a hat-trick in a 3-3 draw to open their World Cup campaign. The first was a penalty he won himself, his nifty stopover prompting Nacho to dangle a leg over which Ronaldo gleefully fell. The second was a gift from David De Gea, who pushed his edge-of-the-box snap shot over the goal line, though again, there's something to be said for Ronaldo's alertness on the break that he was there to capitalize on Goncalo Guedes' layoff following Pepe's defensive clearance. The third was a magisterial free kick that disappeared into the top corner, leaving De Gea flat-footed. \n \n Ronaldo joins Miroslav Klose, Uwe Seeler and Pele as the only players who have scored in four World Cups. He also becomes the oldest player to score a hat-trick in World Cup history, at 33 years and 131 days. And he equals the legendary Ferenc Puskas, the most prolific European-born international goalscorer in history and the second most-prolific overall.

ADRIAN DENNIS/AFP/Getty Images) \n \n 2. Diego Costa's heroics stand out for Spain \n \n He has, at times, looked like a foreign object in a Spain shirt. Even as Julen Lopetegui's side romped through qualification to the World Cup, Diego Costa managed just nine appearances, lasting 90 minutes on just three occasions. But against Portugal he showed just how much value there is in him being so different. \n \n The first goal was vintage Costa: the angry forearm clear-out on Pepe, the deceptively quick legs to send Jose Fonte the wrong way, the threaded smash between two opponents. The second carried his hallmark too, as he used his physicality and hunger to get to the ball first and nudge it past Rui Patricio. The rest was selflessness, sacrifice and running battles with Pepe and Fonte, but always on the right side of VAR. \n \n Just what Spain needed. \n \n 3. A fair result for both teams \n \n The table shows Iran leading the group following their late 1-0 win against Morocco. But beyond the drama of a see-saw game -- one of the best group openers we've seen in a long time -- and the fact that they are two points off the top, there are positive takeaways for both teams. \n \n Spain ultimately controlled much of the game and can chalk up two of the goals conceded to uncharacteristic individual errors. There's some tweaking to be done but the post-Lopetegui meltdown simply didn't materialize. \n \n As for Portugal, it was always going to be a dog-fight of a group. But a point against Spain is a massive boost ahead of their next game, coming against a Morocco side already with their backs to the wall."", ""Published on Jun 15, 2018 \n \n The FIFA World Cup™ Goal of the Day, sponsored by Powerade. \n \n \n \n SUBSCRIBE to get the latest FOX Soccer content: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSOCCER \n \n \n \n ►Top 100 World Cup Moments: https://foxs.pt/Top100WorldCupMoments \n \n ►2018 FIFA World Cup™ - Everything You Need to Know: \n \n https://foxs.pt/2018FIFAWorldCup101 \n \n ►Champions League Highlights 2017-18: http://foxs.pt/FOXSOCCERChampionsLeague \n \n ►Bundesliga Highlights & Features 2017-18: http://foxs.pt/FOXSOCCERBundesliga \n \n \n \n About FOX Soccer: \n \n With exclusive highlights, original programming, and behind the scenes footage, FOX Soccer’s YouTube channel provides the sports content that fans are hungry for.

The cockroach also had a narrow body and wings, elongated legs and mouthparts, and an extra set of modified eyes located on the top of its head, which likely helped it spot predators, such as the feathered dinosaurs living at the time. \n \n This little monster was a solitary hunter \n \n The cockroach was found preserved in amber by German researcher Ziggi Ellenberger in modern day Myanmar. \n \n At first, scientists thought the cockroach might have been a mantis. \n \n But an examination by Dr Peter Vršanský, from the Geological Institute of Bratislava and the Slovak Academy of Sciences revealed it to be something different. “After the first look I knew it was something new,” he told BBC Earth. “Nothing similar runs on Earth today.” \n \n Vršanský made the discovery, reported in the journal Geologica Carpathica along with Günter Bechly, from the State Museum of Natural History in Stuttgart, Germany. \n \n They believe the cockroach hunted at night. \n \n “This little monster was a solitary hunter, able to run very fast, with a body unlike the vast majority of cockroaches living today, it posed high above ground, frequently taking flight when necessary, and seizing its prey with strong short spines developed on its extremely long feet,” he adds. \n \n Not all scientists agree on the cockroach’s hunting skills though. Manipulator had long and weak legs, and was unlikely to run fast, says Dr Alexandr Rasnitsyn, a professor from the Palaeontological Institute, at the Russian Academy of Sciences. \n \n He thinks it was more likely to surprise rather than chase its prey, using its long limbs to traverse gaps between forest leaves. \n \n The new discovery in among a number of ancient cockroaches found in Myanmar. \n \n Many were predatory insects that evolved to rule the night. “Especially drastic and brutal were top predatory Raphidiomimidae. Cockroaches with a wingspan up to 20cm and eyes divided into two parts, with gut containing large pieces of demolished insects,” says Vršanský. \n \n Most of these ferocious lineages went extinct, however, with only one lineage surviving today: the praying mantis, which belongs to the same superorder of the cockroaches.', 'Image copyright Samsung Image caption Samsung acknowledges that it uses software that has an impact on its energy efficiency scores \n \n The European Commission says it is ""following up"" two reports that raise concerns that software used in TVs may be skewing their energy rating scores. \n \n One study indicates that some Samsung TVs nearly halve their power consumption when a standardised test is carried out. \n \n Another accuses a different unnamed manufacturer of adjusting the brightness of its sets when they ""recognise"" the test film involved. \n \n Samsung has denied any wrongdoing. \n \n It acknowledged that it used software that altered its televisions\' performance during tests, but said this was the effect of a general energy efficiency feature that came into effect during normal use and had nothing to do with the testing process. \n \n However, one environmental campaign group has likened the accusations to the Volkswagen diesel scandal, in which the German car firm admitted to programming its cars to deliberately cheat emissions tests. \n \n Power drop \n \n Televisions\' energy efficiency ratings are based on the power they use while screening a 10-minute video, which contains a mix of fast and slow-moving content shown at different brightness levels. \n \n Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Manufacturers must carry out a standardised energy efficiency test before they can put their screens on sale \n \n Manufacturers run the test themselves and then file the results.

News of the study was first reported by the Guardian newspaper. \n \n ComplianTV\'s researchers found that the power demands of one of the South Korean firm\'s LCD TVs dropped from 70 watts to about 39 watts within a minute of the test video starting. \n \n ""That\'s not normal, it\'s an anomaly,"" explained Richard Kay, an EST spokesman. \n \n But he added: ""We don\'t have any evidence to back up the accusation that Samsung has a technology to recognise when it is tested."" \n \n Image copyright ComplianTV Image caption This graph shows how the Samsung TV reduced its power requirement shortly after the start of the test \n \n Samsung said it ""firmly rejected"" suggestions that it had designed its TV settings to deliberately produce misleading power performance results. \n \n But it acknowledged that ""motion lighting"" - a feature introduced in 2011 that controls TV screens\' backlights - was causing the discrepancy. \n \n ""It is a standard out-of-the-box feature, which is switched on when the customer takes delivery of their TV, and remains on whenever the customer chooses to watch their TV in standard viewing mode,"" it said in a blog. \n \n ""It is a default setting which works both in the lab and at home; delivering energy savings and helping us to reduce our environmental impact."" \n \n Dimmer picture \n \n The second study was carried out by the Swedish Energy Agency, which wrote to the European Commission to alert it of its findings in January. \n \n The agency has not disclosed which company\'s televisions it tested. \n \n But the BBC understands that sets belonging to a single manufacturer that was not Samsung were judged to ""clearly recognise"" the test film. \n \n ""These displays immediately lower their energy use by adjusting the brightness of the display when the standard film is being run,"" the report concluded. \n \n ""This is a way of avoiding the market surveillance authorities and should be addressed by the Commission."" \n \n \'Brave new world\' \n \n Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A UK watchdog raised concerns about TVs changing their power requirements during tests four years ago \n \n The European Commission said it now planned to explore the two sets of findings. \n \n ""We will follow up both of them,"" Anna-Kaisa Itkonen, spokeswoman for climate action and energy, told the BBC. \n \n ""We will first of all verify if the problem has occurred. If it has we will estimate at what scale and whether the use of alleged defeat devices results in products being tested as compliant when they are in fact not. \n \n ""So, we therefore cannot yet judge the extent of the problem."" \n \n She stressed that at this stage the Commission had not launched a formal investigation. \n \n One campaign group highlighted that UK regulators had raised concerns about some TVs adjusting their power-use during tests ""to get a better energy label ranking"" as far back as 2011. \n \n ""We\'ve got government agencies appearing to find gadgets that detect test conditions, which smacks of the VW case,"" said Jack Hunter from the European Environmental Bureau. \n \n ""We\'re entering a brave new world of sophisticated, connected technology, which could be a great thing, but is also open to abuse. \n \n ""It\'s vital that government officials have the resources and a bullish attitude to ensure that everyone is playing by the rules.""']",4,"– Cristiano Ronaldo is considered one of the best soccer players ever, and he proved why on Friday. He scored three times, including one with about 2 minutes left in regulation, to lift Portugal into a 3-3 tie with Spain in their World Cup opener.

241,"['Last Updated, Wednesday, 11:07 a.m. The year before his seventh and final Tour de France victory, Lance Armstrong offered to donate “in excess of $150,000″ to the antidoping agency in charge of keeping American athletes from using performance-enhancing drugs, according to the organization’s chief executive. \n \n The latest accusation against Armstrong, the disgraced former cyclist, was made by the current head of the United States Anti-Doping Agency, Travis Tygart, in an interview with CBS News posted online on Tuesday. In October, Usada stripped Armstrong of all of his titles and barred him from competition for life following the release of a 202-page report into what the agency called “the most sophisticated, professionalized and successful doping program that sport has ever seen.” \n \n As my colleague Juliet Macur reported, Armstrong, who has so far denied all allegations of cheating, “has told associates and antidoping officials that he is considering publicly admitting that he used banned performance-enhancing drugs and blood transfusions during his cycling career.” Late Tuesday, Oprah Winfrey announced that she “will speak exclusively with Lance Armstrong in his first no-holds-barred interview,” to be broadcast next week on her network. \n \n BREAKING NEWS: Looking forward to this conversation with @lancearmstrong: http://t.co/GwSmBhdW #NextChapter — Oprah Winfrey (@Oprah) 9 Jan 13 \n \n As the cycling journalist Lionel Birnie notes, the Oprah Winfrey Network is a joint venture with Discovery Communications, the broadcaster that sponsored Armstrong’s team in 2005. \n \n Lance is going on Oprah, partly-produced by Discovery Channel, sponsors of Lance’s 7th and final fraudulent Tour win. Somehow fitting. — Lionel Birnie (@lioneljbirnie) 9 Jan 13 \n \n Samantha Lane, a reporter for The Age in Australia, pointed out on Twitter that Winfrey and Armstrong looked comfortable together in a photograph published in the May 2004 issue of O, The Oprah Magazine with an interview of the cyclist before that year’s Tour de France. \n \n Oprah & Lance, in happier times (pic from her website). http://t.co/TMpMfYfk — Sam Lane (@SamJaneLane) 9 Jan 13 \n \n The photograph showed Armstrong in his Discovery Channel uniform and Winfrey, leaning on his shoulder, wearing a yellow, Livestrong bracelet. \n \n The network’s logo was emblazoned across the victor’s yellow jersey Armstrong wore on the top step of the podium in Paris that year, as he lectured “the people that don’t believe in cycling, the cynics and the skeptics.” \n \n Directly addressing those who accused him of doping that day, Armstrong said, “I’m sorry for you, I’m sorry you can’t dream big and I’m sorry you don’t believe in miracles, but this is one hell of a race, this is a great sporting event and you should stand around and believe. You should believe in these athletes and you should believe in these people. I’m a fan of the Tour de France for as long as I live and there’s no secrets — this is a hard sporting event and hard work wins it.” \n \n The notion of Armstrong confessing on Oprah was pre-mocked nearly two years ago by the bike racers and cartoonists Andy Shen and Dan Schmalz in their cult comic strip about the soap-operatic world of professional cycling, “As the Toto Turns,” for nyvelocity.com. \n \n Andy Shen and Dan Schmalz, nyvelocity.com \n \n Another journalist who writes about cycling, Shane Stokes, suggested that Armstrong might expect Winfrey to go easy on him, since she let another disgraced athlete, Marion Jones, claim during a 2008 interview that she had used performance-enhancing drugs unintentionally. \n \n Just after news of the interview broke, Kathy LeMond, whose husband, Greg, is now the only American to win the Tour de France, offered to put Winfrey in touch with people who could give her a crash course on the culture of professional cycling. \n \n .@Oprah I hope you get educated before the interview. I know people that can help you. — Kathy LeMond (@KathyLeMond) 9 Jan 13 \n \n Joe Lindsey of Bicycling Magazine asked his Twitter followers to help Winfrey by suggesting some tough questions. \n \n I am trying to anticipate some of “no holds barred” questions in Oprah’s Lance interview.

He then revealed that someone representing Armstrong had offered to give the American antidoping agency more than $150,000 at some point in 2004. “It was a clear conflict of interest for Usada,” Tygart said. “We had no hesitation in rejecting that offer.” Pressed further about the amount of the proposed donation, Tygart said that it was about $250,000. \n \n In another portion of the interview, broadcast on the CBS Evening News on Tuesday, Tygart said that Armstrong had tried to intimidate former teammates who had testified to a federal grand jury about his doping. The official also revealed that he personally had received death threats as a result of his investigation into the cancer survivor who was once a hero to millions.', 'Story highlights Lance Armstrong has agreed to 90-minute interview, Oprah Winfrey\'s network announces \n \n Release says Armstrong is expected to talk about doping allegations \n \n Armstrong has been working out in Hawaii, doing triathlon training \n \n Lance Armstrong will give his first television interview since being stripped of his Tour de France titles to Oprah Winfrey, her network announced Tuesday. \n \n A news release from the Oprah Winfrey Network said the 90-minute ""no-holds-barred"" interview will air at 9 p.m. ET January 17 and will be simulcast on Oprah.com. \n \n Winfrey will ask the disgraced cycling star to address the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency\'s report, which said there was overwhelming evidence he was directly involved in a sophisticated doping program, the statement said. \n \n The International Cycling Union, which choose not to appeal the USADA\'s lifetime ban, stripped Armstrong of his record seven Tour victories in October. \n \n The World Anti-Doping Agency also agreed with the sanctions, which means Armstrong may not compete in sports governed by WADA code. \n \n JUST WATCHED What\'s the truth with Lance Armstrong?

Since the ban he has entered two non-sanctioned events. \n \n According to his Twitter feed, Armstrong has been biking, running and swimming in Hawaii. The Winfrey interview will take place at Armstrong\'s home in Austin, Texas. \n \n The New York Times reported last week that Armstrong, 41, was contemplating publicly admitting he used illegal performance-enhancing drugs. Such an admission might lead toward Armstrong regaining his eligibility. \n \n Attorney Tim Herman, in a recent e-mail to CNN Sports, did not address whether Armstrong told associates -- as reported by the newspaper -- that he was considering an admission. \n \n Armstrong has repeatedly and vehemently denied that he used banned performance-enhancing drugs as well as illegal blood transfusions during his cycling career. \n \n In the past, Armstrong has argued that he took more than 500 drug tests and never failed. In its 202-page report that detailed Armstrong\'s alleged use of performance-enhancing drugs and blood transfusions, the USADA said it had tested Armstrong less than 60 times and the International Cycling Union conducted about 215 tests. \n \n The agency did not say that Armstrong ever failed a test, but his former teammates testified as to how they beat tests or avoided the tests altogether. \n \n The New York Times, citing unnamed associates and anti-doping officials, said Armstrong has been in discussions with USADA officials and hopes to meet with David Howman, chief of the World Anti-Doping Agency. The newspaper said none of the people with knowledge of Armstrong\'s situation wanted to be identified because it would jeopardize their access to information on the matter. \n \n Under World Anti-Doping Agency rules, an athlete who confesses to using performance-enhancing drugs may be eligible for a reinstatement. \n \n Armstrong has been an icon for his cycling feats and celebrity, bringing more status to a sport wildly popular in some nations but lacking big-name recognition, big money and mass appeal in the United States. \n \n He fought back from testicular cancer to win the Tour from 1999 to 2005. He raised millions via his Lance Armstrong Foundation to help cancer victims and survivors, an effort illustrated by trendy yellow ""LiveSTRONG"" wristbands that helped bring in the money. \n \n But Armstrong has long been dogged by doping allegations, with compatriot Floyd Landis -- who was stripped of his 2006 Tour de France title after failing a drug test -- making a series of claims in 2011. \n \n Armstrong sued the USADA last year to stop its investigation of him, arguing it did not have the right to prosecute him. But after a federal judge dismissed the case, Armstrong said he would no longer participate in the investigation. \n \n In October 2012, Armstrong was stripped of his titles and banned from cycling. Weeks later, he stepped down from the board of his foundation, Livestrong. \n \n It is unclear whether Armstrong would face criminal prosecution for perjury should he confess. Armstrong was involved in several cases where he gave sworn testimony that he never used banned drugs.']",2,"– Lance Armstrong is rumored to be ready to confess to drug use—and it could happen on Oprah's show.

The average such fund with Greek stocks in its portfolio has just 0.5 percent of its holdings in them, according to the latest data from Morningstar. \n \n Across all categories, the average amount is 0.3 percent, not including funds that are entirely clear of Greek stocks.

The rookie officer, who had only been with the department for a year, asked if he could come closer to speak to her more personally, and she said he could. \n \n The officer quickly developed a rapport with the girl and was able to calm her down, according to police. The girl agreed to allow Perez to come closer, and he asked if he could help her back over the bridge railing. \n \n “She was just crying and holding on,” he said. \n \n The girl told Perez she was scared and needed help, so the officer leaned over the railing, grabbed her in a bear hug and helped her over the railing to safety, police said. \n \n Perez sat with the child on the sidewalk and gave her water, police said. When she complained of an ankle injury, Perez called the fire department for assistance. \n \n The girl, who had been living in a group home at an address off of Avenue 64 in Los Angeles, was taken into custody for medical evaluation, according to police. \n \n She “is safe tonight because of Officer Perez’s calm, professional actions,” police officials said. \n \n CBS2’s Kristine Lazar said this was an example of being in the right place at the right time. \n \n Her interview with Officer Perez is a story that is Only On 2. \n \n He told her he was only an hour into his shift when he was told about the young girl on the bridge. \n \n She told him she wanted to be reunited with her only family — an aunt. \n \n “I do have nephews, and nieces,” Perez said, “one who is 7, the other who just turned 2. So I can’t relate, that, oh my Lord, this young indivual, this juvenile, is on the other side [on the bridge] what could possibly be going wrong in your life to make you want to do something like this?” \n \n Perez is reluctant to call himself a hero and uncomfortable that others are calling him one — but he is glad his parents (and dad is also an officer) took notice. \n \n “Hearing it from my parents is one thing,” Perez says, humbly, “Because I know I did right by them.”']",2,"– Faced with a 12-year-old girl hanging by an arm from an 80-foot-high bridge, threatening to end her young life, a rookie cop started talking, reports CBS Los Angeles.

""It was just back-and-forth banter with me and her,"" Perez says. ""'Can I come closer to you? Can I talk you closer? Can I pull you over the ledge so we can talk in a safer environment?' It was that back-to-back conversation with her that I felt was going so smoothly that I felt comfortable enough to lean over and get her."" Per CBS, Perez ""leaned over the railing, grabbed her in a bear hug, and helped her over the railing to safety."" Police officials credit Perez's ""calm, professional actions"" with saving the girl, while Perez himself seems appalled that someone so young could find herself so desperate.

But a State Department official said that the fact the money wasn\'t transferred on Jan. 1 doesn\'t mean it was frozen. ""There are still deliberations taking place, and we have until mid January to decide what we are going to do,” the official said. \n \n The Trump administration has frozen $125 million in funding for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, which provides aid to Palestinian refugees, according to three Western diplomats who were informed of the move. They said the funding, one third of the annual U.S. donations to the agency, was supposed to be transferred by Jan. 1 but was withheld. \n \n The details: The diplomats, who asked to speak on conditions of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter, said the funding was frozen until the Trump administration finishes its review of U.S. aid to the Palestinian Authority. \n \n The move comes after the Palestinian Authority suspended their contacts with the Trump administration in response to its decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. A senior White House official said no decision have been made yet, but confirmed that a review of the U.S. assistance to the Palestinians is underway ""in light of the Palestinians\' recent conduct."" \n \n The diplomats added that U.S. officials told U.N. officials in the last two days that President Trump is considering totally cutting the part of the funding which was frozen, and is even considering cutting up to $180 million, which amounts to half of the U.S. funding to UNRWA. \n \n The impact: The Western diplomats said freezing or cutting of such a big part of the U.S. funding would be catastrophic for the organization, would hamper its work and might lead to negative consequences for the Palestinian refugee camps in Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan and Lebanon. \n \n U.N. secretary general António Guterres has spoken with senior U.S. official about the UNRWA funding and also consulted with foreign ministers from other donor countries, according to the diplomats. \n \n The Israeli security establishment and the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories — the Israeli organization that oversees government activities in the West Bank and Gaza — are concerned about possible freezing or cutting of U.S. funding to UNRWA, fearing the escalation of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. \n \n “The humanitarian situation in Gaza is complicated enough and harming UNRWA funding will only make it more complicated,"" a senior Israeli security official told me. \n \n What we\'re hearing: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is not enthusiastic about the cutting of U.S. funding to UNRWA, but is politically pressed by conservative ministers in his cabinet and by the fact he can\'t be more dovish on the Palestinian issue than President Trump. \n \n Officials in the prime minister\'s office told diplomats from several western countries that Israel does not object to the cutting of U.S. funding to the Palestinian Authority, but prefers that the U.S. doesn\'t cut funding to UNRWA due to the fact it also serves Israeli security interests. \n \n A senior Israeli official told me Netanyahu is in touch with the White House on the UNRWA funding issue, and conveyed the message that Israel prefers “gradual disengagement"" with UNRWA by the U.S. and not a big funding cut. \n \n The prime minister\'s office said in a statement: ""Netanyahu supports President Trump\'s critical attitude towards UNRWA and believes practical steps need to be taken in order to change the fact that UNRWA is being used to entrench the Palestinian refugee problem instead of solving it.""', ""Amanda Holden leads campaign to stop NHS hospitals secretly burning miscarried foetuses without parents’ knowledge \n \n \n \n Investigation finds thousands of miscarried babies have been incinerated \n \n Uncovered as part of Channel 4 Dispatches programme hosted by actress \n \n Britain's Got Talent host leads campaign after suffering miscarriage in 2010 \n \n Addenbrooke’s Hospital burned 797 foetuses at its 'waste to energy' plant \n \n Actress Amanda Holden, who suffered a miscarriage herself in 2010, and delivered a stillborn son in 2011, is hosting Channel 4's Ending Hospital Heartache \n \n Thousands of miscarried and aborted babies have been incinerated by NHS hospitals without their mothers’ knowledge, an investigation has found. \n \n \n \n The government was forced to ban the practice after it emerged that 15,500 foetal remains have been incinerated by 27 trusts over the last two years alone. \n \n \n \n The bodies are being burned as ‘clinical waste’, while at two trusts they were put into ‘waste-to-energy’ furnaces which generate power for hospitals. \n \n \n \n One devastated mother who suffered a miscarriage was told her child would be ‘incinerated with the rest of the day’s waste’. \n \n \n \n The scandal of how the NHS treats parents who lose a child in early pregnancy was uncovered as part of a Channel 4 Dispatches programme to be broadcast tonight. \n \n \n \n Last night health minister Dan Poulter stepped in to order an immediate ban on incinerating foetal remains. \n \n \n \n ‘This practice is totally unacceptable,’ he said. ‘That is why I have asked Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, NHS medical director, to write to all NHS hospital trusts, to make it clear that it must stop now. \n \n ‘The Chief Medical Officer has also written to the Human Tissue Authority to ask them to make sure that there is clear guidance on this issue. \n \n ‘While the vast majority of hospitals are acting in the appropriate way, that must be the case for all hospitals and the Human Tissue Authority has now been asked to ensure that it acts on this issue without delay.’ \n \n Cathryn Hurley, 35, found out during a 13-week pregnancy scan that her baby had died at eight weeks, and later underwent a medical procedure to remove the foetus. \n \n \n \n She said: ‘I was hysterical.

It\'s massive, it\'s a new system we haven\'t seen before - we need to understand it more completely if we are to predict sea level rise."" \n \n The scientists say the water is prevented from freezing by the large amounts of snow that fall on the surface of the ice sheet late in the summer. \n \n This insulates the water from the air temperatures which are below freezing, allowing the water to persist as liquid all year long. \n \n Other researchers believe this discovery may help explain disparities between projections of mass loss by climate models and observations from satellites. \n \n ""The large mass of liquid water in firn also represents a heat sink that could be playing a role in Greenland\'s interaction with the climate system,"" wrote Dr Joel Harper from the University of Montana, in a comment piece published alongside the study. \n \n ""As the intensity of surface melt in Greenland increases and expands upwards to the higher elevations that are covered by firn, liquid water storage may play an expanding role in the ice sheet\'s future response to climate change."" \n \n Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc.']",3,"– The quotes are so incendiary that some are questioning their veracity.

Mother played piano and violin,"" she wrote. ""I have fond memories of our grandmother playing the piano for us after meals."" She also served as a missionary in Papua, New Guinea. The family was fairly long-lived: Maria's older sister, Agathe, died three years ago at age 97."

With part of this cloud having reached us Sunday morning, aurora watchers are anticipating a great show on Sunday night! \n \n This story has been updated. \n \n \n \n The Sun has continued its quiet progress towards solar minimum - the point in its 11 year cycle where it exhibits the lowest levels of sunspot activity - but on the way there, it can still produce a few surprises. \n \n On Thursday night (early Friday morning, UTC), the larger of two sunspots currently visible on the Earthward side of the Sun blasted out a bright M2-class solar flare. \n \n \n \n Three views of sunspot AR2665, from around 5:00 UTC Friday, July 14, 2017, during the peak of the solar flare. The top frame shows the sunspot itself, while the bottom frames show off the coronal loops surrounding the sunspot (in gold, on the left) and the intense release of energy (in green, on the right). Credit: NASA/SDO/Scott Sutherland \n \n At the same time as the solar flare was blasting out X-rays, which caused a minor radio blackout over parts of Asia, it also released a massive cloud of solar particles - what's known as a coronal mass ejection. \n \n This coronal mass ejection is mostly aimed ahead of Earth's orbital path, and thus the vast majority of it will miss us. As the cloud expands out into space, however, one end of it is projected to sweep past Earth. \n \n \n \n \n \n Even as this swath of solar particles washes past us, much of it will simply be diverted around the planet, due to the protective effects of Earth's magnetic field. A significant portion of them, though, will become snagged within the field lines, and then funneled down into the upper atmosphere near the planet's poles, to produce bright auroras. \n \n RELATED: What is Light Pollution and how does it affect Canadians? \n \n Currently, NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is reporting that the Earth-directed portion of the coronal mass ejection arrived earlier than expected. By their observations, we were already seeing G2 (moderate) geomagnetic storm levels as of mid-morning Sunday, and these are expected to persist throughout the afternoon. \n \n \n \n This evening, storm levels are predicted to diminish slightly - to G1 (minor) geomagnetic storm levels - and then jump back up to G2 storm strength between 8 p.m. to 2 a.m. EDT. Afterwards, activity is expected to ramp down to sub-storm levels by Monday morning. \n \n Based on all of this activity, auroras are expected to stretch down over most of Canada and the northern United States tonight, and likely visible as far south as between the Kp=5 (green) and Kp=7 (yellow) lines on the map below. \n \n There is also a chance, during all of this G2 geomagnetic storm activity, that levels could briefly jump as high as G3 (strong), which would push visibility down over the Kp=7 line. \n \n \n \n Remember that it takes reasonably clear and dark skies to see the auroras, far from the light pollution cast by urban environments. Auroras are also notorious for being random and flighty. Sometimes they can appear faint, only to be seen with long-exposure photography, while other times they can be bright and vibrant to the naked eye, and they can appear and disappear quite suddenly. \n \n \n \n If you plan on getting out to watch, choose your location carefully and be safe. In most regions of the country, simply getting outside of your local community is typically good enough. For those living in southwestern Ontario and the GTA, areas north of Stratford, Guelph and Orangeville tend to be good for viewing, as are those areas to the east of Lake Simcoe and north of Peterborough (the shores of Georgian Bay usually provide excellent viewing!). \n \n \n \n Provincial parks are an excellent resource for skywatching, even if you have to stick to the parking lot at night. \n \n As always with these events, give your eyes some time to adjust to the dark - 30-40 minutes typically - or you will likely miss out on it. Avoid all bright sources of light - streetlights, car headlights, cellphone screens & camera flashes, etc - during that time, then look up and to the north to potentially see the auroras. \n \n \n \n Sources: NOAA | spaceweather.com | teaser image courtesy Team Tanner \n \n \n \n Watch Below: Theresa and Darlene Tanner relate their experiences with the Northern Lights and how they take such amazing photographs""]",2,"– It's not unusual for newspaper editorials to criticize a president's policies. But the editorial board at the Los Angeles Times is taking the concept to a new level with a multi-part series called ""Our Dishonest President."" Part one on Sunday issued a warning that President Trump is ""so unpredictable, so reckless, so petulant, so full of blind self-regard, so untethered to reality that it is impossible to know where his presidency will lead or how much damage he will do to our nation."" Those traits may have helped him get elected as an ""outsider,"" but hopes that they would be reined in once he entered the White House are fading. The editorial ends with a plea for voters, protesters, members of Congress, state legislators, the courts, the media, etc., to be vigilant about protecting America from its own president. On Monday, part two focuses on Trump's capacity to lie. Plenty of politicians lie, of course, but what Trump ""brings to the equation is an apparent disregard for fact so profound as to suggest that he may not see much practical distinction between lies, if he believes they serve him, and the truth."" What makes this especially dangerous is that Trump repeats the lies of others, even crackpots. ""He gives every indication that he is as much the gullible tool of liars as he is the liar in chief."" Verification seems to be a foreign concept to Trump, but it can't be for everyone else, write the editors, who close with advice: ""Investigate. Read. Write. Listen. Speak. Think. ... Be suspicious of those who confuse reality with reality TV, and those who repeat falsehoods while insisting, against all evidence, that they are true. To defend freedom, demand fact."" Read part one and part two."
