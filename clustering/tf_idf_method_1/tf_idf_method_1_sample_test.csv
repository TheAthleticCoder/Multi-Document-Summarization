0,"['One tweet too many \n \n X marks the spot where Denis Finley, editor of the paper in Bernie Sanders\' hometown, screwed up. If Oprah Winfrey was the media\'s Big Winner for her Golden Globes peroration on sexual harassment, Finley was a (fortunately less-publicized) Big Loser due to ham-handed tweets. \n \n Even the most sober of mainstream media get bollixed up over page views and reader engagement as they seek to be more refined P.T. Barnums of a digital age. Being provocative for provocation\'s sake is increasingly rationalized as a way to promote your handiwork, no matter how tenuous and fleeting the actual loyalty manifested (perhaps with help from a Drudge Report link) might be. \n \n But, as Finley, executive editor of the Gannett-owned Burlington Free Press, unwittingly reminds us, there\'s a difference between being responsibly provocative and perhaps tone deaf to your audience — especially in the digital age. \n \n Vermont plans to join Oregon and Washington, D.C., in offering drivers a third option in listing gender on licenses. So M, F or X. In liberal Burlington, where Sanders was mayor, it\'s not unpopular. And it just prompted one citizen\'s tweet, ""This is awesome! // #VT Is One Step Closer To Offering A Third Gender On Driver\'s Licenses."" But Finley, who came to the Free Press from Virginia in 2016 after a long stint as Norfolk Virginian-Pilot editor (and, briefly, as publicist for a Norfolk museum), felt compelled to respond: ""Awesome! That makes us one step closer to the apocalypse."" \n \n If Winfrey played brilliantly to her audience, Finley fumbled in recognizing his. The Vermont online universe is now filled with mostly outrage, and claims of canceling subscriptions. In fact, it was only the third in a succession of curious tweets by Finley. They underscored the tempting perils of journalists, even newsroom bosses, who feel compelled to opine on, well, just about anything.Thus, Finley saw an Associated Press tweet on how fans of Frank Lloyd Wright are seeking to prevent the demolition of a Montana office building designed in 1958. This inspired a response: ""I don\'t care who designed them, destroy all office buildings."" \n \n Fine. Chalk that up to lame humor. Then, after word from none other than The New York Times that ""Former President Barack Obama is to be the first guest on David Letterman\'s new monthly Netflix talk show,"" he sought to exhibit his inner Jimmy Kimmel with this: ""Another reason not to subscribe to Netflix."" That was lame, with a smidgen of the obtuse. \n \n As outrage quickly manifested itself over the gender matter, Finley seemed to dig a deeper hole. A Tim Sinnott tweeted that the state policy was awesome ""because recognition is awesome"" and Finley responded, ""All recognition? Any recognition, Tim? What if someone said it\'s awesome they are going to recognize pedophiliacs on licenses? I\'m not being snarky, I\'m just asking. Not all recognition is awesome."" \n \n Finley was either high-mindedly engaged in a Socratic inquiry, as if teaching a constitutional law seminar, or manifesting Jonesean (as in Alex Jones, of InfoWars) subtlety cum derision. If I\'m a top Gannett official, I might now be wondering if a second bomb cyclone affecting New England is actually on my payroll. \n \n ""So you think trans people are the equivalent of pedophiles?"" Anderson asked. \n \n When tracked down by Vermont\'s Seven Days about the flap (He declined comment when I contacted him, saying, ""Maybe in a few days""), Finley said, ""I really just wanted to ask the question: \'Why is that awesome? And why is that necessary?\' That’s all, and I think any journalist would ask that question."" He said use of the word apocalypse was inspired by a Sports Illustrated feature, ""Signs of the Apocalypse."" \n \n When I passed through Burlington last summer, there were still Sanders T-shirts in store windows. How long before some retail outlets offer a tie-dyed image of Finley with a big, fat ""X""? \n \n ""Denis Finley doesn\'t seem to care that, when he enters the arena as executive editor, he carries the reputation of his news organization with him. \'Reader engagement\' is not making provocative statements and then picking fights with people who disagree,"" says Tom Kearney, deputy managing editor of the Stowe Reporter, Waterbury Record and News & Citizen of Morrisville, and executive editor of the Shelburne News and The Citizen, which serves Charlotte and Hinesburg. \n \n Then there\'s Jon Margolis, who was an A-list national political writer during his heyday with The Chicago Tribune. That was a pre-internet world where reporters and editors weren\'t tweeting their views on everything from whom they\'d seen at lunch, a referee\'s call in the NFL game they were watching or, of course, every breathing moment of Donald Trump. \n \n ""Why this urge to tweet so often?"" asks Margolis, who is retired in South Burlington, a few blocks from the Burlington city line. ""I do not think the world breathlessly awaits my latest witty aphorism or my personal take on what happened today. If I have something to offer that’s worthwhile, I’ll write a piece about it. That means reporting — online, on the phone, at somebody’s office. And then writing, as well as possible, which means as succinctly as possible but always more than 280 clicks of the keyboard."" \n \n \n \n ""Tweeting is like artificial turf. The technology makes it possible, not advisable. That would apply even where the tweet is not as aggressively ignorant as Finley’s. But just think: Were he writing an article instead of a blurt (essentially what a tweet is) he might have read it over and then altered (or deep-sixed) it. Or had somebody else edit it, which even the boss should always do. Amazing how the conventional processes of newspapers can save us from ourselves."" \n \n Jake Tapper vs. Stephen Miller \n \n Jousting between cable TV hosts and guests is now a performance fixture. Bill O\'Reilly rode it to riches before his sexual harassment self-immolation. In its most pedestrian post-O\'Reilly form, it brings some well intentioned but weak liberal saps served up as red meat for Fox\'s Tucker Carlson. \n \n In a fairer tussle, it brought us CNN\'s Jake Tapper and White House aide Stephen Miller. And Tapper giving him the boot. \n \n Tapper is evolving into his network\'s prime skeptic of all things Trump and, unlike Carlson, not reflexively given to pillorying lightweight guests. And Miller is the unbridled partisan who has reveled in public combat ever since his high school days at a largely liberal Los Angeles high school \n \n As The New York Times\' Matt Flegenheimer has put it in a profile of Miller, his life ""is a triumph of unbending convictions and at least occasional contrivance. It is a story of beliefs that congealed early in a home that he helped nudge to the right of its blue-state ZIP code, and of an ideology that became an identity for a spindly agitator at a large and racially divided public high school."" \n \n ""These formative years supplied the template for the life Mr. Miller has carved out for himself in Washington, where he remains the hard-line jouster many of Mr. Trump’s most zealous supporters trust most in the White House — and many former peers fear."" \n \n This all began with the equally pro forma, and dungeon\'s host salutation, ""Stephen, thanks so much for joining us and happy new year, good to see you."" \n \n On Sunday, Miller called Michael Wolff the ""garbage author of a garbage book,"" a rather mediocre pre-meditated line for someone of his acerbic and calculating essence. He called Trump a ""political genius."" He called it a ""work of pure fiction."" And ""a pile of trash."" \n \n It was mostly solid, fair-minded inquisition by Tapper for about six minutes, until it first got a tad personal and each started cutting off the other. Miller referred to CNN\'s Trump coverage as hysterical, and Tapper suggested it was Miller who was being hysterical. As if Miler were a child, Tapper asked him to ""settle down, settle down."" \n \n At the nine-minute mark, what had seemed a small lull turned sour as Tapper brought up a letter that Miller wrote on the subject of firing then-FBI Director James Comey. Miller stumbled a tad before Tapper broached the president\'s bizarre Saturday tweet on his own purported genius. \n \n Tapper correctly persisted in broaching the public discourse on Trump\'s rationality, as Miller sought to divert the topic to his theme of CNN being out of touch with a working America that his boss understands and CNN doesn\'t. \n \n Then, Tapper had enough. He said that Miller was being ""obsequious,"" playing to an audience of one (Trump) and not answering his question. He simply cut him off. It was rather abrupt and could have been executed in a less peremptory manner. It came off as a host losing control, as much as Trump critics loved the scene and think Miller deserved it. But if you don\'t want to fight the lions, stay away from their pen. \n \n Regardless, both Miller and Tapper surely came away thinking they\'d won (maybe all the more so as Miller was escorted out by security). Predictably, Trump soon tweeted some venom Tapper\'s way: ""Jake Tapper of Fake News CNN just got destroyed in his interview with Stephen Miller of the Trump Administration. Watch the hatred and unfairness of this CNN flunky!"" \n \n New York Times unveils ad on Golden Globes \n \n Truly salute The New York Times for actually trying to market excellence in a way that\'s about 20 years late for most of the newspaper industry. It unveiled the next part of its ""The Truth is Hard"" brand campaign during NBC\'s Golden Globes broadcast. \n \n Similar to its first ad on last year\'s Oscars, the ad features black type against a white background. ""He said, she said"" are the first words you see. Then they are repeated multiple times until it\'s just, ""She said, she said, she said, she said,"" with the ad ending ""The truth has power. The truth will not be threatened. The truth has a voice."" \n \n The ""truth has a voice"" is a simple and potent notion. But, as a TV spot, it falls a bit flat. As one top advertising executive told me, it\'s unlikely that most viewers connected the paper\'s incredible sex harassment reporting, including on Harvey Weinstein, and the ad. For those who who did — the event was filled with unavoidable talk of sex harassment in Hollywood, including Seth Meyers\' opening monologue — the ad was preaching to the choir. \n \n Potency of advertising involves melding the right media and the right audience. In a narrow sense, the Golden Globes might seem a good target — but only in a narrow sense. The Times has a great narrative to spin as to why it should be trusted, including its admirable attention to fact-checking and precision (even with some hotly disputed cuts in the copy editing force). Perhaps a larger campaign can include such factors. \n \n It\'s because the challenge for quality media involves more than the mere declaration of virtue. As with changing the attitudes of Americans toward sex harassment, changing attitudes toward even the best of media — especially when it comes to people paying for content — will involve a military-like campaign, with no one-size-fits-all-messages and the unavoidable (and very expensive) need to make the case with unprecedented regularity and persistence. \n \n TV news viewing continues to head south, Trump aside \n \n As Poynter reports, ""Until now, local TV news viewership has been declining slowly. But a new Pew research study shows that from 2016 to 2017, the decline picked up speed."" \n \n Younger Americans\' turn from TV news is important. But, somewhere in the mix, is surely ideology, though the study does not point explicitly to what\'s been previously shown to be the sharp decline in Republicans\' confidence in ""mass media."" \n \n A revealing photo history \n \n The Associated Press put together a gallery of photos of what actresses have tended to wear at the Golden Globe Awards over the years, as opposed to the black dresses they pointedly wore last night. \n \n The morning Babel \n \n CNN opened with Trump defending his mental fitness and, no surprise, a very brief take at colleague Tapper\'s spat with Miller. It gave rather more time to social media hurrahs about Winfrey\'s Golden Globes speech and the notion of her running for president. \n \n ""When you think of the Democratic lineup for 2020 ... you pretty quickly run out of star power,"" said Brian Stelter, media reporter cum political analyst. ""If you want to fight fire with fire, Trump is a reality TV star and Oprah Winfrey has been on TV in some ways longer than he has. There are a lot of reasons why this might make sense to Democratic insiders. That speech if anything, gave people more reason to dream it up."" For sure, there was a smattering of speculation. But, one might hope, it quickly encounters recognition of what\'s playing out before us: the obvious limits of electing somebody with no experience in the arena. \n \n MSNBC\'s ""Morning Joe"" backed Tapper\'s performance (""I would have cut it short after the second answer,"" said Mika Brzezinski) and was the latest to get time with author Michael Wolff. And, before then, there was Axios\' Jonathan Swan on what appears to be Trump\'s shrinking work schedule and also the co-hosts\' riff on Trump\'s insecurity. The latter included the co-hosts venturing into the topic of TV stars, no names mentioned, being self-absorbed (""We\'ve met a lot of people in television who are narcissistic and stupid,"" Brzezinski said). Hmmm. \n \n But it was a different tone on Trump\'s favorite morning show, ""Trump & Friends,"" where co-host Brian Kilmeade surfaced at Pancake Pantry in Nashville, Tenn., for breakfast and generally supportive Trump chat. Oh, he was also giving away free to diners copies of new books both by himself and co-host Ainsley Earhardt. Call it a celebration of American commerce. \n \n Sending individuals back to harm \n \n Sarah Stillman, who heads the Global Migration Project at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, has been compiling a database of individuals essentially deported to harm, even death in Central America. With the help of a dozen students, and lots of activists involved in immigrant rights, humanitarian aid and other organizations, she\'s now uncovered patterns of awful consequences to what can at times seem almost frivolous infractions and, too, insufficient government due diligence and articulation to individuals of their rights. The melancholy bottom line is underscored in this New Yorker piece. \n \n Terrific women in a mostly male soccer universe \n \n Watching loads of English soccer over the past week, I was reminded of the terrific in-studio hosting work of Brit Rebecca Lowe for NBC\'s fine coverage of Premier League matches, as well as Brit Kate Abdo (who is also fluent in Spanish, German and French) for Fox Sports\' solid (not quite as strong and measured as NBC\'s) coverage of the related FA Cup tournament. The latter is one in which the top rank teams are thrown into a mix with lower division ones in frequent David vs. Goliath contests (often at the very quaint fields of the Davids). Sunday, mighty Arsenal was such a victim. \n \n And yet, they are surrounded by a sea of men, in studio and out, with all the match announcers men and, with a single seeming exception, glimpsed in an Arsenal-Nottingham Forest match yesterday, all the refs and linesman are male (there was a female linesman). \n \n New England hoopla \n \n New England Patriots fans have reason to be suspicious of ESPN, as Boston.com columnist Chad Finn, underscores. An us-versus-the-world mindset is partly fueled by some inaccurate reporting on the Patriots by ESPN. But when it comes to its chronicle of rising tensions among the owner, coach and star quarterback, Finn defends reporter Seth Wickersham \n \n The reflexive doubts are too bad, he writes, since ""if the story is read with clear eyes and all rooting interests aside, it’s far more illuminating than it is salacious."" \n \n Are we so sure that Mueller is investigating Trump for obstruction? \n \n Writing in the excellent Lawfare blog, Harvard Law\'s Jack Goldsmith raises the possibility that the seeming lack of recusal by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in the Mueller Russia investigation might suggest that there\'s not the obstruction investigation that folks assume (speculation fueled further by a Michael Schmidt opus in The New York Times last week). \n \n ""One possibility is that Rosenstein has no conflict because Mueller is not actually investigating the president for obstruction. It has been widely reported for months in multiple reputable outlets that Mueller is conducting such an investigation. Schmidt’s story implies that he is, and reports that Mueller has evidence in his possession that appears relevant only to an obstruction investigation."" \n \n The reader over your shoulder \n \n There\'s unavoidable counsel to journalists in a blog in the Paris Review, the literary bastion founded by the late George Plimpton, as Patricia O\'Conner an author and former staff writer at The New York Times Book Review, discusses a 1940s work by poet-novelist Robert Graves, ""The Reader Over Your Shoulder: A Handbook for Writers of English Prose.” \n \n The book turned on the notion that writers should imagine a bunch of readers standing over their shoulder, in the process laying out 41 core principles and, then, annealing 50 excerpts of writing from famous authors to school headmasters. Graves was pretty fearless in underscoring lack of clarity. \n \n As O\'Conner puts it, ""Those forty-one principles work both ways; they make for better reading as well as better writing. They can show a reader what’s wrong with something that rings false or doesn’t make sense or leaves questions unanswered. In a climate where rumors, impressions, and outright lies are sometimes treated as fact, informed readers are more important than ever. No democracy can afford to be without readers who can ask the right questions, who can critically judge what they read, who can mentally peer over an author’s shoulder."" \n \n And tonight\'s big college football championship game \n \n It\'s Alabama versus Georgia and, reports The Wall Street Journal this morning, ""ESPN, armed with new data about its viewers, is more aggressively selling its female audience, starting with the College Football Playoff, which culminates in Monday’s championship game. The timing couldn’t be better. Advertisers are looking for new ways to reach women, and more efficiently reach broader audiences, as consumer viewing habits change."" \n \n ""Financial services firm Northwestern Mutual is among the advertisers using college football to reach women and families. The company wasn’t new to the playoff, and knew that the sporting event reached a \'healthy mix of men and women and families,\' but a new pitch and compelling data from ESPN helped the company \'come up with different ad spots\' targeting women and families, said Aditi Gokhale, Northwestern Mutual’s chief marketing officer."" \n \n Corrections?

The paper reports Finley was fired by honchos at parent company Gannett on Monday evening after he was found to have repeatedly flouted its social media rules. ""We encourage our journalists to engage in a meaningful dialogue on social media, but ... the conversation [should] adhere to our overarching values of fairness, balance, and objectivity,"" says an exec from the USA Today Network, Gannett's main brand.

That makes us one step closer to the apocalypse."" When someone else tweeted the recognition of different genders was awesome, Finley wrote: ""All recognition? … What if someone said it's awesome they are going to recognize pedophiliacs on licenses? I'm not being snarky, I'm just asking."" Poynter notes some readers threatened to cancel their Free Press subscriptions over the tweets.

3,"['CLOSE Scientists say they\'ve found archaeological evidence to support rumors they previously were skeptical of: that starving colonists at Jamestown, Virginia, turned to cannibalism to survive. (May 1) AP \n \n Marks of butchery evident on teen\'s remains discovered at the site. \n \n This August 2012 photo shows four shallow chops to an incomplete skull excavated in Jamestown, Va., by William Kelso of the Jamestown Rediscovery Project. (Photo: Don Hurlbert, Smithsonian) Story Highlights During the \'starving time,\' only 60 of 300 colonists survived \n \n Researchers: Skull shows signs of cannibalization \n \n Final blow split the cranium open \n \n WASHINGTON -- Jamestown\'s colonists resorted to cannibalism during the ""starving time"" winter of 1609-10, archaeologists confirmed Wednesday. \n \n In a briefing at the Smithsonian\'s National Museum of Natural History, archaeologist Doug Owsley presented the reconstructed skull of a 14-year-old English girl, named ""Jane"" by the researchers, discovered at the site of the fort and bearing the marks of butchery. \n \n ""The skull was split in half, most likely with a lightweight ax or quite possibly, a cleaver,"" Owsley said at the briefing. Cut marks crisscrossing the skull and jaw of the girl indicate her flesh, tongue and brains were removed from the skull, Owsley said. Those were traditional cuts for animal butchery of the time, ""all parts of the cuisine of the 17th century,"" he said. \n \n Jamestown was founded in 1607 by English colonists. The starving time was a period two years later in which 80% of the colonists died. Besieged by Powhatan Indians in their wooden fort, the settlers had been joined by new colonists late that summer, among them women and children, whose main supply ship had disappeared in a storm, leaving them without food. Only 60 of 300 people survived the winter. \n \n ""They were so emaciated when they were rescued that they were described as resembling skeletons,"" says historian James Horn of the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, who spoke at the briefing. Records kept by the colony\'s governor, George Percy, make clear references to cannibalism during the winter, Horn says. ""The English would have only resorted to cannibalism under the most severe circumstances,"" he added. \n \n VIDEO: Cannibalism at Jamestown confirmed \n \n Owsley reported on the forensic analysis of 17th century human remains and a reconstruction of her appearance made by forensic scientists. The remains had been excavated by Jamestown archaeologists led by William Kelso of the Jamestown Recovery Project in 2012 as part of a 20-year excavation of the James Fort site. ""We don\'t believe Jane was a lone case,"" Kelso said. \n \n This April 2013 photo shows a forensic facial reconstruction produced by StudioEIS of Brooklyn, N.Y., in consultation with William Kelso of the Jamestown Rediscovery Project. (Photo: Don Hurlbert, Smithsonian) \n \n ""This is amazingly interesting, but it also confirms stories of cannibalism from the settlers themselves,"" says Charles Mann, author of 1493: Uncovering the New World Columbus Created. ""Things were indeed terrible during those early years,"" Mann says, by email. \n \n While not all colonial-era historians agreed that cannibalism took place at Jamestown, most modern ones generally credited the accounts (one man was executed for eating his wife) as reliable. Horn and Owsley argued the butchery marks on Jane provide stronger evidence for the practice. ""No one can say with authoritative certainty exactly why this young lady was cut up, but given the context, it looks like butcher\'s marks,"" Owsley said. \n \n In the briefing, he identified a number of features on the skull and a shin bone that indicated that Jane was cannibalized. Four shallow chops to the forehead were attempted in a first, failed attempt to open the skull. The back of the head was then split open. The final blow split the cranium open. \n \n ""The person doing this was not a very good, or experienced butcher,"" Owsley said. Chop marks on the shin bone resemble more conventional butchers\' marks seen on animal bones from the time, indicating that more than one person may have been involved in cannibalizing the girl. She was doubtless one of the newly arrived settlers, though still not definitively identified. An exhibition devoted to the discovery will open this Friday at the Historic Jamestowne site, and her reconstructed face will be displayed at the Smithsonian museum. \n \n Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/18cNUHU', 'Douglas Owsley, a physical anthropologist at the Smithsonian Institution, left, and Jamestown archaeologist William Kelso unveil the reconstruction from the remains of ""Jane,"" a 17th-century teenager from Jamestown who researchers believe may have been the victim of cannibalism at the National Museum of Natural History in Washington. \n \n May 1, 2013 Douglas Owsley, a physical anthropologist at the Smithsonian Institution, left, and Jamestown archaeologist William Kelso unveil the reconstruction from the remains of ""Jane,"" a 17th-century teenager from Jamestown who researchers believe may have been the victim of cannibalism at the National Museum of Natural History in Washington.

The next set, after the body was rolled over, was more effective. One cut split the skull all the way to the base. \n \n “The person is truly figuring it out as they go,” said Douglas Owsley, a physical anthropologist at the Smithsonian Institution. \n \n In the meantime, someone — perhaps with more experience — was working on a leg. The tibia bone is broken with a single blow, as one might do in butchering a cow. \n \n That’s one possible version of an event that took place sometime during the winter of 1609-1610 in Jamestown. What’s certain is that some members of that desperate colony resorted to cannibalism to survive. \n \n That cannibalism occurred during the colony’s “starving time” was never in much doubt. At least a half-dozen accounts, by people who lived through the period or spoke to colonists who did, describe occasional acts of cannibalism that winter. They include reports of corpses being exhumed and eaten, a husband killing his wife and salting her flesh (for which he was executed), and the mysterious disappearance of foraging colonists. \n \n This 14-year old girl was eaten. She has been reconstructed after archaeologists found her bones in Jamestown, Virginia. Her remains show that she died during the “starving time” period and bare the telltale signs of cannibalism. (The Fold/The Washington Post) \n \n The proof comes in the form of fragments of a skeleton of a girl, about age 14, found in a cellar full of debris in the fort on the James River that sheltered the starving colonists. The skull, lower jaw and leg bone — all that remain — have the telltale marks of an ax or cleaver and a knife. \n \n “Historians have to decide whether this type of thing happened,” said Owsley, who has examined thousands of skeletal remains, both archaeological and forensic. “I think that it did. We didn’t see anybody eat this flesh. But it’s very strong evidence.” \n \n James Horn, head of research at the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation and a historian on the colony, said the discovery “adds a significant confirmation to what was reported to have occurred at Jamestown.” Further, it’s the only physical evidence of cannibalism of Europeans in any New World colony, although, as with Jamestown, there are written accounts of the practice in others. \n \n “I tend to be sparing in the use of words like ‘unique.’ But I think this is one of those finds that literally is,” Horn said. \n \n About 300 people inhabited the fort in November 1609. By spring, there were only 60. The girl, most likely a maidservant but possibly the daughter of a colonist, was one of the casualties. \n \n Her bones were unearthed last August as part of the Jamestown Rediscovery archaeological project begun in 1994. About 18 inches of fill remain in the cellar, so it’s possible more of her skeleton will be found. Enough of her skull exists, however, to imagine what she might have looked like, using CT scanning, computer graphics, sculpture materials and demographic data. \n \n The bones, the reconstruction of her head and the story were presented Wednesday at an event at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History. The remains will be displayed at the Archaearium, the museum at the Jamestown fort archaeological site, starting this weekend. A warning sign at the room’s entrance notes that human remains are on view. There are no depictions of bodies being butchered, cooked or consumed. \n \n The starving time nearly ended the colony, which was riven by internal dissent, under attack by Powhatan Indians and short of food almost from its founding in 1607. A resupply fleet of nine vessels had left Plymouth, England, on June 2, 1609. Aboard, including crew, were 500 people, of which perhaps three dozen were women and girls. The fleet was struck by a hurricane on July 23, 1609. One ship sank. The flagship, Sea Venture, wrecked on Bermuda. Most of the passengers and crew escaped to the island, an event that became the kernel of William Shakespeare’s “The Tempest.” Among the survivors was the colony’s incoming lieutenant governor, Thomas Gates. (The marooned fashioned two boats from the wreck’s remains and miraculously sailed into Jamestown the next May.) \n \n The seven other ships, scattered and damaged, sailed on. Six arrived in mid-August, with the girl, whom the researchers have named “Jane,” almost certainly on one of them. The seventh ship arrived in October. \n \n The new arrivals — about 300 people — proved to be as much a drain on the colony as a relief. \n \n The ships’ crews hoarded provisions. The summer corn crop was enough to feed only about 50 people for a year. The colony’s military leader, Capt. John Smith, sent two groups of colonists upstream and downstream to fend for themselves. He was badly wounded in what was probably an assassination attempt and in October sailed home with the ships. By then, people were already going hungry. \n \n The girl’s bones were found mixed with those of a horse, dogs and squirrels — testament to the extreme food sources the colonists turned to that winter. They were part of the trash collected in a fort-wide cleanup and dumped in the cellar before the arrival of the colony’s governor, Lord De La Warr, the following June. \n \n The cause of her death isn’t known. The tentative cuts to the front of the skull and the deeper ones to the back are close together — evidence that she was dead, not squirming, when they were made. The temporal bone was pried off to reach the brain. There are dozens of cuts to the jaw, suggesting that muscle was stripped from it. \n \n Could the marks have been left by animals? \n \n “Not a chance,” Owsley said. “I deal with this all the time. Not a chance.” In fact, he says with confidence that the dissector or dissectors were right-handed. \n \n Chemical analysis of the bone reveals an enriched “nitrogen profile,” evidence of lots of protein in the girl’s diet. That, in turn, suggests she was a member of a high-born family or at least lived in such a household for much of her life. \n \n She wouldn’t have gone to Jamestown alone. Whoever accompanied her was probably dead by the time she became food for the starving. “If she’d had a family to protect her — after death as well as before — this probably wouldn’t have happened,” Horn said. \n \n Learning who she was will be difficult. Complete passenger lists for the voyages don’t exist. Research into the Virginia Company’s sponsors in Plymouth might reveal a family with a girl born in 1595 or 1596 who went to America. There may be extractable DNA in the bone fragments, but at this point, there are no descendants to compare it with. \n \n Even the appearance that Owsley and his collaborator, Kari Bruwelheide, gave the girl is to some extent guesswork. \n \n They used the thickness of facial tissue seen among girls in contemporary southern England to gauge Jane’s. They gave her consensus hair — light brown — not the red or blond of other latitudes and regions. They also chose not to depict her as she undoubtedly was before death — gaunt and emaciated. \n \n “But I didn’t make her look like a healthy, plump teenager either,” Owsley said. “I’m putting her in her circumstances.” \n \n Those include dirt on her face and a thousand-yard stare, but not, alas, her name.', 'Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The dram was bought for £7,600 \n \n A dram of vintage Scotch bought by a Chinese millionaire in a Swiss hotel bar for £7,600 was a fake, laboratory tests have concluded. \n \n Analysts from Scotland were called in by the Waldhaus Am See hotel in St Moritz after experts questioned the authenticity of the 2cl shot. \n \n It had been poured from an unopened bottle labelled as an 1878 Macallan single malt. \n \n It is believed to be the largest sum ever paid for a poured dram of Scotch. \n \n But analysis found that it was almost certainly not distilled before 1970. \n \n The hotel said it had accepted the findings and reimbursed the customer in full. \n \n Zhang Wei, 36, from Beijing - one of China\'s highest-earning online writers - had paid just under 10,000 Swiss francs (£7,600, $10,050) for the single shot while visiting the hotel\'s Devil\'s Place whisky bar in July. \n \n But suspicions about the spirit\'s provenance surfaced soon after the purchase, when whisky industry experts spotted discrepancies in the bottle\'s cork and label from newspaper articles. \n \n Image copyright Sandro Bernasconi Image caption Mr Zhang was photographed with hotel manager Sandro Bernasconi after buying the dram \n \n That prompted the Waldhaus to send a sample to Dunfermline-based specialists Rare Whisky 101 (RW101) for analysis. \n \n Carbon dating tests were then carried out by researchers from the University of Oxford, which suggested a 95% probability that the spirit was created between 1970 and 1972. \n \n Further lab tests by Fife-based alcohol analysts Tatlock and Thomson indicated that it was probably a blended Scotch, comprising 60% malt and 40% grain - ruling it out as a single malt. \n \n RW101 said the tests had shown that the bottle was ""almost worthless as a collector\'s item"". \n \n Had the bottle been genuine, it would have carried a bar-value of about 300,000 Swiss francs (£227,000). \n \n Image copyright Sandro Bernasconi Image caption The dram was poured from an unopened bottle that purported to be an 1878 Macallan \n \n Mr Zhang, who writes martial arts fantasy novels under the pen name Tang Jia San Shao, earned the equivalent of about $16.8m in 2015, according to China Daily. \n \n He bought the dram while on holiday with his grandmother at the Swiss hotel, which stocks 2,500 different whiskies. \n \n Waldhaus manager Sandro Bernasconi told BBC Scotland that the hotel had no idea the bottle was a fake. \n \n He said: ""My father bought the bottle of Macallan 25 years ago, when he was manager of this hotel, and it had not been opened. \n \n ""When Mr Zhang asked if he could try some, we told him it wasn\'t for sale.

Anthropologists studying the partial remains of a teenage girl—including her skull, jaw, and leg bone—say they bear the unmistakable marks of a cleaver and knife, reports the Washington Post. She had been, for lack of a better word, butchered. “Historians have to decide whether this type of thing happened,” says one of the Smithsonian scientists who worked on the project. “I think that it did. We didn’t see anybody eat this flesh, but it’s very strong evidence.” It's not clear whether the girl was a servant or perhaps the daughter of a colonist, or whether she was killed to be eaten or eaten after she died. Forensic scientists have re-created her face, though she will likely remain forever unidentified."
4,"['Click image above to view graphic \n \n Although the prospect of a pill for Alzheimer\'s remains a long way off, the landmark British study provides a major new pathway for future drug treatments. \n \n The compound works by blocking a faulty signal in brains affected by neurodegenerative diseases, which shuts down the production of essential proteins, leading to brain cells being unprotected and dying off. \n \n It was tested in mice with prion disease - the best animal model of human neurodegenerative disorders - but scientists said they were confident the same principles would apply in a human brain with debilitating brain diseases such as Alzheimer\'s or Parkinson\'s. \n \n The study, published today in the journal Science Translational Medicine, was carried out at the Medical Research Council\'s (MRC) Toxicology Unit at the University of Leicester. \n \n “It\'s a real step forward,” team leader Professor Giovanna Mallucci told The Independent. “It\'s the first time a substance has been given to mice that prevents brain disease. The fact that this is a compound that can be given orally, that gets into the brain and prevents brain disease, is a first in itself… We can go forward and develop better molecules and I can\'t see why preventing this process should only be restricted to mice. I think this probably will translate into other mammalian brains.” \n \n In debilitating brain diseases like Alzheimer\'s, the production of new proteins in the brain is shut down by a build-up of “misfolded proteins” or amyloids. This build-up leads to an “over-activation” of a natural defence mechanism that stops essential proteins being produced. Without these proteins to protect them, brain cells die off - leading to the symptoms of diseases like Alzheimer\'s. \n \n The compound used in the study works by inhibiting an enzyme, known as PERK, which plays a key role in activating this defence mechanism. In mice with prion\'s disease, it restored proteins to protect brain cells “stopping the disease in its tracks”, restoring some normal behaviours and preventing memory loss. \n \n Although the compound also produced significant side effects in mice, including weight loss and mild diabetes, which was caused by damage to the pancreas, Professor Mallucci said it would “not be impossible” to develop a drug that protected the brain without the side effects and that work towards doing so had been “very promising”. \n \n The breakthrough was greeted with excitement by scientists, who nonetheless cautioned that it remained a significant proof of principle and a possible basis for new treatments, rather than a guarantee of an Alzheimer\'s cure in the near future. \n \n Computer graphic of a vertical (coronal) slice through the brain of an Alzheimer patient (credit: Science Photo Library) \n \n Professor Roger Morris, acting head King\'s College London\'s department of chemistry, said: “This is the first convincing report that a small drug, of the type most conveniently turned into medicines, stops the progressive death of neurons in the brain as found, for instance, in Alzheimer\'s disease. True, this study has been done in mice, not man; and it is prion disease, not Alzheimer\'s, that has been cured. However, there is considerable evidence that the way neurons die in both diseases is similar; and lessons learned in mice from prion disease have proved accurate guides to attenuate the progress of Alzheimer\'s disease in patients.” \n \n “From finding the first effective drug in a mouse, to having an effective medicine in man, usually takes decades to bring to fruition, in the very few cases in which it is successful. So, a cure for Alzheimer\'s is not just around the corner. However, the critical point of principle made by Professor Mallucci\'s study is that a drug, given orally, can arrest neurodegeneration caused by amyloid in the brain. \n \n ”This finding, I suspect, will be judged by history as a turning point in the search for medicines to control and prevent Alzheimer\'s disease.“ \n \n David Allsopp, professor of neuroscience at Lancaster University said that the study had thrown up ”very dramatic and highly encouraging results“, but said that more research was needed to overcome the ""problematic side-effects"" and to prove the technique would be effective against other disease like Alzheimer\'s and Parkinson\'s. \n \n There are currently 800,000 people in the UK with dementia and Alzheimer\'s disease is the most common cause. The number of people living with the condition is set to break one million by 2021, and represents an enormous health burden for the NHS and the social care system. Parkinson\'s affect 1 in 500 people and around 127,000 people suffer from the condition. \n \n Dr Eric Karran, director of research at Alzheimer\'s Research UK, said: ""Targeting a mechanism relevant to a number of neurodegenerative diseases could yield a single drug with wide-reaching benefits, but this compound is still at an early stage. It will be important for these findings to be repeated and tested in models of other neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer\'s disease. While Alzheimer\'s is the most common form of dementia, other diseases that cause dementia are also characterised by the abnormal build-up of proteins in the brain. \n \n “If this process is also working overtime in these conditions too, targeting it could be a promising avenue for investigation. However, what is true in animals does not always hold true in people and the ultimate test for this compound will be to see whether it is safe and effective in people with these diseases.”', 'Scientists are hailing a landmark British study which has paved the way for a pill that can cure brain diseases such as Alzheimer\'s and Parkinson\'s by stopping the death of neurons. \n \n The Medical Research Council (MRC) team focused on the root cause of many degenerative brain diseases - abnormally shaped proteins that stick together in clumps and fibres. \n \n When enough misshapen protein builds up in the brain it can trigger a reaction that results in the death of nerve cells. \n \n Other approaches have sought to stop or limit the accumulation of the abnormal protein, whose structure is folded the wrong way. \n \n But this research, published in the journal Science Translational Medicine, targeted the harmful way brain cells react to misfolded proteins. \n \n Using a drug injected into the stomachs of mice through a mouth tube, they flipped a cellular switch from ""off"" to ""on"" to prevent neurons dying. \n \n Five weeks after treatment one group of mice remained free of symptoms such as memory loss, impaired reflexes and limb dragging. \n \n They also lived longer than untreated animals with the same brain disease. \n \n During the study, a neurodegenerative disease caused by abnormal prion proteins was induced in the mice. \n \n Prion diseases, which include Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD), are rare in humans but share the same underlying cause - misfolded proteins - as more common conditions such as Alzheimer\'s. \n \n Lead scientist Professor Giovanna Mallucci, from the MRC Toxicology Unit, said: ""We were extremely excited when we saw the treatment stop the disease in its tracks and protect brain cells, restoring some normal behaviours and preventing memory loss in the mice."" \n \n The scientists stress human trials are a long way off and point out that the mice suffered serious side effects, including significant weight loss and raised blood sugar. \n \n But they also believe the research demonstrates in principle the possibility of developing an oral treatment - a pill or swallowed liquid - that can protect the brain from neurodegenerative disease. \n \n The research is at a very early stage and it could be a decade or more before the medicine is actually developed. \n \n But experts said the findings were highly significant. \n \n Professor Roger Morris, from King\'s College London, said: ""This is the first convincing report that a small drug, of the type most conveniently turned into medicines, stops the progressive death of neurons in the brain as found, for instance, in Alzheimer\'s disease. \n \n ""True, this study has been done in mice, not man; and it is prion disease, not Alzheimer\'s, that has been cured. \n \n ""However, there is considerable evidence that the way neurons die in both diseases is similar; and lessons learned in mice from prion disease have proved accurate guides to attenuate the progress of Alzheimer\'s disease in patients."" \n \n He added: ""This finding, I suspect, will be judged by history as a turning point in the search for medicines to control and prevent Alzheimer\'s disease."" \n \n Professor David Allsop, from the University of Lancaster, said: ""Inhibiting this pathway has produced some very dramatic and highly encouraging results in mice infected with prion disease. \n \n ""The main caveats of the research, however, are that prion disease is very rare in humans, and it is not yet clear if the same approach will be viable for much more common neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer\'s disease and Parkinson\'s disease. \n \n ""More research is needed to determine if this approach is valid for any condition other than prion disease, and also to find ways of getting around these problematic side-effects.""', 'Image caption Enormous underground detectors are needed to catch neutrinos, that are so elusive as to be dubbed ""ghost particles"" \n \n A meeting at Cern, the world\'s largest physics lab, has addressed results that suggest subatomic particles have gone faster than the speed of light. \n \n The team has published its work so other scientists can determine if the approach contains any mistakes. \n \n If it does not, one of the pillars of modern science may come tumbling down. \n \n Antonio Ereditato added ""words of caution"" to his Cern presentation because of the ""potentially great impact on physics"" of the result. \n \n The speed of light is widely held to be the Universe\'s ultimate speed limit, and much of modern physics -

Detainees in at least eight prisons have declared their intention to stop all work on Monday — Martin Luther King Jr. Day — to demand an end to unpaid labor and price gouging in prison commissaries, as well as the restoration of parole, among other requests. \n \n Coordinated, nonviolent prison protests, as well as spontaneous uprisings amid deteriorating conditions, have escalated in recent years both nationwide and in Florida, which has the third-largest prison system in the country. Prisoners in the state were among the most active during a nationwide strike in September 2016, which was quickly dubbed the “largest prison strike in U.S. history.” At least 10 Florida prisons participated in that action, which was planned to coincide with the 45th anniversary of the Attica prison uprising but started a day early when tensions flared at Holmes Correctional Institution in the Florida Panhandle. Then, in August, in response to prison activists’ calls for another show of dissent, Department of Corrections officials placed the entire state system — 143 facilities and 97,000 people — on lockdown, an unprecedented move. \n \n Incarcerated organizers of this week’s strike have chosen to remain anonymous to prevent retaliation, but they shared a statement outlining their demands with outside supporters. In an audio message from prison shared with The Intercept, one of the organizers described the action as a “nonviolent protest to get what we deserve from our government.” \n \n “They use wordplay and deceive the public about what really goes on inside the system, and we want to expose those things,” he said. \n \n Prison officials regularly retaliate against organizers by restricting their visitation rights and contact with other inmates, and sometimes even moving them to different facilities, which makes it harder for reports of protests to reach the public. But despite the challenges, “prisoners are pretty well-organized and coordinated inside the prisons and throughout the prison system,” said Panagioti Tsolkas, an organizer with the prisoners’ rights and environmentalist group Campaign to Fight Toxic Prisons. Tsolkas, who communicates regularly with activists inside, said some of the upcoming strike’s organizers have already been placed in solitary confinement in retaliation for their efforts. \n \n In response to questions about the planned strike, a spokesperson for the Florida Department of Corrections wrote in a statement to The Intercept that “the department will continue to ensure the safe operation of our correctional institutions.” \n \n “Slave Labor” and Price Gouging \n \n Florida prisoners work both inside the prisons — doing laundry, cooking, maintaining the facilities, and growing food — and on outside “community work squads.” According to the corrections department, in 2017 the latter group alone performed 3.15 million hours of work valued at more than $38 million statewide, including cleanup work after Hurricane Irma. \n \n “Our goal is to make the governor realize that it will cost the state of Florida millions of dollars daily to contract outside companies to come and cook, clean, and handle the maintenance,” the prisoners wrote in their statement. “This will cause a total BREAK DOWN.” \n \n Prisoners are demanding compensation for their work as opposed to “the current slave arrangement,” they wrote, in which they are paid in time deducted from their sentences. “A lot of times people will work in order to get time deducted, and then the prison guards and officials will find ways to punish someone for what the prisoners are saying are made up reasons that then extend the person’s time,” Jacqueline Azis, an attorney with the Florida chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, told The Intercept. \n \n “We want to be paid for the work we do, so that somebody doesn’t end up spending 10, 15, 20 years not being paid, and sent home with a bus ticket and a $50 check,” the prisoner speaking in the recording said. “We want to create an environment where someone can do their time, be rehabilitated, and enter into society with some type of hope.” \n \n “That would be helpful for society instead of creating a revolving door where you lock people up and just set them up for failure so that they keep coming back.” \n \n Prisoners are also calling for fairer pricing of goods they can purchase in prison — claiming, for example, that a case of soup that costs $4 on the outside is sold for $17 by prison commissaries (the DOC disputed that claim and provided the following list of canteen prices). \n \n “This is highway robbery without a gun,” the prisoners wrote. “It’s not just us that they’re taking from. It’s our families who struggle to make ends meet and send us money — they are the real victims that the state of Florida is taking advantage of.” \n \n Strike organizers are also calling on Florida to restore parole — which the state eliminated for non-capital felonies in 1984. “When someone is sentenced to life in prison, it means life in prison in Florida,” said Azis. “There is no chance that good behavior in prison will get someone out earlier.” \n \n The lack of parole has compounded the system’s colossal overcrowding, which in turn has contributed to some of the harshest and most violent prison conditions in the country. “There are so many unexplained deaths,” Lisa Graybill, deputy legal director for criminal justice reform at the Southern Poverty Law Center, told The Intercept. “They’re just appalling.” \n \n A prisoner works on the lawn at Dade Correctional Institution, where mentally ill prisoner Darren Rainey died in 2012, in Florida City, Florida, July 10, 2014. Photo:Lynne Sladky/AP \n \n Unexplained Deaths in Custody \n \n Deaths in Florida state prisons — including homicides and a spate of suicides — have skyrocketed in recent years, soaring from 191 in 2000 to 356 in 2016. \n \n Among those killed in custody was Darren Rainey, a mentally ill prisoner who was scalded to death at Dade Correctional Institution in 2012 when guards locked him in a hot shower for two hours. The water reached temperatures as high as 180 degrees, according to witnesses, including a nurse on duty that night who said that the heat controls were in a neighboring room controlled by guards. \n \n Following Rainey’s death, a devastating investigation by the Miami Herald detailed more unexplained and brutal deaths, as well as system-wide neglect and abuse and efforts to cover up prison officials’ wrongdoing. Randall Jordan-Aparo, an inmate with disabilities at Franklin Correctional Institution, was killed in 2010 when guards beat him and gassed him with a chemical agent after he begged for medical help for days (prison guards later took to Facebook to mock his death). Another prisoner allegedly hanged herself while her hands were tied. \n \n The corrections department has also been sued over its treatment of prisoners with disabilities and its failure to treat prisoners with hepatitis C, and rights groups have called on the Department of Justice — twice — to open a federal civil rights investigation into the state’s prisons. “These problems are chronic,” Graybill said. “They haven’t been addressed and they’re not going away.” \n \n Like most other states, Florida went on an “incarceration binge” in the 1990s, Graybill said. But unlike most other states — some 36 of which have undertaken some kind of criminal justice reform — the state has consistently refused to reconsider its policies. \n \n “The solution for Florida is clear,” she said. “It needs to improve the conditions of confinement in its facilities, and one way it can afford to do that is by ensuring that it is only incarcerating the people who truly need to be incarcerated.” \n \n “The question becomes, Why has the legislature been so unwilling or unable to do that?” \n \n “This Is Florida … We’ll Beat Your Ass!” \n \n In addition to denouncing brutal conditions of confinement, the prisoners are demanding broader criminal justice reform in Florida — including restored voting rights and a moratorium on executions. \n \n Florida is one of four states in the country — with Kentucky, Iowa, and Virginia — that imposes lifetime disenfranchisement for people convicted of felonies. That means 1.5 million state residents can’t vote because of their criminal history. “People who have already paid their debt to society are essentially prevented from being active citizens,” said Azis, the ACLU lawyer. \n \n A proposed constitutional amendment could change that — if it can garner enough support to get on the ballot — but until that passes, the only potential path to the vote is for each disenfranchised individual to personally appeal to the governor, Rick Scott. Scott grants only 8 percent of those appeals, with little transparency on the decision-making process and a backlog of 10,000 applications awaiting review, the New York Times recently reported. The process leaves restoration of the right to vote dependent on the governor’s personal convictions. In a hearing on the voting rights of a man who had been convicted of manslaughter in a drunken driving incident, for instance, Scott said he would need to think about it — then noted, with his mic accidentally still on, “That’s how my uncle died.” \n \n Scott also wields disproportionate power when it comes to the state’s death penalty. After newly elected prosecutor Aramis Ayala — Florida’s first black state attorney – said she would not seek the death penalty in her district, which includes Orlando, Scott moved 29 potential capital cases to a different jurisdiction. Ayala appealed, but the state’s Supreme Court ruled in the governor’s favor, forcing her to walk back her ban. Last year, Florida moved to tighten its death penalty laws by requiring a unanimous jury verdict after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the previous sentencing protocol was unconstitutional. The move made dozens of people eligible for re-sentencing, but the state limited retroactive application to those sentenced after 2002 — leaving approximately 200 on death row with sentences ineligible for review. \n \n Finally, prisoners planning the strike are joining the local community’s protest against a phosphate mine set to surround the Reception and Medical Center near Lake Butler, where new arrivals and inmates with medical conditions are housed. Residents and prisoners fear the health consequences of water contamination and exposure to potential carcinogens linked to phosphate mining. \n \n Kevin “Rashid” Johnson arrived at the Reception and Medical Center last spring. \n \n Johnson, a well-known prison activist, jailhouse lawyer, and prolific writer and critic of prison abuse, had already been moved from Virginia to Texas under an interstate agreement that allows for the transfer of prisoners — ostensibly for public safety reasons, but often as a punitive measure. \n \n That Johnson would be transferred to Florida “is a piece of evidence of how the Florida prison system is viewed even by the prison industry itself,” said Tsolkas, who has been communicating with him ahead of the upcoming strike. “Appalachia wasn’t bad enough. Texas wasn’t bad enough. Well, you’re going to the swamps.” \n \n At the RMC, Johnson wrote in July, a guard told him that he was “not in Virginia, or wherever else” he might have been previously. “You will answer us only as ‘no sir’ and ‘yessir,’ ‘no ma’am’ and ‘yes ma’am.’ You forget this and we’ll kick your fucking teeth out,” the guard said, according to Johnson. “This is Florida, and we’ll beat your ass! We’ll kill you!” \n \n That didn’t stop Johnson from continuing to expose prison abuse in Florida, or from joining the state prisoners’ organizing efforts, including ahead of Monday’s strike. \n \n “What the prisoners are asking for is not only completely reasonable, but should be the bare minimum of how we treat an individual that the state is in charge of caring for,” said Azis. “I would hope that whatever the DOC’s response is, it is an ethical and responsible way of addressing these real concerns.”']",4,"– Scientists are calling it a breakthrough and a turning point: In a new study, a compound successfully halted brain cell death in mice, meaning we're one step closer to a pill that can treat Alzheimer's, the Independent reports. Neurodegenerative diseases halt the production of key proteins, which in turn results in the unprotected brain cells dying off, and symptoms appearing. The compound blocks the faulty brain signal that causes the initial ""shutdown,"" thus basically flipping the switch from ""off"" back to ""on."" Proteins are produced, brain cells are protected, and symptoms are reversed. The mice in the study had prion disease, which is similar to a human neurodegenerative disorder. After receiving the compound, memory loss and other symptoms including impaired reflexes and limb dragging were reversed; the treated mice also lived longer than those who didn't receive the compound, Sky News reports. Though it's still a long way off, scientists think a treatment based on these findings could also help people with Parkinson's disease. Now the bad news: The mice did suffer side effects, including weight loss and diabetes.

The StEP Initiative created a map of the world\'s e-waste, which is available online. [Infographic: Tracking the World\'s E-Waste] \n \n Until now, comprehensive data on global e-waste has been hard to come by, and countries define e-waste very differently. For example, the United States only includes consumer electronics such as TVs and computers, whereas European nations include everything that has a battery or power cord in the e-waste category. \n \n ""This is why we have developed this e-waste map. It\'s the first time we\'re introducing really comparable data,"" said Ruediger Kuehr of United Nations University, in Germany, and executive secretary of the StEP Initiative. ""In addition, it gives magnitude to the issue on a national level, so policymakers are aware of the issue in order to take action,"" Kuehr told LiveScience. \n \n Mapping worldwide e-waste \n \n The U.S. and China produce more total e-waste than any other country. [ See full-size infographic Credit: Ross Toro, Infographic Artist \n \n The interactive e-waste map shows data from 184 countries on the estimated amount of electrical and electronic equipment that hits the market and how much e-waste it ultimately generates. Having this data could help governments and companies manage their e-waste. \n \n The world produced nearly 54 million tons (49 million metric tons) of used electrical and electronic products last year. That\'s an average of about 43 lbs. (20 kg), or the weight of eight bricks, for each of the 7 billion people on Earth. \n \n The StEP Initiative forecasts that by 2017, the world will produce about 33 percent more e-waste, or 72 million tons (65 million metric tons). That amount weighs about 11 times as much as the Great Pyramid of Giza. \n \n China currently leads the world in production of electrical and electronic equipment. In 2012, China produced about 12.2 million tons (11.1 million metric tons), followed by the U.S. with about 11 million tons (10 million metric tons). \n \n However, the United States eclipses China in e-waste generation, because more products previously put on the market in the U.S. are likely to be retired. In 2012, the U.S. produced about 10.4 million tons (9.4 million metric tons), versus China\'s 8 million tons (7.3 million metric tons). \n \n The U.S. generated the seventh highest amount of e-waste per person — about 66 lbs. (30 kg) per capita. (The country with the highest per capita e-waste was Qatar.) \n \n E-waste in the U.S. \n \n The U.S. National Center for Electronics Recycling (NCER) and MIT have released a detailed report on U.S. generation, collection and export of used electronics in conjunction with the e-waste map. \n \n The U.S. generated about 258.2 million units of used computers, monitors, TVs and cellphones in 2010, 171.4 million of which were collected for recycling, and 14.4 million were exported, according to the report. [Green Guide to Holiday Electronic Gifts (Op-Ed)] \n \n The U.S. is a major exporter of used electronics. The U.S. exports more CRT (cathode ray tube) monitors by weight than any other product, and more cellphones than any other electronics product in terms of numbers. \n \n However, export numbers could be an underestimate, because exporters want to keep them quiet in order to bypass restrictions or bad press, said Jason Linnell, executive director of NCER. \n \n In terms of recycling, ""We are a little bit behind compared with countries in the European Union,"" Linnell told LiveScience.European countries have had established e-waste recycling programs for more than 10 years, whereas only 25 U.S. states have started similar programs, Linnell said. \n \n But recycling of e-waste is on the rise. ""We\'re seeing more recycling programs, and a lot of states are collecting 5 to 6 lbs. (2.3 to 2.7 kg) of e-waste per person per year,"" he said. \n \n ""It\'s better than the past, but we we still have a ways to go,"" Linnell said. \n \n Follow Tanya Lewis on Twitterand Google+.

Original article on LiveScience.', 'It has been called the “dirty underbelly” of electronics. \n \n E-waste — all those discarded electrical or electronic devices, from cell phones and TVs to tablets and computers. \n \n The numbers are staggering. And now, a world e-waste map — the first of its kind — shows just how staggering. \n \n The average Canadian, for example, generated about 24 kilograms of e-waste in 2012. That’s more than 860,000 tonnes for the entire country, roughly equivalent to the weight of about 1,700 fully loaded Boeing 747s at take off. \n \n But the biggest producer of e-waste is the United States, with an astonishing 9,359,000 tonnes produced in 2012, about 29 kilograms per person, according to the map, which was created by a number of agencies through their “solving e-waste problem” (StEP) initiative. \n \n The numbers are mind-boggling, said Josh Lepawsky, a professor at Memorial University in St. John’s, N.L., and a member of StEP. \n \n “The main purpose (of the map) is to give a sense how much electronic waste is present in any given any country,” said Lepawsky. \n \n It also allows a comparison between purchasing power in different countries, which is a measure of wealth, he said. \n \n (The richer the country, the more e-waste it generally generates.) \n \n By 2017, the volume of discarded e-products worldwide is expected to be 33 per cent higher than in 2012 and weigh the equivalent of eight of the Great Pyramids of Egypt. \n \n Haiti is among the lowest producers of e-waste in the world, with less than 8,000 tonnes produced in 2012, or less than one kilogram per person. \n \n Afghanistan, too, was among the lowest in the world, with less than 19,000 tonnes of e-waste for the country, or 0.58 kilogram per person. \n \n The map is surprising in parts, said Lepawsky. \n \n Singapore is much wealthier than Canada, he said, “when you look at e-waste generated.” In Singapore, a tiny country, the average person generated about 36 kilograms in 2012. \n \n “The world is changing quite quickly,” he said. \n \n Luxembourg is another example. \n \n It has a much smaller population than the U.S., 520,000, compared to more than 314 million, but more new electrical and electronic equipment comes to the market in Luxembourg per capita. \n \n (The U.S. is the largest consumer in absolute terms but it is behind Luxembourg in per capita terms.) \n \n It is a disheartening number, said Miriam Diamond, a professor in the department of earth sciences at the University of Toronto, referring to the e-waste that emanates from Canada. \n \n “It represents throwing away a tremendous amount of energy that went into making it in the first place.” \n \n Used electronics often make their way to the developing world where some are reused. \n \n But, Diamond says, “In a lot of the recycling sector, they are dismantled by hand. That is a serious threat to health and the environment.” \n \n Innovation is a trademark in the world of electronics, especially in the world of cellphones, laptops and computers, where engineers come up with distinct, sleek styles to lure people to buy more. \n \n “Why won’t these same smart people also find a way that electronics can be used longer or reused in the best way, too?” she asked. \n \n The cost of mining new resources is also staggering. \n \n “These minerals that we mine are scarce. . . is it worth it? Mining, too, has negative impact on people and places.” \n \n For Lepawsky, the solution to the tonnes of e-waste is relatively simple. \n \n “Stop buying new electronics; use what you have for longer,” he said, adding that sometimes buying new products is about fashion more than anything else.', 'An employee holds circuit boards at the Coopermiti warehouse of electronic waste in Sao Paulo March 6, 2013. According to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), Brazil generates the greatest amount of electronic waste (e-waste) per capita among emerging countries. \n \n OSLO (Reuters) - China and other emerging economies have overtaken Western nations in dumping old electronic goods, from TVs to cellphones, and will lead a projected 33 percent surge in the amount of waste from 2012 to 2017, a U.N.-backed alliance said on Sunday. \n \n The report, the first to map electronic waste by country to promote recycling and safer disposal of often toxic parts, shows how the economic rise of developing nations is transforming the world economy even in terms of pollution. \n \n ""The e-waste problem requires attention globally,"" Ruediger Kuehr of the U.N. University and executive secretary of the Solving the E-Waste Problem (StEP) initiative, told Reuters. StEP is run by U.N. agencies, governments, NGOs and scientists. \n \n The weight of electronic goods discarded every year worldwide would rise to 65.4 million tonnes from 2012 to 2017 from 48.9 million in 2012, with most of the growth in developing nations, StEP said. \n \n By 2017, it would make the annual piles of old washing machines, computers, fridges, electronic toys and other goods with an electric cord or battery the weight equivalent of 200 Empire State Buildings or 11 Great Pyramids of Giza, it said. \n \n Some waste from rich countries ends up in developing nations, where many people work in hazardous conditions for low wages dismantling it. \n \n Waste from emerging countries, as well as Russia and other former Soviet bloc nations, overtook totals from Western nations such as the United States, the European Union, Japan and Australia around 2012, StEP data showed. \n \n In that year, the West produced 23.5 million tonnes of waste and all others 25.4 million, a shift from the previous estimates for 2007 when the West accounted for most, StEP said. \n \n MOUNTAINS OF TRASH \n \n By 2017, trash from the West would rise to 28.6 million tonnes, far less than the 36.7 million from other countries, a side-effect of the economic rise of emerging nations such as India, Brazil and South Africa. \n \n ""Although there is ample information about the negative environmental and health impacts of primitive e-waste recycling methods, the lack of comprehensive data has made it hard to grasp the full magnitude of the problem,"" Kuehr said in the report. \n \n Consumers could help with better recycling, especially at Christmas, he said. \n \n Waste can be valuable if recycled. One study estimated that a million cellphones can yield 24 kg (53 lb) of gold, 250 kg of silver, 9 kg of palladium and more than 9 tonnes of copper. \n \n Sunday\'s report also showed that the average person on the planet produces 7 kg of electronic waste every year. Americans were among the highest with 29.8 kg each. \n \n Separately, U.S.-based experts trying to track the fate of waste said that about two-thirds of U.S. electronics waste is collected for re-use or recycling and that only 8.5 percent of the collected units are exported. \n \n Bigger electronic items, especially TVs and computer monitors, were exported to nations including Mexico, Venezuela, Paraguay and China, it said. Smaller items often went to Asia. \n \n Jeremy Gregory, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a co-author of the report, told Reuters it was hard to track trade because the waste is often merely described as ""mixed metals"" on import documents. \n \n StEP urged nations to adopt clearer trade descriptions. \n \n For StEP maps, click here: here \n \n (Editing by Alison Williams)', 'A senior U.S. Secret Service agent posted Facebook condemnations of President Trump during the past seven months, including one in which she said she wouldn\'t want to ""take a bullet"" for him. \n \n She explained herself saying she viewed his presidential candidacy as a ""disaster"" for the country, and especially for women and minorities. \n \n Kerry O\'Grady, the special agent in charge of the Secret Service\'s Denver district, oversees coordination with Washington-based advance teams for all presidential candidate and presidential trips to the area, including all upcoming or future trips by the president, vice president or Trump administration officials. \n \n Subscribe today to get intelligence and analysis on defense and national security issues in your Inbox each weekday morning from veteran journalists Jamie McIntyre and Jacqueline Klimas.

You should receive your first issue soon! \n \n Despite her senior security role, she has made her disdain for Trump and his incoming administration clear to her Facebook followers, who included current and former Secret Service agents and other people who were employees at the time of the posts. O\'Grady\'s posts triggered at least one complaint to the office that oversees investigations into Secret Service misbehavior, two knowledgeable sources told the Washington Examiner. \n \n In one Facebook post O\'Grady wrote at 11:07 p.m. on a Sunday in October, she endorsed Hillary Clinton and said she would endure ""jail time"" rather than ""taking a bullet"" for what she regarded as a ""disaster"" for America. \n \n The post didn\'t mention Trump by name but clearly referred to him. \n \n In the same post, she mentioned the Hatch Act, which bars executive branch staff, except the president, vice president and some other senior executive officials, from engaging in certain political activities. \n \n ""As a public servant for nearly 23 years, I struggle not to violate the Hatch Act. So I keep quiet and skirt the median,"" she wrote. ""To do otherwise can be a criminal offense for those in my position. Despite the fact that I am expected to take a bullet for both sides. \n \n ""But this world has changed and I have changed. And I would take jail time over a bullet or an endorsement for what I believe to be disaster to this country and the strong and amazing women and minorities who reside here. Hatch Act be damned. I am with Her."" \n \n Secret Service employees are among those federal employees subject to enhanced Hatch Act restrictions, including these two rules: \n \n May not post a comment to a blog or a social media site that advocates for or against a partisan political party, candidate for partisan political office, or partisan political group. \n \n May not use any email account or social media to distribute, send or forward content that advocates for or against a partisan political party, candidate for partisan political office, or partisan political group. \n \n Asked for comment, the U.S. Secret Service responded: ""The USSS is aware of the postings and we are looking into the matter."" \n \n In a lengthy interview with the Washington Examiner Monday, O\'Grady said she took down the post after two to three days of greater reflection and wasn\'t trying to imply she wouldn\'t take a bullet for Trump or any officials in the Trump administration. \n \n ""It was an internal struggle for me but as soon as I put it up, I thought it was not the sentiment that I needed to share because I care very deeply about the mission,"" she said. \n \n O\'Grady repeatedly stressed that she would in no way shirk her duties to protect the president because of her opposition to Trump\'s candidacy and support for Clinton. \n \n ""No, not at all. I firmly believe in this job. I\'m proud to do it and we serve the office of the president,"" she said. \n \n At the time of the posting, she said she was reacting to news about Trump sexually assaulting women. O\'Grady\'s Facebook post came in the wake of the release of a video in which Trump and ""Access Hollywood"" host Billy Bush engaged in a lewd conversation about women in which Trump bragged about being able to grab women by their genitals. \n \n O\'Grady said she had experienced sexual assault in college and ""there was a very emotional reaction to what was said."" \n \n ""But I recognize that the agency is the most important thing to me. My government is the most important thing to me,"" she said. ""I serve at the pleasure of the president, but I still have the First Amendment right to say things."" \n \n O\'Grady\'s negative stance regarding Trump did not end when he became president. \n \n O\'Grady posted the logo for the Women\'s March on Denver as her Facebook cover backdrop on Inauguration Day, Friday, Jan. 21 at 12:25 p.m. \n \n When one of her Facebook followers commented that ""none of these women represent me #justsayin,"" O\'Grady countered that ""all of these women represent me! Proud to say it! #nasty."" That back and forth, captured in a screengrab of the post, no longer appears on O\'Grady\'s Facebook page. \n \n Women anti-Trump activists have taken on the label of ""nasty woman"" to demonstrate their opposition to him. The phrase is a reference to Trump\'s remark calling Clinton ""such a nasty woman"" in the final moments of the presidential debate in late October. \n \n At 11:23 p.m. on Inauguration Day, she updated her profile picture to an artist\'s rendering of Princess Leia with the words, ""A woman\'s place is in the resistance."" ""The resistance,"" with its allusion to the rebels in the ""Star Wars"" movies, has become a moniker for those opposing Trump\'s presidency. \n \n Those posts remained on O\'Grady\'s Facebook page as of Monday afternoon. She took the posts down after her interview with the Washington Examiner and replaced them with a backdrop of a snowy scene and a smiling photo of herself sporting ski gear. \n \n The Department of Homeland Security\'s Office of the Inspector General, which investigates agency complaints of misbehavior, received a complaint about O\'Grady\'s Facebook posts on Oct. 11, a source said. \n \n It\'s unclear whether the Secret Service explicitly bans agents and other employees from engaging in political speech on social media or has written rules prohibiting it. \n \n But in operational security training, instructors have long warned agents or would-be agents against the use of social media because it can make them vulnerable to threats by exposing their personal information and their movements, according to two knowledgeable sources. \n \n In another pre-election post that no longer appears on her Facebook page, O\'Grady shared a Huffington Post story with the headline: ""Scott Baio Defends Trump\'s Sexism with More Sexism."" She accompanied her Facebook post of the story with the words: ""One word: douche. How do you like them apples?!"" \n \n In a post in late November, O\'Grady shared Facebook remarks from the liberal news outlet Vox, which carried a photo of Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., and a story with the headline, ""Donald Trump nominates Jeff Sessions to serve as attorney general."" The Vox Facebook post commented, ""Just a few years ago, this would have been unimaginable."" \n \n O\'Grady added her own comment on the post: ""We are moving our civil rights into a period of bigotry, misogyny and racism that this country has not tolerated for decades. Dark ages. I am horrified and dismayed beyond words."" \n \n O\'Grady appears to have removed the pre-election posts after fellow and former Secret Service agents complained to her supervisors and the Office of the Inspector General, according to two sources familiar with the timing of the posts\' removal. \n \n At publishing time, O\'Grady released the following statement: \n \n ""I serve this country with pride and I proudly diligently and fiercely protect and support the institutions and pillars of our republic established by the very same document that allows my free expression. I do so with every fiber of my being for the very reason that those institutions are in place to guarantee my right and the rights of all our citizens to voice and express our opinions and beliefs even when and especially when those values may be contrary to those of the party in power. My devotion to mission and country is only strengthened by the fact that the founders recognize the value of dissent and the freedom to assemble and voice those opposing convictions. \n \n ""They enshrine those rights for future generations so we avoid the path of authoritarian regimes that shackle their people with fear."" \n \n In response to whether her expression of her opposition to Trump would affect her ability to do her job, she said:', 'Syrian Deputy Prime Minister Qadri Jamil this week dismissed as mere election politics President Obama\'s implicit threat to intervene should the Syrian regime deploy its chemical weapons stockpile. (Andrey Smirnov, AFP/Getty Images / ) \n \n WASHINGTON — The Pentagon has made contingency plans to send small teams of special operations troops into Syria if the White House decides it needs to secure chemical weapons depots now controlled by security forces loyal to President Bashar Assad, senior U.S. officials said. \n \n President Obama warned this week that any effort by Assad to move or use his arsenal of chemical munitions in the country\'s conflict would cross a ""red line,"" implying it could prompt swift U.S. intervention. \n \n But Pentagon planners are more focused on protecting or destroying any Syrian stockpiles that are left unguarded and at risk falling into the hands of rebel fighters or militias aligned with Al Qaeda, Hezbollah or other militant groups. \n \n Securing the sites would probably involve stealthy raids by special operations teams trained to handle such weapons, and precision airstrikes to incinerate the chemicals without dispersing them in the air, the officials said. U.S. satellites and drone aircraft already maintain partial surveillance of the sites. \n \n U.S. intelligence agencies believe Syria has over the years produced or acquired hundreds of tons of sarin nerve agent and mustard gas, a blister agent, and has sought to develop VX, another powerful nerve gas. The toxicity of some chemical agents degrades significantly over time, so it is unclear how lethal the stockpiles are. \n \n Experts say the chemical agents are stored in bunkers and other sites around the country. Four production facilities are near the cities of Aleppo, Hama and Homs, all tinderboxes in the 17-month uprising, as well as the coastal city of Latakia, an area considered a stronghold for Assad\'s Alawite religious sect. \n \n An unclassified report by the director of national intelligence this year said Syria\'s chemical agents ""can be delivered by aerial bombs, ballistic missiles and artillery rockets."" But Syrian rockets, including Scud missiles procured from North Korea, are notoriously inaccurate, making them ineffective for delivering a heavy concentration of toxic chemicals to a specific target. \n \n They can be very effective, however, at creating chaos. \n \n ""The actual killing may be less important than the panic they would induce,"" said Leonard Spector, who heads the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Monterey Institute of International Studies. \n \n Although he did not make an explicit threat, Obama\'s comments at the White House on Monday were widely seen as a direct warning to Assad that the U.S. would take military action if necessary to stop the use of chemical weapons. But officials said later that no large-scale U.S. intervention is likely unless it is part of an international coalition. \n \n ""You shouldn\'t interpret what Obama said to mean that there would be automatic military action, but rather that we would respond as part of an international effort,"" said one senior official. \n \n Officials said Obama could make a unilateral decision, however, to order special forces teams to stop weapons of mass destruction from falling into the wrong hands. \n \n Pentagon officials and senior military officers said the Syrian stockpiles seem well guarded for now, and they stressed that the White House has not ordered detailed planning of operations aimed at securing the facilities. \n \n ""We have done contingency planning but we\'re not doing detailed planning — identifying numbers [of troops], units and platforms — until the White House tells us we need a specific plan for this,"" a senior officer said. \n \n Although U.S. officials said they are closely monitoring the unconventional weapons sites, they also acknowledge the stockpiles are large enough that some materials, such as small artillery shells filled with chemical agents, could be relocated without their knowledge. \n \n U.S. officials told reporters last month that they had evidence Syrian forces were moving some chemical arms, apparently to keep them away from areas of fighting. \n \n Assad\'s government has said it will not use chemical munitions against the Syrian people, though it has implied they could be used if foreign troops sought to intervene in the war. \n \n ""Any chemical or bacterial weapon will never be used — and I repeat will never be used — during the crisis in Syria, regardless of the developments,"" Jihad Makdissi, a Syrian government spokesman, told reporters last month. ""These weapons are stored and secured by Syrian military forces and under its direct supervision and will never be used unless Syria faces external aggression."" \n \n Analysts say it\'s unclear how much of the chemical arsenal could be deployed, and they note that the agents, particularly VX and sarin, may have weakened if the regime isn\'t regularly refilling its stocks. U.S. intelligence officials have said that Syria, which is under international sanctions, relies heavily on foreign sources for chemicals and other key parts of its weapons program. \n \n The VX stockpiles maintained by former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein\'s government had a shelf life of about six months, and the sarin less than two years, the EU Non-Proliferation Consortium, a network of European think tanks, said in a report last month. \n \n ""To keep those sorts of quantities replenished, you have to have a very robust program,"" said Charles P. Blair, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Federation of American Scientists, a Washington-based group. \n \n In response to a reporter\'s question Monday, Obama mentioned Syria\'s biological weapons program. But that appears a minor concern at this point. \n \n In 2008, Army Lt. Gen. Michael D. Maples, then director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, testified before Congress that Syria had ""a program to develop select biological agents as weapons"" and that the program was ""in the research and development stage."" \n \n U.S. officials no longer appear to believe that Syria is actively pursuing a biological weapons program. The unclassified U.S. intelligence report this year said only that Syria had the infrastructure to support the development of biological weapons. \n \n david.cloud@latimes.com \n \n sbengali@latimes.com']",5,"– Electronic waste is growing at a staggering rate—Americans alone chucked an average of 65 pounds of old electronic goods each last year—and it is set to surge another 33% within five years unless consumers and producers change their ways, LiveScience reports. Most of the waste ends up in developing nations, and those countries plus the former Soviet bloc now produce more electronic waste of their own than Western nations, according to a new map that tracks the problem worldwide for the first time. The world produced around 54 million tons of electronic waste in total last year, researchers found, and though it can be valuable—a million old cell phones can yield 53 pounds of gold and 550 pounds of silver, Reuters notes—recycling rates remain low and where e-waste is recycled, it is often done so in a way harmful to both the environment and workers' health.

He did what was necessary to ensure their well-being.” \n \n BREAKING… EXCLUSIVE… FRIDAY 8:30 PM: NBC insiders tell me The Tonight Show went through ”downsizing” today and that 20 staffers lost their jobs. Others tell me the number is more like 25, and producers were forced to take pay cuts or lose their jobs. I’ve also learned that Jay Leno took what is being described as a “tremendous” pay cut to “save as many people’s jobs as he could”. Leno’s Tonight Show is consistently the #1 late night talk show in both households and demographics, except for some anomalies when Leno does get beaten. And that’s despite the fact that the network’s primetime ratings have been dismal for many years or that Leno himself was harshly criticized by the media for that January 2010 standoff with Conan O’Brien. Even so, The Tonight Show has been and still is a cash cow for NBC. So what happened to merit the downsizing? “I don’t think ad sales are off. I just think the people who bought this company, Comcast, wants to go through everything at NBC and get their money back,” an NBC insider tells me. ”It’s hard to go through those kinds of cuts. It’s more a network issue than a late-night issue. And I would say that Jay doesn’t get credit for digging out of a gigantic hole every single night. He’s a very valuable guy to NBC and someday everyone will understand that. He does a great job.” \n \n Related: Gabby Douglas & Michelle Obama Give ‘Tonight Show’ A Bump \n \n The downsizing also comes just 5 days after First Lady Michelle Obama appeared as a guest for the third time on The Tonight Show: high unemployment, job creation, and taxing the rich vs the poor all are issues in the 2012 president campaign. Leno has said publicly that he’s able to bank his entire Tonight Show salary and live on the hefty fees he makes from his hectic personal appearance schedule. Leno’s new salary is reportedly $27M-$30 million a year. He reportedly brings home another $15M-$20M a year from his other gigs. \n \n Leno replaced Johnny Carson as host of The Tonight Show in 1992 after having been a regular substitute host since 1987. He “officially” ended hosting of The Tonight Show in 2009 when Conan O’Brien started on June 1st. Leno was going to be paid for all of 2009 by NBC even though he was only working six months of it. When his ratings dipped, O’Brien was asked to move The Tonight Show‘s time slot later to make room for Leno’s return at 11:30 PM. O’Brien refused. NBC gave Conan a $40M payoff (including salaries for his staff) to leave The Tonight Show hosting job which Leno resumed in 2010. \n \n Related: Gabby Douglas & Michelle Obama Give ‘Tonight Show’ A Bump \n \n Jay Leno Celebrates 20th Anniversary Hosting ‘The Tonight Show’ \n \n Jimmy Kimmel Bests Leno & Letterman \n \n Editor-in-Chief Nikki Finke - tip her here.', 'Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

The numbers require some guesswork, but the LAT thinks he went from somewhere between $25 million and $30 million down to about $20 million. Finke's numbers are higher. According to both accounts, Leno volunteered to take the cuts to save jobs, though at least 20 people got layoffs. Why the downsizing? Finke says it's not because of concerns about ratings or ad revenue, but because parent company Comcast is demanding cuts all around. She says the show is still a ""cash cow."" The LAT, meanwhile, says Leno's prime-time budget never got shaved when he moved back to later hours."

10,"['* Technology spotted antibodies for disease in blood \n \n * Findings need to be confirmed \n \n By Julie Steenhuysen \n \n CHICAGO, Jan 6 (Reuters) - U.S. researchers have developed a way to harness the immune system to test for Alzheimer\'s, an approach they say could lead to a blood test for the disease within months. \n \n A study of the technology showed it accurately spotted Alzheimer\'s in blood samples from six people with the disease, Thomas Kodadek of the Scripps Research Institute in Jupiter, Florida, wrote on Thursday in the journal Cell. \n \n The approach may work in other diseases, like cancer, Kodadek said in a telephone interview. \n \n The test looks for antibodies, or immune-system proteins, that help the body attack foreign invaders. \n \n Antibodies fight off infections but Kodadek said researchers are beginning to think that most diseases cause changes in cells that make the body see the cells as foreign invaders. \n \n He believes the body may produce antibodies in response to a range of diseases and would like to develop blood tests that look for them. \n \n His team used laboratory-made molecules called peptoids as antigen surrogates to screen for antibodies specific to Alzheimer\'s disease. \n \n Three of them reacted strongly to the blood of the six patients with Alzheimer\'s disease, but not with blood from healthy people. \n \n Kodadek said he has since tested more samples, including samples from people with mild cognitive impairment, an early sign of Alzheimer\'s, and the test is holding up. \n \n Kodadek has licensed the technology to Miami-based OPKO Health Inc (OPK.A), which will develop diagnostic kits, which he thinks could be available in six to seven months. \n \n ""The immediate utility of that is to help pharmaceutical companies stratify patients for clinical trials,"" he said. \n \n The team has tried to determine whether the test can distinguish among different neurodegenerative diseases, like lupus and Parkinson\'s. ""We\'ve even looked at a couple of other forms of dementia. These really do appear to be quite specific to Alzheimer\'s,"" Kodadek said. \n \n They also used the test on blood from 200 elderly people not suffering from dementia and found 8 percent had elevated concentrations of the same antibodies found in Alzheimer\'s patients, which suggests the test may work as an early predictor of disease.', 'Executive Health \n \n Early Steps Toward an Alzheimer\'s Blood Test \n \n Different immune system proteins exist in the blood of people with the disease, study finds \n \n THURSDAY, Jan. 6 (HealthDay News) -- A blood test that screens for antibodies, a protein produced by the immune system, may one day be used to detect Alzheimer\'s and other diseases, new research suggests. \n \n Though the research is still in its infancy, being able to detect Alzheimer\'s via antibodies would be a simpler and less invasive method of diagnosing the disease, researchers said. \n \n But the study\'s lead author stressed that the true benefits of such a test for Alzheimer\'s patients won\'t really arise until scientists develop effective treatments against the disease. \n \n ""It\'s unclear whether people would want to know a couple of years ahead of time they are going to get Alzheimer\'s if they can\'t do anything about it,"" said Thomas Kodadek, a professor of chemistry and cancer biology at The Scripps Research Institute in Jupiter, Fla. ""But I can say with some certainty that we will never get a good therapy for Alzheimer\'s without early diagnosis."" \n \n The study, funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, is published in the Jan. 7 issue of Cell. \n \n Typically, in developing blood tests for diseases, researchers have searched for antigens -- that is, proteins from a virus, bacteria or other disease process such as cancer or neurological conditions like Alzheimer\'s -- that set off an immune response. \n \n Only after identifying the antigen would researchers then search for antibodies to that antigen, or signs that the immune system had picked up on the problem and mounted a response. \n \n But antigens can be difficult to find, Kodadek explained. \n \n ""In Alzheimer\'s, or in a disease such as cancer, it\'s not at all obvious what the initiating event is,"" he said. ""We just don\'t know what are those first weirdly modified proteins that are unique to the disease process that the immune system \'sees.\'"" \n \n The new research went about things differently. Rather than search for the elusive antigen, researchers did ""high throughput"" screening using thousands of synthetic molecules, called peptoids, that would bind with the antibodies. \n \n Comparing blood samples from six Alzheimer\'s patients, six healthy people and six Parkinson\'s disease patients, the researchers found that two of the thousands of synthetic molecules ""captured"" at least three-fold more immunoglobulin (IgG) antibodies from all six of the Alzheimer\'s patients than from either the healthy controls or the Parkinson\'s patients. \n \n The synthetic molecules, in effect, acted as a lure for the antibodies -- enabling the researchers to spot biomarkers in the blood unique to those with Alzheimer\'s. \n \n This process could be repeated to test for antibodies associated with other diseases as well, Kodadek theorized. \n \n ""The big advance from what people have been doing before is that this method completely removes the requirement of knowing the native antigens that triggered the immune response,"" Kodadek said. ""The real excitement is it should allow us to identify biomarkers for any disease for which the immune system reacts."" \n \n The synthetic molecules are easily modifiable and can be produced quickly in large quantities at lower cost, Kodadek said. \n \n However, while promising, the results are preliminary and need to be replicated in larger numbers of patients, noted Dr. Jeremy Koppel, an Alzheimer\'s research scientist at the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research in Manhasset, N.Y. He was not involved in the new research. \n \n ""This study represents a novel approach to the development of a noninvasive screening instrument for conditions such as Alzheimer\'s disease, which currently lack definitive diagnostic biomarkers,"" Koppel said. ""Beyond diagnostics, the future identification of the biomarkers detected in this study has the potential to deepen our understanding of the disease process itself."" \n \n Another caveat is that the study was done in people who already had Alzheimer\'s, not those merely at risk for the disease. Further research needs to be done to determine how soon into the progression of the disease the abnormal antibodies can be detected. \n \n Right now, there are a few medications that can help with the symptoms of Alzheimer\'s, but there are no treatments that slow the progression of the disease. \n \n So for many patients, early diagnosis may not necessarily be something they want, Kodadek said. But from a research perspective, early diagnosis is a key to developing better treatment, he added. \n \n With neurodegenerative diseases, the hope is that drugs could block further decline, making it crucial to know if a person has the disease before they begin having significant symptoms, he said. \n \n More information \n \n The U.S. National Institute on Aging has more on Alzheimer\'s. \n \n SOURCES: Thomas Kodadek, Ph.D., professor, chemistry and cancer biology, The Scripps Research Institute, Jupiter, Fla; Jeremy Koppel, M.D., Alzheimer\'s research scientist, Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Manhasset, N.Y.; Jan. 7, 2011, Cell \n \n Copyright © 2011 HealthDay.

The relationship we have enjoyed with their team to this day means the world to us, and we are deeply ashamed that it took a public revelation, a loss of trust, and damaged friendships for us to fully grasp the gravity of our conduct, for which each member of our team takes full and equal responsibility. No woman deserves to be treated in this manner; not our mothers, our sisters, nor our peers. We apologize to them, and to all those who trusted us, supported us, and believed in us. \n \n Please do not misconstrue our silence up until this point as a lack of remorse on our part. Out of respect for the women’s team, who expressed their desire to focus on the remainder of their season, we postponed the release of our public apology so as not to burden them with further distractions. Now that the Athletic Department has decided to terminate our season, we feel it is appropriate and necessary to address the situation publicly.

These scouting reports, an inexcusable manifestation of sexism and misogyny on our part, persisted in spite of this culture change, and we must now hold ourselves accountable for them. Our coaches have also taught us to be open in accepting our mistakes and to always focus on the next most important thing—and the next most important thing for us now is to do everything we can to start rebuilding the trust and relationships we severed, while doing anything possible to help heal the pain we have caused Harvard Women’s Soccer, their families, and women everywhere. \n \n To do so, we must first confront the issues of sexism and misogyny within our own locker room, so that we can take up the call issued by the women of the Harvard Women’s Soccer Class of 2016 to join them in combatting this sort of behavior. Starting with ourselves, all players on this team now commit our efforts to spur a cultural change that goes beyond the scope of our own team. \n \n Over the course of the previous week, we have been devoting our attention to this problem as our top priority, and our meetings as a team and with University officials have yielded a few specific proposals to educate ourselves and to help others come to the same realizations that we reached without repeating our mistakes. We hope to guide conversation among the other athletic teams about sexism, and we ask for input from the community at large, openly welcoming and encouraging any and all constructive discussion of and collaboration with our efforts. \n \n There are no excuses for our behavior, and all we can do now is take it upon ourselves to be an example of change for the better. Our apology comes from a place of optimism and a willingness to advance an agenda of gender equality that is in line with the relationships that we want to cultivate. We take responsibility for our actions, and we accept the consequences that come from them and now focus on what we can do to move forward.

It was the diocese that immediately reported them to police. But some are furious the public is just now learning about it and that the accused priest is missing \n \n One man who says he was victimized as a child by a Dallas priest did not want his name used or face shown.

It says Bishop Burns was “prepared to announce the allegations in March” but there was “concern for the victims” who asked that it not be made public. \n \n The statement goes on to say Bishop Burns tried to be sensitive to the victim’s request. But when the Pennsylvania report became public, he decided to inform the public about Paredes. \n \n PREVIOUS STORIES: \n \n Dallas Diocese suspends priest over sexual abuse allegations, theft"", 'Paredes is no longer permitted to function or present himself as a priest, the bishop said. \n \n Burns decided to disclose the allegations to parishioners Sunday after a meeting Thursday with the Diocesan Review Board, a group of non-clergy Catholics who counsel the diocese on matters involving the sexual abuse of minors. He said Sunday that he wanted to make the allegations public after last week\'s report from Pennsylvania that said more than 1,000 children had been abused by clergy since the 1940s. \n \n Lisa Kendzior and Paul Petersen, local chapter leaders of the Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests, said in a joint statement that they found it disturbing Burns didn\'t tell parishioners about the allegations sooner. \n \n \n \n ""Why would Bishop Burns suppress this crucial information?

The two were married in 1928 in Latvia but returned to Berlin to pursue their careers. In 1932, using his legal stage name, Yasha Lenssen, Jacob signed a contract with the Breslau opera to perform as their leading baritone in a series of 19 operas. However, shortly before the season opened, his contract was abruptly cancelled when he was asked to add his original surname to the agreement, a name that immediately identified him as a Jew. After Hitler\'s rise to power, the Levinsons were increasingly uneasy about their prospects for the future. They turned for advice to the Latvian consul in Berlin, who assured them Hitler would not last long and predicted a flourishing musical career for them after his demise. As foreigners, the Levinsons were somewhat protected from the anti-Jewish economic legislation that was directed against German Jews. Thus Jacob was able to secure a position as the Berlin representative of a Latvian-based firm. \n \n \n \n Hessy Levinsons was born in 1934. When she was six months old, Hessy was taken to a leading Berlin photographer to have her portrait taken. A few months later this picture appeared on the cover of the Nazi publication, ""Sonne ins Haus"" [Sun in the House]. Frightened by the possible consequences of their exposure as foreign-born Jews, Hessy\'s mother rushed to the photographer. He explained that he had known she was a Jewish child and had deliberately submitted her photograph to a contest for the most beautiful Aryan baby in order to ridicule Nazi racial theory, and Hessy was selected as winner of the contest among all the German babies. Several months later an aunt in Memel recognized Hessy\'s portrait on a picture postcard in a local store and sent it to the Levinsons in Berlin. The card was captioned ""Best wishes for the birthday."" After the publication of her photograph Hessy was kept largely at home lest she be recognized in the street and her parents questioned about her identity. In 1936 her sister Naomi was born. That same year her father was arrested by the Gestapo on a trumped-up tax charge. He was released only after his accountant, a Nazi party member, came to his defense. Following this incident the Levinsons left for Latvia, where they remained for a year until deciding to move to Paris in 1938. The family had fully reestablished itself when the Germans entered Paris. Jacob applied for American visas but had no way of knowing when they might come through. In 1941, when the round-up of foreign Jews began in Paris, the Levinsons fled to Memac-sur-Mer, a coastal town near Bordeaux. From there they were led by members of the French resistance to Nice. In the meantime Jacob received notice that their American visas had arrived, but that only 45 days remained to get to the U.S. before the visas would expire. Unable to find immediate transport to the United States, Jacob applied for an extension of their U.S. visas. The U.S. Department of Immigration denied these extensions. Jacob then secured Cuban visas for the family and booked passage on the Serpa Pinto, a Portuguese ship that left from Lisbon in early in 1942 for Havana. The family spent the next seven years in the Cuban capital, where Hessy and her sister grew up. In 1948 the Levinsons reapplied for immigration to the U.S. and arrived in New York in 1949.', 'SAN DIEGO — A one-time San Diego police criminalist who died in an apparent suicide in the East County highlands this week was due to be arrested on suspicion of taking part in the gruesome murder of a teenage girl 30 years ago, authorities reported Thursday. \n \n Kevin Charles Brown, 62, was found dead at Cuyamaca State Park on Tuesday afternoon. Brown evidently had killed himself, SDPD Lt. Paul Rorrison said, declining to disclose what led to that conclusion. \n \n In November 2012, cold-case homicide detectives uncovered DNA evidence that allegedly linked Brown and a second man to the slaying of 14-year-old Claire Hough, who was found dead at Torrey Pines State Beach on Aug. 24, 1984. \n \n The girl, who was visiting and staying with her grandparents at the time, had been beaten, strangled and stabbed, and one of her breasts had been cut off, according to San Diego County Crime Stoppers. \n \n The other suspect, Ronald Clyde Tatro, died at age 67 in a boating accident in Tennessee the year before investigators got the break in the case. \n \n Brown was civilian lab worker for the San Diego Police Department from 1982 until his retirement in 2002. \n \n “The investigation confirmed Kevin Brown had no association with any of the evidence processed in this case; nor was he assigned to any part of the murder investigation,” Rorrison said. \n \n Since the DNA evidence surfaced in the case two years ago, homicide detectives had “conducted extensive investigative follow-ups to bring forward a prosecutable case,” the lieutenant said. \n \n At the time of Brown’s death, “preparations were being made” for his arrest, Rorrison said. \n \n The murder occurred six years after a highly similar one at the same northern San Diego beach. In August 1978, 15-year-old Barbara Nantais was found slain with one of her breasts severed. Her boyfriend was nearby, suffering from severe head wounds that had left him semiconscious and with no memory of the attacks. \n \n It was unclear if Brown and Tatro were considered suspects in the earlier murder as well.']",5,"– The Catholic Church has hired two private investigators to track down a former Dallas priest who disappeared months before sexual abuse allegations against him surfaced. Pastor at St. Cecilia Catholic Church in Oak Cliff for 27 years, Rev. Edmundo Paredes stands accused of molesting three boys in their midteens between 10 and 20 years ago, though the exact period is being withheld to protect the victims’ identities, reports the Dallas Morning News. Paredes, 69, was removed from St. Cecilia in June 2017 after allegedly stealing $60,000 to $80,000 in cash. This February, church officials also learned of sexual abuse allegations, which were reported to police and found to be credible, Bishop Edward Burns told parishioners on Sunday. ""I recognize this diocese cannot cover its ears, its eyes, its mouth. We need to look at this head on,"" Burns said. Still, the Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests questions the delay in releasing the information. Officials initially said the allegations weren’t disclosed earlier because of a police investigation. Late Monday, however, the Diocese of Dallas said a Pennsylvania grand jury report describing more than 1,000 victims of abuse by clergy since the 1940s had motivated the disclosure after victims objected to an announcement in March, per Fox 4. Officials suspect Paredes is in his native Philippines, which he visited annually, per WFAA. Per the Morning News, authorities there say they are unaware of his location."
12,"['North Korean leader Kim Jong-un executed two top officials publicly, killing them with an anti-aircraft gun, a source with special knowledge of North Korea told the JoongAng Ilbo.One was apparently killed for nodding off during a meeting with Kim.The executed men were Hwang Min, former agricultural minister, and Ri Yong-jin, who had a senior position in the education ministry, possibly as high as minister level.“I have the information that ministers of agriculture and education were publicly executed on a special order from Kim Jong-un,” said the source. The executions took place at a military academy in Pyongyang, he said, and an anti-aircraft gun was used.If the report is true, it would mark the first execution ordered by Kim Jong-un from outside the Workers’ Party and military.The report may be interpreted as a new reign of terror in North Korea prompted by a series of defections by senior officials that has rekindled talk of instability and disunity among the North Korean elite.“One of the executed is Hwang Min, a former agricultural minister,” said the source. “I understand he was executed because policy proposals he had pushed for were seen as a direct challenge to the Kim Jong-un leadership.""The source did not elaborate what the proposal was or why it was seen as a challenge to the leader. Hwang was replaced by Ko In-ho at a meeting of the rubber-stamp parliament in late June before apparently being executed.The other ill-fated official was Ri Yong-jin, who the source said was a ministerial-level official at the education ministry.“He incurred the wrath of Kim after he dozed off during a meeting presided over by Kim. He was arrested on site and intensively questioned by the state security ministry. He was executed after other charges such as corruption were found during the probe.”In North Korea, there are two ministries related to education: the Ministry of Common Education and Ministry of Higher Education, which are headed by Kim Sung-du and Thae Hyong-chol, who is also president of Kim Il Sung University. A government official said the ill-fated Ri could have had a minister-level position at one of the two.Since taking over after his father’s death in late 2011, Kim has carried out a series of executions of party and military officials. The most high-profile was the December 2013 execution of Jang Song-thaek, Kim’s uncle and former political guardian. Another high-profile execution was that of Hyon Yong-chol, North Korea’s former defense chief, who South Korean intelligence said was executed by firing squad in April 2015 on charges of dozing off during a meeting attended by the supreme leader.If the report of the two executions is true, they may have been related to a series of defections by senior North Korean officials with privileged backgrounds.The recent defection of Thae Yong-ho, formerly No. 2 at the North Korean embassy in London, sparked speculation that there is disunity among the North’s inner circle and a decline in faith in the Kim regime. The young leader could have felt the need to impose a sense of terror among elite officials to reinforce their loyalty.“The recent series of defections by top officials is less a looming sign of the collapse of the North Korean regime than the outcome of the North’s wrong policies for its overseas officials,” said Kim Byung-yeon, professor of economics at Seoul National University, who specializes in the North Korean economy.North Korean officials overseas are said to be under growing pressure to find source of hard currency to be transferred to Pyongyang after sanctions were slapped on the country in March, following its fourth nuclear test in January and a long-range missile launch the following month. Such pressure could have driven elite officials like Thae to opt to defect to the South rather than face dire consequences back home after failing to find the motherland extra sources of foreign exchange, observers say.President Park Geun-hye said Monday that her government would continue to “send a message of hope for North Korean people for the life of liberty and dignity.”At a meeting with senior secretaries at the Blue House, Park said, “Improving human rights conditions in North Korea is a humanitarian issue that cannot be put off any more and a cornerstone to bringing about an era of peace on the Korean Peninsula.”She called on the military to maintain readiness so the North Korean regime can be brought to “self-destruction” should it choose to provoke the South violently.BY KANG JIN-KYU, LEE YOUNG-JONG [kang.jinkyu@joongang.co.kr]', 'Rutgers University, New Jersey’s premier public university, continues to dominate top spots in several national college rankings — it ranks 26th among the nation’s top public schools and 30th in campus ethnic diversity, among other accolades. \n \n But the university’s most recent ranking is one that university administration and prospective students may find less favorable. Of all the public institutions in the country, Rutgers has the most graduate student debt. \n \n According to the Washington Post, the Center for American Progress, a non-partisan public policy think tank, released a report earlier this month, which found that just 20 U.S. universities accounted for $6.5 billion — or one-fifth — of all federal student loan debt for the 2013-2014 academic year. \n \n Ranked 19th on the list was Rutgers University, the only public college to appear in the top 20 alongside pricy private universities like New York University and for-profit colleges like the University of Phoenix. \n \n Ava Lorenzo, an out-of-state graduate student at Rutgers’ campus in New Brunswick, N.J., was not surprised to learn the university was the top public college in the nation in terms of graduate student debt. \n \n She says she has met many in-state students who do not qualify for sufficient federal aid but whose parents’ income are not high enough to finance their full tuition and fees. \n \n “A lot of my friends’ parents who live in New Jersey make a decent salary,” Lorenzo says. “[But] this salary is not enough to fund college completely and also not enough for these students to receive wage-based grants from the federal government. Therefore, most of these kids had to take out a significant amount in loans.” \n \n While Lorenzo funded most of her undergraduate expenses with income-based grants and scholarships, she says she is paying for her doctorate degree with loans. \n \n She adds, “I know [the debt] is adding up, but getting a doctoral degree should mean that I will make enough to live comfortably despite having a loan bill to pay each month.” \n \n In addition, Rutgers has one of the highest tuition rates in the nation among state colleges. And while graduate students enrolled at the university received more than $192 million in federal loans in 2013-2014 academic year, undergraduate students at Rutgers received more than $230,962,547 in federal loans that same year, according to the university’s official 2013-2014 financial aid report. \n \n Candice Yeung, an undergraduate student at the Rutgers campus in Newark, N.J. who is considering enrolling in a graduate program in the next few years, says undergraduate debt alone can be so crippling that it becomes a major factor in the decision to pursue an advanced degree. \n \n “Students spend four years paying or taking out loans for education and in addition to that, there are meal plans and dorm payments for those who choose to dorm at school,” she says. “Then, there are the textbooks, the supplies and the extra accessories that professors demand for a class. Even with jobs, it is hard to maintain a stable financial status in college. To be honest, I try to not think about my student loans. It makes me wonder if I’m going to graduate school or if law school is even worth it.” \n \n While the university offers graduate students scholarships and other financial aid resources — including the Eagleton and Ralph Bunche fellowships — federal student loans remain the primary source of aid, according to NJ.com. \n \n Historically, Americans journeyed to the nation’s top public schools to pursue either an undergraduate or graduate education with an expectation of affordability due to government investment. \n \n Elizabeth Baylor, the director of postsecondary education at Center for American Progress and author the new report, argued in a 2014 analysis that cuts in-state funding of public colleges have made a bachelor’s degree or advanced degree very unaffordable for students across the country. \n \n “In response to the fiscal crisis, the majority of state governments charted a budgetary course that reduced direct support to public colleges and universities, which, not surprisingly, coincided with the increasing unaffordability of these institutions,” Baylor said. “To make up for the funding cuts, public colleges increased their reliance on tuition revenue, which unduly burdened low- and moderate-income families.” \n \n Rutgers University – much like other public colleges — has had to increase tuition in response to state disinvestment in recent years, thus forcing more students to rely more heavily on loans to finance their education. \n \n The university’s board just approved a 2.3% tuition hike in undergraduate tuition and fees and approved similar increases of approximately 2.3% for most graduate students for the 2015-2016 academic year on Thursday.']",2,"– Christopher Kennedy Lawford, an actor, author, and nephew of John F. Kennedy, died of a heart attack Tuesday. The 63-year-old, who became an advocate for sobriety after his own substance abuse issues, was in Vancouver, Canada. He was there working to open a recovery center, his cousin, former US Rep. Patrick J. Kennedy, tells the AP, adding Lawford's hot yoga habit ""must have been too much for him at that point."" TMZ reports Lawford was at a yoga studio at the time of the heart attack. In addition to appearing on General Hospital, All My Children, and Frasier, per People, the oldest child of Patricia Kennedy also wrote several books, including 2005's Symptoms of Withdrawal. The AP reports that in that memoir, he wrote of what preceded his getting sober at age 30: mugging women for money, begging for change in Grand Central Station, and two arrests for possession. ""There are many days when I wish I could take back and use my youth more appropriately,"" he said in 2005. ""But all of that got me here. I can't ask for some of my life to be changed and still extract the understanding and the life that I have today."""
13,"['Justice Anthony Kennedy’s retirement — coming on the heels of the chaotic, ugly realpolitik that followed Justice Antonin Scalia’s death — is a good moment to step back and realize just how broken the process for selecting Supreme Court justices now is. \n \n In 2016, Senate Republicans responded to Antonin Scalia’s death by inventing and establishing the absurd faux principle that open seats on the Supreme Court cannot be filled in an election year. Given that America hosts national elections one out of every two years, that means, in theory, that Supreme Court seats should remain unfilled fully 50 percent of the time. \n \n Democrats, infuriated by the GOP’s treatment of President Obama and Merrick Garland, filibustered Neil Gorsuch — the kind of broadly qualified nominee who would’ve passed easily in previous eras. In response, Senate Republicans eliminated the filibuster on Supreme Court nominations. \n \n What we are seeing here is a case of what the political scientist Steven Smith calls “Senate syndrome”: One side breaks a norm or rule, then the other side breaks another in response, and the tit-for-tat escalates until the underlying process is in ruins. That’s now happened with Supreme Court nominations. \n \n Here, in truth, is where the past few years have left us. The minority party no longer holds a scintilla of power over Supreme Court picks. The majority party can and will jam whomever they want onto the Court, where that person will serve for life. But in times when the Senate and the White House are controlled by different parties — which happens fairly often — there’s almost no chance that any seat on the Court will be filled. \n \n Imagine, for a minute, that Democrats win the Senate in 2018 and Ruth Bader Ginsburg retires in 2019. What are the chances, given the precedent of the past few years, that Senate Democrats will permit Trump to replace Ginsburg and give conservatives a 6-3 majority on the Supreme Court? I’d guess somewhere between zero and zero. \n \n This is an insane way to manage one of the most powerful institutions in American life. But the decorous, gentle equilibrium of yesteryear was also nonsensical. There’s always been something bizarre about the idea that a position as important, as long-serving, and as irreversible as Supreme Court justice should be made based on qualifications rather than ideology. \n \n Politics isn’t a résumé competition, it’s a contest for power, and the wielding of that power has real consequences. In practice, the Supreme Court decides how elections are funded, whether abortions are legal, whether millions of people will continue to have health insurance — if elected politicians and activist groups see its composition as a matter of life and death, that’s because it often is. \n \n Yes, Garland was relatively moderate, but if he had replaced Scalia, he would’ve swung the Court to a 5-4 liberal majority, leading to a slew of transformative rulings Republicans would find abhorrent. Yes, Gorsuch was qualified, but he has ruled in ways Democrats find awful, and the clarity of his opinions will not soften their effects. \n \n For that reason, I don’t blame Republicans for blocking Garland. Nor do I blame Democrats for filibustering Gorsuch. And I do not expect Republicans to give Democrats a sliver of oversight over Kennedy’s replacement. \n \n But the result of both sides taking SCOTUS nominations as seriously as they deserve to be taken is disastrous — it will become common for seats on the Court, perhaps multiple at one time, to remain open for years, and when they are filled, they will be filled with more extreme candidates. \n \n The core problem here is the stakes of Supreme Court nominations: They’re too damn high. Candidates serve for life — which, given modern life spans and youthful nominees, can now mean 40 years of decisions — and no one knows when the next seat will open. President Jimmy Carter served four years and saw no open seats. President George H.W. Bush served four years and filled two. Barack Obama served eight years and named two justices. Donald Trump isn’t even two years into his presidency and he’s already been given two vacancies. \n \n The result isn’t merely an undemocratic branch of government but a randomly undemocratic branch of government. And that randomness, and the stakes of seeing it play out in your side’s favor, makes it necessary to turn Supreme Court nominations into bloodsport. It creates incentives for justices to stay on the bench long after the point at which they should’ve retired, in the hopes that they can outlast an ideologically unfriendly administration — Ruth Bader Ginsburg, for instance, is 85, but it’s hard to imagine she won’t do everything in her physical power to hang onto her seat until a Democrat can replace her. It biases presidents toward nominating the youngest qualified jurist they can find, rather than the best jurist they can find. \n \n We need to deescalate Supreme Court fights. The most obvious way to do that is to limit terms. Holding justices to a 10-year, nonrenewable term would lower the stakes of any individual Supreme Court nomination as well as make the timing of fights more predictable. An idea like this could have bipartisan support — Gov. Rick Perry proposed 18-year terms in the 2012 campaign, making an argument that I think sounds even more persuasive today: \n \n Doing this would move the court closer to the people by ensuring that every President would have the opportunity to replace two Justices per term, and that no court could stretch its ideology over multiple generations. Further, this reform would maintain judicial independence, but instill regularity to the nominations process, discourage Justices from choosing a retirement date based on politics, and will stop the ever-increasing tenure of Justices. \n \n Implementing a reform like this would be a step toward repairing and normalizing a process that is now dangerously broken, infuriatingly random, and distorting both our politics and the judges we choose to interpret our laws.', ""The fight over President Trump Donald John TrumpScaramucci warns Trump must 'change tactics now' on trade Trump sought to purchase historic Scottish building for hotel: report Republican wins right to replace Farenthold in Congress MORE’s next nomination to the Supreme Court began almost immediately after the news broke of the opening on Wednesday. \n \n Moments after Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy said he would retire, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellSunday shows preview: Supreme Court fight in the spotlight Appeals court nominees languish in Senate as Flake demands tariff vote Gillibrand incorrectly claims no Democrats voted for Trump’s first Supreme Court nominee MORE (R-Ky.) said the Senate would act before the midterm election to confirm Trump’s next nominee. \n \n ADVERTISEMENT \n \n “We will vote to confirm Justice Kennedy’s successor this fall,” McConnell said on the Senate floor. \n \n Democrats immediately cried foul, arguing the nomination fight should come next year. \n \n Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer Charles (Chuck) Ellis SchumerOvernight Health Care: Judge blocks Kentucky Medicaid work requirements | Trump officials consider cuts to ObamaCare outreach | House probes HHS office in charge of migrant children Overnight Health Care: Amazon enters the pharmacy business | Two Republicans to play pivotal role in Supreme Court abortion fight | Senate panel approves medical research boost Lewandowski: Pelosi is not the leader of the Democratic Party MORE (N.Y.), recalling the bitter fight over Merrick Garland Merrick Brian GarlandBattle over Trump court pick to be most expensive ever Mitch McConnell’s gamble is about to pay off — big time Dem senator: No argument will 'lay bare' GOP's hypocrisy on Supreme Court MORE’s nomination to the court in 2016, demanded that McConnell hold off until a new Congress is seated in 2019.

Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, both of whom support abortion rights and will likely have a big say in who comes next. A remedy: At Vox, Ezra Klein writes that both parties are guilty of turning the nomination process into an ""insane"" one, given the stakes. At this point, if one party held the White House and the other the Senate, it's unlikely any nominee would be confirmed. His solution? Reduce the stakes by limiting justices to 10-year terms. A big percentage: The Washington Post picks out five times Kennedy cast the deciding vote on big issues, on everything from backing abortion rights to supporting gay rights to curtailing the death penalty. The story notes that of the 276 majority opinions written by Kennedy, 92 came in 5-4 decisions."

Hours later, hundreds tried to punch through the cordon of razor wire and riot police massed near the Serbian border town of Horgos. \n \n But they ran headlong into security forces\xad who unleashed tear gas and pepper spray to drive them back. Some refugees were swatted by batons and crumpled to the ground in pain. \n \n [New threat on the refu\xadgee trail: land mines] \n \n “Open the door!” the refugees yelled as they hurled water bottles and debris at riot police. \n \n Nearby, children screamed for their missing parents. Water cannons sprayed crowds on the Serbian side, forcing refugees to retreat to a squalid squatters’ camp that took root just after Hungary closed the border Tuesday. \n \n There were no major injuries, but some refugees were treated by Serbian authorities for respiratory problems from the tear gas and at least one migrant had a leg injury, the Associated Press reported. \n \n It was the first major clash between security forces\xad and migrants since police used stun grenades to stop refugees from crossing into Macedonia from Greece almost a month ago. \n \n “We fled wars and violence and did not expect such brutality and inhumane treatment in Europe,” said Amir Hassan, who was drenched from a water cannon and tried to wash tear gas from his eyes, according to AP. \n \n “Shame on you Hungarians!” he shouted, pointing toward the Hungarian police. \n \n At the United Nations, Secretary General Ban Ki-moon called Hungary’s border crackdowns “unacceptable.” \n \n “All the countries have their domestic problems,” he said, “but since they are the people fleeing the wars and persecutions, then we must show our compassionate leadership.” \n \n Neighboring countries continued to heap scorn on Hungary’s decision to blocks its southern border. \n \n “Barbed wire in Europe in the 21st century is not an answer, it’s a threat,” complained Croatia’s prime minister, Zoran Milanovic, in a direct jab at the blockades by neighboring Hungary. \n \n Milanovic promised that refugees would be allowed to pass through his country. \n \n He told lawmakers in Zagreb that Croatia would “accept and direct” the migrants to transit the country — comments that rocketed through the social media networks used by the refugees and increased the march toward Croatia. \n \n [ The limbo of the no man’s land ] \n \n The river of migrants was swelling by the hour. \n \n By late afternoon, more than 600 migrants walked through fields and along small roads to cross from Serbia into Croatia, a European Union member, where officials set up posts to register names and details. \n \n Many traveled by bus from Macedonia and Hungary; others pulled up in taxis before crossing the border on foot and receiving a polite reception from authorities. \n \n “We want to keep them moving as quickly as possible,” said Zdravko Helic, a civil protection officer in Tovarnik. \n \n He was proud to add, “We haven’t had a single incident.” \n \n Saeed, 19, a student from Damascus, called Hungary’s treatment of the refugees “old-fashioned racism.” \n \n “We’re the first today,” said Dubal, the Syrian refugee. “There’ll be thousands tomorrow.” \n \n Afterward they were taken by bus to a refugee processing camp outside the capital, Zagreb, where they would be officially registered. \n \n What happens after Zagreb was uncertain. \n \n Croatian officials said they would probably allow the migrants to continue their journeys by bus and train to Slovenia, Austria, Germany and beyond. But it was only Croatia’s first day at the leading edge of the mass migration, and authorities were scrambling to coordinate their response with E.U. partners. \n \n “We will walk all the way to Germany if we have to,” said Mohammad, 28, who worked in a mobile phone store in Aleppo, Syria’s largest city. \n \n “Shop is gone, house is gone, some of family is gone,” he said. “So I will walk.” \n \n Like many in the migrant stream, he declined to give his last name out of fear of reprisals against relatives back home. \n \n The refugees had nothing good to say about Hungary. “Not nice at all,” said Abdullah, 24, from Aleppo, who smiled and waved at the Croatian police before they hustled him into a van. \n \n “See? Very good service,” he joked. \n \n Souad Mekhennet in Vienna, Gergo Saling and Jodi Hilton in Horgos, Serbia, and Brian Murphy in Washington contributed to this report. \n \n Read more: \n \n Germany’s enthusiasm for refugees might not last.

Sawiris said the talks would depend on whether the owners can secure approval from the Greek government. \n \n The Egyptian billionaire had announced that he was interested in buying an island where refugees could be housed until they can return to their own country. In a Sept. 8 Bloomberg TV interview, Sawiris said the proposal was something motivated by a desire “to clear my conscience as a human being, and nothing more.” \n \n The best way to deal with donations would be to set up a joint-stock company with a capital of $100 million, Sawiris said in his Facebook statement. Such a step would ensure that any money invested “will not be completely lost, as the asset (the island) will remain.”']",4,"– More than 500 migrants have been detained for illegally entering Hungary or breaching a border fence, with nearly 50 criminal cases on the books since new laws took effect yesterday, the New York Times reports, while the BBC notes that Hungarian riot police today fired tear gas at migrants trying to break through the border with Serbia. And as restrictions tighten, migrants are seeking other ways into Western Europe through Slovenia and Croatia, as well as through Hungary's border with Romania. Issues remain: Hungary’s poorer neighbors may be ill-equipped to handle the flow, and there are areas peppered with land mines, remnants of the Balkan Wars. While solutions are sought, thousands spent last night in a Vienna train station, per the Times, while at least 22 migrants drowned yesterday in the Aegean Sea, the Post notes—a sad repeat of a similar incident a couple of days earlier. Leaders of neighboring nations are scrambling to come up with their own plans for dealing with the influx, which is no small task: The EU border agency notes a head count of 500,000 migrants at EU nations' entry points so far in 2015; last year that number was around 280,000, the BBC reports. Many are refugees fleeing high-conflict areas such as Syria and Iraq, per the Washington Post, which adds there's a noted ""absence of a coordinated policy for the unprecedented influx."" ""Barbed wire in Europe in the 21st century is not an answer, it's a threat,"" Croatia's PM says, per the Post, adding that Croatia would ""accept and direct"" migrants through his country. An Egyptian billionaire who says he wants ""to clear my conscience as a human being"" has come up with an even more creative stopgap for the Syrian refugees involved: hosting them on two available Greek islands, using a joint-stock company to accept donations, Bloomberg reports.

Sounds like someone\'s summer internship is over. \n \n KTVU has also provided further explanation into why they said these names on air: They didn\'t say them out loud before rattling them off during their live taping and they didn\'t confirm with the NTSB employee (intern) on their position within the organization. They did, however, call to verify the correct spelling of the names. \n \n \n \n Update: Peter Knudson, a spokesman for the NTSB, just confirmed to SF Weekly that the NTSB did not release the names of the pilots of flight 214 to KTVU, or any news organization, for that matter. \n \n \n \n Original Story: Local station KTVU totally screwed up the names of Asiana Flight 214 pilots when announcing them on live television today, and we\'re a little worried the name ""Ho Lee Fuk"" might actually go down in history. \n \n So just to correct the record: The ill-fated Boeing 777 wasn\'t actually being steered by Mr. Fuk and his co-pilots Sum Ting Wong, Wi Tu Lo, and Bang Ding Ow. \n \n KTVU rushed to fix the blunder and issued an apology,blaming the NTSB for the fuck-up.

20,"['If all goes well, the Curiosity rover will be on the Mars surface at about 1:17 a.m. Eastern time, and 13 minutes, 48 seconds later (the time it takes for a radio signal to travel 154 million miles to Earth from Mars), there will be confirmation and cheering in the control room at 1:31 a.m., give or take a minute or so. \n \n Or there could be silence – nothing from the rover, and probably a somber pall in mission control. \n \n But it would not necessarily mean that the Curiosity had come to a quick, unfortunate demise. It could just be an interplanetary communications glitch. \n \n There are several transmitters on the spacecraft that will broadcast at different frequencies. Using one of them, the so-called X-band, the Curiosity will send simple messages directly to Earth. But, a couple of minutes before landing, the landing site at Gale Crater will rotate out of view from Earth – that means the direct communications path will be blocked, too. \n \n In addition, the spacecraft will be broadcasting a wealth a data using a UHF antenna. That is not powerful enough to be picked up by antenna on Earth, but a NASA orbiter, Mars Odyssey, will act as a relay, re-transmitting the data to Earth in real-time. \n \n If anything goes wrong with the Curiosity-to-Odyssey-to-Earth communications, then the result will be silence. \n \n That is not inconceivable, especially as Odyssey experienced a malfunction two months ago with one of three spinning wheels used to orient the spacecraft. A spare wheel was put into operation, but if it turns out that Odyssey cannot turn itself toward Curiosity, it will not hear anything. \n \n If Odyssey misses Curiosity’s messages, a second orbiter, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, will also be listening. But Reconnaissance Orbiter will be recording the data, not relaying it, and engineers on Earth will not get to sift through that information until hours later. \n \n If silence persists, the two orbiters will make additional passes over Curiosity over the next day, and late on Monday, the Curiosity will be able to talk directly to Earth, bypassing the orbiters. \n \n NASA engineers said it is quite possible for Curiosity to land successfully and that they would not find out for hours. Once they establish contact, the mission proceeds. \n \n But if a full day passes without hearing from Curiosity, then pessimism will set in that something had gone terribly wrong. \n \n — KENNETH CHANG', 'That landing is scheduled for 1:31 a.m., and officials said they could know almost immediately if the rover was safely on the ground. That tracking would come from the Odyssey orbiter circling Mars, if the spacecraft is able to get to the right location at the right time. \n \n If not, the waiting time for a final answer on whether the rover was safely on the surface could range from two to eight hours. If no signal arrives from Curiosity via three Mars orbiters and the Deep Space Network after 18 hours, NASA officials said, then they would start to worry about its safety. \n \n The final descent has been pre-programmed and the army of engineers and scientists at the Jet Propulsion Lab’s Mission Control have no control over it. “Our position will be identical to anyone at home,” said Adam Steltzner, lead of the Entry, Descent and Landing (EDL) team. “We’re all along for the ride.” \n \n Speaking for the team as a whole, Steltzner said they were “Rationally confident, emotionally terrified and ready for EDL.” \n \n Because the rover is so much larger, more complicated and more ambitious than earlier models, it has to land in a new and far more hazardous way. The landing, which could never be tested in full on Earth, includes a hovering rocket stage, a kind of sky crane, to lower it to the ground. NASA’s chief scientist John Grunsfeld has said that because of that heightened landing difficulty, in addition to the unprecedented sophistication of the instruments on board, Curiosity is “the most important NASA mission of the decade.” \n \n Worldwide spectacle \n \n The Curiosity landing is shaping up to be an international spectacle. Formal “landing” parties have been scheduled from South Australia to Rome, from Israel to Crete; and in the United States from Atlanta to Seattle, Milwaukee to Honolulu. \n \n NASA also has helped organize a landing gathering in New York’s Times Square, which will feature a large screen that will beam the streaming news from atop a building and high above the crowd. \n \n Reaching, orbiting and landing on Mars is notoriously hard. In addition to the European Space Agency, nations including the United States, the former Soviet Union, Russia, the European Space Agency, China and Japan have sent missions to Mars since the late 1960s, but only about one-third of them have succeeded. \n \n The United States is the only nation to land a vehicle on Mars and complete its mission, having done it six out of seven tries.', 'Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The boys can be seen introducing themselves next to a diver in a wetsuit \n \n A new video has been released of the 12 boys and their football coach trapped in a Thai cave, in which they say they are in good health. \n \n Smiling and at times laughing, they introduce themselves one by one. \n \n They were found on Monday after nine days trapped deep in the cave by rising water, and have since received food and medical treatment. \n \n But their rescue may take months as they must either be taught to dive or wait for the water to recede. \n \n The concern is that the rainy season has only just begun, so water levels in the Tham Luang cave will almost certainly continue to rise. \n \n The video posted on the Thai Navy special forces Facebook page shows the team draped in foil blankets to keep them warm. \n \n Image copyright AFP Image caption The boys all give their names, and a traditional Thai greeting \n \n Lit by torches and with divers sitting alongside, they each give their name and the traditional ""wai"" greeting, putting their palms together. \n \n Two other videos show the group having some light scratches treated by a military doctor. The boys are also again seen asking how soon food is coming. \n \n Written on a rock in the cave can be seen the name of the football team and of the navy unit involved in the rescue. \n \n Two Thai navy divers will be staying with the group underground from now on. \n \n Could the group swim out? \n \n ""Now we are teaching the children to swim and dive,"" Thai Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwan was quoted as saying by the Reuters news agency. \n \n A report in The Guardian says the boys are being trained to breathe through scuba masks. \n \n But a source inside the Thai navy diving team has told the BBC that taking the boys, few of whom can even swim, out through the narrow flooded passages is too risky. \n \n He said the journey in to where they were, deep in the caves, had exhausted even experienced divers. So they were seriously considering keeping the boys there for the full four or five months of the rainy season, he added. \n \n Some of the route involves squeezing through tight gaps underwater. In parts it is too narrow to wear an oxygen tank and the exits are not visible, so it would be easy for a child to panic. \n \n However, other Thai officials say they may need to bring the boys out quickly if water levels rise. Weather forecasts for the area are being closely monitored for heavy rain which could trigger further flooding. \n \n What are the trapped group having to endure? \n \n Before they were found, they would have lived in total darkness once any torch batteries had expired. \n \n However, the three basic conditions for survival were met: \n \n The temperature in the cave is thought to be around 26C (79F) so hypothermia was not an issue \n \n There was sufficient oxygen because air enters through porous limestone or cracks in the rocks. \n \n They had drinkable water \n \n Oxygen may yet become a problem should the water level rise and the air pocket they are in get smaller. \n \n Unknown factors include the possibility of dangerous animals like snakes in the cave or of contamination from bat droppings. \n \n What rescue efforts are being made? \n \n Rescuers are trying to work out how best to bring them all to safety, with officials stressing they do not intend to take any risks with the boys\' safety. \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Families have been shown new footage of the 12 boys and their coach stuck in a cave in Thailand. \n \n At a news conference, officials said no rescue attempt would be made on Wednesday but conditions were perfect for a rehearsal. \n \n Water continues to be pumped out of the cave complex and officials have said they are confident they have been able to stop more water getting into the chamber the boys are in. \n \n Emergency teams are also trying to install a phone line so the group can talk to their families but attempts to do so failed on Tuesday. \n \n Outside the cave, medics are staging rehearsals in case the group can be brought out soon. \n \n Other teams are still scouring the mountainside in the hope of finding another way into - and out of - the cave. \n \n How did the group get trapped? \n \n The boys, aged between 11 and 16, and their 25-year-old coach went missing on 23 June. It is believed they entered the cave in northern Chiang Rai province when it was dry and that sudden heavy rains blocked the exit. \n \n It is thought they could at first move through parts of the cave in dry conditions but rushing waters clogged the narrow passages with mud and debris, blocking visibility and access. \n \n How were they found? \n \n They were finally reached by two British rescue divers late on Monday, nine days after they entered the caves. \n \n They were huddled on a rock shelf about 4km (2.5 miles) from the mouth of the cave. \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The moment divers discover the missing boys \n \n The video of that first contact was also posted on Facebook by Thai navy special forces. \n \n The boys are seen by torchlight sitting on a ledge above water, responding to the divers that all 13 are there and they are very hungry. \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Diver Ben Reymenants is assisting with the rescue mission and says none of the boys can swim']",3,"– The Curiosity rover landed safely on Mars early this morning, prompting whoops of joy and relief in NASA's mission control center, reports the New York Times.

We are safe on the surface of Mars!"" the team read out after receiving signals from the rover. After a journey of 354 million miles, the rover, which is much bigger and more complex than previous models, had to land in a new way that could never be fully tested on Earth, leading to what control room staff described as ""seven minutes of terror"" before confirmation was received, notes the Washington Post.

21,"['Bloomberg News A worker harvests bok choy at a California farm earlier this month. \n \n Key senators are exploring an immigration bill that would force every U.S. worker—citizen or not—to carry a high-tech identity card that could use fingerprints or other personal markers to prove a person\'s legal eligibility to work. \n \n Key senators are exploring an immigration bill that would force every U.S. worker-citizen or not-to carry a high-tech ID card that could use fingerprints or other personal markers to prove legal eligibility to work. Danny Yadron reports. Photo: Getty. \n \n The idea, signaled only in vaguely worded language from senators crafting a bipartisan immigration bill, has privacy advocates and others concerned that the law would create a national identity card that, in time, could track Americans at airports, hospitals and through other facets of their lives. \n \n Vote \n \n The lawmakers haven\'t committed to the ""biometric"" ID card, and are wary of any element that might split the fragile coalition of Democrats, Republicans and outside organizations working toward agreement on a broad overhaul of immigration laws. \n \n But at least five of the eight senators writing the bill have backed biometric ID cards in the past. At least three of them—Sens. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.), John McCain (R., Ariz.) and Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.)—have said they support requiring the cards under the new law but are open to other options, aides say. \n \n The goal is to ensure that employers can learn the legal status of all new hires quickly, part of the effort to dissuade illegal immigrants from entering the country or seeking jobs. A system now in place, called E-Verify, matches prospective hires to a database of Social Security numbers and other data, but it can be foiled at times when illegal immigrants give stolen names, dates of birth and Social Security numbers. \n \n The Senate group, in a statement guiding their work on a new law, called for workers to prove their legal status and identities through ""non-forgeable electronic means."" Senate aides said the language was intentionally broad because of the sensitivity of the issue. It leaves open several possibilities for how new hires would be required to prove they can legally work. \n \n Mr. Graham, in an interview, said that in his mind the language refers to a requirement for biometric ID cards. ""This is the public\'s way of contributing to solving the problem"" of illegal immigration, Mr. Graham said. \n \n A second senator working on the bill, Jeff Flake (R., Ariz.), said in an interview he is open to the idea of biometric ID cards but that the issue remained unsettled. ""You\'ve got to give employers the tools"" to screen new workers, Mr. Flake said, noting he had signed on to legislation in past years that employed biometric data. \n \n Mr. McCain\'s spokesman declined to discuss Senate talks on the current bill. Two other senators who have backed the ID card in the past, Mr. Schumer and Democrat Dick Durbin of Illinois, said through spokesmen that the new Senate legislation wouldn\'t necessarily call for a biometric card. \n \n In 2010, Messrs. Graham and Schumer offered an immigration plan that included the requirement for an ID card featuring either fingerprints or a scan of the veins in the top of a person\'s hand. \n \n Like the senators, President Barack Obama is calling for an improved worker-verification system, but he doesn\'t specifically call for a biometric card for all workers. In principles for an immigration overhaul released this year, Mr. Obama called for a ""fraud-resistant, tamper-resistant Social Security card."" Draft legislation prepared by the White House refers to collecting biometric information from those in the country illegally as part of qualifying for legal status. A senior administration official said the White House wants to deal with ""fraud in a way that works and is cost effective."" \n \n The other senators writing the immigration bill are Marco Rubio (R., Fla.), Michael Bennet (D., Colo.) and Robert Menendez (D., N.J.). Spokesmen for Messrs. Rubio and Bennet declined to comment on the ID cards, while a spokeswoman for Mr. Menendez said the lawmaker has supported employee verification with antifraud measures. \n \n As an alternative to a biometric card, senators may move to strengthen the E-Verify system by, for example, requiring new hires to answer questions about previous addresses or other details, a person familiar with the Senate group\'s thinking said. \n \n Aides to several senators in the group said that a biometric card would be used only for employment verification and that it wouldn\'t become a mechanism for linking other personal data or replacing drivers\' licenses. Still, privacy advocates fear that governments and companies would in time require people to use the biometric card in other spheres of daily life. \n \n ""I subscribe to the \'if you build it, they will come\' school of regulation,"" said Chris Calabrese of the American Civil Liberties Union, who said he worried that the card would be required to board airplanes, to vote or perhaps purchase a firearm. ""It becomes in essence a permission slip to do all of the ordinary things that are your rights as an American,"" he said. \n \n Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration-policy expert at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, said: ""It\'s not only a gross violation of individual privacy, it\'s an enormously high-cost policy that will have an incredibly low to negligible benefit."" \n \n ""Every time I\'ve heard someone say \'non-forgeable,\' it\'s code for biometric,"" Mr. Nowrasteh added. \n \n The U.S. Chamber of Commerce supports expanding the E-Verify system, which is now used by a fraction of companies, though some states require all businesses to use it to clear new hires. The chamber hasn\'t taken a position on biometric IDs, a spokeswoman said. \n \n Some businesses support a move to biometric cards. If Congress expanded E-Verify nationally, it could widen identity theft and create new paperwork for small businesses, some businesses said. A 2009 study by Westat Inc. for the Department of Homeland Security found that 54% of unauthorized workers who submitted E-Verify paperwork were able to trick the system, though unauthorized workers account for only 6.2% of E-Verify queries. \n \n A high-tech ID card that could be scanned could solve that problem, said Manuel Cunha Jr., president of the Nisei Farmers League in Fresno, Calif. The scan would check the employee against a federal database to confirm eligibility to work. ""I don\'t want on the biometric card when I went to the hospital or whether I am married,"" Mr. Cunha said. ""I just want to know Manuel F. Cunha Jr. can work."" \n \n Julie Pace, an immigration lawyer from Phoenix, said she previously opposed a biometric card but would now support it as part of a broader immigration overhaul, arguing it would make worker verification more accurate. ""Undocumented workers today would be so happy to come out from the underground,"" she said. \n \n It isn\'t clear how much such a card would cost businesses and taxpayers. When Mr. Schumer proposed biometric identification in 2010, he estimated card scanners could cost businesses as much as $800. \n \n A 2012 study by the Chief Justice Earl Warren Institute on Law and Social Policy at the University of California, Berkeley, law school concluded that a national ID system would cost the government $22.6 billion to create and $2.1 billion each year to operate. \n \n Most European countries require their citizens to carry some form of ID.

This week, 52-year-old Shermain Miles got released from jail to a residential home for ex-cons, and she told the Sun-Times she is determined to avoid yet another return trip by staying away from old haunts and bad influences. ""I’m really not that bad a person,"" she says. ""It was the alcohol I was drinking that turned me into a monster.""

22,"['“Now, this is real simple,” President Obama told a crowd at Prince George’s Community College, in Maryland, in late September. “It’s a Website where you can compare and purchase affordable health-insurance plans, side by side, the same way you shop for a plane ticket on Kayak … same way you shop for a TV on Amazon. You just go on, and you start looking, and here are all the options.” \n \n As we all now know, the bug-infested Website healthcare.gov turned out to be anything but “real simple.” After the site’s disastrous October 1 launch, the administration organized a frantic rescue effort shepherded by Jeffrey Zients, who is to become Obama’s chief economic adviser in January, and on December 17, the administration tapped Microsoft executive Kurt DelBene to lead the effort to build out the rest of the Website. The site is working better (but as of this writing still not perfectly) for consumers, though the complications it has unleashed for President Obama will be even harder to fix. The New York Times called the broken Website a “crisis that suddenly threatened his presidency,” and according to a CBS News poll, Obama’s job-approval rating has plunged to an all-time low. Americans’ approval of the Affordable Care Act has also dropped to its lowest level since CBS News began polling support for the law. \n \n The story of how the Obama administration and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the agencies tasked with implementing the Affordable Care Act got it so wrong is still unfolding. Much of the blame has to fall on an insular White House that didn’t want to hear about problems, and another chunk has to land on CMS, which instead of hiring a systems integrator, whose job it would have been to ensure that all the processes feeding into healthcare.gov worked together, kept that role for itself. As anyone who has worked with the federal government on such projects knows, it is utterly inept when it comes to technology. “The government continues to struggle with how best to acquire the expertise to integrate technology,” says Stan Soloway, the C.E.O. of the Professional Services Council, which represents contractors who work with the government. Soloway has a scary stat, which is that of the 80,000 information-technology workers in the federal government, for every one person under 30, there are 10 people over 50. \n \n That lack of expertise explains why in building healthcare.gov, the government turned to industry contractors; in particular, to CGI Federal, a subsidiary of CGI Group, a Canadian company. To those uninitiated in the dark art of government contracting, it seems scandalous that CGI, a company most Americans had never heard of, a company that is not located in Silicon Valley (where President Obama has plenty of Internet superstar friends who could have formed a dazzling brain trust to implement his signature legislation) but rather in Montreal, could be chosen as the lead contractor for the administration’s most important initiative. While right-wing news outlets have focused on the possible relationship between Toni Townes-Whitley, senior vice president for civilian-agency programs at CGI Federal, and Michelle Obama, both of whom were 1985 Princeton graduates, CGI’s selection is probably more an example of a dysfunctional system than it is a scandal. “A lot of the companies in Silicon Valley don’t do business with the government at that level [the level required for federal contracting],” explains Soloway. “It is very burdensome, and the rules make it very unattractive.” Indeed, government contractors have to meet a whole host of requirements contained in a foot-thick book, including cost accounting and excessive auditing, to prove that they are not profiting too much off the American taxpayer. Hence, there tends to be a relatively small, specialized group of companies that compete for this work, even on such critical matters as healthcare.gov. \n \n In this context, the selection of CGI, which has had a long relationship with the U.S. government through the companies it has acquired—among other projects, CGI also ran recovery.gov, the Website for all data related to the Recovery Act—doesn’t seem so odd. Back in 2007, CGI was one of 16 companies given an umbrella contract to do unspecified systems work for CMS. These so-called indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity, or ID/IQ, contracts exist throughout the federal government. Companies compete to be on the list, and then when a specific task arises, they compete again to be awarded that task; but because the list of competitors is predetermined, the process is shorter. When the Obama administration selected a main contractor for healthcare.gov, they decided to use the prequalified contractors, rather than starting afresh, in order to save time, according to Bloomberg. CGI was chosen as the lead contractor for the Website over three other bidders: IBM, QSSI, and Computer Sciences Corporation. According to congressional testimony, CGI stands to be paid $292 million for its work on healthcare.gov. \n \n CGI’s lack of visibility before healthcare.gov wasn’t a reflection of the size of the company or how much work it does. With a market value of roughly $11.6 billion, CGI, after the decline of BlackBerry maker RIM, boasts of being Canada’s biggest technology company. (All figures in this story are in Canadian dollars; one U.S. dollar is worth about 1.07 Canadian dollars at the present time.) In truth, companies like CGI are more body shops than true technology companies, and the projects they take on require a lot of grunt work by a lot of low-level employees. CGI employs almost 70,000 people, who are embedded in businesses and governments around the globe. Its U.S. clients have included the military, the F.B.I., Pennsylvania’s Medicaid Medical Assistance program, and at least 40 state governments. \n \n CGI is short for Conseillers en Gestion et Informatique, or Consultants to Government and Industry. It was founded back in 1976 by two Québécois, Serge Godin and Andre Imbeau. The publicity-shy Godin, now 63 and still active as the company’s chairman, became a billionaire this year, according to Slate, which called him a “classic tortoise” who had built his fortune with a “reliable, and more patient, business strategy than stumbling on the right tech at the right time.” He’s received numerous awards and honorary titles, including being inducted into the Canadian Business Hall of Fame, and he is a major owner of harness-racing horses. His daughter, Julie Godin, is the company’s executive in charge of human relations, and her father’s presumptive heir. \n \n CGI has been a big stock-market success. According to the Canadian newspaper Globe and Mail, CGI’s stock has risen an average of 25 percent annually for the last 25 years. At its peak in November, the stock was up almost 70 percent in 2013, and the problems of healthcare.gov seemed to be having no discernible impact. Slate said that that’s because healthcare.gov is such a small part of its business. At any rate, CGI just reported revenues of $10.1 billion in its fiscal year ended in September 2013, up more than 100 percent from a year ago. \n \n Even before healthcare.gov, CGI was embroiled in its share of controversy about its work, from problems with Ontario’s online medical registry to difficulties with the Department of Taxation’s collection system in Hawaii. As CGI worked on healthcare.gov, government officials were frustrated with the company for missing deadlines, and Michelle Snyder, CMS’s chief operating officer, told colleagues, “If we could fire them, we would,” according to The New York Times. Both Marilyn Tavenner, CMS administrator, and Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of Health and Human Services, testified in congressional hearings that CGI didn’t meet expectations. A CGI spokesperson says, “as a matter of policy, we do not discuss the specifics of our ongoing client projects.” \n \n On Wall Street, there’s an entirely different sort of controversy brewing about CGI. Several smart investors—including well-known short-seller Jim Chanos, who runs Kynikos Associates—are betting against CGI, or shorting its shares, not because of the quality of its work but because of questions about its earnings. In September, Deutsche Bank analyst Bryan Keane downgraded CGI to a rare “sell” rating, citing quality-of-earnings questions. What he and others point out is that a number of questionable accounting tactics could be creating the illusion that CGI’s business is far more successful than it actually is. After the news broke in Newsweek that Chanos was shorting CGI, its stock fell more than 12 percent, although it’s begun to climb again. \n \n CGI is what’s known as a “roll-up,” meaning that it was built by acquiring other businesses, or rolling them up. Indeed, since its founding in 1976, CGI has acquired more than 70 businesses. (“Please stand up if you’ve ever been acquired,” Godin asked a crowd at a company gathering last February, according to the Globe and Mail. Almost everyone in the room stood up.) In the U.S., CGI built its business with the 2004 purchase of American Management Systems, based in Arlington, Virginia, and the $1.1 billion 2010 purchase of Stanley Inc., another Arlington, Virginia–based company. Stanley’s biggest customer was the U.S. Army, and the Stanley deal, according to Cormark Securities analyst Richard Tse, was instrumental in entrenching CGI with the government. “They are quite embedded,” he told the Globe and Mail. “Stanley was an entity that was really effectively managing many of the back-office systems for government and military.” Most recently, CGI bought Logica, a management-consultancy company headquartered in the United Kingdom.', ""CGI Federal, the company responsible for building the problem-plagued Web site for the Affordable Care Act, won the job because of what federal officials deemed a “technically superior” proposal, according to government documents and people familiar with the decision. \n \n Not considered in the 2011 selection process was the history of numerous executives at CGI Federal, who had come from another company that had mishandled at least 20 other government \xadinformation technology projects more than a decade ago. But federal officials were not required to examine that long-term track record, which included a highly publicized failure to automate retirement benefits for millions of federal workers. \n \n By 2011, CGI Federal already had been cleared to do government work at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency overseeing the rollout of the new health-care law. \n \n The company had been included in a pool of pre-screened, approved contractors in 2007, during the George W. Bush administration, and only firms in that pool were later allowed to bid for the Affordable Care Act work. It was at that earlier time that the problems at American Management Systems, the Fairfax County IT contractor acquired by CGI, would have figured into the assessment of CGI Federal, contracting experts say. \n \n In hindsight, one former CMS official said, the AMS record “could well have knocked [CGI Federal] out of the competition, and probably should have.” \n \n View Graphic A look at the consumer's route through the HealthCare.gov website and the potential failure points. \n \n In light of the bungled launch of the health-care Web site, critics have repeatedly asked how CGI Federal got the contract, and there has been widespread speculation on online news sites and blogs that the firm was selected because of political ties to the Obama administration. \n \n But a review of internal documents and interviews with former and current federal officials show that the selection process was walled off from politics. \n \n Career officials at CMS, working out of an obscure Baltimore-based contracting office, focused in 2011 on the proposals submitted by four bidders, examining technical competency and cost while giving relatively little attention to past performance. Since 2007, CGI Federal had won 17 other CMS jobs under the pre-screened contract, worth several hundred million dollars. \n \n The review of CGI Federal concluded there was “no evidence of performance risk,” according to a CMS document, portions of which were read to The Washington Post by a person familiar with the contracting process. \n \n CGI Federal won the $93 million contract, now worth $293 million, in September 2011. \n \n At the time of the earlier selection process in 2007, CGI Federal was still relatively new to federal contracting. It had grown out of CGI Group’s acquisition in 2004 of AMS, which had a recent history of troubled projects, including a Philadelphia school computer system that sent paychecks to dead people and a Mississippi tax system so dysfunctional that a jury awarded a $474 million verdict against the firm. \n \n Three former CMS officials said in recent interviews that the AMS problems should have raised red flags. \n \n “Should CMS have recognized that ‘Okay, here’s CGI Federal. It’s a new company, but, oh, my God, it looks a lot like the AMS from yesterday’?” asked one former CMS official familiar with the contracting process who like others interviewed for this article spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal procedures. “Yes. I would consider that dropping the ball.’’ \n \n Tasha Bradley, a CMS spokeswoman, said in a statement that the agency “adheres by a long- \n \n established contracting process where expert, career contracting officials evaluate and award contracts based on criteria outlined in the contract solicitation, including past performance, technical expertise and proposed contract value.” \n \n CMS declined to comment on specific questions about how closely CGI Federal’s past performance was evaluated and whether that review looked at AMS. \n \n Former AMS executives have defended that company’s performance, and CGI officials have rejected any comparison with AMS’s earlier failures. \n \n CGI Federal has also defended its work on HealthCare.gov, despite an October launch that White House officials have acknowledged was disastrous. Federal officials have faulted the company’s performance, saying it missed deadlines, understaffed the job and overstated its progress. \n \n People familiar with the project have said it was also hampered by administration mismanagement, fierce Republican opposition and political sensitivities that delayed policy and regulatory decisions. \n \n The federal online marketplace that is selling health plans in 36 states under the 2010 health-care law has been functioning better in recent weeks, but officials are still working to fix lingering problems, including errors in enrollment records sent to insurance companies. CGI Federal remains intimately involved in the project, writing computer code in attempts to fix various aspects of the system. \n \n Linda Odorisio, CGI’s vice president for global communications, said the company “continues to work closely with CMS and all of its vendor partners to deliver continuous enhancements in system performance and the user experience” on the Web site. \n \n She added that CGI Federal “contributed to the significant improvements made to the system over the last two months, resulting in more than half a million Americans enrolling in just the first three weeks of December.” \n \n Umbrella contract \n \n In December 2006, CMS put out a request for proposals. The agency said it was seeking “world-class IT services” to improve and maintain the massive systems that run Medicare and Medicaid, according to contracting documents. Thirty-one bidders responded, including CGI Federal. \n \n CMS used a procurement method that has become increasingly common over the past decade. The agency first awarded an umbrella contract to a group of firms, and those firms were then eligible to bid on future IT work. Experts say this saves the government time because it shortens the subsequent bid process. \n \n In evaluating the bids, CMS was to scrutinize each company’s performance on previous contracts, according to an internal agency document obtained by The Post. The document described a “risk assessment” of cost control, on-time delivery and other factors. \n \n Federal law requires that past performance be considered for all federal contracts worth more than $150,000, with limited exceptions. Federal regulations also say CMS should have considered the record of “predecessor companies,” such as AMS. Several former officials familiar with the 2007 selection said no concerns about CGI Federal were raised inside the agency. \n \n AMS projects had run into trouble at the federal level and in at least 12 states, according to government audit reports, interviews and news accounts. The purchase of AMS was CGI’s entree into the U.S. government market, and AMS executives flocked to CGI Federal. Today, more than 100 former AMS employees are senior executives or consultants working for CGI in the Washington area. \n \n One former CMS official said the agency especially should have examined the most publicized AMS failure, an effort to automate retirement benefits for millions of federal workers. AMS was fired in 2001 by the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board after going $60 million over budget, writing computer code that turned out to be useless and never delivering a workable system, according to government reports. \n \n AMS had settled lawsuits arising from the project in 2003. “That should have stood out,’’ the former official said. \n \n CGI Federal was ultimately chosen for an umbrella contract, worth up to $4 billion in future work, along with 15 other firms, including Lockheed Martin and IBM. \n \n While it is unclear whether agency officials examined the AMS track record, former CMS officials said it probably would not have made much difference, because past performance has long been an overlooked component of federal contracting. \n \n Deadline pressure \n \n In the summer of 2011, the Obama administration was racing to figure out who would build the Affordable Care Act’s all-important Web site. “Time is of the essence,” said an internal CMS draft request for proposals, dated June 24, 2011. \n \n With deadlines looming, officials limited the bidders to the winners of the 2007 umbrella contract. “There was very great time pressure,” recalled a former CMS official familiar with the process. “The feeling was we had a lot of big IT powerhouses and they knew our work.’’ \n \n Four firms applied: IBM, Computer Sciences Corp., Quality Software Services and CGI Federal. \n \n As is tradition, the selection process was strictly sheltered from political considerations and political appointees at CMS or elsewhere in the administration, according to numerous former and current CMS employees. \n \n “I deliberately stayed out of contracting,’’ said Leslie Norwalk, the agency’s acting administrator under President George W. Bush. “If that had changed, I would have heard rumblings.’’ \n \n Agency documents show that a career contracting officer, in the CMS Office of Acquisition and Grants Management, was in charge of awarding the contract for the Web site. The selection process focused on bidders’ business and technical proposals, which described the proposed cost, hardware and software required, proposed infrastructure design, security requirements, and key personnel. \n \n The companies’ past performance was not a priority. The CMS document listed it as the second least important of seven technical evaluation factors. And the review would look only at past work under the 2007 umbrella contract, the document said. \n \n While the review found no performance risk for CGI Federal, agency officials had not always been satisfied with the company’s work. In 2010, CMS rejected CGI Federal’s bid under the umbrella contract to perform work on four health IT systems, in part citing unspecified performance issues in carrying out an earlier contract, according to a Government Accountability Office ruling. CGI Federal protested the CMS decision, but the GAO upheld it. \n \n And the review did not take into account problems that several other CGI projects had encountered, including years of delay and system failures on a state computer system in Hawaii. State auditors in 2010 partially faulted another CGI subsidiary, CGI Technologies and Solutions, for those issues. \n \n CGI says its overall work is high-quality and nearly always on time and on budget, and the company has also had many successes. In the past two years, CGI Federal has been awarded contracts with at least 25 federal agencies. \n \n Documents and interviews show that CGI Federal was selected because of what was deemed to be the company’s technical prowess, even though the price of the firm’s proposal was higher than that of at least of one competitor."", 'Since its launch in March 2009, the MBA has trained nearly 3,000 students and farmers to spread the ""positive beef message,"" offering online lessons on how to combat PETA and organizing a Twitter and Facebook "" Food Fight "" against its ""campus critics.""

When CGI was vetted back in 2007, it didn't have any obvious black marks on its record, the Washington Post explains. But CGI is a ""roll-up"" company formed by acquiring other companies—one of which, American Management Systems, was one giant black mark. AMS projects have hit trouble in at least 12 states as well as at the federal level, including a much-publicized 2001 failure to automate federal retirement benefits. The company went $60 million over budget on that one, yet produced nothing useful. More than 100 AMS alumni are now CGI executives or consultants.

She also gave a bruising interview to the New York Daily News. \n \n Tragic: Julia Roberts\' half-sister Nancy Motes killed herself in a desperate attempt to destroy the actress\' career and scupper her chances of winning an Oscar at this year\'s Academy Awards, Conner Dilbeck, pictured, has claimed in an exclusive interview with MailOnline \n \n Busy woman: Roberts has been working the awards circuit for her turn in August: Osage County, which she did here on January 18 while attending the Screen Actors Guild Awards \n \n Plea: Conner wrote about his brother\'s fiance and Nancy\'s troubles with Julia Roberts on his Facebook page along with a photo of when John Dilbeck proposed \n \n According to Page Six, the Hollywood star was \'mortified\' by the \'embarrassing\' stories and wondered if her cash-strapped sister had betrayed her by selling the juicy details to the UK tabloid for money. \n \n \n \n It\'s not clear if Nancy was in fact paid by The Sun for the interview. \n \n However, Conner told MailOnline Julia inflicted \'pure cruelty\' on her sister and Nancy\'s suicide letter was a desperate attempt to expose the alleged treatment. \n \n And a friend and neighbor of Nancy Motes told MailOnline that her death was \'not a Philip Seymour Hoffman thing\' but a planned suicide. \n \n \n \n Conner claimed the note is eight pages long - not five as had been thought - and Julia is said to be \'terrified\' about it coming out. \n \n Conner also revealed that John Dilbeck was overcome by the \'horror\' of seeing his fiance\'s lifeless body in the bath. \n \n In a Facebook post Conner wrote: \'Nancy wanted the Truth to come out and she was Willing to Die to get her point across.\' \n \n Conner, 40, lived with Nancy and John in their apartment in Santa Monica, California for years, during which time he saw their relationship blossom. \n \n But the dark side was that he claimed it gave him a front row seat to the he mistreatment he claims Nancy suffered at the hands of Julia. \n \n Watch the full interview on Inside Edition \n \n \n \n \n \n Emotional: Nancy Motes appeared to post aggressive messages onto her Twitter account in the weeks prior to her tragic death apparently attacking her half-sister Julia Roberts \n \n Conner said: \'I have spent enough time with Nancy and I know enough about her that I can say from first hand experience a lot of things that have happened.\' \n \n He added: \'The truth is in the eight pages of her suicide letter.\' \n \n In a series of furious posts on Facebook, Conner railed against Julia and squarely blamed her for the tragedy. \n \n He wrote: \'I am posting this as a plea to everyone to Pray for my Brother John. \n \n \'His lovely Fiancé, Nancy Motes, was driven to Take her Life yesterday because of the Pure Cruelty of her Sister, Julia Roberts (yes Ms. Pretty Woman herself), that has done everything in her power to Ruin her and my brothers lives. \n \n \'He is overwhelmed by this horrible event and all the Turmoil Julia has subjected them too.\' Speaking to MailOnline, Conner said that after his brother found his fiance\'s body last Sunday he called the police and then called his family in distress. Breaking into tears, he said: \'The one thing that has made it more emotional for our family than anything else is to think of the horror of my brother having to walk in their and find his dead love in the water and nothing he could do about it and how she was driven to do this.\' \n \n Oscars: Nancy Motes killed herself to scupper her sister\'s Oscar chances, it has been claimed. Roberts, left, stars in the film with Meryl Streep, center In the months before her death, Nancy took aim at her famous sister on Twitter and one particular tweet apparently gives weight to the claim that she was plotting to hurt the Notting Hill star in some way. Nancy\'s death hasn\'t officially been ruled a suicide as a toxicology report has not been completed but her the family said in a statement that she died of \'an apparent drug overdose.\' In December, an emotional Nancy mysteriously tweeted, apparently about Julia: \'Hey Hag! Glad you f****ed with me yet? You\'re going to LOVE what\'s coming! FYI-You\'re an awful, hate filled old pathetic excuse for a human.\' \n \n Conner\'s account comes after John Fraschetti, who also knows Nancy\'s grieving fiancé, claimed the family of the Oscar winner were now \'crying crocodile tears\' over the former Glee production worker\'s death. He said they are only interested in manipulating public opinion after her suicide, but during her life, \'drove her to death.\' Making the incendiary comments Tuesday outside Nancy and Dilbeck\'s home, Fraschetti said Nancy spiraled into depression after Betty Lou Motes, the mother she and Roberts shared, \'rejected\' her six months ago - and that she \'just couldn\'t handle it anymore\'. \'And then you get the actress woman who is pretending to grieve but she didn\'t want to deal with Nancy and made her f***ing miserable.\' Nancy Motes was found dead on Sunday in a bathtub filled with water with prescription and \'illegal drugs\' near her in an apparent suicide. Fraschetti claims to have seen the letter she left behind. \n \n Fraschetti, who has known Dilbeck since he was 13, said that since her death, her family have been careful to mold a favorable public reaction. \'They are crying crocodile tears. They have taken control of this situation, but they never cared of her when she was alive,\' said Fraschetti. Fraschetti said that Nancy, \'couldn\'t stand the rejection of her mom, who in the last six months had cut her off entirely.\' Upset: Julia Roberts\' mother Betty Lou Motes is seen leaving her home in Los Angeles looking frail and upset Tuesday afternoon Cut-off: Nancy Motes is pictured in this photo with Julia Roberts when the Oscar winning actress was around 22 years old \n \n \'It hurt her that none of her family wanted to be with her. She had a miserable Christmas, truly awful, and I think she just couldn\'t handle it anymore.\' \n \n Fraschetti admitted that Nancy\'s well-documented problems with drugs and her weight had caused divisions, but claimed that to cut her off was unforgivable. \n \n \'They didn’t care when she was alive. She was a handful, and yes she had her problems, but there’s a way to deal with your relatives,\' said an angry Fraschetti. \n \n Nancy\'s suicide note also reveals the true depths of depression that her family\'s rejection had sent her to. \n \n \'It read about how much she loved and cared for her fiancé and how happy he made her, but it also said how unhappy and depressed her family made her and how she couldn’t cope anymore,\' said Fraschetti, who said that fiancé, Dilbeck, is grief stricken by Nancy\'s death and can\'t face the media. \n \n Indicating that the suicide note goes into detail about how hurt she felt by being ignored, Fraschetti said that Roberts and her family even put pressure on Dilbeck to delete tweets. \n \n But, it was revealed last night that Nancy had apparently tweeted a string of vicious messages aimed at her Oscar winning sister, including \'Just so you all know ""America\'s Sweetheart"" is a B****!!\' on January 20. \n \n That and others were indeed deleted overnight. \n \n \n \n Friend: John Fraschetti has known Nancy Motes\' fiance John Dilbeck since he was 13 and says that Julia Roberts and her family cutting off Nancy caused her suicide \n \n \'We\'ve got a person who is grieving so much, but then there is the other so called family who are grieving, so to speak, who want to see as little grief as possible for them,\' said Fraschetti. \n \n \'It\'s the rich versus the poor, the fake versus the real, he\'s the one who\'s in agony, he\'s the one that\'s genuine.\' \n \n And in an apparent confirmation that she did indeed commit suicide, Fraschetti said that her death was planned, but that she didn\'t use heroin like Philip Seymour Hoffman. \n \n She wasn’t into heroin, as far as I was aware. It’s not like her or John were heroin addicts. Come on, it’s ridiculous. \n \n ‘I wouldn’t read too much into where she did it, it wasn’t in some drug den. She was dog sitting, and I imagine she did this, so she didn’t have to do it at home and let John find her.\' \n \n And this afternoon, Julia Roberts\' grief-stricken mother looked frail and visibly shaken as she visited the Oscar-winner following the apparent suicide death of her younger daughter, Nancy Motes. \n \n \n \n Dressed in a tartan hat and black jacket, Betty Lou Motes was driven by a friend from her home in Pacific Palisades to Julia\'s mansion in Malibu. \n \n The visit came after it was reported that Nancy left a five page suicide note in which she accused her famous sibling of driving her to kill herself. \n \n Her fiancé discovered her body, which had been dead as long as 12 hours, but a responding EMT worker recovered the extensive letter, according to the New York Daily News. \n \n In the note, Nancy dedicated three pages to her tortured relationship with the Pretty Woman actress, the Daily News quoted a source close to the investigation as saying. \n \n Gone too soon: Nancy Motes, pictured in August (left), died on Sunday from an apparent drug overdose; she is the half-sister of Julia Roberts (right) \n \n Rage: Nancy Motes, tweeted under her husband-to-be\'s last name online. This vitriolic attack is believed to be against her half-sister, Julia Roberts and happened a little more than a month before she died \n \n Pain: Nancy Motes is also believed to have launched these attacks on the star of Pretty Woman and Mystic Pizza - calling her cruel and blaming her for causing her rage despite her best efforts to remain calm \n \n Sad: Nancy Motes posted these bittersweet tweets in October - in which she laments that she is having to leave her family to find the love she craves from another \n \n \'It was definitely a suicide. She left a five-page suicide letter. The EMT found it,\' the source told the Daily News. \n \n \'There were three pages of rantings that her sister drove her to do this. There was one page to her mom, telling her how much she loved her, and one page apologizing to (her fiancé).\' \n \n Nancy and Dilbeck were scheduled to be married in May, but the Georgia native seemed to be unraveling recently. \n \n On Twitter, she sounded decidedly unstable, lashing out at Julia, whom she claims bullied her about her weight when they were growing up. \'So my ""sister"" said that with all her friends & fans she doesn\'t need any more love. Just so you all know ""America\'s Sweetheart"" is a B****!!\' she tweeted on January 20, referring to Roberts. \'Do you want to be a fan of someone so cruel? She\'s not even that good of an actress. Happy you totally F***ed with me?\' she added in a subsequent tweet before claiming she\'d never been more angry. \'I must admit I maybe going to far… But I never been so angry in my life. I\'m actually a pretty easygoing, peaceful person.\' \n \n \'(M)y own family has abandoned me,\' she tweeted January 22. Three weeks later, she was dead. \n \n The emotional comments, seen on the Twitter handle @Dabbs76, had been deleted by Tuesday morning. \n \n Family: Roberts with Motes and their mother Betty Lou when the star was filming 1997\'s My Best Friend\'s Wedding \n \n The most recent Twitter outburst followed similar rants late last year. \n \n For example, Nancy had written previously of her family abandoning her. \n \n \'Feeling blessed, even though I\'m sick as a dog! I\'m very grateful that I have my loves family, since my own family has abandoned me,\' she tweeted, referring to her new partner. \n \n \n \n Her next tweets also appeared to be angrily directed at the Notting Hill star. \n \n \n \n She tweeted: \'Hey Hag! Glad you f****ed with me yet? You’re going to LOVE what’s coming! FYI-You’re an awful, hate filled old pathetic excuse for a human. \n \n \n \n \'I must be grateful & not hateful. I must forgive. But Damn that is a REALLY hard thing to do sometimes, right?!?!\' \n \n Back on December 19, Nancy also sounded depressed. She wrote: \'I must remember how blessed I am even in this very low point in my life. I want ALL of my family to have an awesome magical Christmas! \' \n \n \n \n And on December 15 she tweeted: \'Must remember to stay strong. Life is a fight. You have to stay in it.\' \n \n \n \n Back in October Nancy also spoke about her family rift, tweeting: \'It’s a shame when you get more support from strangers than you do from your family. I can’t wait to officially belong to another family!\' \n \n She also wrote that she was getting support from her and Julia’s mother Betty, writing: \'So glad to have the support & love of my friends & mom! \n \n \n \n Still a smashing success: At 46, Roberts is more in demand than ever; here she leaves a talk about her Meryl Streep drama on February 4 \n \n Nancy last tweeted on Saturday, the day before she was found dead in the bathtub. \n \n \n \n She wrote: \'Hope everyone is enjoying their Saturdays & watching East Los High! Season 3 coming soon!\' \n \n \n \n Nancy joined twitter last August and had 69 followers. \n \n \n \n She posted several happy photos with her fiancé John Dilbeck who she was due to marry on May 17. \n \n Nancy had been tweeting excitedly about the big day, on October 21 she wrote: \'I found my beautiful shoes for my wedding day! And anyone that wants to bring me down during all the planning I have to do can kiss my ass!\' \n \n \n \n On October 3 she tweeted a photo of them together, writing: \'YAY! Wedding Venue found! Wedding dress found! Things are truly happening! It\'s all soooo exciting! I love him!\' \n \n Since her tormented tweets were made public overnight, they key sections have been deleted. \n \n \n \n On Monday, her family confirmed to People the 37-year-old had passed away in what appears to be an overdose. \n \n \n \n On top: The actress on the February cover of Vanity Fair, on stands now \n \n \'It is with deep sadness that the family of Nancy Motes ... confirms that she was found dead in Los Angeles yesterday of an apparent drug overdose,\' the statement read. \'There is no official report from the Coroner\'s office yet. The family is both shocked and devastated.\' \n \n \n \n She was discovered in the bathtub of a home by her fiancé John Dilbeck and pronounced dead at 2:12 p.m., a spokesman for the Los Angeles Coroner\'s Office told MailOnline. \n \n It is believed she was found at a house where she was pet-sitting for a friend. \n \n Today, Ed Winter, assistant chief at the LA County Coroner\'s Office, said: ‘The autopsy has been completed and the cause of death has been deferred depending on the toxicology reports. This can take between six and eight weeks. \n \n \n \n ‘A number of prescription medications were found in the bathroom area as were illegal drugs. We are still investigating whether they were hers or not. We’re not releasing what illegal drugs they were. \n \n \n \n ‘It could be a possible suicide, but we don’t know the cause of death yet for sure, which is depending on further investigation. It’s more complicated as she also had some medical issues, so we’re not sure what happened at the moment. \n \n \n \n \'We are not being specific what those issues are, but it could mean a number of reasons for her death, she could have been taking a bath and had a heart attack. We just don’t know at this stage.\' \n \n Julia\'s rep did not return calls to MailOnline. The actress cancelled an appearance at an Academy Awards luncheon on Monday. \n \n \n \n Nancy was an aspiring actress who had worked as a production assistant on TV\'s Glee. \n \n \n \n Julia and Nancy had the same mother, Betty Lou, but different fathers: Nancy\'s dad was Michael Motes and Julia\'s is the late Walter Grady Roberts. \n \n \n \n In August the blonde had complained about growing up in the shadow of the Pretty Woman star, who has been working the awards circuit this year for her turn in August: Osage County with Meryl Streep. \n \n Thinner: Nancy Motes looked considerably thinner in August 2013 as she grabbed coffee near her home in Santa Monica \n \n The younger sibling had said she was known as Julia\'s \'fat little sister\' and said the Oscar-winner had taunted her about her weight, leading her to undergo weight loss surgery in June 2012. \n \n \n \n Roberts, 46, made her feel embarrassed and ashamed of her weight, according to Nancy, which peaked at 20st. \n \n \n \n She resorted to a £20,000 gastric bypass operation last year. \n \n \n \n \'It makes me feel incredibly hurt and very sad,\' Motes said. \'When you\'re in a family of very, very exceptionally beautiful people it\'s intimidating.\' \n \n \n \n Her other siblings include Eric Roberts, 57, and Lisa Roberts Gillan, 48, who are also actors. \n \n \n \n Actress Emma Roberts is the daughter of Eric. \n \n \n \n \'I think that growing up as Pretty Woman\'s little sister has definitely made me try to see the person inside and not the person outside,\' she added. \'A lot of my life I felt judged for my weight.\' \n \n Motes, who grew up in the US state of Georgia, was only 13 when Roberts shot to Hollywood fame as hooker Vivian Ward in Pretty Woman. \n \n \n \n The actress, who had won a Golden Globe for playing a young bride in Steel Magnolias, received a second for Pretty Woman. \n \n \n \n Motes, who described herself as an \'awkward\' child who was bullied at school, could not compete with the success of her \'very pretty and very popular\' sister. \n \n \n \n She said: \'When I was in high school and she was an adult, she would just let me know that I was definitely overweight. She would make it quite clear to me and in a not so nice manner. \n \n \n \n \'Julia did not want to see me go down that path [of acting] … So I just got a lot of criticism from Julia, which was very discouraging for me.\' \n \n \n \n After graduating from high school in 1995, Motes auditioned for roles in Hollywood while working as a waitress. But she could not afford to continue so returned to Georgia. \n \n Niece: Emma Roberts, pictured Monday with Evan Peters, was Nancy\'s niece \n \n Three years ago Nancy moved back to Los Angeles, after meeting her fiancé John Dilbeck. But she claimed Roberts started taunting her about her weight again days after she arrived. \n \n \n \n With her weight soaring, she finally decided to have a gastric bypass fitted. \n \n \n \n Motes said she could not afford the £20,000 fee, but rather than ask Roberts, who is worth £90million, for financial help, she took out a loan. \n \n \n \n She had lost 7st since the operation last June and had planned on marrying in May. \n \n However, RadarOnline reported last year that Julia planned to boycott the nuptials because she didn\'t like the groom and didn\'t want to get stuck paying for the wedding. \n \n \n \n \'Julia doesn\'t think much of Nancy\'s husband-to-be,\' the website quoted an insider as saying. \'She\'s convinced he\'s sponging off Nancy, who doesn\'t have much money in the first place.\' \n \n \n \n At the time of her death, it was not known if she had mended her relationship with Julia. \n \n \n \n She said last year: \'It\'s a work in progress, it\'s not going to be fixed overnight, nor do I think it\'s going to be fixed by me just getting skinny.\'', 'Julia Roberts was left devastated and anguished that she could not convince her half-sister Nancy Motes to enter rehab before her tragic drug overdose death in Los Angeles, Calif., on Feb. 9, RadarOnline.com has exclusively learned. \n \n Motes, 37, a former production worker on the hit television show Glee, was found dead Sunday in a bathtub at a Los Angeles home, where authorities recovered both prescription and non-prescription drugs. \n \n A source close to Oscar-nominee Roberts told Radar: “The sisters had a very complex relationship. They used to be very close when they were younger. Julia tried in vain over the years, even in the last six months, to get Nancy to go to rehab. Nancy refused the offers and that is when she would often publicly lash out at Julia. \n \n PHOTOS: Stars Who OD’d \n \n “It hurt Julia, but she knew her sister was battling addiction. \n \n “The addiction to prescription drugs made Nancy a totally different person. There would be periods of sobriety and with that brought clarity. It would be during those moments that the sisters would reconnect. Sadly, of course, those times became less frequent before her death.” \n \n As Radar previously reported, Motes called the Pretty Woman star a “b*tch” and appeared to have called her a “hag” as she vented in a series of tweets sent late last month. \n \n PHOTOS: Cheating, Gay Lovers, Incest, Drugs & Lip Synching! 50 Of Hollywood’s Juiciest Confessions \n \n It was yet another illustration of the pair’s rocky relationship after Motes previously declared Roberts led her to take the extreme measure of having gastric bypass surgery. \n \n “When I was in high school and she was an adult, she would just let me know that I was definitely overweight,” Motes told the New York Daily News last year. \n \n “She would make it quite clear to me and in a not-so-nice a manner.” \n \n PHOTOS: Celebs Who Died Young \n \n In tweets that have since been deleted, Motes wrote on Jan. 19 under the handle @Dabbs76, “So my ‘sister’ said that with all her friends & fans she doesn’t need anymore love. Just so you all know ‘America’s Sweetheart’ is a B—-H!!’” \n \n She later added, “Do you want to be a fan of someone so cruel? She’s not even that good of an actress. Happy you totally F—ed with me?” \n \n The family insider revealed to Radar that Roberts, 46, made arrangements for her troubled sister to check into a first class rehab facility last year. \n \n “She had agreed to go… this was about a year ago,” the source said. \n \n PHOTOS: Heroin Addicts, Coke Fiends & Celebrity Stoners — Hollywood Drug Dealers Tell All! \n \n “At the last minute, Nancy backed out, gave no reason. Yet, Julia told Nancy if she was ready to get healthy, all she had to do was call. Julia never got that call.” \n \n On Monday, Roberts’ rep released a statement announcing the death of her Motes, as the August: Osage County star withdrew from a number of professional commitments in the wake of the family tragedy, including appearances Monday at a pre-Academy Award luncheon and one on Jimmy Kimmel. \n \n “There is no official report from the Coroner’s office yet,” the spokesperson said. “The family is both shocked and devastated.” \n \n Nearly Unrecognizable! 20 Shocking Photos Of Stars Without Makeup \n \n Added our source: Julia is taking the death very hard.

They did not approve of John and felt that he was a bad influence on her. But you can’t tell someone of Nancy’s age whom not to date. She was living in a tiny apartment with John, his brother and a child. \n \n “While Nancy wasn’t a wealthy woman, she would have had gifts given to her by Julia as well as intimate family pictures. \n \n “There is a fear that John could be holding Nancy’s personal items hostage and possibly sell them to the highest bidder.

She is up for Best Supporting Actress for “August: Osage County.” \n \n Conner claims Julia inflicted “pure cruelty” on her sister and Nancy’s suicide letter was a desperate attempt to expose the alleged treatment. \n \n Conner claimed the note is eight pages long, and Motes deliberately timed her apparent overdose to destroy Julia’s Oscar chances. The note is believed to be in the possession of police — who have not confirmed its contents to Julia’s family. \n \n A source countered, “Julia has been nominated for other awards. Timing a suicide doesn’t make sense.” Roberts’ rep declined to comment.']",4,"– The latest drama surrounding the death of Julia Roberts' half-sister, Nancy Motes: A source tells the New York Post that Roberts may end up in a battle with Motes' fiance, John Dilbeck, who plans to argue that he should be a beneficiary of Motes' estate due to the length of their relationship. Of particular concern: gifts Roberts gave her sister and ""intimate family pictures,"" the source explains. ""There is a fear that John could be holding Nancy’s personal items hostage and possibly sell them to the highest bidder. If Nancy had photos and wrote a diary, describing her feelings towards her sister, he could use them,"" the source adds. And things get more bizarre: In an interview with the Daily Mail, Dilbeck's brother Conner—who has been ranting about Roberts on Facebook—claims Motes killed herself at this time specifically to hurt Roberts' chances of winning an Oscar for her role in August: Osage County. ""We are talking about people who are powerful,"" he says. ""People who have very delicate power, people who are in the limelight. Their power can be destroyed very easily if unfortunate things make them look more wicked. They have to be careful, it can destroy their career or their Academy Award."" He also claims Motes' suicide note contains secrets about Roberts that Motes wanted to make public, and that Roberts is ""terrified"" the note could come out. Meanwhile, Radar has stories from both sides: Some sources insist Roberts had been trying to help Motes by getting her into rehab, but Motes' fiance says she was not a drug addict."
24,"[""Judy Shalom Nir-Mozes, the wife of Interior Minister Silvan Shalom, was berated on social media for racism Sunday after tweeting a joke about US President Barack Obama. \n \n Hundreds of the former UNICEF Israel chief and popular radio show host’s 75,000 followers expressed outrage when Nir-Mozes posted: “Do u know what Obama coffee is? Black and weak.” \n \n Within minutes, the post garnered hundreds of comments, some of them calling Nir-Mozes “arrogant,” a “disgrace” and “explicitly racist.” \n \n One user wrote Nir-Mozes’s tweet was even more offensive in light of the racially motivated massacre of nine African American parishioners in a South Carolina church last week. \n \n If the wife of a senior U.S. official Tweeted this, there'd be a storm coming #Israel https://t.co/c0ZtP8M17l pic.twitter.com/Y8qe50suPM — Holly Dagres (@hdagres) June 21, 2015 \n \n Nir-Mozes swiftly removed the tweet and issued a number of apologies. “I apologize, that was a stupid joke somebody told me,” she wrote. \n \n Later, she apologized to the US president directly and tried to offer reassurances that she was not racist. \n \n President Obama I shouldnt have written the inappropriate joke I heard. I like people no matter about their race and religion. — Judy Mozes (@JudyMozes) June 21, 2015 \n \n Adopting a more lighthearted tone as she continued her online damage control, in another tweet Nir-Mozes wrote that she hoped her husband wouldn’t divorce her over the social media uproar. \n \n Sorry if I caused any offence to anyone. I hope I will stay married when my husband will land and hear what I did. — Judy Mozes (@JudyMozes) June 21, 2015 \n \n Last month, Silvan Shalom was appointed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to lead negotiations with the Palestinians and to oversee strategic dialogue with the United States. \n \n In a separate incident last month, Nir-Mozes was accused of trolling Obama soon after the president launched his personal Twitter account. \n \n In that tweet, the MK’s wife wrote “@POTUS well come, I hope u ‘ll write from The hurt of barack, and not from the head of Rrsedent Obama. Kisses from israel.” \n \n That tweet was also deleted shortly after, and Nir-Mozes later denied having written it. However, journalist Tal Schneider took a screenshot of the tweet and noted that it came from her account. \n \n Schneider also pointed out one of the typos — that Nir-Mozes likely meant to write “heart” and not “hurt.”"", ""Were these helpful? \n \n We've made a few changes to bidding. \n \n Your feedback is submitted. \n \n Your feedback is submitted.

25,"['A high court ruling blocking extradition to the US of Lauri Love, a student accused of breaking into US government websites, has been welcomed by lawyers and human rights groups as a precedent for trying hacking suspects in the UK in future. \n \n The decision delivered by the lord chief justice, Lord Burnett of Maldon, is highly critical of the conditions Love would have endured in US jails, warning of the risk of suicide. \n \n Lawyers for the 33-year-old, who lives in Suffolk, had argued that Love should be tried in Britain for allegedly hacking into US government websites and that he would be at risk of killing himself if sent to the US. \n \n There was cheering and applause in court on Monday when Burnett announced his decision. He asked supporters to be quiet, saying: “This is a court, not a theatre.” \n \n In his judgment, Burnett said: “It would not be oppressive to prosecute Mr Love in England for the offences alleged against him. Far from it. Much of Mr Love’s argument was based on the contention that this is indeed where he should be prosecuted. \n \n “The CPS [Crown Prosecution Service] must now bend its endeavours to his prosecution, with the assistance to be expected from the authorities in the United States, recognising the gravity of the allegations in this case, and the harm done to the victims.” \n \n The court heard evidence from psychiatrists who work in the US prison system and questioned the adequacy of safeguarding procedures in US prisons. \n \n \n \n The CPS, which acts on behalf of the US authorities in the case, said it would read the judgment before deciding whether or not to appeal. It has 14 days to decide whether or not to appeal to the supreme court. \n \n Emerging from the front of the court afterwards, Love said: “This is not just for myself. I hope this sets a precedent for the future for anyone in the same position that they will be tried here.” \n \n At a press conference later, he added: “I am greatly relieved that I’m no longer facing the prospect of being locked up in a country I have never visited. This legal struggle has defined my life for the past four years. I’m not looking forward to be being prosecuted but I think there’s a better chance that it will be done justly and fairly in the UK.” \n \n Keyboard warrior: the British hacker fighting for his life Read more \n \n Love, who holds joint British and Finnish nationality, has Asperger syndrome and severe depression. His supporters had gathered outside the Royal Courts of Justice before the hearing carrying placards declaring: “Trump can’t get no Love”, “Free Love”, “Trial at home” and “Give Love a chance”. \n \n They feared he would be held in solitary confinement and face a jail sentence of up to 99 years in the US. \n \n \n \n Welcoming the judgment, Emma Norton, the head of legal casework at Liberty, which intervened in the case, said: “We are delighted that the court has today recognised Lauri’s vulnerability, close family connections to the UK and the potentially catastrophic consequences of extraditing him. This was always a case that could have been prosecuted here and it’s shameful that Lauri and his family have been put through this terrible ordeal.” \n \n His father, the Rev Alexander Love, had said his son feared for his life because he did not think he could cope with the trauma of being sent to the US. He also praised Theresa May for devising the legal test that prevented Love’s removal. \n \n \n \n Nick Vamos, a solicitor at the law firm Peters and Peters and a former CPS extradition specialist, said: “This judgment will mean that US and UK prosecutors will need to be very careful in future about how they decide who should prosecute cases of concurrent jurisdiction, and will have to focus far more than previously on a suspect’s connections to the UK.”', 'Lauri Love smiles as he leaves with parents Alexander Love, left, Sirkka-Liisa Love, second left, and girlfriend Sylvia Mann, from The Royal Courts of Justice in London, Monday, Feb. 5, 2018.

The new decision by the judges overrules Westminster Magistrates\' court in late 2016, which said Love should go to the US. \n \n Love, who lives near Newmarket, is accused of hacking US government bodies and intelligence agencies in 2012 and 2013.

We\'re hopeful that other people may be able to rely on this verdict to ensure they\'re more humanely treated by the justice services."" \n \n Here\'s the background to Love\'s case. \n \n What\'s he charged with? \n \n It\'s alleged that Love was involved in #OpLastResort, run by hacking group Anonymous. The operation was a protest against the arrest of renowned programmer Aaron Swartz. (Swartz killed himself while facing charges in 2013). \n \n Read next Against a torrent of digital abuse, women are taking back control Against a torrent of digital abuse, women are taking back control \n \n Between 2012 and 2013 it is said Love belong to an Anonymous group accused of hacking into Nasa, the FBI and US Federal Reserve. A 2014 FBI legal filing says Love is allegedly a ""sophisticated hacker"" who stole sensitive personal information and made it available online. \n \n The FBI says an SQL injection was used to exploit vulnerabilities in Adobe ColdFusion and backdoors were inserted into the websites that could be exploited in the future. The website of the United States Sentencing Commission was also defaced and hosted a video created by Anonymous. \n \n Love has neither confirmed or denied any role in Operation Last Resort, as The Guardian reported in September 2017. \n \n Before this, in October 2013, the National Crime Agency arrested Love after pretending to deliver him a parcel at his parent\'s home. The body later issued legal proceedings telling Love to hand over passwords to his encrypted laptop but courts ruled this would not be legal and denied the NCA\'s request. No charges were brought by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). \n \n The legal arguments \n \n The court case Love v Government of the United States of America – which is being ruled on today – was held in the Royal Courts of Justice in November last year. The appeal was took to court by Love after he lost a court case for extradition in 2016. \n \n Read next A cyberattack on Russia wouldn\'t be a good move for the UK A cyberattack on Russia wouldn\'t be a good move for the UK \n \n In the case three months ago, Love\'s legal team, led by Edward Fitzgerald QC, argued that Love should not be tried in the US because of his medical conditions. ""There’s a very real risk that he would commit suicide,"" The Guardian reported at the time. ""There’s a virtual certainty that his condition would deteriorate."" \n \n It was argued the stress of being removed from his family and routine would exacerbate his conditions. Fitzgerald said the case against Love could be held in the UK and there would be a ""real risk of inhuman treatment"" against Love if he was sent to the US. \n \n Judge Nina Tempia, at Westminster Magistrates\' court, ruled in September 2016 (court documents) that Love should be extradited to the US. She said: there is a ""strong public interest"" in the UK upholding its extradition treaties with the US; the offences are serious; ""millions of dollars\' worth of damage"" was caused by the hacks; that US officials say they can manage vulnerable people in their prison system. \n \n However Tempia\'s ruling said Love is ""at high risk of committing suicide"" if extradited and he is ""of good character"" and is working and studying. \n \n Ultimately, it was decided that he should be extradited as Tempia was ""satisfied his needs will be comprehensively met by the US authorities"". Two months later, in November 2016, home secretary Amber Rudd signed an order that Love should be extradited. His appeal was then launched. \n \n The change in the law \n \n Love\'s case has many similarities with that of hacker Gary McKinnon. In October 2012, Theresa May – the then home secretary – blocked the extradition of McKinnon to the US after a 10 year battle. He faced up to 60 years in US jail if convicted of hacking charges. \n \n Advertisement \n \n McKinnon, who has Asperger\'s syndrome and suffered with depression, was allowed to stay in the UK after it was found his condition would ""give rise to such a high risk of him ending his life"" that it would breach his human rights. \n \n May also introduced a forum bar. ""This will mean that where prosecution is possible in both the UK and in another state, the British courts will be able to bar prosecution overseas if they believe it is in the interests of justice to do so,"" she said at the time. \n \n The forum bar exists under section 83A of the Extradition Act 20013. It allows judges to block extradition to the US and other countries if a crime was committed in the UK and if it is in the accused\'s interests to stand trial in the UK. Essentially, the addition to the law ensured that government ministers would not have to make any final decisions on an extradition case when it comes to human rights grounds. Speaking ahead of Love\'s trial one of his lawyers, Karen Todner, said if the forum bar is successful ""the UK police will have a green light to take more prosecutions here and not bow to the US pressure to extradite"".']",4,"– A 33-year-old British man who allegedly hacked into the FBI, NASA, and Federal Reserve and did millions of dollars worth of damage as a form of protest in 2012 and 2013 won't be stepping foot on US soil anytime soon. The High Court of London decided against extradition on Monday, with the Guardian reporting that it agreed with the two arguments his lawyers put forth as part of Love's appeal against extradition: That he could be prosecuted in the UK, and that Love, who has Asperger's and depression, could end up killing himself while in US custody. The AP reports the judges felt his suicide risk would be lessened if he was jailed in England, where family and friends would be accessible to him. The BBC and Wired quote Love as saying ""the reason I have gone through this ordeal is not to just to save myself from being kidnapped and locked up for 99 years in a country I have never visited,"" but that he hoped his case set a ""precedent so this will not happen to people in the future. ... I'm hoping that this outcome can contribute to the discussion we are having as a society about how to accommodate people that have neuro-diversity, whose brains are made up in a slightly different way."" Wired notes that Love would have faced up to 99 years and a fine of up to $9 million were he convicted in US courts. As for prospects of being tried on his own shore, the judges in their ruling ""emphasize ... that it would not be oppressive to prosecute Mr. Love in England for the offences alleged against him."""
26,"[""Marissa Mayer hits out at 'gender bias' as Yahoo is sold for $5bn \n \n Verizon agreed to buy Yahoo’s core internet business for $4.83bn (£3.62bn) in cash on Monday, marking the final chapter in the struggling fortunes of the fading web pioneer. \n \n Marissa Mayer, Yahoo’s chief executive officer, has faced a barrage of criticism over her tenure. She hit out at “gender-charged” reporting in an interview with the Financial Times after the sale. \n \n “I’ve tried to be gender-blind and believe tech is a gender-neutral zone but do think there has been gender-charged reporting,” she said. “We all see the things that only plague women leaders, like articles that focus on their appearance, like Hillary Clinton sporting a new pantsuit. I think all women are aware of that, but I had hoped in 2015 and 2016 that I would see fewer articles like that. It’s a shame.” \n \n Verizon, the US’s largest telecommunications company by subscribers, will combine Yahoo with another fallen giant of the first internet age, AOL, which it bought last year for $4.4bn. \n \n By the numbers: why big-name businesses are bidding for Yahoo Read more \n \n After the deal, expected to be complete in 2017, Yahoo will be left as a holding company for its valuable stakes in web businesses in China and Japan. Yahoo has a 15% stake in the Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba and a 35.5% interest in Yahoo Japan. \n \n “The sale of our operating business, which effectively separates our Asian asset equity stakes, is an important step in our plan to unlock shareholder value for Yahoo,” Mayer said in a statement on Monday. \n \n Founded in a Stanford University dorm room in 1994 by Jerry Yang and David Filo as “Jerry and David’s Guide To The World Wide Web”, Yahoo grew rapidly through the 1990s to become one of the pre-eminent internet companies of its generation. \n \n Offering email, news, shopping and search, Yahoo went public in 1996, with its share price soaring 154% on day one. In January 2000, Yahoo was valued at $125bn. But the company failed to keep pace with the changing tech landscape as Google came to dominate search and Facebook social media. \n \n Microsoft launched a $44.6bn hostile bid for Yahoo in 2008. On Monday, the company was valued at $37bn while Google’s parent company, Alphabet, was valued at $518bn and Facebook at $349bn. \n \n The new generation of tech companies have also outstripped Yahoo. Mayer’s company may still have more than one billion active monthly users but Verizon’s price is less than a quarter of Snapchat’s current valuation. \n \n \n \n Yahoo will continue as an independent company until the deal receives shareholder and regulatory approval, the companies said. \n \n The sale is an ignominious end to Mayer’s plans to turn Yahoo around. Mayer, a highly rated Google executive, joined Yahoo in July 2012. Before her arrival the company was in disarray and had had four CEOs in three years. \n \n Mayer promised a “renewed focus on product innovation to drive user experience and advertising revenue”. But shareholders lost faith in her after a wild spending spree in which she tried to build Yahoo’s content business by adding the blog site Tumblr, for $1.1bn, and signed deals with TV news anchor Katie Couric and the National Football League that failed to pay off. \n \n In a Tumblr blogpost, Mayer said she planned to stay at Yahoo, but Verizon’s Marni Walden, who will head the combined company, told CNBC the new leadership team had yet to be determined. \n \n Should Mayer be forced out, she is in for a payoff of $137m. Yahoo’s boss has already taken home $78m since she was installed as CEO, according to the stock analytics firm MSCI. Based on the terms of the company’s most recent proxy statement, she will take home another $59m if she’s dismissed from the company after a buyout. \n \n Some commentators were skeptical about the combined power of AOL and Yahoo. John Colley, a professor at Warwick Business School, said the merger was an alliance of two weak companies unlikely to form a single strong one. “Technology history is littered with the remnants of once all-powerful businesses – take Nokia and RIM, makers of the Blackberry,” Colley said. He said it was difficult to see how Verizon would benefit from this acquisition. \n \n The sale does not include Yahoo’s cash, its shares in Alibaba, its shares in Yahoo Japan, Yahoo’s convertible notes, certain minority investments and Yahoo’s non-core patents. \n \n \n \n The Alibaba and Yahoo Japan investments are worth about $40bn, while Yahoo had a market value of about $37.4bn as of Friday’s close. \n \n Verizon prevailed over rival bidders for Yahoo, including AT&T; a group led by the Quicken Loans founder Dan Gilbert and backed by the billionaire Warren Buffett; the private equity firm TPG Capital; and a consortium of buyout firms, Vector Capital and Sycamore Partners. \n \n The telecoms company is hoping that a combined AOL and Yahoo will create a strong third player to compete with Alphabet and Facebook for online revenues. \n \n Reuters contributed to this article"", 'ENLARGE Photo: Bloomberg News \n \n It’s Jobs Friday. For one ever-so-brief moment, the interests of Wall Street, Washington and Main Street were all aligned on the same thing: jobs. \n \n Nonfarm payrolls rose by a seasonally adjusted 160,000 in April, the Labor Department said. It was the weakest gain since September. The unemployment rate, obtained from a separate survey of U.S. households, held steady last month at 5%. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had predicted 205,000 jobs added and expected the 5% figure. \n \n Here at MoneyBeat HQ, we crunched the numbers, tracked the markets and compiled the commentary as it came in.']",2,"– Marissa Mayer says coverage of her four years at the helm of Yahoo has been ""gender charged.""

It was announced Monday that Verizon would acquire the struggling Internet pioneer for $4.83 billion, which, per the Guardian, puts an ""ignominious end to Mayer’s plans to turn Yahoo around."" Mayer has been oft-criticized for how she has run Yahoo, with much of the criticism centering on ""bad acquisitions and poor hires,"" per the Times, such as buying Tumblr for $1.1 billion—part of what the Guardian calls a ""wild spending spree."" In a post on that platform, Mayer writes, ""I’m planning to stay. I love Yahoo, and I believe in all of you. It’s important to me to see Yahoo into its next chapter.""

The pictures, taken by professional photog Mario Sorrenti, were captioned “Legal in NYC but not on @instagram” and “What @Instagram won’t let you see.” \n \n Public female toplessness has been legal in New York City since 1992.

India’s government is advising... (Associated Press) \n \n NEW DELHI (AP) — India\'s government is advising pregnant women to avoid all meat, eggs and lusty thoughts. \n \n Doctors say the advice is preposterous, and even dangerous, considering India\'s already-poor record with maternal health. Women are often the last to eat or receive health care in traditionally patriarchal Indian households. \n \n Malnutrition and anemia, or iron deficiency, are key factors behind India\'s having one of the world\'s highest rates of maternal mortality, with 174 of every 100,000 pregnancies resulting in the mother\'s death in 2015. That\'s better than five years earlier, when the maternal mortality rate was 205 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births, but still far worse than China\'s 27 per 100,000 or the United States\' 14 per 100,000, according to UNICEF. \n \n ""The government is doling out unscientific and irrational advice, instead of ensuring that poor pregnant women get to eat a nutritious, high-protein diet,"" said gynecologist Arun Gadre, who is based in the western Indian city of Pune but works in rural areas. \n \n The government booklet, titled ""Mother and Child Care,"" smacks of religious dogma and ignores widely accepted medical evidence that pregnant women benefit from eating protein-rich meats and can safely engage in sex, doctors said. \n \n It says pregnant women should also shun ""impure thoughts"" and look at pictures of beautiful babies to benefit the fetus. \n \n ""Pregnant women should detach themselves from desire, anger, attachment, hatred and lust,"" reads the booklet, released last week by the Central Council for Research in Yoga and Naturopathy, a part of the government\'s ministry that promotes traditional and alternative medicine. \n \n The traditional medicine minister defended the booklet as containing ""wisdom accumulated over many centuries,"" and said it did not advise specifically against sex, only against all thoughts of desire or lust. \n \n ""The booklet puts together relevant facts culled out from clinical practice in the fields of yoga and naturopathy,"" Minister Shripad Naik said. \n \n The advice is unlikely to be followed at the many government-run health centers across India. They are operated by the Health Ministry, which has had past conflicts with the traditional medicine ministry and follows more scientific practices. \n \n The booklet is the latest push for vegetarianism by Prime Minister Narendra Modi\'s Hindu-nationalist government, which already advocates avoiding beef and strictly limits the transportation and slaughter of cows, which are considered sacred by Hindus. \n \n But the latest homily to pregnant women has outraged the medical community. \n \n ""This is a national shame. If the calories of expectant mothers are further reduced by asking them to shun meat and eggs, this situation will only worsen,"" Gadre said. ""This is absurd advice to be giving to pregnant women in a country like India."" \n \n About a third of India\'s 1.3 billion people struggle to live on less than $2 a day. Many are lucky to eat more than one full meal a day, and women often give their portions up to their hungry children or husbands. \n \n Malnourished women are more likely to give birth to underweight babies, who then are in danger of being ""stunted"" or not growing to their full height and weight. A full 48 percent of all Indian children under the age of 5 are considered stunted, according to a 2015 report by UNICEF. \n \n ""Undernourished girls grow into undernourished women. Married by their families while still in their teens, these girls become pregnant by the time they are 17 or 18, when their bodies have not matured enough to safely deliver a child,"" said Amit Sengupta, a physician and health care activist with the Delhi Science Forum, a public advocacy organization. \n \n He said the government\'s advice to pregnant women betrayed ""backward thinking"" and hostility toward evidence-based science. \n \n ""This kind of advice is detrimental to women\'s health,"" he said.']",2,"– A government pamphlet's advice for pregnant women in India isn't going over well. The booklet titled ""Mother and Child Care"" tells the women to ""detach themselves from desire, anger, attachment, hatred and lust,"" spurn ""impure thoughts,"" look at ""beautiful pictures"" to benefit their fetus, and avoid meat and eggs, per the AP and Hindustan Times. According to one gynecologist in India, the advice isn't just ""unscientific and irrational,"" but it's ""a national shame"" in a country where 174 of every 100,000 pregnancies resulted in the mother's death in 2015, due in part to malnutrition and anemia. That's compared to 14 deaths per 100,000 pregnancies in the US, according to UNICEF. Since women are typically the last to eat and receive medical care in Indian households, the government should be ""ensuring that poor pregnant women get to eat a nutritious, high-protein diet,"" says gynecologist Arun Gadre. This would also help prevent stunted births; some 48% of Indian children under 5 have not grown to the proper height and weight. But ""if the calories of expectant mothers are further reduced by asking them to shun meat and eggs, this situation will only worsen,"" Gadre says. With its advice against lust, the pamphlet also suggests that engaging in sex is dangerous for pregnant women, contrary to medical evidence. A government minister charged with promoting traditional and alternative medicine says the booklet contains ""wisdom accumulated over many centuries"" from ""the fields of yoga and naturopathy."""
29,"['Correction: Earlier versions of this article misspelled the name of reality-TV personality Tareq Salahi. This version has been corrected. \n \n A couple of thousand people were held hostage by Charlie Sheen’s ego Tuesday night in an auditorium named after the female descendants of the American Revolution, half a mile from the World War II Memorial in the capital of the free world. This prompts an icky existential question: If the abusive ex-star of a CBS sitcom can compel a legion of citizens to pay $104.25 apiece to be doused in cultural bile, is the free world a little too free? \n \n The answer, of course, is no. Mostly no. No, except for the five seconds after Sheen seemed to imply that he believes President Obama wasn’t born in the United States, triggering boisterous applause from the mostly young, near-capacity crowd at the 3,700-seat DAR Constitution Hall. Sheen seemed to toy with the idea of running for president (with Nicolas Cage) and noted that his birth certificate was not “Photoshopped.” \n \n The man has become so unreadable that it was hard to tell whether he was joking or serious. He was, though, noncommittal about running and occasionally circumspect. \n \n “Every day is just one day,” Sheen said at the top of the show. “Tomorrow is not here yet.” \n \n It was the end of a long day for Sheen, who deployed his lawyers to two court hearings in Southern California on Tuesday morning, charioted himself in a black Rolls-Royce to the Van Nuys Airport that afternoon, and blazed across the continent in a private jet to walk onstage 67 minutes late for his show in downtown Washington, the halfway point in his 20-city tour titled “Violent Torpedo of Truth: Defeat Is Not an Option,” a kind of Sherman’s March of the male libido. \n \n Washington as a whole greeted Sheen with a feisty, inebriated bear hug, but there was some wonky thoughtfulness in the crowd. \n \n “I came here to see Charlie Sheen on an extended loop and be both horrified and entertained,” said a 34-year-old lobbyist who declined to give her name because she’s a “professional girl” who “cares about my future.” \n \n “Not often can you see a public figure implode in front of your eyes — usually you can only see that through the media,” said her 40-year-old lobbyist friend, who was also too embarrassed to be identified. \n \n “We perpetuate this image that is fake and a lie, and we put it on television,” railed a TV reporter into her cellphone — presumably to an editor — as she prepared to do a spot from outside the venue before the show started. “That’s how I feel as a journalist.” \n \n Me, too, but here’s the straightest scoop deliverable: The show began with a stream-of-consciousness monologue about Sheen’s hatred of ex-wives and his failure to secure sole custody of his children earlier in the day. It lurched onward to a dry sit-down interview — led by much-booed WBIG (100.3 FM) host Tommy Griffiths — about the first time Sheen met Marlon Brando. The crowd quaked with catcalls whenever Sheen wasn’t talking about doing drugs or manhandling women. \n \n “ENTERTAIN US,” boomed a male voice as Sheen waxed philosophical on the hard living of Dennis Hopper. \n \n “SHUT THE [EXPLETIVE] UP AND SAY SOMETHING WEIRD,” demanded another. \n \n It has been less than two months since Sheen outed himself as a warlock who is capable of ingesting “epic” amounts of cocaine, vanquishing addiction with his superhuman mind, shrugging off his nearly $2 million-an-episode job with Warner Bros. and orating on national television about the vague, seemingly mutable bylaws of nature and space-time (Google “winning” and “tiger blood” and “Adonis DNA” and so on). \n \n In the first week or so of his renaissance (or breakdown, depending on your standards), it seemed as if Sheen was onto something, as if he were imbued with a spiritual clarity reserved for prophets, as if he were pulverizing and remolding the very notion of celebrity. \n \n That notion of celebrity now seems to belong to his audiences — or at least the one at DAR, whose restlessness guided the rhythms of the show and whose outbursts were often more entertaining than the ramblings of Sheen or his better-received guest, stand-up comic Jeff Ross. \n \n “Curiosity about exploitation” was why 33-year-old Arlington salesman Johnny Champane came with three friends at the last minute. “Exploitation of himself. Of us. We bought tickets, didn’t we?” \n \n Since this was Washington, Griffiths asked Sheen how he’d handle Libyan dictator Moammar Gaddafi (“I’d make him marry [my ex-wives] Brooke and Denise”) and about what he’d defund to balance the budget (disband the Fed and “send the IRS to prison”). The crowd veered between boos and applause so frequently and quickly that one was indistinguishable from another. \n \n “Geez, you guys hate everything,” Sheen said at one point. \n \n Recognizable Washingtonians in attendance included Tareq and Michaele Salahi, the infamous White House gate-crashers and erstwhile reality-TV personalities, who signed autographs in the lobby, where they inadvertently created the event-horizon of a cultural black hole.', 'Enough probable cause exists for a citizen\'s official misconduct complaint against Gov. Chris Christie to move forward in connection with the governor\'s alleged failure to stop politically-motivated lane closures at the George Washington Bridge in 2013, a judge in Bergen County ruled Thursday. \n \n The complaint by Bill Brennan, a retired Teaneck firefighter and citizen activist, alleges that Christie knew of the closures while they were happening and should have halted them. He alleges that the governor\'s inaction constitutes second-degree official misconduct, a charge punishable by five to 10 years in prison. \n \n The lane closures caused significant traffic problems over a four-day span in Fort Lee and sparked a 16-month investigation that resulted in charges against two former members of Christie\'s inner circle, who are currently on trial in federal court in Newark. The trial is in its third week. \n \n ""I\'m satisfied that there\'s probable cause to believe that an event of official misconduct was caused by Gov. Christie,"" Municipal Presiding Judge Roy McGeady said. ""I\'m going to issue the summons."" \n \n The governor\'s office vowed to ""immediately appeal"" the ruling. Christie\'s first appearance was scheduled for 9 a.m. on Oct. 24. \n \n ""This is a dishonorable complaint filed by a known serial complainant and political activist with a history of abusing the judicial system,"" Christie spokesman Brian Murray said. ""The simple fact is the governor had no knowledge of the lane realignments either before they happened or while they were happening. This matter has already been thoroughly investigated by three separate independent investigations."" \n \n Brennan said he based the complaint on testimony from David Wildstein, a Christie appointee at the Port Authority who pleaded guilty to his role in the scandal. Wildstein is the government\'s key witness in its conspiracy and fraud case against William Baroni, who served as deputy executive director of the Port Authority, and Bridget Anne Kelly, who was the governor\'s deputy chief of staff. \n \n The latest on the Bridgegate trial \n \n Though Christie was never charged in connection with the lane closures, the scandal is seen as contributing to his failed bid for the Republican nomination for President. \n \n Wildstein has said in his testimony that he discussed the plot with multiple members of Christie\'s senior staff before and during the lane closures, which he said was political retribution against Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich for not endorsing the governor in his reelection campaign. \n \n Wildstein also testified that Christie was told about the gridlock at a 9/11 memorial service, as the lanes remained closed in Fort Lee. Brennan says Christie had a legal obligation to stop the lane closures at that point. \n \n McGeady asked Brennan why he filed in Bergen County, not Mercer County, where the governor\'s office is located. Brennan said that it was because the lane closures took place in Fort Lee, which McGeady said was a satisfactory answer. \n \n ""It\'s been dumped in this court\'s lap so this court is going to deal with it,"" McGeady said. \n \n Craig Carpenito, an attorney at the law firm Alston & Bird who appeared on behalf of the governor, told McGeady that Brennan\'s claim was ""intentionally misleading"" and that the governor\'s knowledge of the lane closures had already been thoroughly investigated. \n \n The audience in McGeady\'s courtroom, mostly there for minor criminal violations, applauded after he ruled. \n \n ""Anything short of probable cause today would have been official misconduct on the part of the judge,"" said Brennan, a graduate of the Seton Hall University School of Law. ""The standard is low, the evidence is heavy."" \n \n McGeady said the case would now go to the Bergen County Prosecutor\'s Office, which would decide whether to bring an indictment against Christie. The prosecutor, Gurbir S. Grewal, a Christie appointee, would likely recuse himself, McGeady said. \n \n The Bergen County Prosecutor\'s Office declined to comment. \n \n In New Jersey\'s criminal code, a charge of official misconduct pertains mostly to public officials. \n \n ""You\'re someone who either exercised their official function, knowing that it\'s unauthorized,"" explained James Pomaco, a former prosecutor in Passaic County who\'s now a criminal defense attorney. ""Or you\'re someone who knowingly \'refrained from performing a duty which is imposed upon him by law or is clearly inherent in the nature of his office\'."" \n \n Pomaco said that ""from a prima facie standpoint, there\'s enough for a charge"" of official misconduct based on Wildstein\'s testimony that Christie was informed of the lane closures as they were occurring on Sept. 11, 2013. \n \n At the start of the Bridgegate scandal, some experts argued that state was better suited to prosecute the case overall because violations of state law were more apparent. \n \n Assemblyman John Wisniewski (D-Middlesex), who along with state Sen. Loretta Weinberg (D-Bergen), co-chaired the legislative committee that looked into Bridgegate, said ""it was a very interesting development, certainly not something that I expected today."" \n \n ""It is a black eye for the state of New Jersey to have a judge find probable cause that the governor\'s actions were malfeasance in office,"" Wisniewski said. ""Look, the testimony of David Wildstein corroborated a lot of the suspicions that the committee had during our process, that lot of people have statewide. It remains to be seen exactly what happens now that a finding of probable cause has been reached, because we know that the prosecutor has a discretion to act on that. We don\'t know exactly what they\'ll do."" \n \n Weinberg said the Bridgegate panel may have to reconvene. \n \n ""I believe that there are people who came before the joint committee under oath and were not exactly forthcoming, which is the kindest way I can describe. There were texts apparently that they never told us about, there were meetings that they never offered,"" she said. \n \n Brennan unsuccessfully sued the Bergen County Prosecutor\'s Office in 2014 in an effort to reveal the names of bidders at an auction for baseball memorabilia seized in a drug arrest. He has filed numerous suits against public officials in Bergen County over the years. \n \n Staff Writers Craig McCarthy, Claude Brodesser-Akner and Samantha Marcus contributed to this story. \n \n Myles Ma may be reached at mma@njadvancemedia.com.

One of Governor Mitt Romney’s spokesmen was Florida Representative Will Weatherford, and during the course of his remarks in the “Spin Room”, he shed a very dim light on the ongoing redistricting process in the Florida Legislature…. West’s congressional district inexplicably sheds the most out support as compared to all other incumbent Republican and Democrat Congressman. A few weeks back we quoted an unnamed legislator saying that, “Allen West was screwed”, a statement which was originally made about made five months before the purposed maps were made public, leading insiders to believe that the fix was in against Allen West. But in light of Weatherford’s comment, it is increasingly clear that this is a fait accompli. According to Weatherford, those preliminary maps will not change- at the most, any additional changes would be minimal, and those changes would not make any appreciable difference from the preliminary maps. In addition, Weatherford stated that a deal was struck between him, Senate President Mike Haridopolos, and Senator Don Gaetz to finalize these maps and push them through as soon as possible. \n \n Weatherford tried to hide behind a need to comply with [state and] federal law, but that’s obviously a dodge since there could have been many ways to comply yet not sacrifice West: \n \n A website, SaveAllenWest, had been set up, but it appears to be too late. \n \n One of the rising stars of the Tea Party is about to be sacrificed by the Republican establishment in Florida, led by someone spinning for Mitt Romney. \n \n Don’t say you weren’t warned. \n \n Update 1-30-2012: Florida redistricting looking even worse and Dem SuperPAC targeting “Tea Party 10″. \n \n Also, Will Weatherford: The Florida legislature has NOT targeted Allen West \n \n Update No. 2 1-30-2012: Mark Levin interviewed West on January 30.

(Associated Press) \n \n CLEVELAND (AP) — After weeks of planning and one ferocious outburst that upstaged nearly everything on the Republican National Convention\'s first day, conservatives\' feisty but always improbable effort to deny Donald Trump the GOP presidential nomination succumbed to multiple causes of death. \n \n The lack of vital signs grew daily, culminating during Tuesday\'s roll call of the states that formally put Trump over the top. That vote saw a fizzling of what conservatives hoped would be an effort by some delegates to brazenly ignore state party rules and back the candidate of their choice, not Trump. \n \n ""Whatever may or may not have been planned, apparently it didn\'t happen,"" said Colorado delegate Kevin Grantham. He said party leaders wanted to ""make sure that Donald Trump is the nominee, regardless of what the states said, regardless of what the delegates say."" \n \n The anti-Trump conservatives unified with another faction trying to alter party rules to shift power from the establishment Republican National Committee to grassroots activists, including many supporters of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, a defeated presidential hopeful. But they were badly outnumbered by Trump delegates and party regulars who believed, like him or not, he\'d won this year\'s GOP primaries. \n \n Also weighing against them — the rebels\' lack of an alternative candidate, vigorous lobbying by an alliance between the Trump campaign and the RNC and a growing sense that it was time to unite against presumptive Democratic pick Hillary Clinton. \n \n ""You can stand your ground until the point comes when you would be compromising the country or the state,"" said Steve House, chairman of the Colorado GOP, whose delegation was loaded with dissidents and Cruz supporters. ""The team said, \'Let\'s stand up and support the nominee.\' "" \n \n On the other side of the arena, the Utah delegation gamely announced that it was casting its 40 votes for Cruz. But the presiding officer awarded all those delegates to Trump because of a quirk in Utah GOP rules that allow votes only for active candidates at the convention — and Trump was the only one. \n \n ""There\'s been a lot of effort to make sure we have a smooth convention, that Donald Trump is the nominee and that we unite,"" said Phil Wright, chairman of the Utah delegation. He said awarding all the votes to Trump was the GOP\'s way ""of trying to squash any dissent."" \n \n Since it became clear last spring that Trump was the likely nominee, conservative delegates around the country plotted ways to use the party\'s rules to derail him at the convention. They organized using social media, conference calls and seemingly endless emails. \n \n But they were soundly thrashed last week when the convention\'s rules committee approved guidelines for this week\'s gathering. That carried over to the convention itself, which is run by party leaders who wield the gavel and make final rulings on disputes. \n \n On Monday, conservatives demanded a final shot at rewriting party rules but were blocked. Their roars of outrage drew widespread coverage and distracted from party leaders\' efforts to show unity, but still they lost. \n \n During Tuesday\'s roll call, the Alaska delegation split its 28 votes among Trump, Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. Convention officials counted all 28 Alaskan delegates for Trump, citing a discrepancy in state party rules, and overruled the delegation when it demanded a fresh count. \n \n Underscoring the futility in challenging party leaders, GOP Chairman Reince Priebus explained the ruling against Alaska to the entire convention and said, ""In any event, have a great night."" He then quickly left the stage as music began to play, leaving the Alaska delegates unhappy and vanquished. \n \n ___ \n \n AP congressional correspondent Erica Werner contributed to this report.']",2,"– ISIS really wants to make sure it covers all its bases: A recruitment video released yesterday stars two deaf and mute fighters using sign language.

""I am sad that I could not keep my calm in the face of all the provocation, insults, and attacks that I was subjected to that day,"" he reportedly said. \n \n Besides the anger prompted by the photo, Erdogan\'s speech Wednesday to relatives of dead and injured miners was seen as insensitive and drew scathing criticism. \n \n As public anger mounted through the evening, hundreds took to the streets in anti-government protests in Istanbul and Ankara, with police answering, in some cases, with water cannons and tear gas. \n \n In Ankara, the nation\'s capital, some left black coffins in front of the Energy Ministry and the Labor and Social Security ministry buildings. Meanwhile, unions called for strikes across the country on Thursday. \n \n At the mine, where what has become more of a recovery effort than a rescue continued, the mood was sullen, but there was little sign of the burning anger seen elsewhere over the accident. \n \n Energy Minister Taner Yildiz said the number of coal miners confirmed dead had risen by one to 283, as of Thursday evening. \n \n Three injured miners remain in the hospital, he said. The recovery operation is expected to continue overnight and into Friday. \n \n A \'sorrow for the whole Turkish nation\' \n \n President Abdullah Gul offered words of comfort as he visited the western city, a day after his premier attracted public ire. \n \n The mine fire is a ""sorrow for the whole Turkish nation,"" Gul told reporters, and he offered his condolences to the victims\' families. \n \n Onlookers listened silently until a man interrupted Gul with shouts: ""Please, President! Help us, please!"" \n \n An investigation into the disaster has begun, Gul said, adding that he was sure this would ""shed light"" on what regulations are needed. ""Whatever is necessary will be done,"" he said. \n \n He commended mining as a precious profession. ""There\'s no doubt that mining and working ... to earn your bread underground perhaps is the most sacred"" of undertakings, he told reporters. \n \n Gul had entered the mine site with an entourage of many dozens of people -- mostly men in dark suits -- walking through a crowd of rescue workers who were standing behind loosely assembled police barricades. \n \n Rescue and recovery workers retrieved more bodies Thursday from the still smoldering coal mine. \n \n Resignation marked the workers\' faces after they had stood and sat outside the mine for hours, idle and waiting. Some of them passed the time talking on cell phones, others smoking or taking off their hard hats and burying their faces in their hands. \n \n With hope of finding survivors nearly gone, it appeared there was little they could do. \n \n Funerals amid grief \n \n Smoke and fumes are hindering efforts to reach more of those still missing below the surface and lessen the chances that any more will be found alive, even in special ""safe"" chambers equipped with oxygen and other supplies. Fourteen bodies were found in one such chamber. \n \n More than a day has passed since anyone was pulled out alive. \n \n Rescuers saved at least 88 miners in the frantic moments after a power transformer blew up Tuesday during a shift change at the mine, sparking a choking fire deep inside. \n \n Since then, the bodies of nearly 200 miners who were trapped in the burning shaft nearly a mile underground have been returned to their families. \n \n ""Enough, for the life for me!"" yelled one woman -- her arms flailing, tears running down her cheeks.

MUST WATCH Turkish opposition demanded mine reforms 01:19 \n \n Funerals took place Thursday in a community stricken with grief. \n \n Autopsies on dozens of bodies revealed the miners died of carbon monoxide poisoning. \n \n Erdogan said Wednesday that as many as 120 more were trapped inside the mine, though that was before rescue crews grimly hurried a series of stretchers -- at least some clearly carrying corpses -- past the waiting crowd. \n \n In his much-criticized speech to the relatives of the dead and injured, the Prime Minister glossed over the issue of mine safety, describing the carnage they had suffered as par for the course in their dangerous business. \n \n Apparently on the defensive, he rattled off a string of horrible past accidents, even going back to an example from 19th-century Britain. \n \n As he took a stroll through the city, onlookers showered him with deafening jeers as well as chants of ""Resign, Prime Minister!"" \n \n Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu defended the government\'s response and Erdogan during an interview with CNN\'s Christiane Amanpour on Thursday. \n \n ""All the efforts will be done to check what was wrong, if there was anything wrong during this disaster or before,"" he said, stressing the country\'s standards are ""quite high."" \n \n About Erdogan, Davutoglu said: ""He was feeling all these pains in his heart. Everybody knows that our Prime Minister is always with the people, and always feels the pain of the people. Otherwise, he wouldn\'t get such a high support in eight elections in (the) last 10 years."" \n \n Scathing engineers\' accusations \n \n A group of engineers investigating the cause of the inferno made a scandalous accusation. \n \n ""WHAT HAPPENED IN SOMA IS NOT FATE, IT IS MURDER,"" a local branch of the Chamber of Electrical Engineers wrote in all capital letters at the top of its official statement Wednesday. \n \n Although the group is not known for any party affiliation and comprises serious experts, such barbs have become common in a country riven with political division, where street protests and water cannons have become a familiar sight. \n \n The statement also reflects the anguish that has shaken Turkey after what looks to be the deadliest mine disaster in its history. \n \n The latest death toll already tops a mining accident in the 1990s that took 260 lives. \n \n The chamber of electricians also contradicted the official version of how the fire started, saying: ""The fire was not caused by an electrical situation as presented to the public in the first statements."" \n \n The assessment from inspectors from the chamber\'s local branch in Izmir on what happened suggests negligence may have played a part. \n \n ""The inspection revealed that the systems to sense poisonous and explosive gases in the mine and the systems to manage the air systems were insufficient and old,"" they said. \n \n The blaze started as a ""coal fire"" at 700 meters deep, and then air fans pushed the flames and smoke farther through the mine, the chamber concluded. The ventilation was not corrected until ""much later."" \n \n The miners were trapped and inundated with smoke and fire. \n \n Soma\'s public prosecutor\'s office has started an investigation of its own into the fire, Turkey\'s semiofficial Anadolu news agency reported. \n \n Political bonfire \n \n The chamber\'s accusations land on top of those already heaped on Erdogan\'s government by his political opponents. \n \n Opposition politician Ozgur Ozel from the Manisa region, which includes Soma, filed a proposal in late April to investigate Turkish mines after repeated deadly accidents. \n \n He has said that he is sick of going to funerals for miners in his district. \n \n Several dozen members of opposition parties signed on to his proposal, but Erdogan\'s conservative government overturned it. Some of its members publicly lampooned it, an opposition spokesman said. \n \n The mine, owned by SOMA Komur Isletmeleri A.S., underwent regular inspections in the past three years, two of them this March, Turkey\'s government said. Inspectors reported no violation of health and safety laws. \n \n Waiting on dead friends \n \n For Veysel Sengul, a miner waiting by the mine\'s entrance for more of his friends to emerge, the mourning may go on much longer than the three days of official grieving ordered by Erdogan. \n \n After what\'s happened, he said, he\'ll never work in a mine again. \n \n Rescuers haven\'t given up hope that some miners reached emergency chambers stocked with gas masks and air and could still be alive. \n \n But Yildiz, the energy minister, said ""hopes are diminishing"" of rescuing anyone yet inside the mine. \n \n Sengul has already given up. The miner knows that at least four of his friends are dead.']",2,"– Greece blinked today: In a showdown with creditors, the crisis-wracked country agreed to find the final $1.85 billion needed to reach the $14.2 billion in cuts required to get desperately needed aid money in September, reports Reuters.

In many cases, they are suspected of harming their children or other loved ones. As a result, when under investigation, they may be coping with deep personal loss, rendering them especially vulnerable to high-pressure interrogation tactics that can lead to false confessions or seemingly inculpatory statements. When women—traditionally viewed as nurturers and protectors—are accused of murdering or sexually abusing children, they are particularly reviled by society, including, of course, police, prosecutors, judges, jurors, and witnesses. 40% of female exonerees were convicted harming children or loved ones in their care. \n \n In cases in which no crime has occurred—such as accidental or natural deaths that are mistaken for homicides—the evidence is often entirely circumstantial. DNA evidence, the gold standard for exonerating the innocent, has been central to less than 3% of women\'s exonerations (compared to 22% of men\'s exonerations). In circumstantial cases, other types of forensic evidence may play an unusually large role, yet the evidence may be erroneous. More than a third of exonerated women\'s cases involved flawed or misleading forensic evidence. Two-thirds of female exonerees were convicted in cases in which no crime occurred. \n \n *Statistics on this webpage are derived from the National Registry of Exonerations and are reasonably current but may not be fully up to date.', 'In what was easily her strongest debate performance in recent memory – and arguably her strongest since the campaign began – Hillary Clinton was calm, cool and collected at Thursday night’s debate. \n \n Clinton could’ve been understandably on edge, as she was fresh off a resounding loss in New Hampshire on Tuesday and an effective tie in Iowa the week before. But it was Sanders who was oddly on the defensive despite what has been momentum in his favor, starting out the night more combative than Clinton and wasting his time on petty one-liners. (When Clinton talked about building political capital when she’s in the White House, for instance, Sanders began a rebuttal with “Secretary Clinton, you’re not in the White House yet.”) \n \n Perhaps it was understandable that Sanders appeared to be on defensive as the major topics of the night – race, foreign policy and relations with Obama – are all considered areas of relative weakness for the income inequality-focused Sanders, though the the depth of his policy knowledge and ability to articulate it before audiences, particularly on race issues, has improved markedly since the campaign began. \n \n Still, as winning over minority voters will be one of the principal areas of focus for both candidates going into southern primaries like the one in South Carolina and polls show that Sanders is struggling to eat into Clinton’s lead in the coming contests, expectations were high for Sanders this debate. \n \n And while both candidates performed well initially in talking about systemic racism and reforming the criminal justice system, it was Sanders who stumbled when a moderator asked if race relations would be better handled under him than the current president. It was a foreseeable trap – asking a white man whether he’d do a better job on race issues than the first black president – but Sanders didn’t seem to see what he was walking into. \n \n “Absolutely,” he said in response to the moderator’s question before slipping into his classic stump speech. “Because what we will do is instead of giving tax breaks to billionaires, we are going to create millions of jobs for low-income kids so they’re not hanging out on street corners. We’re going to make sure those kids stay in school are able to get a college education.” \n \n It was as tone-deaf a line as any all night and, worse yet, it may have reminded Clinton of another line of attack she’d prepared in advance. In an MSNBC interview earlier on Thursday, Sanders had criticized President Obama’s failure to connect with Congress, saying in an interview with MSNBC, “There’s a huge gap right now between Congress and the American people. ... What presidential leadership is about [is] closing that gap.” \n \n From a political analyst’s perspective, it’s a completely valid criticism – but when you’re running in a Democratic primary with an extremely popular Democratic president, it is, well, a weird move. \n \n And Clinton didn’t let him – or the audience – forget about that or other critiques of the president, pivoting near the end of evening to Sander’s frequent criticism of Obama. “I want to follow up on something having to do with leadership” she said, “because, you know, today Senator Sanders said that President Obama failed the presidential leadership test. And this is not the first time.” \n \n Then, without changing her even tone in the slightest, Clinton launched her most vicious attack on Sanders of the debate, running down a list of the times Sanders had called the president “weak” and “a disappointment”. She ended with, “I don’t think [Obama] gets the credit he deserves.” \n \n The argument over Obama’s legacy is one that Clinton’s campaign has been wanting to have with Sanders for some time, and Sanders set her up for an easy hit. Viewers at home watching the candidates on a split screen could see Sanders huffing and puffing as Clinton spoke, laughing angrily to himself and scribbling notes as she spoke. He clearly hadn’t been expecting that line of attack, though he might well have anticipated it. When he finally did get time to respond, he told the woman whom he’d earlier all but accused of accepting campaign donations in direct exchange for political favors that repeating his own words “was a low blow”, indignantly and with no cool whatsoever. \n \n It was a bad look for Bernie – whom the cameras often caught wagging a finger at the moderators while Clinton spoke – and it left him struggling to articulate the reasons for the distance between himself and a popular president, a distance he’d previously tried to wave away before when an interview Obama gave to Politico seemed to suggest that the sitting president favors Clinton over Bernie. \n \n Throughout the debate, on practically every topic, Clinton’s cool demeanor played well. Even on the one topic that should have gotten under her skin – why more New Hampshire women, particularly young women, didn’t vote for her – she resisted the temptation to be or even sound critical. \n \n “I have spent my entire adult life making sure that women are empowered to make their own choices even if that choice is not to vote for me” she said, adding that she hoped that they’d vote their consciences in the primary and learn more about her before the general election. \n \n After Clinton surrogates like Madeleine Albright and Gloria Steinem made the mistake of being insufficiently deferential to younger women last week – possibly costing her at least a few votes – Clinton didn’t have a lot of room to err in her answer, and she didn’t. \n \n It was, instead, her opponent who made the mistake – repeatedly this debate – of being too quick to anger and allowing his feelings to affect his answers. Clinton, who can hardly express an emotion in public without her ability to lead being called into question, didn’t have that luxury, and she didn’t try to indulge in it. \n \n For once, that was an advantage.', 'Expand \n \n No matter how distant the days of Five Star notebooks and three-ring binders, the first week of September always manages to usher in a familiar feeling of going back to school, particularly for those studied in the house of Chanel.

All five of the individual drawers are removable so as to set them up for creative work, while essential accessories such as a foldable Clic & Go water cup are also included. “To me, drawing is like breathing and writing. These are the things that almost relax me,” said the designer in a press release. Lagerfeld is fluent in the delicate synergy between fashion and design, and is said to often turn to pen and paper when bringing his new ideas to life. Of course, the first lesson in the art of expressing oneself is all about having the right tools, making the Karlbox collection expertly tailored to seriously stylish adults this back-to-school season.

She got 60 years for supposedly setting the fire that killed her 3-year-old son in 1995, and struggled to find anyone who could help, Mother Jones reports. Finally, lawyers at the Center on Wrongful Convictions at Northwestern University's law school exposed a glaring hole (and possibly corruption) in the arson investigators' case. That evidence got Bunch released in 2012 after 16 years in prison, USA Today reported at the time. Then two lawyers from the Center, Karen Daniel and Judy Royal, began helping wrongfully convicted women based on a shocking statistic: Women constitute roughly 11% of violent-crime convictions but only 6% of overturned cases. But why are women's cases harder to overturn? Daniel and Royal give their reasons: Women are usually convicted of violent crimes against people close to them (like a husband or son) so DNA evidence won't help; the suspect's DNA is already spread around the crime scene. By contrast, men usually assault or kill strangers. An incredible 63% of women's exoneration cases turn out to be accidents or suicides rather than crimes. So instead of finding a ""real culprit,"" Daniel and Royal may have to laboriously dismantle the prosecutors' case, perhaps with new science on arson or shaken-baby syndrome that not everyone accepts. Sexist stereotypes are used against women in court. In the case of a woman wrongfully convicted of murdering her son, the prosecutor implied she did it to pursue a modeling career. ""That was based on one tiny conversation expressing slight interest in maybe having a nice photo taken,"" says Daniel. ""Almost every case has something like this.""

In particular, he was 1-for-7 with one strikeout this season against Darvish. \n \n ""I did not mean it to be offensive at any point,"" Gurriel said. ""Quite the opposite. I have always had a lot of respect [for Japanese people]. ... I\'ve never had anything against Darvish. For me, he\'s always been one of the best pitchers. I never had any luck against him. If I offended him, I apologize. It was not my intention."" \n \n The 33-year-old Gurriel is a native of Cuba who played for the Yokohama DeNA Baystars of the Japanese Central League in 2014. Darvish is of Japanese and Iranian descent. \n \n Gurriel said it\'s common in Cuba to use the word ""chinito"" to describe someone of Asian heritage, although he admitted he realizes it\'s considered offensive in Japan. \n \n Darvish, also speaking through an interpreter, called the gesture and the word ""disrespectful."" \n \n ""I feel like, of course, Houston has Asian fans and Japanese fans, and Asian fans live all over the place,"" Darvish said.

""I\'ll let the league handle [potential discipline]. I\'m not the right guy to handle that one."" \n \n A source in the Dodgers organization said the team is ""very upset"" about the situation, ""especially in these times in this environment."" \n \n Darvish later tweeted a statement, saying people should put effort into ""learning rather than to accuse [Gurriel]."" \n \n ""If we can take something from this, that is a giant step for mankind,"" Darvish wrote.

On the contrary, I’ve always had a lot of respect for them.’’ \n \n Gurriel, who had a successful stint in the Japanese league in 2014 before defecting from Cuba and signing with the Astros in July 2016, also acknowledged using the word “chinito’’ – little Chinese guy – in the dugout in reference to Darvish. \n \n “In Cuba and in other places, we call all Asian people Chinese,’’ Gurriel said. “But I played in Japan and I know they find that offensive, so I apologize for that. I know they don’t like it.’’ \n \n Darvish, the Japanese right-hander in his sixth major league season, said after the game that he\'d seen a replay of the sequence and said he was “disappointed” in Gurriel’s gesture. \n \n ""Acting like that…is disrespectful to people around the world,"" Darvish said through his interpreter after the Astros\' 5-3 victory in Game 3. ""I try not to care much about it, but he played in Japan and I have a lot of respect for him, so I try not to think about it too much against him."" \n \n Darvish seemed subdued, but forgiving of Gurriel\'s gesture. \n \n ""Nobody’s perfect. And everybody’s different,"" he says. "" And we’re going to have to learn from it. We are all human beings. That’s what I’m saying. We’ll learn from it and we have to go forward."" \n \n Dodgers teammate Kike Hernandez said he talked to Darvish about the incident and said Darvish was ""extremely disappointed, as expected."" Earlier this season, Toronto Blue Jays outfielder Kevin Pillar was suspended three games for directing a homophobic slur toward an opponent. It\'s not likely such a punishment would be adjudicated between Major League Baseball and the union during the World Series, but MLB has shown a greater intolerance for hateful speech. \n \n ""I\'ll let the league handle that one,"" said Hernandez, a native of Puerto Rico. ""All I can say it’s disappointing to me. It’s just unfortunate that he did that right after that and not thinking that the cameras were on him. \n \n ""I’m sure (Darvish) is (stung).

35,"['In a new memo, Romney pollster Neil Newhouse argues that “the key numbers in this election are the 43 straight months of 8 percent or higher unemployment, the 23 million Americans struggling to find work, and the 47 million Americans who are on food stamps,” and that any convention bounce will be temporary. \n \n “Don’t get too worked up about the latest polling,” Newhouse wrote. “While some voters will feel a bit of a sugar-high from the conventions, the basic structure of the race has not changed significantly. The reality of the Obama economy will reassert itself as the ultimate downfall of the Obama Presidency, and Mitt Romney will win this race.” \n \n Newhouse goes on to argue that Romney is proving to be more competitive in more states than anticipated, and he’s close to Obama in several swing states: \n \n Next, the battlefield has actually expanded, not contracted. Note that Wisconsin is now in play and our campaign is now up with ads in that state, while the latest poll numbers from the Albuquerque Journal in New Mexico show the race closing there. And this tightening is not an anomaly. Consider the traditional Democratic strongholds of New Jersey and Connecticut, won by President Obama in 2008 by margins of 15 points and 22 points, respectively. In both states, Pollster.com’s reporting of the most recent statewide polls puts Obama’s lead at only seven points in each of these states. \n \n All Signs Point to a Tight Race: Those watching the daily tracking polls know that, while the President has seen a bounce from his convention, his approval has already begun to slip, indicating it is likely to recede further. In eight states, Pollster.com’s reporting of the most recent statewide polls puts the margin between the two candidates at less than three points, virtually guaranteeing a tight race. \n \n Full memo below the jump. \n \n #more# \n \n TO: Interested Parties \n \n FROM: Neil Newhouse, Romney for President Pollster \n \n RE: State of the Race \n \n DATE: September 10, 2012 \n \n Don’t get too worked up about the latest polling. While some voters will feel a bit of a sugar-high from the conventions, the basic structure of the race has not changed significantly. The reality of the Obama economy will reassert itself as the ultimate downfall of the Obama Presidency, and Mitt Romney will win this race. \n \n In his acceptance speech, President Obama did not offer any solutions for the millions of Americans unemployed or underemployed. But his convention speech was not the only big letdown to voters, as Americans also dealt with yet another dismal jobs report last week. President Obama is the only president in modern American history to stand before the American people asking for re-election with this many Americans struggling to find work. The key numbers in this election are the 43 straight months of 8% or higher unemployment, the 23 million Americans struggling to find work, and the 47 million Americans who are on food stamps. \n \n Today, there is no question: Americans are not better off than we were four years ago, and that is why President Obama has struggled in this race. The truth is that some of President Obama’s allies are claiming victory, but others are acknowledging the unsustainable position in which they find themselves. This is evidenced in a recent quote in The New York Times by an Obama Administration official saying, “It’s certainly not what I would call the position we wanted to be in at this point in the race…He’s going to have to make the case that we wouldn’t even be at 8 percent if it weren’t for him.” \n \n Consider the following points: \n \n The Obama Economy: The stakes are very high in this election, and voters understand the future of our country is on the line. This may be lost on those living within the hyper-political world in and around the Beltway, but it is not lost in communities in battleground states. In short, the Romney-Ryan campaign understands Americans struggling in the Obama economy will determine the outcome of the race, and once the preponderance of information about the President’s failed policies – combined with Mitt Romney’s vision to strengthen the middle class – are communicated, our nation will move in a different direction. \n \n All Signs Point to a Tight Race: Those watching the daily tracking polls know that, while the President has seen a bounce from his convention, his approval has already begun to slip, indicating it is likely to recede further. In eight states, Pollster.com’s reporting of the most recent statewide polls puts the margin between the two candidates at less than three points, virtually guaranteeing a tight race. Next, the battlefield has actually expanded, not contracted. Note that Wisconsin is now in play and our campaign is now up with ads in that state, while the latest poll numbers from the Albuquerque Journal in New Mexico show the race closing there. And this tightening is not an anomaly. Consider the traditional Democratic strongholds of New Jersey and Connecticut, won by President Obama in 2008 by margins of 15 points and 22 points, respectively. In both states, Pollster.com’s reporting of the most recent statewide polls puts Obama’s lead at only seven points in each of these states. In North Carolina, fresh off of hosting the Democratic National Convention, the Obama campaign is laying the groundwork for a stealth withdrawal. In a state the President won by a mere 14,000 votes in 2008, all one has to do is look at the Obama campaign’s television buy in the state to understand how they view their chances there. The Obama campaign’s North Carolina television buy has dropped 35% compared to June, and they have run more than twice as much advertising over the past two weeks in Rochester, Minnesota (hitting a small slice of Iowa), than they have in any North Carolina market. \n \n Historical Data: Political campaign historians will recall President Jimmy Carter led Ronald Reagan by a near double digit margin late in the fall in 1980. In that race, the voters made their decision based on the key issues confronting the nation and it determined the outcome. On the economy, the most important issue of this race, Mitt Romney leads by 51%-45%, according to the most recent CNN/ORC poll. \n \n Targeted Campaign: The Romney-Ryan campaign is running deeply local and targeted efforts in each of the states focusing on the voter groups that will make the difference on Election Day. Anyone asserting a “one-size-fits-all-campaign” effort is being put forward is simply misinformed, as evidenced by the 15 different ads released by the Romney Ryan campaign this past Friday and now running in nine states, including Wisconsin. \n \n New Money Advantage: All of this is not possible without resources, and the Romney-Ryan campaign and the Republican Party have a real advantage. In August alone, the Romney Victory effort raised more than $111 million, marking the third straight fundraising month of more than $100 million, putting us on a very strong financial footing for the final two months. \n \n Energy and Enthusiasm: CNN/ORC’s most recent polling shows that 62% of Republicans are “extremely” or “very” excited about this election, while only 56% of Democrats report being “extremely” or “very” excited. This Republican enthusiasm advantage has manifested itself in an unprecedented and historic grassroots effort that will have a significant impact on turnout in battleground states on Election Day. For instance, as of today, Victory volunteers have already knocked on more doors than during the entire 2008 campaign. (2.72 million in 2012 through September 8 compared to 2.43 million overall in 2008.) \n \n Romney’s Ground Game: During last weekend’s “Super Saturday,” we crossed the 20 million volunteer voter contact threshold. Also, the Romney campaign knocked on more doors last week than in any week during the 2008 campaign. More than 55,000 volunteers have knocked doors or made phone calls for Victory this year and that number is growing by the week. And volunteers have collected person-to-person identification information on nearly 1.7 million swing voters in battleground states thus far. And the numbers are even more startling when one looks at individual states. For instance, in Ohio alone, five times more phone calls and 28 times more door knocks have been made than at this time in 2008. This past Saturday, more than 100,000 doors were knocked on by Victory volunteers in the Buckeye State. And in Wisconsin, five times more phone calls and 72 times more door knocks have been made than at this time in 2008. And the list goes on and on. \n \n Mitt Romney will be the next President. The outcome of this race will ultimately be determined in favor of Governor Romney because he has the better leadership skills, the better record, and the better vision for where he wants to take the country. These advantages are being fueled by the commitment and determination of volunteers and voters to change direction and move our country on a path toward economic growth and job creation. In short, the combination of having the superior candidate, being in a margin-of-error race with an incumbent President, having a cash advantage, and having an unprecedented grassroots effort and a winning message on the economy ensure that Americans will make a change in leadership in Washington on November 6.', 'AP \n \n The Mitt Romney campaign circulated a statement Monday from its pollster, Neil Newhouse, conceding that President Barack Obama ""has seen a bounce from his convention"" in daily tracking polls but urging readers not to ""get too worked up about the latest polling."" \n \n Newhouse characterized the recent shift to Obama as ""a bit of a sugar-high from the conventions"" and argued that the ""basic structure of the race has not changed significantly"": \n \n All Signs Point to a Tight Race: Those watching the daily tracking polls know that, while the President has seen a bounce from his convention, his approval has already begun to slip, indicating it is likely to recede further.

PPP has these polls that just put chum in the water for the media. Sometimes I think there\'s a conscious effort between the media and Chicago to get Republicans depressed. \n \n A poll tracking model created for HuffPost Pollster by political scientist Simon Jackman, based on all polling at the national and state levels, shows that the conventions have helped boost Obama\'s share of the vote to his highest levels since early March.

This was a last minute booking made Friday afternoon, and the reservation was made under a different name, therefore we were not aware that NPI was dining with us or what the group represents.

39,"['The rate of developing esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) nearly doubles in those who both smoke and drink compared to those who only smoke or drink, according to new research published in The American Journal of Gastroenterology. Although multiple studies have identified risk factors for the development of ESCC, notably, exposure to alcohol and tobacco, this research is the first meta-analysis to look at the interaction between alcohol and tobacco in the risk of ESCC, a class of esophageal cancer that begins in the flat cells lining the esophagus. \n \n ""Our study suggests that not only do alcohol and tobacco play an important role in the development of esophageal cancer, the combination of their use markedly increases their potency as carcinogens. As a result, we as physicians should focus efforts directed at controlling the burden of esophageal cancer on those who consume both of these substances,"" said lead author Anoop Prabhu, MD, Advanced Endoscopy Fellow at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, in New York, NY. \n \n Dr. Prabhu, and authors Drs. Kenneth O. Obi and Joel H. Rubenstein at the University of Michigan Medical School, performed a systematic literature search in multiple electronic databases and looked at population-based case-control or cohort studies of ESCC that assessed the effects of tobaccos and/or alcohol. A synergy factor was calculated from each study to estimate the interaction on a multiplicative scale between tobacco and alcohol on the outcome of ESCC. \n \n ""Our systematic review confirmed the expected exposure-dependent relationship of both alcohol and tobacco with the risk of ESCC, as alcohol use and tobacco use were both independent risk factors for the development of ESCC,"" stated Dr. Prabhu. \n \n According to the National Cancer Institute, it is estimated in 2014 there will be over 18,000 new cases of esophageal cancer in the United States, and over 15,000 deaths from the disease.', '""Grape or grain, but never the twain."" So runs the old folk wisdom that advises against drinking wine or beer on the same night. It is far from uncommon to hear people who have woken up feeling sick, dehydrated and with a splitting headache blaming their hangovers on having unwisely mixed their drinks. \n \n Then there are the theories about the order in which to consume different tipples. One version suggests: “Wine before beer and you’ll feel queer. Beer before wine and you’ll feel fine.” Or is it the other way round? After a couple of drinks it’s not always easy to remember. All of which begs the question of how reliable these sayings are. Is there any evidence beyond the anecdotal that drinking wine followed by beer or vice versa makes hangovers worse? \n \n A review of previous research published in 2000 confirms that the causes of the main symptoms of hangovers are dehydration, changes in the levels of hormones such as aldosterone and cortisol, and the toxic effects of alcohol itself. In addition there’s evidence that the immune system is disrupted and that this could be the cause of the headache, the nausea and the fatigue. \n \n \n \n The first of the two main ingredients of a drink that affect the severity of a hangover is obvious. The higher the alcohol content, and the faster you drink it, the worse the hangover. This is however just an average. The same quantity of alcohol does not always result in the same severity of hangover. Many report that they don’t get hangovers and no one quite knows why. In a study of young Danes on holiday, almost a third of those who consumed at least 12 units of alcohol (roughly equivalent to four pints of lager or four 250ml glasses of wine) avoided hangovers. \n \n Mixing drinks needn’t necessarily increase the overall amount of alcohol consumed, but it may do with cocktails. If combining three or four measures of spirits alongside other ingredients, a throbbing head and dry throat is probably just the result of consuming more alcohol in total. \n \n Beyond the ethanol that triggers intoxication, the other key ingredients that affect hangovers are what the beverage industry calls congeners. These are the other substances produced during fermentation, such as acetone, acetaldehyde, fusel oil and the best-known, tannins, which give darker drinks their colour and part of their flavour. Bourbon whisky, for example, contains 37 times the quantity of congeners as vodka. \n \n To find out the effect of these substances on hangover severity, researchers in the US recruited university students who were regular drinkers, without alcohol problems. On different nights they were given either bourbon and cola, vodka and cola or a placebo which consisted of cola mixed with tonic, with a few drops of either bourbon or vodka to make it taste similar to the real stuff. They drank anything between three and six drinks, however much was enough to give them a concentration of 0.11g of alcohol per 100ml of breath. This would put them two to five times over the drink drive limit, depending which country they were in. They then spent the night in the clinic and were woken at 7am for breakfast before taking part in a battery of tests. For this they were paid a rather generous $450. The researchers found the students who drank bourbon rated their hangovers as worse, but interestingly they performed just as well on tasks such as reaction time tests. \n \n Clear drinks such as white rum, vodka and gin tend to cause fewer and less severe hangovers because they contain relatively low levels of congeners. Perhaps those who mix their drinks are more likely to choose a dark-coloured drink containing higher levels of these substances simply by virtue of their wider drinking range, but again it isn\'t the mixing in itself that causes the problem. \n \n No scientist seems to have done the perfect counter-balanced study where people are randomly assigned to drink beer followed by wine or wine followed by beer. But perhaps it’s not the grape or the grain that matters, but the effect that the strength of those drinks has on judgement. Beer is only between a third and half the strength of wine, so starting on it leads to less intoxication if followed by the stronger stuff. But if a person starts on wine or spirits, then their judgement may be impaired enough to drink more heavily later. There’s certainly evidence that people are not good at judging their own drunkenness. At low levels people overestimate the amount of alcohol in our blood, but after a few drinks they start to underestimate it. \n \n So, the existing evidence suggests that hangovers can\'t be blamed on mixing drinks. It\'s probably down to the high congener count of the booze, or over-drinking. As for hangover cures, scientists have looked into those too, and the British Medical Journal published a review of trials of everything from borage to artichoke and glucose to prickly pears in 2005. The bad news for drinkers is that none of them work. \n \n Do you agree?

But at the BBC, a review of existing research on the topic suggests the drinks' variety itself isn't the problem. Instead, Claudia Hammond points to other possible factors. For instance, she notes, having several different types of drinks may simply mean drinking more total alcohol. (As for ""beer before liquor, never been sicker""? It appears no research has been done to prove or disprove the idea that drink order makes a difference.) ""The existing evidence suggests that hangovers can't be blamed on mixing drinks,"" Hammond writes. But the amount of alcohol may not be the only culprit: Congeners, the non-ethanol products of the fermentation process, also contribute to a hangover. Tannins, for instance, are responsible for the color in darker types of alcohol. There are 37 times more congeners in bourbon than in vodka, and one study found that bourbon drinkers reported worse hangovers than those who drank vodka. So, Hammond writes, people having various types of drinks in a single night may end up indulging in drinks with more tannins. So go ahead and mix types of alcohol if you so desire, but you may want to avoid mixing alcohol with cigarettes: A study last month found that people who smoke and drink are at a higher risk of developing esophageal cancer, Science Daily reported. (If you do find yourself with a hangover, you may want to reach for a Sprite.)"
40,"['BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) — Scientists from the U.S. and Denmark are seeking to map out the plumbing system hidden inside the earth\'s crust that\'s responsible for the famous Old Faithful geyser and other hydrothermal features at Yellowstone National Park. \n \n Throughout November the research team will conduct flights over the park using a giant, hoop-shaped electromagnetic system suspended from a helicopter. The device acts like an X-ray to determine where and how hot water flows beneath the surface. \n \n The team also hopes to gain insights into the infrequent but sometimes massive hydrothermal explosions that occur in the park, said lead scientist Carol Finn with the U.S. Geological Survey. \n \n One such explosion, or possibly multiple explosions, that occurred roughly 13,800 years ago left a crater that measures 1-1/2 miles (2.6 km) across beneath at the bottom of Yellowstone Lake. It\'s believed to be the largest such crater in the world. \n \n Similar to the regular eruptions of Old Faithful, hydrothermal explosions occur when huge pockets of boiling water beneath the ground experience a sudden drop in pressure, causing the water to convert to steam and explode violently to the surface. \n \n Similar work elsewhere in the U.S. has helped reveal hazards from volcanoes. \n \n ""Nobody knows anything about the flow paths"" for the hot water that erupts from Yellowstone\'s geysers, Finn said. ""Does it travel down and back up? Does it travel laterally?"" \n \n The electromagnetic system was developed in Denmark to map out groundwater supplies in Denmark. It\'s able to discern between water and rocks to a depth of about 1,500 feet beneath the surface. \n \n In Yellowstone, a better understanding of the hydrothermal plumbing could help administrators plot out future development so tourists can enjoy the park\'s features without damaging them or being put into harm\'s way. \n \n The study is a collaboration between the U.S.G.S., Yellowstone National Park, the University of Wyoming and Denmark\'s Aarhus University.', 'This week, a survey will begin to map the underground hydrothermal features of Yellowstone National Park for the first time. \n \n The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), in collaboration with the Aarhus University in Denmark and the University of Wyoming, will use a helicopter carrying electromagnetic technology that resembles a giant hula hoop to record tiny voltage signals. \n \n The data will be able to tell the scientists if they are flying over solid earth, “rotten” sulfuric rock, or water. Carol Finn, one of the scientists on the surveying team, said she has been looking forward to this for ten years. \n \n “This is really kind of a last frontier if you will, in Yellowstone, of being able to look at a large part that’s underground that people that people have not looked at,” said Finn. “This survey can visualize the geology and the water down to about 500 meters, so 1500 feet.” \n \n The goal of the project is to fill in the gaps of knowledge about what causes geysers like Old Faithful and hydrothermal explosions by locating where all that heated water flows underground. \n \n “There’s just a lot we don’t know and this survey is really exciting because it’s going to be the first view of a large portion of the groundwater system, of the water underground that feeds all of these thermal features,” said Finn. \n \n The survey will also provide information that could help the park in the future by locating unstable ground. The researchers will fly the helicopter along the Mammoth-Norris corridor and take at least four weeks to complete.', 'Will Sacha Baron Cohen’s ‘The Dictator’ Walk The Oscar Red Carpet? \n \n UPDATED 5:30 PM WITH MORE DETAILS \n \n EXCLUSIVE… BREAKING 3PM… The Academy Of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences has pulled actor Sacha Baron Cohen‘s tickets from the 84th Academy Awards. This means he is banned from attending the Oscars even though he is an Academy member and one of the stars from Hugo, Paramount’s 11-nominated movie and Best Picture contender. “Unless they’re assured that nothing entertaining is going to happen on the Red Carpet, the Academy is not admitting Sacha Baron Cohen to the show,” Paramount just told me. The reason is that a proposal reached the Academy for Baron Cohen to strut the Red Carpet in full costume as his title character in the upcoming Paramount comedy The Dictator. UPDATE AT 5:30 PM: Later today, faced with all the bad publicity resulting from its action, the Academy tried to parse what it did when questioned by some media outlets. But the fact is that, this morning, the Academy’s Managing Director Of Membership Kimberly Rouch phoned Paramont’s awards staff to say Baron Cohen’s tickets had been pulled unless he gives the Academy assurances ahead of time promising not to show up on the Red Carpet in costume and not to promote the movie on the Red Carpet. The Academy made it clear that, without those assurances, it would not issue him the tickets. So he’s banned.* \n \n Of course, the next best thing to that publicity stunt is all the media coverage which this ban is going to generate for Baron Cohen’s film. So the Academy has decided to act like dictators about the actor playing The Dictator. Ugh. \n \n Sancha Baron Cohen Today Show Video \n \n Loosen up, people. Frankly, the Academy looks like uptight wankers with this treatment of one of the globe’s funniest comedians. The Academy merely had to say no when that proposal was presented to it. Everyone involved in the ceremony was adamantly against it on the grounds that it makes a mockery of what Hollywood considers its most prestigious event. Instead, the Academy clearly wants another overly long, ridiculously reverential show about movies no one bothered to see where the best thing about the telecast will be the comeback of popular host Billy Crystal at age 63. \n \n UPDATE: Is Academy Blinking On Banning Sacha Baron Cohen From Oscars 2012? \n \n The Dictator is a spoof about the “heroic story of a Middle Eastern dictator who risks his life to ensure that democracy never comes to the country he so lovingly oppressed”. Whether the fact that the 84th Academy Awards will be beamed into 200 countries had anything to do with this ban is unclear. But it is highly unusual for the Academy to pull a member’s tickets. An Oscars spokesperson acknowledged to Deadline yesterday: ”We would hope that every studio knows that this is a bad idea. The Red Carpet is not about stunting.” Oh really? Then why did Trey Parker and Matt Stone of South Park crossdress down the Red Carpet as J-Lo and Gwyneth Paltrow in evening gowns in 2000? Or Ben Stiller appear as an Oscar presenter in full blue Avatar makeup and hair in 2010? \n \n Deadline reported yesterday that Baron Cohen’s plan was to come dressed as The Dictator and then change into a tuxedo and attend the Oscars as planned. He wasn’t scheduled to present an award, but he was arriving at Kodak Theatre as part of the Paramount contingent. Now he can’t do even that. Paramount has a Best Picture nominee in the Martin Scorsese-directed Hugo in which Baron Cohen plays the train station inspector of the movie about an orphan in 1930s Paris. \n \n At the 2007 Oscars, Baron Cohen was asked to be a presenter and said he would do it only if he could be in character as Borat. And Oscars’ Powers That Be said, “No way.” He didn’t attend. But this is the first time he has been officially banned from the show. \n \n Purists feel that the Oscars is no place for such in your face promotion. The Academy hasn’t even allowed movies to be advertised during the Oscarcast, until this year. Then again, these Oscars have very little suspense because it’s a forgone conclusion that many of the winners of the marquee categories are already known and The Artist will win Best Picture. The prospect of Baron Cohen’s Red Carpet walk was the closest thing to drama. \n \n This would not have been Baron Cohen’s first time upstaging an awards show. To promote Bruno, he flew through the air at the MTV Movie Awards and landed with his crotch in the face of Eminem, who later admitted the stunt was rehearsed. And a trailer for The Dictator certainly was one of the raciest ever allowed by the MPAA during the Super Bowl, where Baron Cohen’s character was hilariously depicted running a competitive race while and leg-shooting rivals with a starter pistol as they got close to him. \n \n Editor-in-Chief Nikki Finke - tip her here.']",3,"– The mysteries of Old Faithful may soon be solved, thanks, in part, to something that looks like a giant hula hoop. American and Danish scientists have this week begun an aerial survey of Yellowstone that actually looks well into the earth, ""visualizing"" the geology and water as much as 1,500 feet below the surface, says Carol Finn. She's waited a decade to explore what she calls ""a last frontier ... in Yellowstone,"" and the intention is to better map the flow of water that's feeding Old Faithful and rare but sometimes violent hydrothermal explosions. Over a four-week period, a helicopter will fly above, armed with electromagnetic technology that looks like a giant hula hoop. The AP explains it in layman's terms: ""The device acts like an X-ray to determine where and how hot water flows beneath the surface."" Scientists will use the data to determine whether solid earth, ""rotten"" sulfuric rock, or water lurks below, which could assist in identifying unstable areas, per Wyoming Public Media. But a press release frames the main quest like so: We know that the water that explodes from Yellowstone's geysers ""originates as old precipitation, snow and rain that percolates down into the crust, is heated, and ultimately returns to the surface."" We know that it can take as long as thousands of years for that process to run its course. What scientists are hoping to determine are the routes these waters take. ""Does it travel down and back up? Does it travel laterally?"" asks Finn. Right now, ""nobody knows."" (Archaeologists made a surprise find underneath a Mayan temple.)"
41,"['Once they sense danger, fruit flies can pitch their bodies like a fighter jet during flight, rolling almost upside down in order to shift momentum and speed to avoid a oncoming threat, new research shows. \n \n “We discovered that fruit flies alter course in less than one one-hundredth of a second, 50 times faster than we blink our eyes, which is faster than we ever imagined.” Michael Dickinson, UW professor of biology and co-author of the paper about these findings, said in a news release. \n \n In his lab, Dickinson and other researchers have found that evasive maneuvers performed by fruit flies, also known as Drosophila hydei, are very similar to those of a fighter jet. His research will be published in the April 11 issue of Science. \n \n Escape Maneuver in a Flying Fly from Michael Dickinson on Vimeo. \n \n More like a plane than a boat \n \n “One of the fastest things a fruit fly does is take information from its eyes and react accordingly,” Dickinson said. \n \n Previous research suggested that flies would turn like a boat would, Dickinson said, but this new research has shown that they can pitch their body and perform banked turns much like a plane would. \n \n “They do this with remarkably subtle changes in wing movement,” Dickinson told us. \n \n Florian Muijres, lead author of the paper and postdoctoral researcher, said that it’s both the speed and accuracy of the flies that they have found impressive. \n \n “What we have found is that these flies are fast and accurate in their response,” Muijres said. \n \n According to Muijres, the flies can roll almost completely upside down while flying thanks to the incredible speed at which they flap their wings. \n \n “These flies normally flap their wings 200 times a second and, in almost a single wing beat, the animal can reorient its body to generate a force away from the threatening stimulus and then continues to accelerate,” Muijres said in the UW release. \n \n The fly’s brain may be small, but it’s very dense with neurons. Muijres said a fly’s brain is actually more dense than a human brain. The mystery of how these little creatures are able to perform such amazing feats is still pushing the researchers at UW forward with their research. \n \n “We have the input and the output and now we are looking at how the input translates into the output,” Muijres said. \n \n Using tech to slow down time \n \n UW researchers used three high speed cameras to accurately capture the flies’ movements in a 20-by-20 centimeter flight arena. They used an expanding shadow effect to make the fly take evasive action, and the cameras recorded the action at 7,500 frames per second. \n \n Escape Maneuver Fly SetupNrobofly from Michael Dickinson on Vimeo. \n \n Because the camera shutters were opening and closing every one thirty-thousandth of a second, they need to light the flight arena so the cameras would be able to get the footage. Dickinson said they used infra-red light in order to light the space for the cameras without blinding the flies in the process. \n \n “When the flies would go through the focus of all three cameras is when we would start recording,” Dickinson said. \n \n Once the measurements and video were recorded, the scientists were able to replicate the fly’s movement on a robot fly model. \n \n “We are able to take the measurements and replay them on the robot and directly measure the forces the wings were generating,” Dickinson said. \n \n Amazing brains \n \n Dickinson said a fruit fly’s brain performs very complicated calculations in a split second, an amazing level of calculation for something so small. \n \n “How can such a small brain generate so many remarkable behaviors? A fly with a brain the size of a salt grain has the behavioral repertoire nearly as complex as a much larger animal such as a mouse. That’s a super interesting problem from an engineering perspective,” Dickinson said in a news release. \n \n Check out some more videos of the fruit fly in action: \n \n Escape Maneuver FlyModel from Michael Dickinson on Vimeo. \n \n Escape Maneuver Fly Topview from Michael Dickinson on Vimeo. \n \n Escape Maneuver in Fly #2 from Michael Dickinson on Vimeo. \n \n Break out your 3D glasses for this one: \n \n Escape Maneuver FlyModel 3D from Michael Dickinson on Vimeo.', 'Fruit flies could make some talented fighter pilots. Scientists who had the insects wing it through two laser beams watched the bugs make hairpin turns at blazing fast speeds, by banking in the same way that fighter jet planes do. The findings, published in the journal Science, shed light on these tiny critters’ remarkable ability to evade predators (and fly swatters). \n \n [Updated at 5:15 p.m. PDT April 10: Tracking how these insects fly in response to a threat should help researchers understand the fruit fly\'s inner life, said Cornell University physicist Jane Wang, who was not involved in the research. \n \n ""The insects turn because they have some internal control circuitry, just like a pilot [who\'s] turning a plane,"" Wang said. ""And by looking how the insects turn, we might be able to say what the \'pilot\' is thinking.""] \n \n When trying to escape from a threat, the Drosophila hydei flies turn at a speed that’s five times faster than their normal turning speed, according to researchers from the University of Washington. Instead of turning right or left on the ""yaw"" axis, like a boat in the water, the flies execute banked turns, by rolling and pitching their bodies at the same time, which supercharges their turns. They can execute one of these within less than one hundredth of a second after seeing a threat, the scientists said. That’s 50 times faster than the blink of an eye. \n \n “A lot of other people working in the field … would not have predicted the fly could rotate itself so quickly,” said study coauthor Michael Dickinson, a neurobiologist at the University of Washington in Seattle. \n \n Dickinson and his colleagues captured 3,566 wing beats involved in 92 separate fruit fly escapes, which was no easy task. To capture such infinitesimally tiny movements, the scientists had to use high-speed cameras that took 7,500 frames per second -- that’s nearly 40 frames for each wing beat. They also needed flood the flight area with light to capture the motions in high detail -- but all that light would blind the flies, which wouldn’t be able to maneuver. \n \n Instead, they had to use infrared light, whose wavelength is too long for human or fly eyes to pick up on. All the circuitry in those lights generated so much heat that the scientists had to run an air conditioner in the laboratory, forcing the researchers to dress warmly in already chilly Seattle weather. \n \n There were, Dickinson said, “a whole lot of wool hats worn in the lab.” \n \n The scientists watched the flies fly through two crossing laser beams, causing their own shadow to loom large like an impending threat. In response, the flies quickly executed their escape maneuvers, which the scientists were able to capture on camera. \n \n The videos showed that the flies could roll to one side by 90 degrees or even more as they made these turns, almost bringing them upside down. And they could make these turns in less than two wing beats -- which is pretty remarkable, given that they typically flap their wings at 200 times per second, the scientists said. \n \n “So it’d kind of be like a jet fighter pilot with a stick in his or her hand, only had to make a little bit of tiny change in the stick and pshooo, the plane goes off,” Dickinson said. “So we’re very interested in how the brain can control motion on such a fine scale.” \n \n With all this high quality data, the scientists were able to pull out mathematical rules that governed the flies’ decisions on how to make a banked turn, and they then programmed them into a robotic fly that they tested in flowing mineral oil. (Because the robot was much bigger than the flies, the scientists had to adjust the viscosity of the fluid they were ""flying"" through so the physics would stay about the same, the scientists said.) \n \n The next step, Dickinson said, is to understand the complex neural circuitry linked to the flight muscles that makes these daring maneuvers possible. \n \n ALSO: \n \n Hallelujah!

Just because children who eat more fast food are the most likely to become obese does not prove that calories from fast foods bear the brunt of the blame.” \n \n In the study, researchers looked at data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) collected between 2007 and 2010. The team analyzed dietary intake in nearly 4,500 children between 2 years and 18 years old. The children were categorized as being non-consumers of fast food, low consumers (less than or equal to 30 percent of calories from fast food) or high consumers (more than 30 percent of calories from fast food). \n \n The researchers discovered that fast food is only a small portion of a larger dietary pattern established by children’s parents and caregivers. The obese children’s diet often includes too few fruits and vegetables and too much processed food and overly-sweet beverages. This unhealthy diet pattern is often reinforced in the meals students are offered as school lunches. \n \n “The study presented strong evidence that the children’s diet beyond fast- food consumption is more strongly linked to poor nutrition and obesity,” said study author Jennifer Poti, doctoral candidate in UNC’s Department of Nutrition. “While reducing fast-food intake is important, the rest of a child’s diet should not be overlooked.” \n \n Popkin noted that a better understanding of the patterns behind childhood obesity is important in the attempt to foster healthier habits, such as the reduction of sugary drink consumption and the greater inclusion of fresh vegetables and fruits. \n \n “Children who rely on fast foods may tend to have parents who do not have the means, desire or time to purchase or prepare healthy foods at home,” Popkin said. “This is really what is driving children’s obesity and what needs to be addressed in any solution.” \n \n Another study published this week from University of Illinois researchers found three main predictors for preschool obesity risk: a lack of adequate sleep, having parents with high body mass index (BMI) and having their eating habits restricted for weight control purposes. \n \n Published in the journal Childhood Obesity, the study included data from a survey sent to over 300 children and their parents living in east-central Illinois. The study’s conclusion was based on the first round of data collected when the youngsters were two years old. \n \n “What’s exciting here is that these risk factors are malleable and provide a road map for developing interventions that can lead to a possible reduction in children’s weight status,” said study author Brent McBride, director of the university’s Child Development Laboratory. “We should focus on convincing parents to improve their own health status, to change the food environment of the home so that healthy foods are readily available and unhealthy foods are not, and to encourage an early bedtime.”']",3,"– Swatting a fruit fly is as tricky as trying to catch a tiny fighter jet with an expert pilot at the controls, researchers say. High-speed cameras captured the insects avoiding threats by executing supercharged, banked turns much like fighter planes, reports the Los Angeles Times.

42,"['Babies cry more in Britain, Canada, Italy and Netherlands than in other countries – proved for first time by new research by the University of Warwick. \n \n Psychologists have created world’s first universal charts for normal amount of crying in babies during first three months \n \n in babies during first three months On average, babies around the world cry for around 2 hours per day in first two weeks, peak at 2 hours 15 mins at six weeks - and crying reduces to 1 hour 10 minutes by week twelve \n \n In Denmark, Germany and Japan, parents deal with the least amount of crying and fussing \n \n Babies cry more in Britain, Canada and Italy, than the rest of the world – according to new research by the University of Warwick. \n \n Professor Dieter Wolke in the Department of Psychology and the Warwick Medical School has formulated the world’s first universal charts for the normal amount of crying in babies during the first three months. \n \n In a meta-analysis of studies involving almost 8700 infants – in countries including Germany, Denmark, Japan, Canada, Italy, the Netherlands and the UK – Professor Wolke calculated the average of how long babies fuss and cry per twenty-four hours across different cultures in their first twelve weeks. \n \n On average, it was found that babies cry for around two hours per day in the first two weeks. Crying generally peaks at around two hours fifteen minutes per day at six weeks – and reduces gradually to an average of 1 hour 10 minutes by the twelve week mark. \n \n However, some infants were found to cry as little as 30 minutes - and others over 5 hours - in twenty-four hours. \n \n Babies cry the most in the UK, Italy, Canada, and the Netherlands – and the lowest levels of crying were found in Denmark, Germany and Japan. \n \n The highest levels of colic – defined as crying more than 3 hours a day for at least 3 days a week in a baby– were found in the UK (28% of infants at 1-2 weeks), Canada (34.1% at 3-4 weeks of age) and Italy (20.9% at 8-9 weeks of age). \n \n In contrast, lowest colic rates were reported in Denmark (5.5% at 3-4 weeks) and Germany (6.7% at 3-4 weeks). \n \n The current definitions for determining whether a baby is crying too much and suffering from colic, are the Wessel criteria, which were formulated in the 1950s. \n \n As childcare and the family unit has largely transformed over the last half century and across different cultures, new universal guidelines were needed for modern parents and health professionals to assess normal and excessive levels of crying in babies. \n \n Professor Wolke comments on what the research will lead to: \n \n “Babies are already very different in how much they cry in the first weeks of life – there are large but normal variations. We may learn more from looking at cultures where there is less crying and whether this may be due to parenting or other factors relating to pregnancy experiences or genetics. \n \n “The new chart of normal fuss/cry amounts in babies across industrialised countries will help health professionals to reassure parents whether a baby is crying within the normal expected range in the first 3 months or shows excessive crying which may require further evaluation and extra support for the parents.” \n \n The research, ‘Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis: Fussing and Crying Durations and Colic Prevalence in Infants’ is published in The Journal of Pediatrics. \n \n 3 April 2017', 'Professor Dieter Wolke, who led the research, said: “German and Danish parents are much less likely to get worked up and they will wait a little bit before they intervene to see if the baby can self-sooth. \n \n “They don’t get all worried about it.” \n \n Across all the countries examined for the survey, babies cried for an average of two hours per day in the first two weeks after birth. \n \n Crying peaked at about two hours and 15 minutes each day at six weeks of age, before gradually reducing to an average of one hour and 10 minutes. \n \n Previous research has indicated that around 40 per cent of infant crying is inconsolable, and Professor Wolke said many new mothers and fathers are unduly stressed by some “unscientific” parenting books which offer bogus solutions. \n \n Concern in Britain over crying babies costed the NHS an estimated £70 million each year, he said, with stressed-out parents less more likely to reinforce a pattern of crying. \n \n “It’s the same principal as going on a plane,” he said. \n \n “You are told to put your own oxygen mask on before helping others. \n \n “If you are not relaxed you are not going to be any use to your baby.” \n \n But he added that adult well-being surveys consistently put Denmark as one of the happiest countries in the world and that Danish babies may enjoy some “genetic bias” whereby they cry less. \n \n “The new chart of normal fuss/cry amounts in babies across industrialised countries will help health care professions to reassure parents whether a baby is crying within the normal expected range in the first three months or shows excessive crying which may require further evaluation and extra support for the parents,” he said.', 'The family of Walter Scott will get a settlement of $6.5 million from the city of North Charleston, the largest such payout in the recent high-profile killings of black men by police officers. \n \n With members of Scott’s family seated in the audience, City Council unanimously voted Thursday to approve the settlement, which City Attorney Brady Hair called “the largest settlement for this type of case in the state of South Carolina,” adding that he feels it’s in line with settlements on similar cases nationwide. \n \n Scott, 50, a black man, was shot April 4 by white North Charleston police officer Michael Slager. Cellphone video captured by a passerby showed the officer shooting Scott in the back. \n \n Although the killing sparked protests at City Hall, there was no violence as there has been in other cities where similar incidents have occurred, such as Ferguson, Mo., and Baltimore. City officials and family members credited the peaceful response of the public and the city’s swift action in arresting Slager with facilitating a settlement. \n \n “We are very proud that we were able to settle a case of this magnitude without a brick being thrown, without a fire being set and without a lawsuit being filed,” said Hair. \n \n North Charleston officials said they have been talking with Scott family lawyers for several months. \n \n “We agreed ... to try to resolve the case without a lawsuit,” Hair said. “We had lots of open, honest, cordial discussions with them. We didn’t agree on everything but it was a very unique way of handling the situation. We’ve never done it like this before. ... but we felt that if we could come to a resolution without a lawsuit being filed, without depositions and without press coverage of every step both sides made, that it would be healthier for both the family and the city.” \n \n Days after the Scott slaying, lawyers for the family said they planned to file suits against Slager, 33, for civil rights violation and wrongful death, but no suits were filed. During several meetings over the past few months, City Council has gone into closed session to receive advice from Hair on a potential lawsuit. \n \n Slager was indicted on a murder charge in June, and in September Circuit Judge Clifton Newman denied bail, calling the evidence against Slager “persuasive.” \n \n Anthony Scott, Walter Scott’s brother, said Thursday, “Though nothing can replace having Walter in our lives, the city of North Charleston’s historic actions ensure that he did not die in vain. This city sent a message loud and clear that this kind of reckless behavior exhibited by members of law enforcement will not and shall not be tolerated.” \n \n The settlement also protects current or former city employees from being sued in the case. \n \n “The Eric Garner case in New York and the Freddie Gray case in Baltimore really set the tone for the range of numbers that we thought was consistent with what was going on,” said Hair. “We think it is a really fair settlement and a good one. It’s a lot of money but we had to realistically face the fact that the potential for a very large verdict was there because of the video and because we have a police officer who is charged with murder.” \n \n Asked how the parties arrived at a figure, Chris Stewart, a lawyer for the Scott family, said, “You have to be realistic. There is no way that this city could pay $50 million ... You can go to your corner being unrealistic and just fight with the other side, and at the end of the day also harm the city and innocent people that had nothing to do with the situation.” \n \n Mayor Keith Summey said it was important for the city to acknowledge the harm done to Scott and his family. \n \n “(Nothing) negates the fact that (Slager) shot the guy in the back and we’re wrong,” said Summey. “From Day 1, we have said, ‘When you’re wrong, you’re wrong,’ and there was no doubt in our mind that it was going to cost us. Even though I think we handled it completely appropriately, it was still going to cost us.” \n \n The settlement will allow the family and the city to move on, Hair said. \n \n “We think that it is a good resolution and a fair one,” Hair said. “This would have been the thing that we dealt with the next several years and that’s not fair to our citizens, not fair to our Police Department and frankly, not fair to the family.” \n \n “It’s time to move on, bottom line,” said Police Chief Eddie Driggers. “It’s time to move on and do what people pay us to do — to serve and protect. We have 343 sworn officers trying to do what’s right by the citizens they serve.” \n \n Stewart said he could not address how the money will be divided among family members, “but his (four) children will be taken care of.” \n \n In addition, a portion of the settlement money will be donated to the Red Cross to aid flood victims, Anthony Scott said. \n \n Talks are ongoing with the state Insurance Reserve Fund, but as of now, about $1 million of the settlement will come from the Insurance Reserve Fund and the rest will come from the city’s fund balance, which currently is about $18 million. It will not affect the city’s bond rating, Summey said. \n \n “This entire situation has been almost a blueprint of how these situations should be handled,” Stewart said of the settlement. “They came to the table willing to talk, willing to work things out. They didn’t just give away $6.5 million. We had to fight, argue, battle, got at each other for a while, but peaceful resolution is always better.” \n \n Justin Bamberg, a state representative who is also a Scott-family lawyer, said, “From start to this point, to hopefully a criminal conviction of the officer, we have set a prototype, the standard, for how these types of situations can be handled and should be handled, in that when you keep faith, when you respect one another ... things can work out.” \n \n After the video was made public, Scott’s death became the focus of a nationwide discussion on police officers’ use of force against black men. The video showed Scott freeing himself from a struggle and running away as he was shot at eight times. \n \n “The criminal process still has to run its course,” Hair said. “Getting this part of the matter behind everyone will help so that the criminal justice system can focus on that.” \n \n Anthony Scott called the settlement a “bittersweet victory” and said the family will focus on the criminal trial. \n \n “It is our hope that after a jury of his peers reviews the evidence, they’ll send an equally important message to law enforcement that there is no place for unnecessary violence against unarmed, fleeing individuals.” \n \n Slager also is being sued by Julius Garnett Wilson, who has a history of drug arrests and a conviction for interfering with police, for allegedly shooting Wilson in the back with a Taser last year. The suit was filed in the wake of Scott’s shooting. \n \n In July, New York City reached a $5.9 million settlement with the family of Garner to resolve a wrongful-death claim over his killing by the police on Staten Island a year earlier. The officer, Daniel Pantaleo, was not indicted in the case. \n \n On July 17, 2014, two officers approached Garner, who was unarmed, and accused him of selling untaxed cigarettes. One of the officers used a chokehold to subdue Garner, and that hold, along with the compression of Garner’s chest by other officers who held him down, was cited when the medical examiner ruled the death a homicide. \n \n Last month, the city of Baltimore approved a $6.4 million settlement with the family of Freddie Gray, who suffered a fatal spinal injury when the 25-year-old was handcuffed and shackled, but not buckled in, inside a police van in April. \n \n Six officers charged in the case have pleaded not guilty and will stand trial on charges ranging from assault to murder. \n \n In a case of an officer-involved shooting that went to trial recently, a federal jury last year awarded $97.5 million to the family of former Cottageville Mayor Bert Reeves. Reeves was fatally shot by a town police officer and the sum was settled earlier this year by both sides at $10 million.']",3,"– New research into the amount of time that infants in various countries spend crying found that the littlest ones in usually placid Canada were the most colicky. British babies came in second, followed by Italy. The most tranquil tots, meanwhile, live in Denmark and Germany. Writing in the Journal of Pediatrics, psychologists at the University of Warwick analyzed 28 previous studies of some 8,700 infants to measure colic—a harmless, if nerve-jangling, condition—by gauging crying times during the first 12 weeks. The longest crying jags were clocked in Canada, reports the Guardian, where 34.1% of babies wailed more than three hours a day, at least three days a week. In the UK, the tally was 28% and in Italy 20.9%. Relatively blissful Danish babes scored 5.5%, with Germany at 6.7%. The first-of-its kind analysis found that babies the world over cry around two hours a day for the first weeks, peaking at two hours and 15 minutes at six weeks. Happily for stressed-out new parents everywhere, crying time is halved by week 12, per a press release. Lead researcher Dieter Wolke says parents in countries with low colic scores are less likely to intervene when baby starts crying, allowing the infant to self-soothe. ""They don’t get all worried about it,"" Wolke tells the Telegraph. Then again, he notes, Danish babies may enjoy a bit of ""genetic bias"" since their country consistently ranks at the top of wellness surveys. In any case, new parents should learn to chill. ""If you are not relaxed you are not going to be any use to your baby,"" Wolke says. (Crying saved this baby's life.)"
43,"['falls A lot of luck: How teen survived parachuting accident Jan. 28, 2014 at 7:32 PM ET \n \n Tweet email \n \n When Texas teen Mackenzie Wethington survived a parachuting accident Saturday, her father Joe called the 16-year-old “a miracle.” Doctors who treat traumatic injuries aren’t disagreeing. \n \n “Considering the bone and soft tissue damage that would occur from a fall from this height, the fact that she is alive and seemingly doing well really is quite miraculous, ’ said Dr. Michael Anderson, a pediatric critical care specialist at University Hospitals Case Medical Center in Cleveland. \n \n \n \n Wethington is one lucky teen. The trauma surgeon who first treated Mackenzie in the ER didn\'t expect her to survive. ""I\'m glad to be wrong about that,"" Dr. Jeffrey Bender of the University of Oklahoma Medical Center in Oklahoma City said Tuesday at a news conference. \n \n Currently, Wethington is awake and breathing on her own and is listed in fair condition. “We see worse injuries routinely from car and ATV accidents,” said trauma surgeon Dr. Jason Lees, who is part of the Oklahoma team treating Wethington. “There’s a reason we wear parachutes when we step out of a plane.” \n \n Amazingly, Wethington, who suffered a lacerated liver and kidney, broken teeth and multiple fractures throughout her body, is expected to fully recover within about six to eight weeks, Bender said Tuesday. Her injuries are ""consistent with someone hit by a car going 40-50 mph,"" although that doesn\'t mean she hit the ground at that speed, he said. \n \n According to the World Health Organization, falls are the second leading cause of accidental or unintentional injury deaths worldwide. Each year an estimated 424,000 individuals die from falls globally. And it doesn’t have to be a 3,500-foot mishap. \n \n \n \n “A person can take a fall from a standing height and the neck can break, so this young girl is exceptionally fortunate in how the circumstances and force of the fall dissipated throughout her body,” said Dr. Ryan Goodwin, director of the Center for Pediatric and Adolescent Orthopedics at the Cleveland Clinic. “She is young, and in seeming good health, so she has that going for her.” But, he adds, she also had a lot of luck and physics on her side, too. \n \n \n \n When an individual falls from a great height, survival often depends on a lot of luck, as well as air resistance, or drag. \n \n “You can think of a fall as a form of energy,” explained James Kakalios, the Taylor Distinguished Professor in the school of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Minnesota. “Basically, if a person steps out of a plane you have no velocity. Gravity will start to pull you down and you accelerate.” \n \n \n \n But as you gain speed, air resistance comes into play and acts as a kind of brake slowing you down and reducing the amount of kinetic energy, or in other words, the force in which your body slams into the ground, said Kakalios, author of the Physics of Superheroes. \n \n He thinks the teen may have done some things accidentally to increase air drag, slowing her fall, and leading to a potentially softer, yet still serious, landing. \n \n “She’s creating a lot of turbulence as she falling, and therefore she’s maximizing the time it takes for her to hit the ground,” he said, citing that reducing the rate in which an object, or person, comes to a stop is critical for safety. “That’s why we have airbags,” Kakalios said, citing other instances of people surviving long falls such as I- 35W bridge collapse in Minneapolis in which 13 people were killed, but 145 survived the 115-foot fall and the case of man who survived after he fell 500 feet from a New York skyscraper. \n \n “It’s noteworthy that people don’t usually survive these things, but some people do in the right set of circumstances,” he said. “Many people buy lottery tickets and don’t win, but there’s always someone who does win.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Tweet email', 'Gawker was convicted Thursday in the court of Twitter opinion.

""It had nothing to do with her being a woman."" \n \n Despite the sensational headline -- ""I Had a One-Night Stand With Christine O\'Donnell"" -- the two never actually had sex. However, the anonymous writer describes O\'Donnell\'s anatomy in detail, which led to some of the backlash. \n \n ""Hey Gawker, I hope a one-day SEO term victory is worth the sleaziest piece of s--- story in memory,"" wrote Slate\'s Dave Weigel.

Stern said Gawker paid in the ""low four figures"" for the O\'Donnell story, but also did its due diligence in checking the accuracy of the man\'s claims. \n \n Stern said that the man approached Gawker about 10 days ago. He had shopped it elsewhere but wanted it to be told correctly, and Gawker allowed him to do it first-person. \n \n ""From an editorial standpoint, it was compelling to hear it from his own words,"" Stern said, adding that ""it\'s a good story and that\'s why we did it."" \n \n Gawker Media chief Nick Denton, in a staff memo, described the O\'Donnell post as ""an example of brilliant packaging,"" with a good composite image on the front and compelling writing. \n \n ""And this points to a general rule on the Web,"" Denton said.

Mr. Thurber\'s aviator flew around the world nonstop in a rickety airplane he had built, then revealed himself to be a braggart, a fool and a generally despicable human being. The airline pilot played by Denzel Washington, Whip Whitaker, is far from despicable—he is, after all, played by Denzel Washington—but he\'s no Chesley Sullenberger, either. ""Flight,"" which was directed by Robert Zemeckis, soars when Whip is at the controls, struggling to save a seemingly doomed airplane. When he\'s back on the ground and struggling with himself, the film takes a surprising turn into a drama of addiction and moral exploration. One unwelcome surprise is how shopworn the story\'s components prove to be. Still, they\'re enhanced if not redeemed by Mr. Washington\'s stirring portrait of a skillful, prideful pilot hitting bottom. \n \n White-knuckle fliers may want to pass on ""Flight"" altogether, though they\'ll be missing an early sequence that\'s right up there with the best of the incipient-disaster genre: Think ""Airplane!"" without the laughs. What\'s unclear is whether Whip, who shouldn\'t even be sitting in the cockpit, will be up to the challenge. What\'s abundantly clear from the outset of the midair crisis is that a cascade of malfunctions will make his airplane uncontrollable. (However wildly over the top the sequence may seem to be, it\'s only a heightening of what actually happened off the California coast in 2000 when a loose jackscrew jammed the horizontal stabilizer of an Alaska Airlines MD-83, sending the airplane into a dive from which the pilots tried, unsuccessfully, to recover by flying upside down.) \n \n Crisis has been a major food group for many of the characters Mr. Washington has played; he\'s such a quick-witted star, with his flashing smile and mercurial spirit, that he ingests danger gleefully and thrives on it. Not this time, though. It\'s a shock to see the shape he\'s in—overweight, unkempt, a star stripped of his charisma for a role that keeps him in a garishly unflattering light. And Whip\'s experience and demonstrable skill may not be enough to save him, even though he\'s first hailed as a hero. Too many secrets threaten to bring him down in the investigation that follows his fateful flight. \n \n Watch a clip from the Robert Zemeckis film ""Flight."" An airline pilot (Denzel Washington) saves a flight from crashing, but an investigation into the malfunctions reveals something troubling. Also starring Nadine Velazquez. (Photo & Video: Paramount) \n \n When movie stars choose roles that make them unattractive, they\'re often praised for their courage, even though doing so can amount to adventurous career management. I\'d rather praise Mr. Washington for the eloquence, solemnity and disarming humor of his performance as a man whose body and soul are beset by the contending forces of probity and deceit, a good man whose addictions to drugs and booze have turned him into a shameless liar. \n \n That said, the script, by John Gatins, brings mixed blessings at best. Instead of hurtling to a climax, the story moves in fits and starts, loses momentum, injects itself with cockeyed comedy—John Goodman\'s Falstaffian drugmeister is the damnedest deus ex machina you\'ve ever seen—lumbers through 12-step thickets and finally resolves into an old-fashioned morality play. Mr. Zemeckis\'s direction is similarly a mixture of thrilling action, incisive characterization, overblown set pieces—the federal crash investigation is staged like a full-scale congressional hearing—and shameless, though effective, melodrama. The cast includes Don Cheadle and Bruce Greenwood, both of whom give the movie\'s star valuable support, and Kelly Reilly, who, as another addict in Whip\'s life, turns tepid writing into passionate humanity. \n \n Watch a clip from the Disney animated film ""Wreck-It Ralph."" A video game villain (John C. Reilly) wants to be a hero, but his quest brings havoc to the whole arcade where he lives. Also with Jane Lynch & Sarah Silverman. (Photo & Video: Disney) \n \n \'Wreck-It Ralph\' \n \n Can it be that three decades have passed since video arcade games such as Pac-Man and Donkey Kong first unleashed their jumpy, choppy, charmingly blocky characters on a pop-eyed public? Disney\'s latest animated feature evokes nostalgia for that bygone era of barebones 8-bit technology and simple gameplay rules with a genially simple scheme. Just as Pixar\'s ""Toy Story"" trilogy revealed the secret life of toys, ""Wreck-It Ralph"" follows characters from a game called ""Fix-It Felix, Jr.,"" a takeoff on Donkey Kong. On duty, they\'re exuberant primitives. Off duty, they\'re fully drawn creatures in a 3-D world. Ralph, voiced by John C. Reilly, is the game\'s bad guy, a sensitive hulk who wants desperately to win a medal as a good guy. To that end, he flees his console\'s confines, travels around the arcade electronically and patches himself, with chaotic consequences, into a succession of modern high-definition games. It\'s a lovely pretext for dazzling visuals, yet the production is diminished by the clumsiness of an 8-bit script. \n \n That\'s a major or a minor matter, depending on how addicted you may have been to those early games, many of whose characters make cameo appearances; whether the film will connect with today\'s young kids is a major matter soon to be resolved. The story begins promisingly, with Ralph in an envious funk. He has always been compelled to wreck things—the rules of his game are inviolable—while Felix (Jack McBrayer) has always gotten praise for fixing things with his magic hammer. A 12-step group for bad guys doesn\'t do much for Ralph\'s bruised psyche, so the first stop on his pilgrimage is, logically enough, a game called ""Hero\'s Duty."" There he impersonates a robot and meets Vanellope von Schweetz (Sarah Silverman), a shrill and glitchy character—she suffers from visual static—who has been evicted from her own game of ""Sugar Rush."" \n \n Enlarge Image Close Disney Wreck-It Ralph and Vanellope von Schweetz \n \n The film was directed by Rich Moore, in his feature debut, and written by Jennifer Lee and Phil Johnston. Its narrative core concerns the fraught friendship of Ralph and Vanellope, which in turn poses the question of whether a bad guy can really transform himself into a good guy. (Spoiler alert: Yes, he can.) But character gets trampled as the action goes turbo, Vanellope\'s voice grows ever more shrill and we find ourselves trapped, along with Ralph, in a Sugar Rush surround of oppressively pretty colors and numbingly repetitive races and chases. A further question posed by ""Wreck-It Ralph"" is whether brilliant animation alone can sustain a film that comes up short in dramatic development. (Spoiler alert: No, it can\'t.) \n \n Watch a clip from the film ""This Must Be the Place.""

At several points Cheyenne says ""Something\'s not quite right here: I don\'t know exactly what it is, but something…."" Before I get to what that something might be, let me touch on several relatively right things about this remarkably lifeless film, which Paolo Sorrentino directed from a script he wrote with Umberto Contarello. \n \n Mr. Penn\'s performance, depressed by the nature of his sad-clown character, is self-regarding in ways that are simultaneously dismaying and fascinating. The music, by David Byrne and Will Oldham, is exceptionally varied and characteristically rich. The cinematographer, Luca Bigazzi, finds one striking vista after another when Cheyenne leaves Dublin and criss-crosses the U.S. \n \n Enlarge Image Close The Weinstein Company Sean Penn and Frances McDormand \n \n What\'s wrong here, ludicrously and groanworthily wrong, is the reason for Cheyenne\'s criss-crossings. He is, it develops, on a hunt for the Nazi war criminal who did some unspecified something to his late father during the Holocaust. As juxtapositions go, regressed Goth rock star and Holocaust could hardly be more bizarre, and bizarre can be good when it\'s done deftly. In this case, however, it\'s done ponderously and sententiously. The movie\'s title is taken from the classic Talking Heads song, which is subtitled ""Naive Melody.""

Mackenzie Wethington, who went skydiving Saturday as a birthday present from her parents, slammed into the ground, yet somehow only suffered a lacerated liver and kidney, broken bones, and a broken tooth; she's already communicating with her parents in writing and doctors say she's in good condition and should suffer few long-term effects. ""I have no idea how she survived,"" one tells Today. Experts are calling it a miracle; one suspects the teen somehow decreased her air speed and thus landed somewhat more softly—in other words, she was incredibly lucky. The teen was supposed to do a tandem jump with an experienced skydiver, but was told when she arrived that Pegasus Air Sports Center wasn't doing tandem jumps, so her first jump after six hours of training was on her own—and went horribly awry. It's not clear exactly what happened: According to MyFox DFW, the family says Mackenzie's primary parachute didn't open properly (it was supposed to open automatically) and may have gotten tangled, and Mackenzie couldn't open the emergency chute. Mackenzie's dad (who says the main chute only half-opened, according to CNN) blames Pegasus Air Sports Center, claiming it offered inadequate training and didn't properly maintain its equipment. The owner of Pegasus, however, blames Mackenzie and denies any problem with her equipment: ""She didn't do what she was supposed to do,"" he says, though it's not clear what she did wrong; the owner says she didn't take a ""corrective counter action"" to make her parachute ""stop turning."" He claims the chute did open fully but somehow, ""maybe ... initiated by her,"" started a rotation that caused the problem. The family has hired a lawyer, Fox News Insider reports."
44,"['The actor\'s children say they have no choice but to protect their father\'s legacy from the ""avarice and overreaching"" of his third wife. \n \n America\'s dearly departed favorite dad Alan Thicke is at the center of what is shaping up to be a dramatic family fight, as his two oldest sons are taking his wife to court over his estate. \n \n Brennan and Robin Thicke are co-trustees of Thicke\'s living trust. They say they\'ve been left with no choice but to file a petition in order to ""honor the memory of their father, protect his legacy, and prevent his testamentary intentions from being undermined by avarice and overreaching of his third wife, Tanya Callau."" \n \n Thicke died suddenly in December at age 69, after his aorta ruptured while playing hockey with his son Carter. \n \n The older sons claim their father acquired the vast majority of his wealth long before meeting Callau, who signed a prenuptial agreement ahead of their 2005 marriage. \n \n In the trust, Thicke left each of his three children equal shares of a Carpinteria ranch, 75 percent of his personal effects and 60 percent of his remaining estate, according to the petition. He left Callau the ranch\'s furnishings, 25 percent of his personal effects, a $500,000 life insurance policy, all of his death benefits from pensions and union memberships and 40 percent of his remaining estate. He also provided that she could live at the ranch, as long as she paid for its expenses and maintained the property. \n \n Now, Thicke\'s sons claim Callau is insisting that the prenup she signed is invalid. \n \n According to the petition filed Tuesday in Los Angeles County Superior Court, Thicke updated his trust from time to time, and the most recent iteration was signed in February 2016. It designated his brother Todd as the trustee, and left the estate in the hands of his children if Todd declined the role — which he did. Brennan and Robin say Callau made no complaints about the prenuptial agreement or the estate plan at that time. \n \n ""Now that Alan is dead, Tanya claims there are numerous problems with the Trust and the Prenuptial Agreement,"" writes attorney Alex Weingarten in the petition. ""Tanya asserts that there is no chance the \'Prenup\' could withstand legal challenge and that she has very significant community rights in the Trust’s assets and rights of reimbursement with respect to improvements to the Ranch. Tanya also claims \'Marvin rights\' asserting that she had to forgo opportunities to pursue and advance her own career in order to support Alan and be his companion and partner, including raising Carter."" \n \n Weingarten also claims Thicke\'s wife has ""threatened to make her claims fodder for \'tabloid publicity\' unless the Co-Trustees agreed to participate in a mediation and succumb to her demands."" \n \n The Thickes are asking the court for instructions concerning the extent to which the Trust\'s property is the actor\'s separate property and whether Callau\'s challenge to the prenup is barred because she waived her community property rights when signing it. \n \n ""My clients made every effort to resolve this without the need for going to court,"" Weingarten tells The Hollywood Reporter. ""The only thing they care about is protecting the legacy of their father and honoring his intentions. That is exactly what we are going to do."" \n \n The widow\'s attorney Adam Streisand sent THR a statement Tuesday evening. ""Tanya Thicke has never threatened to take private family matters public and she never has,"" he says. ""It is clear that Alan’s sons have chosen this distasteful public smear tactic to bully Tanya, by stirring up the tabloid media, filing a bogus lawsuit, and refusing family mediation. Tanya is still grieving the death of her beloved husband and out of respect for Alan’s memory intends to handle his son’s false statements privately."" \n \n May 16, 6:00 p.m. Updated with a statement from Tanya Callau Thicke\'s attorney.', 'Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., walks from the chamber to his office as the GOP overhaul of the tax bill nears a vote, on Capitol Hill in Washington, Friday, Dec. 1, 2017. (AP Photo/J.... (Associated Press) \n \n WASHINGTON (AP) — Republicans pushed a nearly $1.5 trillion tax bill through the Senate early Saturday after a burst of eleventh-hour horse trading, as a party starved all year for a major legislative triumph took a giant step toward giving President Donald Trump one of his top priorities by Christmas. \n \n ""Big bills are rarely popular. You remember how unpopular \'Obamacare\' was when it passed?"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said in an interview, shrugging off polls showing scant public enthusiasm for the measure. He said the legislation would prove to be ""just what the country needs to get growing again."" \n \n Trump hailed the bill\'s passage on Twitter, thanking McConnell and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. ""Look forward to signing a final bill before Christmas!"" the president wrote. \n \n Presiding over the Senate, Vice President Mike Pence announced the 51-49 vote to applause from Republicans. Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., was the only lawmaker to cross party lines, joining the Democrats in opposition. The measure focuses its tax reductions on businesses and higher-earning individuals, gives more modest breaks to others and offers the boldest rewrite of the nation\'s tax system since 1986. \n \n Republicans touted the package as one that would benefit people of all incomes and ignite the economy. Even an official projection of a $1 trillion, 10-year flood of deeper budget deficits couldn\'t dissuade GOP senators from rallying behind the bill. \n \n ""Obviously I\'m kind of a dinosaur on the fiscal issues,"" said Corker, who battled to keep the bill from worsening the government\'s accumulated $20 trillion in IOUs. \n \n The Republican-led House approved a similar bill last month in what has been a stunningly swift trip through Congress for complex legislation that impacts the breadth of American society. The two chambers will now try crafting a final compromise to send Trump. \n \n After spending the year\'s first nine months futilely trying to repeal President Barack Obama\'s health care law, GOP leaders were determined to move the measure rapidly before opposition Democrats and lobbying groups could blow it up. The party views passage as crucial to retaining its House and Senate majorities in next year\'s elections. \n \n Democrats derided the bill as a GOP gift to its wealthy and business backers at the expense of lower-earning people. They contrasted the bill\'s permanent reduction in corporate income tax rates from 35 percent to 20 percent to smaller individual tax breaks that would end in 2026. \n \n Congress\' nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation has said the bill\'s reductions for many families would be modest and said by 2027, families earning under $75,000 would on average face higher, not lower, taxes. \n \n The bill is ""removed from the reality of what the American people need,"" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. He criticized Republicans for releasing a revised, 479-page bill that no one can absorb shortly before the final vote, saying, ""The Senate is descending to a new low of chicanery."" \n \n ""You really don\'t read this kind of legislation,"" Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., told home-state reporters, asked why the Senate was approving a bill some senators hadn\'t read. He said lawmakers needed to study it and get feedback from affected groups. \n \n Democrats took to the Senate floor and social media to mock one page that included changes scrawled in barely legible handwriting. Later, they won enough GOP support to kill a provision by Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., that would have bestowed a tax break on conservative Hillsdale College in Michigan. \n \n The bill hit rough waters after the Joint Taxation panel concluded it would worsen federal shortfalls by $1 trillion over a decade, even when factoring in economic growth that lower taxes would stimulate. Trump administration officials and many Republicans have insisted the bill would pay for itself by stimulating the economy. But the sour projections stiffened resistance from some deficit-averse Republicans. \n \n But after bargaining that stretched into Friday, GOP leaders nailed down the support they needed in a chamber they control 52-48. Facing unyielding Democratic opposition, Republicans could lose no more than two GOP senators and prevail with a tie-breaking vote from Vice President Mike Pence, but ended up not needing it. \n \n Leaders\' changes included helping millions of companies whose owners pay individual, not corporate, taxes on their profits by allowing deductions of 23 percent, up from 17.4 percent. That helped win over Wisconsin\'s Johnson and Steve Daines of Montana. \n \n People would be allowed to deduct up to $10,000 in property taxes, a demand of Sen. Susan Collins of Maine. That matched a House provision that chamber\'s leaders included to keep some GOP votes from high-tax states like New York, New Jersey and California. \n \n The changes added nearly $300 billion to the tax bill\'s costs. To pay for that, leaders reduced the number of high-earners who must pay the alternative minimum tax, rather than completely erasing it. They also increased a one-time tax on profits U.S.-based corporations are holding overseas and would require firms to keep paying the business version of the alternative minimum tax. \n \n Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz. — who like Corker had been a holdout and has sharply attacked Trump\'s capabilities as president — voted for the bill. He said he\'d received commitments from party leaders and the administration ""to work with me"" to restore protections, dismantled by Trump, for young immigrants who arrived in the U.S. illegally as children. That seemed short of a pledge to actually revive the safeguards. \n \n The Senate bill would drop the highest personal income tax rate from 39.6 percent to 38.5 percent. The estate tax levied on a few thousand of the nation\'s largest inheritances would be narrowed to affect even fewer. \n \n Deductions for state and local income taxes, moving expenses and other items would vanish, the standard deduction — used by most Americans — would nearly double to $12,000 for individuals and $24,000 for couples, and the per-child tax credit would grow. \n \n The bill would abolish the ""Obamacare"" requirement that most people buy health coverage or face tax penalties. Industry experts say that would weaken the law by easing pressure on healthier people to buy coverage, and the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said the move would push premiums higher and leave 13 million additional people uninsured. \n \n Drilling would be allowed in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Another provision, knocked out because it violated Senate budget rules, would have explicitly let parents buy tax-advantaged 529 college savings accounts for fetuses, a step they can already take but which anti-abortion forces wanted to inscribe into law. There were also breaks for the wine, beer and spirits industries, Alaska Natives and aircraft management firms. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writers Andrew Taylor in Washington and Scott Bauer Milwaukee contributed to this report.', ""Kate Middleton 's account was accessed in 2005, when she was the girlfriend of Prince William , by Jonathan Rees, a private investigator who once worked for the News of the World, it was alleged. \n \n Other high-profile individuals said to have been targets for Mr Rees, who was cleared of murder earlier this year, include Tony Blair, Jack Straw, the Duke and Duchess of Kent and John Yates, the Metropolitan Police assistant commissioner who once headed the phone hacking inquiry. \n \n The allegations were made after Mr Rees was named by Tom Watson MP. He told the House of Commons yesterday that Scotland Yard had evidence against the investigator but have said it falls outside the scope of their investigation. \n \n Detectives at Scotland Yard are understood to have been in touch with the Duchess of Cambridge to warn her that her bank details may have been accessed. \n \n On Wednesday night the Met confirmed it had received “a number of allegations” and the force was considering investigating. \n \n It is understood that the reason the allegations fall outside the scope of the investigation, codenamed Operation Weeting, is because they do not relate to phone hacking, but other forms of illegal intrusion. \n \n A St James’s Palace spokesman said they were unable to comment. \n \n In March this year, Mr Rees was cleared of the murder of Daniel Morgan, who was found with an axe in his head in a pub car park on March 10, 1987. \n \n After his acquittal, it was disclosed that Mr Rees, who was a private investigator for Southern Investigations — the company established by Mr Morgan, had worked for a number of media outlets. \n \n In 1999, Mr Rees was sentenced to seven years in prison for conspiring to plant cocaine on a woman. \n \n After his release in May 2004, the News of the World hired him under the editorship of Andy Coulson, who went on to become David Cameron’s media adviser. \n \n It is in the following year that Mr Rees is alleged to have accessed the Duchess of Cambridge’s bank account details. \n \n Last night, Mr Rees’s solicitor did not respond to enquiries from The Daily Telegraph. \n \n A Met spokesman added: “Since January 2011 the Metropolitan Police has received a number of allegations regarding breach of privacy which fall outside the remit of Operation Weeting. \n \n “These allegations are currently being considered.” \n \n A spokesman for News International, the News of the World’s parent company, said: “It is well documented that Jonathan Rees and Southern Investigations worked for a whole variety of newspaper groups. \n \n “With regards to Tom Watson’s specific allegations, we believe these are wholly inaccurate. The Met Police, with whom we are co-operating fully in Operation Weeting, have not asked us for any information regarding Jonathan Rees. \n \n “Tom Watson MP made these allegations under parliamentary privilege.”""]",3,"– Alan Thicke's kids are fighting with his third wife over the late actor's estate. Robin Thicke and brother Brennan, the oldest of Thicke's three sons, say that Tanya Callau—who wed Thicke in 2005—is threatening them with bad publicity unless they give her more of Thicke's estate. Thicke left much of his estate to his three children, but Callau still inherited a significant amount (the Hollywood Reporter has the exact breakdown) and was allowed to continue living on his Carpinteria, Calif., ranch. Thicke's sons say their father acquired most of his wealth before meeting Callau, and that she signed a prenup prior to marrying Thicke. They also say she had no issues with the prenup or the estate plan the last time Thicke updated his trust, in February 2016. (He died in December.) But now, Thicke's sons claim, Callau is claiming the prenup is invalid and there are problems with the trust. Per a petition the brothers filed in a Los Angeles court this week, the brothers say Callau also claims she has community rights to more of Thicke's assets, she should be reimbursed for any improvements she makes to the ranch while living there, and that she took a step back from her own career to support Thicke and help raise his youngest son. The brothers' attorney says in the filing that Callau has ""threatened to make her claims fodder for 'tabloid publicity' unless the Co-Trustees agreed to participate in a mediation and succumb to her demands,"" leading the brothers to ask a court to enforce the prenup and Thicke's will, TMZ reports. Callau's rep says in a statement, ""Tanya Thicke has never threatened to take private family matters public."""
45,"['A 1,112-y tree-ring record of moisture shows that in opposition to conventional wisdom, the climate during the rise of the 13 th -century Mongol Empire was a period of persistent moisture, unprecedented in the last 1,000 y. This 15-y episode of persistent moisture likely led to a period of high grassland productivity, contributing fuel to the Mongol Empire. We also present evidence that anthropogenic warming exacerbated the 21st-century drought in central Mongolia. These results indicate that ecosystems and societies in semiarid regions can be significantly affected by unusual climatic events at the decadal time scale. \n \n Abstract \n \n Although many studies have associated the demise of complex societies with deteriorating climate, few have investigated the connection between an ameliorating environment, surplus resources, energy, and the rise of empires. The 13th-century Mongol Empire was the largest contiguous land empire in world history. Although drought has been proposed as one factor that spurred these conquests, no high-resolution moisture data are available during the rapid development of the Mongol Empire. Here we present a 1,112-y tree-ring reconstruction of warm-season water balance derived from Siberian pine (Pinus sibirica) trees in central Mongolia. Our reconstruction accounts for 56% of the variability in the regional water balance and is significantly correlated with steppe productivity across central Mongolia. In combination with a gridded temperature reconstruction, our results indicate that the regional climate during the conquests of Chinggis Khan’s (Genghis Khan’s) 13th-century Mongol Empire was warm and persistently wet. This period, characterized by 15 consecutive years of above-average moisture in central Mongolia and coinciding with the rise of Chinggis Khan, is unprecedented over the last 1,112 y. We propose that these climate conditions promoted high grassland productivity and favored the formation of Mongol political and military power. Tree-ring and meteorological data also suggest that the early 21st-century drought in central Mongolia was the hottest drought in the last 1,112 y, consistent with projections of warming over Inner Asia. Future warming may overwhelm increases in precipitation leading to similar heat droughts, with potentially severe consequences for modern Mongolia.', 'The Backstreet Boys dropped their first new music since 2013 early Thursday morning with a single called “Don’t Go Breaking My Heart.” The band, which celebrated 25 years together last month, will release an as-yet-untitled album later in the year featuring the new song.

This would probably remain of note only in tree-ring-studying circles if not for one other thing: Those dates happen to coincide with the rise of none other than Genghis Khan, reports the BBC. And the researchers say it's no coincidence. They argue in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that the change in weather from severe drought conditions prior to 1211 to fertile ones afterward directly helped Khan build his empire. Think rain—specifically the lush grasslands it created to fuel to Khan's horse-driven army, along with the livestock his soldiers needed to survive. ""It wasn't the only thing, but it must have created the ideal conditions for a charismatic leader to emerge out of the chaos, develop an army, and concentrate power,"" West Virginia University researcher Amy Hessl tells National Geographic. ""Where it's arid, unusual moisture creates unusual plant productivity, and that translates into horsepower—literally. Genghis was able to ride that wave."" By the time he died in 1227, Khan's empire spanned modern-day Korea, China, Russia, eastern Europe, India, and southeast Asia.

46,"['george washington Washington the ‘Blackest’ Name in America \n \n On the eve of George Washington\'s birthday, Associated Press writer Jesse Washington investigates why the founding father\'s surname now belongs predominantly to African-Americans. The 2000 U.S. Census counted 163,036 people with the last name Washington, 90 percent of whom were black — a far higher percentage than any other name. Writes Washington: \n \n \n \n The story of how Washington became the ""blackest name"" begins with slavery and takes a sharp turn after the Civil War, when all blacks were allowed the dignity of a surname. \n \n By choosing the name, he says, Reconstruction-era blacks might have been showing pride in the nation\'s history, as George Washington, who died in 1799, was still hugely popular at the time. Alternately, the name could have been a way to maintain ties to plantation owners who continued to be powerful regional figures after the Civil War. Then again, ""It\'s a myth,"" writes Washington, ""that most enslaved blacks bore the last name of their owner."" \n \n For instance, ""only a handful"" of George Washington\'s slaves had his name. According to Mary Thompson, a historian at Washington\'s Mount Vernon plantation, the president recorded most as having only a first name — and despite the abolitionist writings he left behind, he owned hundreds of slaves. ""Washington was leading this schizoid life,"" says biographer Ron Chernow. ""In theory and on paper he was opposed to slavery, but he was still zealously tracking and seeking to recover his slaves who escaped."" (Martha Washington\'s maid, Oney Judge, ran away while the family was living in Philadelphia. Washington abused his presidential powers by asking the Treasury Department to kidnap Judge from her new life in New Hampshire, says Chernow, but the plot failed.) \n \n In the end, any assumption that the name is tied to George may be a faulty one. ""There is no direct evidence,"" says Tony Burroughs, an expert on black genealogy. ""As far as I\'m concerned it\'s a coincidence."" \n \n But the coincidence is a marked one. According to Jesse Washington, the name is so heavily African-American that many present-day Washingtons are ""surprised to learn"" that white Washingtons exist, having never met one. In 2000, only 5 percent (8,813) of Washingtons in the U.S. were white. (The surname study was not repeated in the 2010 Census.) By comparison, Williams was the sixteenth ""blackest"" name, at 46 percent black, even though the name is much more popular, and there were 716,704 black Williamses overall. \n \n Washington: The \'Blackest Name\' In America [AP via HuffPo]', 'George Washington\'s name is inseparable from America, and not only from the nation\'s history.

George Washington\'s name is inseparable from America, and not only from the nation\'s... (Associated Press) \n \n In a puzzling twist, most of these people are black. The 2000 U.S. Census counted 163,036 people with the surname Washington. Ninety percent of them were African-American, a far higher black percentage than for any other common name. \n \n The story of how Washington became the ""blackest name"" begins with slavery and takes a sharp turn after the Civil War, when all blacks were allowed the dignity of a surname. \n \n Even before Emancipation, many enslaved black people chose their own surnames to establish their identities. Afterward, some historians theorize, large numbers of blacks chose the name Washington in the process of asserting their freedom. \n \n Today there are black Washingtons, like this writer, who are often identified as African-American by people they have never met. There are white Washingtons who are sometimes misidentified and have felt discrimination. There are Washingtons of both races who view the name as a special _ if complicated _ gift. \n \n And there remains the presence of George, born 279 years ago on Feb. 22, whose complex relationship with slavery echoes in the blackness of his name today. \n \n ___ \n \n George Washington\'s great-grandfather, John, arrived in Virginia from England in 1656. John married the daughter of a wealthy man and eventually owned more than 5,000 acres, according to the new biography ""Washington: A Life,"" by Ron Chernow. \n \n Along with land, George inherited 10 human beings from his father. He gained more through his marriage to a wealthy widow, and purchased still more enslaved blacks to work the lands he aggressively amassed. But over the decades, as he recognized slavery\'s contradiction with the freedoms of the new nation, Washington grew opposed to human bondage. \n \n Yet ""slaves were the basis of his fortune,"" and he would not part with them, Chernow said in an interview. \n \n Washington was not a harsh slaveowner by the standards of the time. He provided good food and medical care. He recognized marriages and refused to sell off individual family members. Later in life he resolved not to purchase any more black people. \n \n But he also worked his slaves quite hard, and under difficult conditions. As president, he shuttled them between his Philadelphia residence and Virginia estate to evade a law that freed any slave residing in Pennsylvania for six months. \n \n While in Philadelphia, Oney Judge, Martha Washington\'s maid, moved about the city and met many free blacks. Upon learning Martha was planning one day to give her to an ill-tempered granddaughter, Judge disappeared. \n \n According to Chernow\'s book, Washington abused his presidential powers and asked the Treasury Department to kidnap Judge from her new life in New Hampshire. The plot was unsuccessful. \n \n ""Washington was leading this schizoid life,"" Chernow said in the interview. ""In theory and on paper he was opposed to slavery, but he was still zealously tracking and seeking to recover his slaves who escaped."" \n \n In his final years on his Mount Vernon plantation, Washington said that ""nothing but the rooting out of slavery can perpetuate the existence of our union."" \n \n This led to extraordinary instructions in his will that all 124 of his slaves should be freed after the death of his wife. The only exception was the slave who was at his side for the entire Revolutionary War, who was freed immediately. Washington also ordered that the younger black people be educated or taught a trade, and he provided a fund to care for the sick or aged. \n \n ""This is a man who travels an immense distance,"" Chernow said. \n \n In contrast with other Founding Fathers, Chernow said, Washington\'s will indicates ""that he did have a vision of a future biracial society."" \n \n Twelve American presidents were slaveowners. Of the eight presidents who owned slaves while in office, Washington is the only one who set all of them free. \n \n ___ \n \n It\'s a myth that most enslaved blacks bore the last name of their owner. Only a handful of George Washington\'s hundreds of slaves did, for example, and he recorded most as having just a first name, says Mary Thompson, the historian at Mount Vernon. \n \n Still, historian Henry Wiencek says many enslaved blacks had surnames that went unrecorded or were kept secret. Some chose names as a mark of community identity, he says, and that community could be the plantation of a current or recent owner. \n \n ""Keep in mind that after the Civil War, many of the big planters continued to be extremely powerful figures in their regions, so there was an advantage for a freed person to keep a link to a leading white family,"" says Wiencek, author of ""An Imperfect God: George Washington, His Slaves, and the Creation of America."" \n \n Sometimes blacks used the surname of the owner of their oldest known ancestor as a way to maintain their identity. Melvin Patrick Ely, a College of William and Mary professor who studies the history of blacks in the South, says some West African cultures placed high value on ancestral villages, and the American equivalent was the plantation where one\'s ancestors had toiled. \n \n Last names also could have been plucked out of thin air. Booker T. Washington, one of the most famous blacks of the post-slavery period, apparently had two of those. \n \n He was a boy when Emancipation freed him from a Virginia plantation. After enrolling in school, he noticed other children had last names, while the only thing he had ever been called was Booker. \n \n ""So, when the teacher asked me what my full name was, I calmly told him, \'Booker Washington,\'"" he wrote in his autobiography, ""Up from Slavery."" Later in life, he found out that his mother had named him ""Booker Taliaferro"" at birth, so he added a middle name. \n \n He gives no indication why the name Washington popped into his head. But George Washington, dead for only 60-odd years, had immense fame and respect at the time. His will had been widely published in pamphlet form, and it was well known that he had freed his slaves, Thompson says. \n \n Did enslaved people feel inspired by Washington and take his name in tribute, or were they seeking some benefits from the association? Did newly freed people take the name as a mark of devotion to their country? \n \n ""We just don\'t know,"" Weincek says. \n \n But the connection is too strong for some to ignore. \n \n ""There was a lot more consciousness and pride in American history among African-Americans and enslaved African-Americans than a lot of people give them credit for. They had a very strong sense of politics and history,"" says Adam Goodheart, a professor at Washington College and author of the forthcoming ""1861: Civil War Awakening."" \n \n ""They were thinking about how they could be Americans,"" Goodheart says. ""That they would embrace the name of this person who was an imperfect hero shows there was a certain understanding of this country as an imperfect place, an imperfect experiment, and a willingness to embrace that tradition of liberty with all its contradictions."" \n \n Many black people took new names after the Revolutionary War, the Civil War, and the black power movement, says Ira Berlin, a University of Maryland history professor who has written books on the history of African-Americans. \n \n ""Names are this central way we think about ourselves,"" Berlin says. ""Whenever we have these kinds of emancipatory moments, suddenly people can reinvent themselves, rethink themselves new, distinguish themselves from a past where they were denigrated and abused. New names are one of the ways they do it."" \n \n But for black people who chose the name Washington, it\'s rarely certain precisely why. \n \n ""It\'s an assumption that the surname is tied to George,"" says Tony Burroughs, an expert on black genealogy, who says 82 to 94 percent of all Washingtons listed in the 1880 to 1930 censuses were black. \n \n ""There is no direct evidence,"" he says. ""As far as I\'m concerned it\'s a coincidence."" \n \n ___ \n \n Coincidence or not, today the numbers are equally stark. Washington was listed 138th when the Census Bureau published a list of the 1,000 most common American surnames from the 2000 survey, along with ethnic data. The project was not repeated in 2010. \n \n Ninety percent of those Washingtons, numbering 146,520, were black. Only five percent, or 8,813, were white. Three percent were two or more races, 1 percent were Hispanic, and 1 percent were Asian or Pacific Islander. \n \n Jefferson was the second-blackest name, at 75 percent African-American. There were only 16,070 Lincolns, and that number was only 14 percent black. \n \n Jackson was 53 percent black. Williams was the 16th-blackest name, at 46 percent. But there were 1,534,042 total Williamses, including 716,704 black ones _ so there were more blacks named Williams than anything else. \n \n (The name Black was 68 percent white, meaning there were far more white Blacks than black Blacks. The name White, meanwhile, was 19 percent black.) \n \n Many present-day Washingtons are surprised to learn their name is not 100 percent black. \n \n ""Growing up, I just knew that only black people had my last name,"" says Shannon Washington of New York City. Like many others, she has never met a white Washington. \n \n She has no negative feelings about her name: ""It\'s a reflection of how far we\'ve come more than anything. I most likely come from a family of slaves who were given or chose this name."" \n \n As the creator of advertisements, events and http://www.parlourmagazine.com, she works with many Europeans, who often ask how she got her name. She plans on keeping it when she gets married, and likens her attachment to that of some black people for racist memorabilia like mammy dolls and Jim Crow signs. \n \n ""I don\'t exactly love it,"" she says of her name, ""But I have to respect it."" \n \n Marcus Washington never thought much about his name as one of the few black people working in the overwhelmingly white William Morris talent agency. That changed after he filed a $25 million lawsuit in December accusing William Morris of racial discrimination. \n \n ""I\'m sure that for some people there, my name triggered the thought that I was African-American, and automatically triggered biases that resulted in me not being given a fair shot,"" he says. \n \n One 2004 study conducted by researchers at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business found that job applicants with names that sound white receive 50 percent more callbacks than applicants with ""black"" names. \n \n The study responded to real employment ads with more than 5,000 fictitious resumes. Half the resumes were assigned names like Emily Walsh; the other half got names like Lakisha Washington. After calculating for the difference in resume quality, the study concluded that ""a white name yields as many more callbacks as an additional eight years of experience on a resume."" \n \n But what about those 8,813 white Washingtons? What is their experience? \n \n For the family of 85-year-old Larry Washington, who traces his family tree back to England in the 1700s, the experience has changed over the years. (He says he is not related to George, who had no children.) \n \n When he moved to New Jersey in 1962 to teach at a college there, Larry Washington\'s family tried to scout housing over the phone, but nothing was ever available. ""When we showed up, there were plenty of houses,"" he recalls. After that, he taught his six children to always apply in person. \n \n Over the years, his name made him sensitive to racism: ""We just simply recognized these things, and had full sympathy with the people who were really black and getting the real treatment."" \n \n His son Paul, who in the 1970s worked for a temporary agency in Long Island, NY, says people in the offices where he was assigned always betrayed their relief when he turned out to be white. He experienced housing discrimination into the \'80s, but says that no longer happens. \n \n He is now a geology professor who has lived in ten states from Louisiana to Pennsylvania. Sometimes he wonders if his name helps him get interviews at colleges looking to recruit a rare black geologist, and if it hurts him when the college discovers that he is white. \n \n Paul\'s children have had much different experiences _ like his 25-year-old daughter, an English professor who teaches foreign students, whose new pupils are always amazed to meet someone with ""the ultimate American name."" \n \n When Paul\'s brother Larry Jr. was recently traveling through customs in Japan, the inspector looked at his passport and said, ""Oh, Mr. Washington!"" \n \n ""His politeness and the number of times he bowed clearly indicated that he thought I was the member of a very important family,"" Larry Jr. recalls. \n \n His sister Ida, a veterinarian who lives in Seattle, says she has never experienced discrimination due to her name as an adult. She is married, but uses Washington as her professional name. \n \n ""It\'s very distinctive. I use it with a certain amount of pride,"" she says. \n \n Back in high school, she became fascinated with black history. ""I think my name has made me much more aware of what African-American folks struggle with. I feel in tune with them."" \n \n Perhaps her sentiments bring the name full circle _ from blacks making a connection to the greatest white Washington to a white person choosing a name associated with blackness. \n \n ""I find it touching that freed blacks wanted to identify with the American tradition and the American dream,"" says Chernow, the biographer. ""It makes a powerful statement."" \n \n ""I have to think,"" he says, ""that George Washington would be very pleased that so many black people have adopted his name."" \n \n ___ \n \n Jesse Washington covers race and ethnicity for The Associated Press. He is reachable at jwashington(at)ap.org or http://www.twitter.com/jessewashington. \n \n ___ \n \n On the Web: \n \n Census surname study: http://www.census.gov/genealogy/www/data/2000surnames/index.html', 'The longtime chief executive of Wells Fargo agreed on Tuesday to forfeit $41 million in performance pay three weeks after the bank acknowledged that for at least five years, thousands of low-level employees set up sham accounts to meet sales quotas. \n \n The San Francisco-based bank has repeatedly apologized for the scheme and said it had fired 5,300 employees for misconduct and put in place more stringent internal controls. But that has not been enough for lawmakers, who have been pushing for the company’s top leaders to give back the millions of dollars in bonuses they earned while the irregularities were occurring. \n \n The independent directors of the Wells Fargo board announced Tuesday that they were launching an investigation into the bank’s retail business. \n \n “We are deeply concerned by these matters, and we are committed to ensuring that all aspects of the Company’s business are conducted with integrity, transparency, and oversight,” Stephen Sanger, the lead independent director, said in a statement. Sanger, who has been a member of Wells Fargo’s board since 2003, is the former chairman of General Mills, the packaged-food company. \n \n John Stumpf, the chief executive, will forfeit unvested stock awards worth about $41 million, will not receive a salary while the investigation is underway and will not be eligible for a 2016 bonus, the committee said in a statement. Carrie Tolstedt, the former head of Wells Fargo’s community banking unit, where the misconduct took place, will give up $19 million in unvested stock awards and not be eligible for a 2016 bonus. Tolstedt had announced her retirement in July but had initially planned to stay at the bank until the end of the year. \n \n In a tense exchange, Senator Elizabeth Warren badgered Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf on why he had not offered to give up any of his compensation or to resign in the wake of the fake accounts controversy. (Reuters) \n \n Stumpf and Tolstedt still have millions of dollars in stock and other compensation from Wells Fargo. Stumpf, for example, was awarded $161 million in bonuses and performance awards between 2011 and 2015, the period in which the misconduct took place, according to Equilar, a research firm. Tolstedt was awarded more than $60 million in bonuses in the same period. \n \n But this action by the bank’s board is, by far, the most aggressive and public effort by a bank since the 2008 financial crisis to show that top executives will be held responsible for their companies’ misdeeds. \n \n In early September, Wells Fargo was fined $185 million by regulators after it discovered that thousands of employees were setting up unauthorized accounts, including credit cards and checking accounts, that customers had not requested. In some cases, the customers were charged various fees for accounts they did not know existed. \n \n The case has sparked a national outcry, with lawmakers pummeling Stumpf before the Senate Banking Committee last week, with one even calling on him to resign. He is to be the only witness before the House Financial Services Committee when he attends a hearing this week, and the move to take back financial awards could help head off some of the inevitable anger of lawmakers. \n \n The debate comes as regulators try to finalize rules called for by the 2010 financial-reform bill, known as Dodd Frank, to overhaul the way Wall Street executives are paid and to address years of complaints that excessive bonuses helped lead to the 2008 financial crisis. \n \n The long-awaited rules were aimed at stopping executives from making risky financial bets to boost their pay and then collecting large bonuses before the consequences of their actions are clear. But the banking industry is mounting a counterattack against the rules, which critics say do not allow enough flexibility. Some employees would be subject to claw-backs for up to 11 years after being awarded bonuses, much longer than the current industry standard of three to five years, industry officials have said. \n \n In July, Wells Fargo joined the debate, saying it was concerned that the rules may have unintended consequences. “We have worked, and are continuing to work, diligently . . . to improve and evolve our incentive-based compensation practices,” Hope Hardison, Wells Fargo’s director of human resources, said in a letter to regulators. \n \n But the rules would “create an un-level playing field, driving high-quality talent” away from big banks subject to the rules, she wrote. \n \n The controversy surrounding Wells Fargo is likely to make it more difficult for banks to mount efforts to weaken the rules, industry officials say. \n \n Stumpf is expected to face tough questioning when he appears before the House Financial Services Committee on Thursday. In addition to questions about executive compensation, he is likely to face questions about a recently launched Labor Department inquiry into the bank. \n \n The Labor Department says it is conducting a “top-to-bottom review” of Wells Fargo after lawmakers complained that the bank’s workers were forced into a hypercompetitive environment that led thousands of them to set up the sham accounts to meet aggressive sales goals. \n \n Some former employees allege that they were unfairly fired when they did not cut corners to meet Wells Fargo’s aggressive sales targets. \n \n That could violate federal rules, according to lawmakers and some labor experts. Last week, former Wells Fargo employees who say they were fired for following the law filed a $2.6 billion lawsuit against the bank. They are seeking class-action status. \n \n The Labor Department said it has set up a working group to expedite a review of the issue. \n \n “Given the serious nature of the allegations . . . I have directed enforcement agencies within the Department to conduct a top-to-bottom review of cases, complaints, or violations concerning Wells Fargo over the last several years,” Labor Secretary Thomas Perez said in a letter released Tuesday by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who had asked the agency to look into the matter. \n \n “We take the concerns raised . . . very seriously,” Perez wrote. \n \n A Wells Fargo spokeswoman declined to comment on the Labor Department review. \n \n It is just the latest sign that San Francisco-based bank will be grappling with the fallout from this case for some time. Federal prosecutors are considering civil or criminal charges against the bank.']",3,"– George Washington’s name is synonymous with America—and of the people who bear his surname today, 90% of them are African-American, according to the 2000 census. How did “Washington” become, as Jesse Washington, writing for the AP calls it, the “blackest name"" in America? It could be that blacks chose the name to honor George himself, an odd prospect when you consider that the first US president, while opposed to slavery on paper, owned 124 slaves and worked them hard. But perhaps not so odd when you realize that Washington also freed all 124 of those slaves upon his and his wife’s deaths; of the eight American presidents who owned slaves while in office, he was the only one to do so. Some of his former slaves may have chosen to take his surname as a mark of their community; others may have wanted to maintain a link to a powerful family after being freed. Or the choice could have been random: Booker T. Washington, for example, has never said why he chose his last name 60 years or so after George Washington’s death. Some may even have picked the name to signal their devotion to their new country: ""There was a lot more consciousness and pride in American history among African-Americans and enslaved African-Americans than a lot of people give them credit for,” says one professor and author. But one black genealogy expert, who says 82% to 94% of Washingtons listed in the 1880 to 1930 censuses were black, disagrees. ""As far as I'm concerned it's a coincidence.""

47,"['Water from the Mt. Tabor Reservoir system tested clean of urine-related toxins Thursday, news that came as no surprise to Water Bureau administrators yet also did not change their decision to dump 38 million gallons after a man peed in the Southeast Portland storage pool a day earlier. \n \n City leaders said they were going ahead with plans to drain the water in Reservoir 5 to ensure no health risks to Portland water customers. The decision to empty and clean the reservoir has drawn mention of Portland -- much of it disbelieving or out-and-out derisive -- by national and international news media. \n \n The chief point of contention: Reservoir 5 can hold up to 50 million gallons of water. The typical adult human bladder can hold two or so cups of urine. So the possibility someone getting sick because of Wednesday morning’s incident is, as Water Bureau officials acknowledge, slight at best. \n \n “From a public health protection standpoint, it’s not necessary to get rid of the water,” said Anna Harding, co-director of the School of Biological and Population Health Sciences at Oregon State University. “The urine, which has very few microorganisms to begin with, would be very, very, very, very diluted.” \n \n Still, city officials say, any risk is too much. \n \n “The professionals told me this is the way to go. I’m following their advice. We’ve got plenty of water, so we will go ahead and take the safest course,” said City Commissioner Nick Fish, who oversees the utility. “People can feel free to second guess, but this is not a debate. This is the best public health decision.” \n \n The second-guessing came from far and wide Thursday, including the leading advocate of a May ballot measure to switch control of the city’s water away from the City Council to an independently elected water district board. \n \n Kent Craford, a former lobbyist for large industrial water customers and co-petitioner of the ballot measure, said he thinks flushing 38 million gallons is a bad idea. \n \n “It’s a public relations decision,"" he said. ""I wouldn’t waste all that water, all that money.” \n \n Craford would not speculate whether the water board he’s proposing would feel the same. \n \n “That would be up to the board, up to the managers,” he said. “Our belief is that a water district board will make better decisions than the City Council, and that they would ensure better management than what we have right now.” \n \n The debate about dumping or keeping the water is uniquely Portland with roots in the city’s multi-year battle against new federal mandates on open-air reservoirs. Portland leaders opted to stop fighting last year, and Mt. Tabor’s open reservoir system must be disconnected from the city water system by the end of 2015. The open-air reservoir at Washington Park must go offline by the end of 2016. \n \n “Politics had no impact on our decision in this case,” Fish said. “But this is Mt. Tabor and the reservoirs, and everything that happens up there is evaluated through a political prism. I know people are going to second guess. That’s their right.” \n \n -- Anna Griffin', 'Dallas Swonger wants the world to just know one thing. \n \n “I didn’t piss in the fucking water,” he says, pulling a drag off a Newport cigarette. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Dallas Swonger \n \n The Portland teen is in the hot seat after surveillance video supposedly captured him taking a leak in a city reservoir early Wednesday morning, prompting officials to flush 38 million gallons of drinking water down the drain. \n \n For those more visually inclined, that’s enough H20 to fill about 57 Olympic-size swimming pools. Or 304 million tallboy cans of Pabst Blue Ribbon. \n \n “Yeah, it’s fucking retarded dude,” Swonger says. \n \n In an exclusive, expletive-filled interview with Vocativ outside his mother’s home Thursday, the 18-year-old insisted that his piss never trickled into Portland’s drinking supply. He also lamented the looming reality that this story will make him a national (and international) laughing stock. \n \n “Everybody thinks it’s funny and a joke and I’m going to be on the news,” he says, flicking the cigarette butt into a nearby bush. “It’s no fuckin’ joke, dude. I don’t want people thinkin’ that Dallas is a dumb ass because he pissed in the fuckin’ water. In our drinking water. Yeah, that’s fucking awesome. I mean, wouldn’t you be pissed about that?” \n \n The night that launched the whiz-seen-round-the-world had started off on a more feel-good note for Swonger. He says he had moved back to town that very day from St. Helens, which is 30 miles north of Portland, where he had been living with his dad. Eager to shred with some friends, he and two buddies went to skateboard at Mount Tabor Park after hours, which is home to three of the city’s five uncovered drinking water reservoirs – and a handful of excellent hill runs. After bombing down the park’s western slope, nature began to call Swonger. It was around 1 a.m. and the three friends, along with two other people they met in the park, were near one of the reservoirs. \n \n “I was like, ‘Dudes I have to piss so bad,’” he says. “So I just went over to the wall [of the reservoir].” \n \n “I leaned up against the wall and pissed on it,” he says. “Right there on the wall, dude. I don’t know else how to describe it.” \n \n Water Bureau officials, however, insist Swonger took a leek in the drink. “When you see the video, he’s leaning right up because he has to get his little wee wee right up to the iron bars,” bureau administrator Davd Shaff told the Oregonian. “There’s really no doubt what he’s doing.” \n \n Water Bureau security and Portland Police officers later stopped Swonger and his two friends, identified as Trey McDaniel and Daniel McDonald, and cited all three with trespassing. Swonger was also cited for public urination. \n \n While human pee is not a health hazard – and scores of animals piss, shit and die in Mount Tabor’s reservoirs every year – the city says it will dump a total of 38 million gallons of water, even though test results on Thursday showed no signs of water contamination. \n \n “Like, how they can do that?” says Swonger. “How can they be like, ‘Yeah, we’re gonna flush all that water.’ Dude, I’ve seen dead birds in there. During the summer time I’ve see hella dead animals in there. Like dead squirrels and shit. I mean, really, dude?” \n \n Yes, really. In 2011, city officials flushed 7.8 million gallons of reservoir water from Mount Tabor after another man decided to unzip and rip. The Water Bureau also says that it intends to pursue additional charges against Swonger. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mount Tabor Reservoir: The city is flushing 38 million gallons of drinking water down the drain because it says Dallas peed in the open reservoir. REUTERS/Steve Dipaola \n \n The whole ordeal has Swonger pretty rattled. “Dallas is really bummed out about all of it,” says his skateboard buddy McDonald, who we reached by phone on Thursday. “He’s a really good guy at heart. He just doesn’t make the best decisions. Honestly, he has the potential to do really good.” \n \n As Swonger stood outside his family’s yellow, single-story house talking to a reporter, his mother suddenly opened the front door. “Dallas, don’t do anything stupid,” she says, ushering him indoors. She adds: “I’m sorry, he just graduated from high school. He’s trying to get his stuff together.” \n \n Swonger stops at the front door and turns around. “Sorry, dude,” he says. “I don’t know, dude. I don’t know what’s going on.”', 'DNA testing has disclosed that a set of Vietnamese twins have two different fathers. There are only 10 such cases of bipaternal twins reported from across the world so far. — Photo dantri.com.vn \n \n HA NOI (VNS) — A set of twins in the northern Hoa Binh Province were found to have different fathers, following DNA tests done by the Ha Noi-based Centre for Genetic Analysis and Technology. \n \n This is the first case of its kind to be detected in Viet Nam. The two-year-old twins of the same sex look different, as one has thick and wavy hair, while the other has thin and straight hair. \n \n The 34-year-old father, under pressure from a family member, agreed to a DNA test, which proved that he is the father of one infant. \n \n In order to rule out possible mistakes by nurses at the hospital in giving them a baby of another couple, the wife also underwent a DNA test. The result shows that she is the mother of both children. \n \n President of Viet Nam Genetics Association Le Dinh Luong said bipaternal twins were very rare. \n \n There are reportedly about 10 sets of twins with different fathers across the world, including one in Poland, one in Spain, two in the United States and two in India. \n \n He said the phenomenon had a scientific explanation. \n \n Two eggs of the same mother get fertilised by two different fathers, within the same ovulation period. \n \n When we see twins, we assume that both eggs were fertilised during a single act of intercourse. But it\'s quite possible for one egg to be fertilised during one act of intercourse, and the other during another. \n \n It\'s only logical, then, that when a woman has sex with more than one man while she\'s fertile, ""heteropaternal superfecundation"" can occur. That is, each egg can be fertilised by a different father. \n \n However, if the twins don\'t look alike, it should not be assumed that they have different fathers. Like siblings, twins with the same father can look completely different from each other. They may even appear to be of different races. — VNS', 'To be a modern Republican in good standing, you have to believe — or pretend to believe — in two miracle cures for whatever ails the economy: more tax cuts for the rich and more drilling for oil . And with prices at the pump on the rise, so is the chant of “Drill, baby, drill.” More and more, Republicans are telling us that gasoline would be cheap and jobs plentiful if only we would stop protecting the environment and let energy companies do whatever they want. \n \n Thus Mitt Romney claims that gasoline prices are high not because of saber-rattling over Iran , but because President Obama won’t allow unrestricted drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Meanwhile, Stephen Moore of The Wall Street Journal tells readers that America as a whole could have a jobs boom, just like North Dakota , if only the environmentalists would get out of the way. \n \n The irony here is that these claims come just as events are confirming what everyone who did the math already knew, namely, that U.S. energy policy has very little effect either on oil prices or on overall U.S. employment. For the truth is that we’re already having a hydrocarbon boom, with U.S. oil and gas production rising and U.S. fuel imports dropping. If there were any truth to drill-here-drill-now, this boom should have yielded substantially lower gasoline prices and lots of new jobs. Predictably, however, it has done neither. \n \n Why the hydrocarbon boom? It’s all about the fracking. The combination of horizontal drilling with hydraulic fracturing of shale and other low-permeability rocks has opened up large reserves of oil and natural gas to production. As a result, U.S. oil production has risen significantly over the past three years, reversing a decline over decades, while natural gas production has exploded. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Given this expansion, it’s hard to claim that excessive regulation has crippled energy production. Indeed, reporting in The Times makes it clear that U.S. policy has been seriously negligent — that the environmental costs of fracking have been underplayed and ignored. But, in a way, that’s the point. The reality is that far from being hobbled by eco-freaks, the energy industry has been given a largely free hand to expand domestic oil and gas production, never mind the environment. \n \n Photo \n \n Strange to say, however, while natural gas prices have dropped, rising oil production and a sharp fall in import dependence haven’t stopped gasoline prices from rising toward $4 a gallon. Nor has the oil and gas boom given a noticeable boost to an economic recovery that, despite better news lately, has been very disappointing on the jobs front.']",4,"– The Portland teen accused of peeing in a city reservoir on Wednesday insists he didn't do it—in a relatively NSFW defense.

""I didn't piss in the f---ing water."" He explains that he did urinate, after a night of skateboarding at Mount Tabor Park, but he did so against the wall of the reservoir, not into the reservoir.

Lindsey Graham will headline a fundraiser on Monday in support of Ted Cruz. \n \n Graham told CNN that while the Texas senator is not his preferred candidate, he\'s ""the best alternative to Donald Trump,"" and he said he will ""help Ted in every way I can."" \n \n A draft of the invitation, obtained first by CNN, invites guests to ""honor and support a great friend of Israel and the Jewish people,"" at a meet-and-greet event that will take place during the AIPAC policy conference in Washington next week. \n \n Graham, who ended his bid for the Republican nomination last December, originally threw his support behind former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and campaign for him in South Carolina.', ""Former presidential candidate Marco Rubio told a group of Minnesota supporters Wednesday he is hoping one of the remaining candidates for president will stop Donald Trump from winning the Republican nomination — and that Texas Sen. Ted Cruz could be the best option for conservatives. \n \n Rubio, who dropped out of the race Tuesday after losing his home state of Florida, didn’t endorse any of his former rivals in a conference call with dozens of Minnesota supporters. In the call, he explained his decision to leave the race and why he felt his presidential campaign didn’t do better, and suggested he might run for office again at some point in the future. \n \n He said he saw no real path forward for his campaign after losing Florida and its 99 winner-take-all delegates. He acknowledged he could have stayed in the race with the intention of seeking the nomination at the convention, but said he would have had to run a shoestring campaign with no money to defend himself on the airwaves. Even if he had won the nomination against the odds, Rubio said, the victory could prove pyrrhic. \n \n “Winning a general election with a nominee that a significant percentage of the base thinks stole it, even though you did it through the rules of the RNC, would be pretty much fatal for the party,” Rubio said, though he added that many Republicans will not vote for Trump, either. \n \n But he’s rooting for someone else to stop Trump from winning the 1,237 delegates he needs to clinch the nomination — someone who can go into the convention with more delegates and a better claim than Rubio believes he would have been able to muster. \n \n He didn’t endorse either Texas Sen. Ted Cruz or Ohio Gov. John Kasich, the two other remaining candidates. But Rubio praised Cruz as “the only conservative left in the race.” \n \n Rubio said his positive campaign message didn’t match the national mood, and said media coverage helped snowball Super Tuesday losses into the end of his campaign. \n \n “This election was entirely driven by national media coverage, in many ways,” Rubio said, in audio of the conference call obtained by the Pioneer Press. “When the media narrative goes negative on you, and all the news is bad, it kind of knocks us off.” \n \n Minnesota was one of only three primaries or caucuses Rubio won in his year-long presidential campaign and the only state he won. His other wins were in Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C. \n \n “We’re always joking the last 24 hours at home that we need to move to Minnesota with a winter home in Puerto Rico and work in D.C.,” Rubio said. \n \n The Florida senator said he had tried to run an upbeat campaign, but didn’t think that message resonated in an election when “there’s a lot of frustration in this country.” \n \n “I really believe we’re on the verge of an incredible era in our history,” Rubio said, but added: “This is not the greatest year for that kind of message.” \n \n Describing the arc of his campaign for his Minnesota supporters, Rubio said he endured an “unprecedented” amount of attack ads from the Super PAC supporting former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. Though he “weathered” those ads, Rubio said he “probably could have won Iowa if it weren’t for the TV attacks.” \n \n He said he “saw the bottom fall out of our support” after the March 1 elections, when Rubio won Minnesota but lost everywhere else. \n \n “The media kind of just said, ‘Marco Rubio had a terrible night, and it looks like the strongest anti-Trump alternative is Ted Cruz,'” Rubio said. \n \n He rejected an unidentified supporter’s suggestion that negative coverage by Fox News was particularly to blame for his defeat, but said “there were a couple people on (Fox) that went full Trump.” \n \n The “drumbeat” of negative news about his chances made it harder for Rubio to raise money, he said, and also turned away potential voters. \n \n “When the media is constantly telling you, ‘So-and-so is winning and so-and-so is losing,’ it impacts voters,” he said. \n \n Rubio said polling showed him trailing in Florida by just 5 points last Thursday — “We were closing fast on Donald Trump in Florida,” he said. But by the time Tuesday came around Rubio got blown out by 17 points. \n \n “The only thing that happened over the weekend was the constant drip drip drip of ‘Rubio’s losing’ ” in the media, he said — as well as a Trump rally in Chicago that was canceled after a heavy presence from protesters. “I don’t know for a fact it had an impact on voters, but there’s nothing else that happened during that three-day period.” \n \n But Rubio acknowledged that media narratives cut both ways. \n \n “When we won Iowa, we came in third place, but the media coverage treated us like the winner. We were raising $250,000 a day online,” Rubio said. “We benefited from that narrative, but in the end, we were hurt by it, too. That’s just the way it is.” \n \n He said he is “at peace” with his decision to leave the race but believes he might seek office in the future — though he joked he doesn’t “have any ‘Rubio 2020’ signs printed out or anything like that.” \n \n “I remain open to public service in the future if the opportunity is right for me,” Rubio said. \n \n Rachel E. Stassen-Berger contributed to this report. \n \n This story has been updated with additional information.""]",2,"– Politicians are getting behind Ted Cruz ... sort of: In a conference call to Minnesota supporters Wednesday that was mostly focused on explaining why he dropped out of the presidential race, Marco Rubio said that he hopes one of the GOP candidates still in the race will keep Donald Trump from becoming the nominee, the St. Paul Pioneer Press reports. He also said that Ted Cruz is ""the only conservative left in the race"" ... but he didn't actually endorse Cruz. (John Kasich is the only other non-Trump contender left.) Another senator and former 2016 presidential contender offered a similar non-endorsement of Cruz: Lindsey Graham tells CNN that he'll headline a fundraiser for Cruz on Monday, a meet-and-greet event during the AIPAC conference in DC. Why? ""I think he's the best alternative to beat Donald Trump. I'm going to help Ted in any way I can,"" Graham explained. Buuuuut, ""He's certainly not my preference,"" Graham added of Cruz. ""But he's a reliable Republican, conservative, which I've had many differences with. John Kasich is the most viable general election candidate. I just don't see how John gets through the primary. This is an outsider year, and he is an insider."" Graham, who has previously joked about how unpopular Cruz is among his fellow senators, added that Cruz is indeed ""not well-liked,"" but said that even though ""Senator Cruz would not be my first choice, I think he is a Republican conservative who I could support."""
50,"['Abstract \n \n We document a new genus and species of shrew rat from the north peninsula of Sulawesi Island, Indonesia. The new taxon is known only from the type locality at 1,600 m elevation on Mt. Dako, in the district of Tolitoli. It is distinguished from all other Indonesian murines by its large, flat, pink nose with forward-facing nares. Relative to other Sulawesi murines, the species has extremely large ears (~ 21% of head and body length), very long urogenital hairs, prominent and medially bowing hamular processes on the pterygoid bones, extremely long and procumbent lower incisors, and unusually long articular surfaces on the mandibular condyles. Morphologically, the new taxon is most similar to a group of endemic Sulawesi rats known commonly as “shrew rats.” These are long faced, carnivorous murines, and include the genera Echiothrix, Melasmothrix, Paucidentomys, Sommeromys, and Tateomys. Our Bayesian and likelihood analyses of DNA sequences concatenated from 5 unlinked loci infer the new shrew rat as sister to a clade consisting of Melasmothrix, Paucidentomys, and Echiothrix, suggesting that Sulawesi shrew rats represent a clade. The Sulawesi water rat, Waiomys mamasae, was sister to the shrew rats in our analyses. Discovery of this new genus and species brings known shrew rat diversity on Sulawesi to 6 genera and 8 species. The extent of morphological diversity among these animals is remarkable considering the small number of species currently known. \n \n Kami mendokumentasikan genus dan spesies baru tikus cucurut dari bagian semenanjung utara pulau Sulawesi, Indonesia. Takson baru ini hanya diketahui dari lokasi spesimen tipe pada ketinggian 1,600 mdpl di Gunung Dako, Kabupaten Tolitoli. Ia dibedakan dari spesies tikus Indonesia lainnya berdasarkan ukuran hidung yang besar, datar, berwarna merah muda dengan moncong hidung menghadap ke arah depan. Jika dibandingkan dengan spesies tikus Sulawesi lainnya, spesies ini memiliki telinga yang sangat besar (~ 21% dari panjang kepala dan badan), rambut urogenital yang sangat panjang, prosesus hamular yang jelas dan menonjol pada pertulangan pterygoid, gigi seri bagian bawah yang sangat panjang, dan penampang persendian yang panjang dan tidak biasa pada kondilus mandibula. Secara morfologi, takson ini lebih mirip dengan kelompok tikus endemik Sulawesi yang umumnya dikenal sebagai “tikus cucurut”. Kelompok ini dicirikan dengan mulut yang panjang, pemakan daging, dan termasuk didalamnya adalah genus Echiothrix, Melasmothrix, Paucidentomys, Sommeromys, dan Tateomys. Analisis Bayesian dan likelihood menggunakan sambungan sekuens DNA dari 5 lokus yang tidak terpaut menunjukkan spesies tikus cucurut baru ini berkerabat dekat dengan kelompok yang terdiri dari Melasmothrix, Paucidentomys, dan Echiothrix, memberi kesan tikus cucurut Sulawesi merepresentasikan suatu clade atau kelompok tersendiri. Tikus air Sulawesi, Waiomys mamasae, diketahui berkerabat dekat dengan tikus cucurut dalam analisis yang dilakukan. Penemuan genus dan spesies baru ini menambah keanekaragaman jenis tikus cucurut di Sulawesi yang telah diketahui menjadi 6 genera dan 8 spesies. Besarnya perbedaan morfologi di antara spesies-spesies tersebut merupakan sesuatu yang luar biasa mengingat sedikitnya jumlah spesies yang telah diketahui saat ini.', ""Published on May 8, 2015 \n \n Is This The World's Longest Tongue? \n \n WATCH on our Barcroft TV Website: \n \n SUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/Oc61Hj \n \n We upload a new incredible video every weekday.

Reporting on their find in the Journal of Mammalogy, scientists describe the animal, found in 2013 on Mount Dako, on Indonesia's Sulawesi Island: It's a long-faced carnivorous creature with ""extremely large ears (~21% of head and body length) [and] very long urogenital hairs""—the latter being pubic hairs. Co-author Kevin Rowe tells Mashable Australia that it's unclear what purpose the hair serves, though ""it probably helps it in some kind of reproductive way. Both males and females have those long ... hairs, like whiskers. They're not like human pubic hairs."" Among its other features: Rowe explains that the 18-inch-long rat's mouth opening is so narrow that it can't open it much. ""It probably eats worms and insect larvae, just kind of slurping them up."" (In line with that slurping, it also lacks the coronoid process on the dentary bone, which other mammals rely on to chew.) KNOE reports it's the third genus newly identified by the international team since 2012 (here's another of the team's finds), and recalls the moment the rat was found—twice. Rowe, of Museum Victoria, and LSU Museum of Natural Science Curator of Mammals Jake Esselstyn went to check their respective traps, saw what was clear to them was a new species, ""came back to camp and were both surprised that the other one had it as well."" The rodent was given the name Hyorhinomys stuempkei, which the Age translates from the Greek as ""'hyo' meaning hog, 'rhino' meaning nose and 'mys' meaning rat.""

51,"[""The Supreme Court won't get involved in a death penalty case in which a convicted killer in Illinois complained that prosecutors focused the jury's attention on the fact that he never testified on his own behalf. \n \n The court did not comment on its action Monday to leave in place the conviction and sentence of Ronald Mikos, a foot doctor who was facing allegations of Medicare fraud. He was sentenced to death in 2005 on charges that he shot a disabled nurse and former patient, Joyce Brannon, to keep her from testifying against him. \n \n He did not testify in his own defense during his trial.

United States, 08-1280."", 'Federal prosecutors announced Friday they will seek the death penalty for a former University of Illinois graduate student accused of kidnapping, torturing and killing a visiting scholar from China in June. \n \n In making the announcement, prosecutors alleged for the first time that Brendt Christensen “choked and sexually assaulted” another victim in 2013 in central Illinois. He also has claimed “additional victims” and expressed a “desire to be known as a killer,” according to prosecutors. \n \n Christensen, 28, who is being held without bond, had tentatively been set to go to trial Feb. 27 in federal court in Urbana on a charge of kidnapping resulting in a death stemming from the disappearance of 26-year-old Yingying Zhang, whose body has not been found. \n \n The decision to seek the death penalty — which required the approval of U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions — means that the trial will likely be delayed for months. \n \n The death penalty was abolished in Illinois state court in 2011 after years of allegations of deep flaws in the state’s justice system. In certain cases, though, it remains a tool for federal prosecutors, but its use in federal courts is still rare. It also can take years for an execution to actually be carried out. \n \n The last person to be sentenced to death in a federal courtroom in Illinois was Dr. Ronald Mikos, who was convicted in 2005 in Chicago of murdering a former patient to keep her from testifying against him in a Medicare fraud trial. \n \n Mikos, 69, whose appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court was denied nearly a decade ago, is still awaiting execution in federal prison in Terre Haute, Ind., federal records show. \n \n The announcement in Christensen’s case marks at least the third time in recent weeks that Sessions has opted to push for the death penalty. Earlier this month, it was revealed prosecutors would seek the death penalty against Billy Arnold, an alleged gang member accused of killing two rivals in Michigan. In December, Sessions greenlighted pursuit of the death penalty against Jarvis Wayne Madison, a Florida man who allegedly kidnapped and killed his estranged wife. \n \n In their five-page motion Friday, prosecutors said the death penalty was warranted because Christensen “is likely to commit criminal acts of violence in the future that would constitute a continuing and serious threat to the lives and safety of others.” \n \n No details of the alleged 2013 sexual assault by Christensen were provided other than the initials of the victim, “M.D.” The alleged assault occurred the year Christensen was admitted to the university’s highly competitive physics graduate program. \n \n Four years later, Zhang\'s sudden disappearance rattled the U. of I. campus and sent shock waves throughout China. \n \n Zhang, who began her research appointment last April, tried unsuccessfully to flag down a bus before walking to another stop the afternoon of June 9. Shortly after, federal authorities allege, Christensen approached Zhang in his black Saturn Astra sedan and lured her inside. \n \n Surveillance video from a nearby parking garage captured the exchange in which Zhang could be seen speaking to the driver for several moments before getting into the front passenger seat. \n \n The investigation focused on Christensen after police concluded his Saturn was the car seen in the video. He initially told the FBI he was home all day playing video games on the day Zhang disappeared. \n \n Yingying Zhang, 26, a visiting scholar at the University of Illinois, has been missing since June 9, 2017. Authorities say she is presumed dead. Brendt Christensen, 28, has been charged with kidnapping Zhang. \n \n When he was questioned a second time, Christensen changed his story, telling agents he got the date mixed up, according to court records. He said he was driving on campus, came across an Asian woman looking distressed and offered her a ride because she said she was late to an appointment, authorities said. Christensen said the woman panicked after he made a wrong turn, and he let her out of his car a few blocks from where they met, prosecutors said. \n \n Meanwhile, police searched Christensen’s car and determined that the area where Zhang would have been sitting had been cleaned in a way to conceal evidence, according to prosecutors. Police also searched his phone and found visits to a sadomasochism fetish website with discussion threads on kidnapping fantasies, prosecutors said. \n \n On June 29, Christensen attended a campus rally for Zhang with a girlfriend, who unbeknownst to him was wearing an FBI wire. He was captured on audio recordings describing his ""ideal victim"" as he pointed out people in the crowd, prosecutors have previously said. \n \n Other recordings made that day captured Christensen admitting to having kidnapped Zhang and describing how she fought back as he held her against her will, according to prosecutors. \n \n Earlier this week, a defense filing revealed that a few hours before Zhang’s kidnapping, a female U. of I. graduate student reported to police that a man wearing aviator sunglasses had pulled up to her in a black sedan and flashed a badge. She refused to get in the car and he drove off. \n \n A few days later, the woman picked out Christensen’s photo from among six shown her by the FBI, but Christensen’s lawyers are seeking to block the testimony, saying she couldn’t be certain because of the sunglasses. \n \n She did say that of the six photos, Christensen ""shared the most characteristics"" of the man because of his ""short, dark hair and tan face,"" the filing said. \n \n jmeisner@chicagotribune.com \n \n Twitter @jmetr22b \n \n RELATED: Earlier abduction attempt reported on day Chinese scholar went missing at U. of I. » \n \n Parents of missing Chinese scholar: \'I don\'t know how to spend the rest of my life without my daughter\' » \n \n At vigil for missing Chinese scholar, suspect talked about \'ideal victim,\' prosecutor says »', 'Gabrielle Giffords shooting: Frightening, twisted shrine in Arizona killer Jared Lee Loughner\'s yard \n \n DAILY NEWS EXCLUSIVE Miniature altar with human skull replica in backyard tent at Jared Lee Loughner\'s home. \n \n DAILY NEWS EXCLUSIVE Tent containing shrine in Jared Lee Loughner\'s Tucson backyard.

It’s not hard to see why. The lame duck two-term governor fawned over Donald Trump after the bombastic billionaire won the presidential election. Many speculated Christie was angling for a post in the new administration. Trump did name Christie to head his transition team, but eventually replaced him with Mike Pence. In the end, Trump decided not to include Christie in his cabinet, possibly because Christie was damaged goods. Indeed, Christie’s reputation was sullied by the Bridgegate scandal in which allies created a traffic jam on the George Washington Bridge in early September 2013, hoping motorists would blame a local Democratic mayor for the tie-up. \n \n The outgoing governor said he does not care about poll numbers. That seemed to be the case last month when Christie and his family were spotted lounging on a state-owned beach while the general public was denied beach access due to a statewide government shutdown. \n \n Source: Federal Bureau of Investigation \n \n 3. James Comey \n \n > Occupation: Director of the FBI \n \n James Comey has been a controversial figure since the middle of the 2016 presidential election. Initially, Comey was criticized for publicly attacking Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton’s judgment in using a private email server during her time at the State Department. Comey garnered even more ire when, in an apparent break with bureau protocol, he announced candidate Clinton was the subject of an FBI investigation only days before the election. While some attribute President Donald Trump’s electoral victory to Comey’s investigation of Clinton, Trump abruptly fired the FBI Director less than five months into his presidency. \n \n Comey had served as FBI Director since 2013, when he was appointment by President Barack Obama, until he was terminated by Trump in May 2017. The White House has since provided multiple conflicting justifications for Comey’s firing. \n \n Source: media.ford.com \n \n 4.

A loyal company man, Fields had been with Ford since 1989, working his way up to COO in 2012 and CEO in 2014. \n \n Fields’ time at the top was limited largely due to his failure to inspire confidence on Wall Street. Ford shares fell by nearly 40% during his tenure as CEO — even as corporate revenue climbed over 5% from 2014 to 2016. Shareholder confidence was mostly undermined by Fields’ determination to take on Tesla, investing in electric and autonomous vehicle technology. Despite attempts to woo shareholders by announcing a 10% reduction in its global workforce in early May 2017 in order to boost profits, Fields was let go later that month. \n \n Source: Flickr / Keith Allison \n \n 5.

53,"['""The Road"" is a road you\'ll wish hadn\'t been taken. Not because anything\'s been badly done, but because there\'s a serious imbalance in the complicated equation between what the film forces us to endure and what we end up receiving in return.Given that it\'s based on Cormac McCarthy\'s somber novel, winner of the Pulitzer Prize for a devastating report from the end of the world witnessed by a man who\'s been there, it\'s no surprise that the film is for the most part profoundly depressing.What is disappointing is that despite numerous strong areas, including fine acting by Viggo Mortensen and young Kodi Smit-McPhee as father-and-son survivors of an unnamed apocalypse, what we\'ve been given is no more than a reasonable facsimile, an honorable attempt at filming an unfilmable book.As adapted by British playwright Joe Penhall and directed by John Hillcoat, best known for the slickly violent ""The Proposition,"" ""The Road"" turns out to be good at shocking and upsetting us, but it lacks the compensating emotional heft that would make absorbing those shocks worth our while.For while Chris Kennedy\'s formidable production design places us in an uncomfortably real space, absent McCarthy\'s haunting language, ""The Road"" for the most part is not so good at transcendence, at making us feel, as the book definitely does, that there is reason for us to endure its pitiless descriptions of what Joseph Conrad described in ""Heart of Darkness"" as ""the horror, the horror.""What Conrad was likely talking about, and what ""The Road"" devotes considerable time to on the screen and on the page, is the terrors that humans inflict on each other. One of the provocative questions this story asks is whether staying alive is worth the savagely inhuman actions necessary to make survival possible.Unwilling to begin on a totally downbeat note, ""The Road"" opens with what turns out to be a dream flashback to a time just before the unspecified catastrophe happens, a time when Mortensen\'s unnamed man is married to Charlize Theron\'s unnamed woman and their first child is on the way.Ten years into the post-apocalypse, the mother is gone, the unborn child is a young boy (Australian actor Smit-McPhee) and the world has changed. It\'s a blasted, blighted, ashen and slowly dying Earth, shaken by quakes, lighted by out-of-control fires and filled with dead cars, empty buildings, deserted bridges and very few people.To stay alive in this world, you have to keep moving, wearing the most utilitarian rags you can find (Margot Wilson did the excellent costume design) and pushing the shopping cart that contains all your possessions. It\'s a vision of a world largely without us that completely chills the soul.The casting of Mortensen and Smit-McPhee is one of the film\'s strengths. With straggly hair and a great wild look, Mortensen is convincing as a harried survivor, and the rapport he has with the more innocent and soulful child played by Smit-McPhee is excellent.""I\'ve never had a better acting partner,"" Mortensen has said, ""someone I knew had my back, and he knew I had his.""One of the great fears of those few survivors is cannibalism, something the strong inflict on the weak, and scenes that hint at that are among ""The Road\'s"" hardest to take.The man\'s greatest fear is that he will die before his son is old enough to protect himself, and the son\'s greatest fear, paradoxically, is that he and his father will somehow lose the essence of their humanity in the drive to stay alive. ""Are we still the good guys?"" he asks his father plaintively. ""Are we carrying the fire?""This pair have their affecting moments, as does Robert Duvall as a kind of barely alive human lump, but absent McCarthy\'s transformative prose, which has a power even images can\'t improve on, what we are left with is more endurance test than anything more elevated.If it is to do more than horrify and depress us, ""The Road"" is in need of a finer sensibility, and that is simply not on offer.', 'The Road \n \n November 24, 2009 \n \n Cast & Credits The Man Viggo Mortensen \n \n The Boy Kodi Smit-McPhee \n \n Wife Charlize Theron \n \n Old Man Robert Duvall \n \n The Veteran Guy Pearce \n \n \n \n Dimension Films presents a film directed by John Hillcoat. Written by Joe Penhall, based on the novel by Cormac McCarthy. Running time: 119 minutes. Rated R. \n \n \n \n Printer-friendly » \n \n E-mail this to a friend » \n \n Note: I first saw ""The Road"" in September at the Toronto Film Festival, as one of eight films I saw in three days. I wrote a draft of a review at the time and sent it. That review accidentally found its way into sight in October, long before the film was scheduled to open. I yanked it offline as quickly as I could. \n \n \n \n I saw the movie a second time at a press screening on Oct. 27 in Chicago. I see festival films again whenever I have the chance. I find the second viewing makes the good ones better, and the bad ones worse. Such is the case with ""The Road."" \n \n ""The Road"" evokes the images and the characters of Cormac McCarthy\'s novel. It is powerful, but for me lacks the same core of emotional feeling. I\'m not sure this is any fault of the filmmakers. The novel itself would not be successful if it were limited to its characters and images. Its effect comes above all through McCarthy\'s prose. It is the same with all of McCarthy\'s work, but especially this one, because his dialogue is so restrained, less baroque than usual. \n \n \n \n The story is straightforward: America has been devastated. Habitations have been destroyed or abandoned, vegetation is dying, crops have failed, the infrastructure of civilization has disappeared. This has happened in such recent memory that even The Boy, so young, was born into a healthy world. No reason is given for this destruction, perhaps because no reason would be adequate. McCarthy evokes the general apprehension of post-9/11. The Boy and The Man make their way toward the sea, perhaps for no better reason than that sea has always been the direction of hope in this country. \n \n \n \n The surviving population has been reduced to savage survivalists, making slaves of the weaker, possibly using them as food. We\'ve always done that, employing beef cattle, for example, to do the grazing on acres of pasture so we can consume the concentrated calories of their labor. In a land where food is scarce, wanderers seek out canned goods and fear their own bodies will perform this work for the cannibals. \n \n \n \n Although we read of those who stockpile guns and ammunition for an apocalypse, weapon stores on the Road have dwindled down. The Man has a gun with two remaining bullets. He is a wary traveler, suspecting everyone he sees. He and The Boy are transporting a few possessions in a grocery cart. He encourages his son to keep walking, but holds out little hope for the end of their journey. \n \n \n \n I am not sure the characters could be played better, or differently. Viggo Mortensen portrays The Man as dogged and stubborn, determined to protect his boy. Kodi Smit-McPhee is convincing as a child stunned by destruction, depending on his father in a world where it must be clear to him that any man can die in an instant. The movie resists any tendency toward making the child cute, or the two of them heartwarming. \n \n \n \n Flashback scenes star Charlize Theron as the wife and mother of the two in earlier, sunnier days. These sequences show the marriage as failing, and these memories haunt The Man. I\'m not sure what relevance this subplot has to the film as a whole; a marriage happy or sad -- isn\'t it much the same in this new world? It has a lot of relevance, however, to The Man and The Boy. In times of utter devastation, memories are what we cling to. \n \n \n \n The external events of the novel have been boldly solved, and this is an awesome production. But McCarthy\'s prose has the uncanny ability to convey more than dialogue and incident. It\'s as dense as poetry. It is more spare in The Road than in a more ornate work like Suttree; in The Road, it is as evocative in the way Samuel Beckett is. If it were not, ""The Road"" might be just another film of sci-fi apocalypse. It\'s all too easy to imagine how this material could be vulgarized, as Richard Matheson\'s novel was in the 2007 version of ""I Am Legend."" \n \n \n \n How could the director and writer, John Hillcoat and Joe Penhall, have summoned the strength of McCarthy\'s writing? Could they have used more stylized visuals, instead of relentless realism? A grainy black-and-white look to suggest severely limited resources? I have no idea. Perhaps McCarthy, like Faulkner, is all but unfilmable. \n \n \n \n The one great film of his work is the Coens\' ""No Country for Old Men,"" but it began with an extraordinary character and surrounded him with others. The Road is not fertile soil, providing a world with life draining from it. McCarthy\'s greatest novels are Suttree and Blood Meridian. The second, set in the Old West, is about a fearsome, bald, skeletal man named Judge Holden, who is implacable in his desire to inflict suffering and death. (""Blood Meridian"" is being prepared by Todd Field, director of ""In the Bedroom."") \n \n \n \n Hillcoat\'s earlier film, ""The Proposition"" (2005), written by Nick Cave, seems almost McCarthy-like. Something in McCarthy\'s work draws Hillcoat to it, and you must be a brave director to let that happen. Writing this, I realize few audience members can be expected to have read The Road, even though it was a selection of Oprah\'s Book Club. Fewer still will have read McCarthy\'s other works. \n \n \n \n I\'ve been saying for years that a film critic must review the film before him, and not how ""faithful"" the film is to the book -- as if we\'re married to the book, and somehow screen adaptation is adultery. I realize my own fault is in being so very familiar with Cormac McCarthy. That may affect my ability to view any film adaptation of his work afresh. When I know a novel is bring filmed, I make it a point to not read the book. Yet I am grateful for having read McCarthy\'s.', 'In “The Road,’’ the world has ended with a bang and a whimper. Author Cormac McCarthy’s lean prose has been lifted off the printed page and laid carefully into the soundtrack like antique china in a packing crate. “The clocks stopped at 1:17,’’ says the narrator. “A long shear of light and then a series of low concussions.’’ That’s all we know about the apocalypse and all we need to know. \n \n The movie takes place in an America that has been turned into an ash heap, with skeletal human survivors picking their way across the cinders. Kept rigorously in the foreground are a Man (Viggo Mortensen) and a Boy (Kodi Smit-McPhee), the latter born shortly after the end came and thus a creature exclusively of this fallen world. \n \n The two are traveling from the interior to the coast before winter comes - that’s the action of the movie. That, and keeping clear of marauding bands of men who would gladly skin them and eat them. Also, as the boy reminds his father, the two “carry the fire,’’ whatever that means. It could refer to decency and goodness, the guttering spark of humanity. It could just mean they’re still alive. \n \n “The Road’’ has been poured straight from McCarthy’s bleak bottle and brought to the screen by Australian John Hillcoat, who turned the 2005 Outback Western “The Proposition’’ into an epic of blasted landscapes and bloody motivations. He’s the man for the job, yet in adapting this harsh, unyielding book for the screen, Hillcoat and screenwriter Joe Penhall pull their punches the slightest degree and thus too much. \n \n Or maybe movies can only dully visualize horrors the best writers hint at. Hillcoat’s “Road’’ is true to the book’s profoundly moving post-nuclear stoicism, but it can’t quite get those biblical cadences that make McCarthy such a transfixing read. The Coens managed it with “No Country for Old Men,’’ so it can be done, but you have to be willing to go all the way into the dark. As a colleague said after seeing this movie, you need to show the baby on the spit. “The Road’’ doesn’t dare, can’t dare, and is the lesser thing. \n \n What’s on the screen is disturbing enough. (Even at that, it has taken a year for the Weinsteins, the producers and distributors of “The Road,’’ to get the nerve to release the film.) As the Man and the Boy drag their shopping cart across what’s left of America, the enormity of the cataclysm is glimpsed forward and backward. A wife (Charlize Theron) who may have been the braver for opting out. An impossibly old man (Robert Duvall) like a figure out of “Godot,’’ unable to go on but still going on. A trap door in a kitchen that leads to something you’d better not think about. \n \n There are other basements and further revelations in “The Road,’’ but Hillcoat avoids jack-in-the-box suspense clichés; the movie plods with a literalism that’s at times too reverent (as is Nick Cave’s score, piling on a sensitive “mournfulness’’ both redundant and unnecessary). Mortensen underplays his role admirably, and Smit-McPhee is gratifyingly unactorly. At the movie’s best we see their relationship shift as something crucial and inarticulate is passed from one generation to the next. \n \n Like all end-of-the-world fiction, “The Road’’ brings iconic meaning to the smallest of gestures. A single kindness becomes the hope of humanity; a cruel act the path to hell. If I have mixed feelings about the movie, it’s because Hillcoat honors the story’s minimalism without bringing his own sensibilities to bear on the material. He’s spooked by the responsibility, and maybe he’s right: When the director does add a single furry detail to the final scenes, it feels like a surrender to sentiment. \n \n At the same time, everything about the film is a welcome rebuke to the happy-face apocalypse of “2012,’’ a movie that turns mass extinction into the Greatest Show on Earth. In “The Road,’’ what has been lost is recognized as infinitely precious; what’s left is bitter and our due. \n \n Ty Burr can be reached at tburr@globe.com.

Critics have mixed feelings about the bleak post-apocalyptic film. Here’s what they’re saying: Despite good acting, the film is merely adequate, “an honorable attempt at filming an unfilmable book,” writes Kenneth Turan of the LA Times. “To do more than horrify and depress us, The Road is in need of a finer sensibility.” A devoted Cormac McCarthy fan, Roger Ebert wrestles with his review. “It is powerful, but for me lacks the same core of emotional feeling,” he writes. “I'm not sure this is any fault of the filmmakers.” The movie can only “dully visualize horrors the best writers hint at,” says Ty Burr of the Boston Globe. Still, it’s a “welcome rebuke to the happy-face apocalypse of 2012.” “The Road isn't a masterpiece,” writes Steven Rea in the Philadelphia Inquirer. But it stuck with him, “its images of dread and fear kicking around like such a terrible dream.”"

In Gaza, Hamas is sovereign, and we see it as being responsible for today\'s shooting from the Strip and rocket launches over the past today at Israel. We will not allow a disruption to life in the South, and we will respond decisively and painfully to attacks on our sovereignty and against our civilians and soldiers,"" the defense minister added. \n \n \n \n He advised Hamas ""not to test our patience,"" calling on Gaza\'s ruling regime to exercise its authority on the ground to prevent further attacks on Israel by other organizations. \n \n \n \n ""If there won\'t be quiet in Israel, there won\'t be quiet in Gaza either,"" Ya\'alon warned. \n \n \n \n ""Terrorism incidents are the continuation of previous attacks, most of which are the result of a lone attacker, or one who has been influenced by the atmosphere of incitement and hatred that exists in the Palestinian Authority against Israel. This is an intolerable situation from our perspective, and despite the difficulties in dealing with a lone individual incited to murder Jews, we will act with a resolute hand and in various ways to harm anyone who tries to carry out terrorist attacks,"" Ya\'alon pledged. \n \n \n \n As long as the PA continues to incite against Israel and its civilians, and fails to promote a culture of peace, Israel will have to deal with attacks that result from this, he added. Ya\'alon sent his condolences to the family of the fatally wounded civilian, and wished the policeman stabbed on Monday a swift recovery. \n \n \n \n Ya\'alon ordered the closing of the Kerem Shalom border crossing on Tuesday evening, following escalation on the Gaza border. \n \n \n \n President Shimon Peres said that ""Israel will ensure its own security"" and advised Hamas and the Islamic Jihad to stop aggressions against Israel. \n \n \n \n ""If Gaza wants it to be quiet, it must remain quiet, otherwise it will suffer the consequences of the unrest many times over,"" Peres said. \n \n \n \n ""Gaza is not under any occupation.

""I trust that the IDF and security forces will act against terror."" \n \n \n \n However, some on the right did not share Herzog\'s determination to continue negotiating. \n \n \n \n ""The deterioration in security shows once again that the Palestinians don\'t want peace,"" Deputy Minister for Liaison with the Knesset Ofir Akunis said.

We can find our way back to each other.” \n \n Many Chinese social media users have echoed that sentiment since the death of the 2-year-old in Yueyang. \n \n “Head-down tribe, it’s time to lift your head now,” one commenter wrote on Weibo, using a popular Chinese nickname for smartphone obsessives.""]",3,"– Israel launched an airstrike in the Gaza Strip today, in retaliation for the shooting of an Israeli working on the border fence, the Israeli military said, according to the AP.

All four belonged to a family that lived near an al Qassam Brigades camp that the attack appeared to be targeting. A Palestinian sniper shot Salah Shukri Abu Latyef, a 22-year-old civilian engineer, earlier today, the Jerusalem Post reports. He was airlifted to the hospital, where he died of his wounds. Benjamin Netanyahu called it a ""very grave incident,"" and promised to ""react with force"" in accordance with longstanding policy.

55,"['The Norwegian captain who found Perry Cohen and Austin Stephanos’ tiny boat bobbing off the coast of Bermuda last month called it an extraordinary coincidence over which he’s still marveling. \n \n In an interview with The Palm Beach Post from Norway, Håvard Melvaer, 40, said the discovery happened while captaining the Edda Fjord, a massive multipurpose supply ship, on its route from Port Fourchon, La., to its home port in Haugesund, Norway. \n \n A week into their voyage, on March 18, Melvaer said he was in his office working on some Excel spreadsheets when his wife came up to see him in the afternoon. \n \n “You look tired,” she said. “Let’s go out for some fresh air.” \n \n The second he stepped out the door, he spotted the 19-foot SeaCraft in the water about 30 to 40 feet off the port side. \n \n + Håvard Melvaer, captain of the Edda Fjord (Courtesy Håvard Melvaer) × \n \n Nobody else in the 16-person crew noticed it. The officer on the bridge was using binoculars to keep lookout, but at that moment was looking off the starboard side, Melvaer said. Had his wife not asked him to step outside, he would have missed it, too. \n \n “We were basically just crossing exactly where it was at the time,” Melvaer said. “It’s just a stroke of luck. There was no skill involved. It just took a pair of eyes looking in that direction at that particular time.” \n \n Melvaer said he’s tried to wrap his head around how unlikely it was. \n \n “You kind of think a little bit and try to understand the concept of how big it really is,” he said. “It’s amazing. We kind of felt like it wanted to be found.” \n \n The discovery, nearly eight months after Austin and Perry left the Jupiter Inlet and never returned, has been called a “miracle” by the U.S. Coast Guard. Coast Guardsmen initially found it floating 67 miles off the coast of Daytona Beach two days after the Tequesta teens disappeared. They attached a data marker buoy to it and continued searching for the boys, but the device failed. When they went to retrieve the boat, it was gone. \n \n The boat is now packed in a shipping container and expected to arrive May 16 at Port Everglades. Its contents — Austin’s iPhone, two fishing rods and two small tackle boxes — have been returned to the families. The phone could offer clues to their disappearance if the family wants to pursue them. \n \n Melvaer said Sunday that after spotting the boat, the crew hoisted it on board to remove it from the shipping lane, a standard practice. The boat was intact and had a serial number on the engine, so he notified the Coast Guard. \n \n In the meantime, he wondered about the boat and its crew. \n \n “I went up to my office and basically Googled ‘missing fisherman,’ I think, and it (Austin and Perry’s story) came up as one of the first ones,” he said. \n \n He had never heard of the boys, but when the Coast Guard confirmed his suspicion and asked him to send photos, Melvaer was stunned. He and the crew felt they had to protect what was now precious cargo, he said, and they made sure it was kept out of harm’s way while on board. \n \n “I’m a parent myself, so I can identify with the situation,” he said. “I’ve been boating since I was a kid as well. \n \n “That goes for all the crew, as well. They had the same reaction. They felt that it was important to get this properly done and try not to do extra damage.” \n \n Since he started training at age 17, he’s only twice run across abandoned vessels in the water — one time the bow of a boat off the coast of India, and a second time a downed helicopter he happened to be searching for. \n \n “It’s not something that happens every day,” he said. “When you’re at sea, things have a tendency to blend in.” \n \n Melvaer declined to discuss particular details about the boat or its contents, citing the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission investigation and concern for the boys’ families. He wouldn’t say whether Austin’s cellphone was in usable condition. \n \n His hope is that the chance discovery might bring some peace to the families. \n \n “Let’s hope that this leads to something good,” he said. “Of course, nothing can ever replace what’s lost. We’re just crossing our fingers and hoping for the best.”', 'THE LIGHTBULB \n \n Acting Environmental Protection Agency chief Andrew Wheeler listens as President Trump leads a cabinet meeting in the White House this month. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) \n \n Investigators in Congress and reporters played a role in unearthing information about Scott Pruitt’s suspect spending decisions. But much of the credit for exposing the activities of the former Environmental Protection Agency chief goes to the Sierra Club. \n \n Now the group is making its move against his successor, acting administrator Andrew Wheeler. \n \n The nation’s oldest environmental advocacy group overwhelmed the agency with requests for emails and other documents sent by Pruitt and his closest aides. When the EPA failed to cough up the correspondence requested under the Freedom of Information Act, the Sierra Club sued. By April, the lawsuit yielded a trove of documents used by reporters, including those at The Washington Post, to share with the public details of his behavior in office that sparked a firestorm of criticism. \n \n This week the Sierra Club filed an amendment to a lawsuit against the EPA in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, asking the agency to release yet more communications from EPA staff — including those, for the first time, from Wheeler. \n \n “With these FOIAs, we\'re keeping an eye on their external communication, which will allow us to see how they\'re getting information, how they\'re making decisions,” Sierra Club senior attorney Elena Saxonhouse said. “That was the same approach that we took with the Pruitt FOIA, and it\'s really the same strategy here.” \n \n The organization is not letting up after its past FOIA requests yielded documents that helped whittle down President Trump’s support for Pruitt -- even though the former EPA chief was lauded by conservatives for reducing regulatory burdens for businesses. \n \n For example, one of the more unusual emails unearthed by the Sierra Club was a request from Pruitt\'s scheduler to Dan Cathy, the chief executive of Chick-fil-A. The aide asked Cathy whether he would meet with Pruitt to discuss “a potential business opportunity.” The fast-food company eventually confirmed to The Post that Pruitt told a Chick-fil-A representative over the phone that he wanted his wife to become a franchisee. \n \n Another exchange revealed the agency spent $1,560 on a dozen customized fountain pens emblazoned the Pruitt\'s signature. \n \n Of course, the Sierra Club did not originally file its public-records requests on Pruitt with fancy pens or fried chicken in mind. “He had many ties to polluting industries,” said Saxonhouse, who was recently profiled in Slate for overseeing the Sierra Club\'s FOIA efforts. \n \n “There is still a lot of people at EPA there to carry out the agenda of granting industry wish lists,” she added. \n \n In total, the Sierra Club is seeking the records of 25 more staffers with its suit in San Francisco. The agency did not reply to a request for comment from The Post. \n \n Environmentalists see a similar pro-industry streak in Wheeler. After working for years for Sen. James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.), one of the most ardent opponents of climate science in the Senate, Wheeler went on to lobby for several industries, including coal and nuclear companies, before joining the Trump campaign as an energy adviser. \n \n Programming note: I am off next week, but the Energy 202 is not.

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) \n \n — More on Wheeler: The acting administrator pledged upon taking office that he would avoid potential conflicts of interest. But E&E News reports that since taking over as acting chief of the agency, Wheeler has taken three meetings with former clients that “may have violated the Trump administration’s ethics pledge,” and attended events that included the head of a company that Wheeler agreed not to meet with through 2020. The meetings, which E&E News reports are mentioned on Wheeler’s public schedule, “stand in stark contrast to the acting EPA chief\'s claims that he is taking pains to avoid helping his former clients advance their interests,” per the report. “It\'s possible that the meetings with former clients weren\'t about a \'particular matter\' that Wheeler previously worked on for them. But that\'s difficult to determine from the public calendars, and EPA didn\'t provide additional information about the focus of the events.” \n \n Vehicles sit in rush hour traffic at the interchange between the Interstate 405 and 10 freeways in Los Angeles, California. (Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg) \n \n — EPA rolls forward with some Pruitt deregulation... The Trump administration is set to halt Obama-era fuel efficiency standards for cars and light trucks, Wheeler told USA Today, adding that the previous administration “jumped the gun” on increasing fuel-economy standards. The Obama-era agreement was to boost fuel-economy levels to an average of 34.5 mpg by 2016 and increase it yearly up to 54.5 mpg by the end of 2025, per the report. \n \n ...and reverses it elsewhere: In a 180, the EPA said Thursday it would enforce stricter pollution limits on “glider trucks,” which The Post’s Juliet Eilperin and Brady Dennis report emit dozens of times more soot and contaminants than diesel engine trucks. The move reverses ex-administrator Pruitt’s final act as the head of the agency. In a three-page memo, Wheeler said he would withdraw Pruitt’s “no action assurance” to manufacturers of glider trucks that said they would not have to limit their production to 300 trucks through the end of 2019. “In his memo Wheeler noted that the agency suspends enforcement only in rare circumstances and that after consulting with EPA lawyers and policy experts, \'I have concluded that the application of the current regulations to the glider industry does not represent the kind of extremely unusual circumstances that support the EPA’s use of enforcement discretion,’” per Eilperin and Dennis. \n \n Former Republican Senate candidate and former Massey Energy CEO Don Blankenship.

56,"['CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand | \n \n CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ruled out running for president in 2012 or 2016 on Friday, saying the United States should be ready for a woman president but it would not be her. \n \n In interviews in New Zealand, the failed 2008 presidential candidate made clear she had no plans to run again despite talk -- fueled partly by her fellow Democrats\' losses in Tuesday\'s U.S. mid-term elections -- she might embark on a new race. \n \n Asked by TV3 New Zealand whether she ruled out standing for the top U.S. office through 2016, Clinton, according to a U.S. reporter, replied: ""Oh yes, yes. I\'m very pleased to be doing what I\'m doing as secretary of state."" \n \n In a separate interview with TV New Zealand, Clinton said she hoped the United States was ready for a female president, adding ""it should be."" \n \n Asked if it might be her, she replied: ""Well, not me. But it will be someone and it is nice coming to countries that have already proven that they can elect women to the highest governing positions that they have in their systems."" \n \n New Zealand -- whose former prime ministers include Helen Clark and Jenny Shipley -- is the second-to-last stop on a nearly two-week Asia-Pacific tour that Clinton wraps up in Australia, whose current prime minister is Julia Gillard. \n \n In Tuesday\'s election, Democrats lost control of the House of Representatives, where the Republicans gained at least 60 members. As of Thursday, Democrats held on to the Senate with a 51-seat majority but the Republicans gained six seats there. \n \n The Democrats\' poor showing has been widely interpreted as a referendum on U.S. President Barak Obama, raising questions about who the party may field as its candidate in 2012, when he would be expected to run for re-election, and 2016. \n \n (Editing by Sugita Katyal)', 'Secretary of State Hillary Clinton aimed to defuse speculation about another presidential run Friday, telling New Zealand television that she\'s very pleased to serve as Secretary of State. \n \n Asked by New Zealand TV3\'s Duncan Garner Friday, ""Just looking long term, do you still rule out standing for top office, for president?"" \n \n ""Yes,"" Clinton said. \n \n Garner continued: ""Even as going as far as 2016?"" \n \n ""Oh yes, yes,"" Clinton reiterated. ""I’m very pleased to be doing what I’m doing as Secretary of State."" \n \n Does that constitute Clinton ruling out a 2016 run, as the Reuters\' take on her comments suggests? \n \n Not necessarily. Clinton says she\'s enjoying her job as Secretary of State too much to get into the presidential race. But in 2016, she almost certainly will not be Secretary of State anymore. \n \n (Clinton may also have been even more careful than usual to try to squelch political speculation about herself given the fact that New Zealand Prime Minister John Phillip Key accidentally introduced her yesterday as ""President Clinton"" before correcting himself.) \n \n In the interview Friday, Clinton also sought to defend President Barack Obama and put the Democrats\' losses in the midterms Tuesday in perspective. \n \n Asked if this was a bigger than normal midterm rout such as that her husband experienced in 1994, Clinton acknowledged, ""It\'s big,"" but added, ""but it is not out of the pattern of historical political elections."" \n \n ""But what I think the President made very clear was he made decisions which were essential for the well-being of the American people,"" Clinton continued. \n \n ""It may not have been popular to do what had to be done with the stimulus and some of the other actions he took on the economy, but many of us believe it prevented even worse economic consequences,"" Clinton said. ""So these things take a while for people to feel them, and I think the President recognizes that we’re just all going to have to redouble our efforts.""', '(CNN) In the first national telephone poll since Donald Trump earned rebukes from Republican leaders over his comments about Senator John McCain\'s military service, the real estate mogul has increased his support among GOP voters and now stands atop the race for the party\'s nomination. \n \n The new CNN/ORC Poll finds Trump at 18% support among Republicans, with former Florida governor Jeb Bush just behind at 15%, within the poll\'s margin of error. \n \n They are joined at the top of the pack by Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, with 10% support among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents who are registered to vote. Trump\'s backing has climbed 6 points since a late-June poll, while support for Bush and Walker has not changed significantly. \n \n None of the other 14 candidates tested in the new CNN/ORC survey earned double-digit support. \n \n Though Trump currently tops the race for the nomination, his advantage is by no means firm. A majority of Republican voters, 51%, say they see the field as wide open, and that it\'s too soon to say which candidate they will ultimately get behind. Among that group that see the contest as wide open, Bush has 14% support, while Trump has the backing of 13% and Walker stands at 9%. \n \n Trump does much better among those Republicans who say they\'ve narrowed it down to one or two candidates, 24% of that group backs him, 16% Bush and 12% Walker. \n \n Trump\'s popularity among Republican voters does not translate to the broader pool of registered voters. When tested in hypothetical general election matchups against top Democrats, he trails both frontrunner Hillary Clinton and upstart Senator Bernie Sanders by wide margins. Bush and Walker run just behind Clinton and about even with Sanders. \n \n Trump\'s unfavorability rating is sky high. Overall, 59% of all registered voters have an unfavorable opinion of Trump, though that dips to 42% among GOP voters. \n \n None of the other Republicans landing near the top of the field have such a negative image nationwide, though many remain little known. \n \n Clinton is the only candidate who is about as well-known as Trump, and while she is more well-liked than the developer, her favorability rating is net negative among registered voters nationally: 49% have an unfavorable view while 44% have a positive impression. \n \n Still, the poll suggests Republican voters haven\'t yet had their fill of Trump. A majority (52%) say they\'d like to see Trump continue his run for the GOP nomination, including nearly six in 10 conservatives, tea party supporters and white evangelicals. Even among those Republican voters who support someone other than Trump, 42% say they\'d like him to remain in the field. \n \n The Republican electorate is more enthusiastic about next year\'s vote than the Democrats are. The poll finds 46% of Democratic voters say they are extremely or very enthusiastic about voting for president next year, compared with 55% of Republican voters. But enthusiasm is down in both parties compared with June of 2011, when 61% of Republican registered voters and 55% of Democratic registered voters were that enthusiastic. \n \n In another positive sign for Trump\'s candidacy, among those Republicans who are enthusiastic about voting next year, Trump holds a larger edge over his competition: 22% say they would back him for their party\'s nomination, compared with 14% who back Bush and 12% behind Walker. \n \n Overall, about three-quarters of Republicans are satisfied with their choices, more so than in 2011 at this time (about two-thirds were satisfied then), but still, just 23% say they are ""very satisfied"" with the field. \n \n Meanwhile, an NBC News/Marist poll on Sunday showed Trump leading among New Hampshire GOP primary voters and narrowly trailing Walker in Iowa. \n \n Trump took 21% of the New Hampshire GOP primary vote, with Bush running second at 14%, while in Iowa Trump was at 17% and Walker at 19%, according to the NBC/Marist survey \n \n On the Democratic side, the CNN poll found Clinton remains the clear frontrunner, though Sanders has increased his support slightly since last month\'s poll. Clinton is backed by 56% of registered Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters, while Sanders has inched up to 19% from 15% in June. The rest of the field is about even with where they were before. \n \n The CNN/ORC International Poll was conducted July 22-25 among a random national sample of 1,017 adults, including 898 registered voters. Results for all registered voters have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. The registered voter sample included 419 Republicans and Republican-leaning independents as well as 392 Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents.']",3,"– A day after being accidentally introduced as ""President Clinton,"" Hillary seems to be taking pains to kill talk of a future run in New Zealand's media, reports Reuters.

Its mission as a company, the one-line overview that has informed the company since its foundation and is still the banner headline on its corporate website today, is to “organise the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful”. It strives to give you the best, most relevant results. And in this instance the third-best, most relevant result to the search query “are Jews… ” is a link to an article from stormfront.org, a neo-Nazi website. The fifth is a YouTube video: “Why the Jews are Evil. Why we are against them.” \n \n The sixth is from Yahoo Answers: “Why are Jews so evil?” The seventh result is: “Jews are demonic souls from a different world.” And the 10th is from jesus-is-saviour.com: “Judaism is Satanic!” \n \n There’s one result in the 10 that offers a different point of view. It’s a link to a rather dense, scholarly book review from thetabletmag.com, a Jewish magazine, with the unfortunately misleading headline: “Why Literally Everybody In the World Hates Jews.” \n \n I feel like I’ve fallen down a wormhole, entered some parallel universe where black is white, and good is bad. Though later, I think that perhaps what I’ve actually done is scraped the topsoil off the surface of 2016 and found one of the underground springs that has been quietly nurturing it. It’s been there all the time, of course. Just a few keystrokes away… on our laptops, our tablets, our phones. This isn’t a secret Nazi cell lurking in the shadows. It’s hiding in plain sight. \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest Are women… Google’s search results. \n \n Stories about fake news on Facebook have dominated certain sections of the press for weeks following the American presidential election, but arguably this is even more powerful, more insidious. Frank Pasquale, professor of law at the University of Maryland, and one of the leading academic figures calling for tech companies to be more open and transparent, calls the results “very profound, very troubling”. \n \n He came across a similar instance in 2006 when, “If you typed ‘Jew’ in Google, the first result was jewwatch.org. It was ‘look out for these awful Jews who are ruining your life’. And the Anti-Defamation League went after them and so they put an asterisk next to it which said: ‘These search results may be disturbing but this is an automated process.’ But what you’re showing – and I’m very glad you are documenting it and screenshotting it – is that despite the fact they have vastly researched this problem, it has gotten vastly worse.” \n \n And ordering of search results does influence people, says Martin Moore, director of the Centre for the Study of Media, Communication and Power at King’s College, London, who has written at length on the impact of the big tech companies on our civic and political spheres. “There’s large-scale, statistically significant research into the impact of search results on political views. And the way in which you see the results and the types of results you see on the page necessarily has an impact on your perspective.” Fake news, he says, has simply “revealed a much bigger problem. These companies are so powerful and so committed to disruption. They thought they were disrupting politics but in a positive way. They hadn’t thought about the downsides. These tools offer remarkable empowerment, but there’s a dark side to it. It enables people to do very cynical, damaging things.” \n \n Google is knowledge. It’s where you go to find things out. And evil Jews are just the start of it. There are also evil women. I didn’t go looking for them either. This is what I type: “a-r-e w-o-m-e-n”. And Google offers me just two choices, the first of which is: “Are women evil?” I press return. Yes, they are. Every one of the 10 results “confirms” that they are, including the top one, from a site called sheddingoftheego.com, which is boxed out and highlighted: “Every woman has some degree of prostitute in her. Every woman has a little evil in her… Women don’t love men, they love what they can do for them. It is within reason to say women feel attraction but they cannot love men.” \n \n Next I type: “a-r-e m-u-s-l-i-m-s”. And Google suggests I should ask: “Are Muslims bad?” And here’s what I find out: yes, they are. That’s what the top result says and six of the others. Without typing anything else, simply putting the cursor in the search box, Google offers me two new searches and I go for the first, “Islam is bad for society”. In the next list of suggestions, I’m offered: “Islam must be destroyed.” \n \n This is the equivalent of going into a library and asking a librarian about Judaism and being handed 10 books of hate Danny Sullivan \n \n Jews are evil. Muslims need to be eradicated. And Hitler? Do you want to know about Hitler? Let’s Google it. “Was Hitler bad?” I type. And here’s Google’s top result: “10 Reasons Why Hitler Was One Of The Good Guys” I click on the link: “He never wanted to kill any Jews”; “he cared about conditions for Jews in the work camps”; “he implemented social and cultural reform.” Eight out of the other 10 search results agree: Hitler really wasn’t that bad. \n \n A few days later, I talk to Danny Sullivan, the founding editor of SearchEngineLand.com. He’s been recommended to me by several academics as one of the most knowledgeable experts on search. Am I just being naive, I ask him? Should I have known this was out there? “No, you’re not being naive,” he says. “This is awful. It’s horrible. It’s the equivalent of going into a library and asking a librarian about Judaism and being handed 10 books of hate. Google is doing a horrible, horrible job of delivering answers here. It can and should do better.” \n \n He’s surprised too. “I thought they stopped offering autocomplete suggestions for religions in 2011.” And then he types “are women” into his own computer. “Good lord! That answer at the top. It’s a featured result. It’s called a “direct answer”. This is supposed to be indisputable. It’s Google’s highest endorsement.” That every women has some degree of prostitute in her? “Yes. This is Google’s algorithm going terribly wrong.” \n \n I contacted Google about its seemingly malfunctioning autocomplete suggestions and received the following response: “Our search results are a reflection of the content across the web. This means that sometimes unpleasant portrayals of sensitive subject matter online can affect what search results appear for a given query. These results don’t reflect Google’s own opinions or beliefs – as a company, we strongly value a diversity of perspectives, ideas and cultures.” \n \n Google isn’t just a search engine, of course. Search was the foundation of the company but that was just the beginning. Alphabet, Google’s parent company, now has the greatest concentration of artificial intelligence experts in the world. It is expanding into healthcare, transportation, energy. It’s able to attract the world’s top computer scientists, physicists and engineers. It’s bought hundreds of start-ups, including Calico, whose stated mission is to “cure death” and DeepMind, which aims to “solve intelligence”. \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin in 2002. Photograph: Michael Grecco/Getty Images \n \n And 20 years ago it didn’t even exist. When Tony Blair became prime minister, it wasn’t possible to Google him: the search engine had yet to be invented. The company was only founded in 1998 and Facebook didn’t appear until 2004. Google’s founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page are still only 43. Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook is 32. Everything they’ve done, the world they’ve remade, has been done in the blink of an eye. \n \n But it seems the implications about the power and reach of these companies is only now seeping into the public consciousness. I ask Rebecca MacKinnon, director of the Ranking Digital Rights project at the New America Foundation, whether it was the recent furore over fake news that woke people up to the danger of ceding our rights as citizens to corporations. “It’s kind of weird right now,” she says, “because people are finally saying, ‘Gee, Facebook and Google really have a lot of power’ like it’s this big revelation. And it’s like, ‘D’oh.’” \n \n MacKinnon has a particular expertise in how authoritarian governments adapt to the internet and bend it to their purposes. “China and Russia are a cautionary tale for us. I think what happens is that it goes back and forth. So during the Arab spring, it seemed like the good guys were further ahead. And now it seems like the bad guys are. Pro-democracy activists are using the internet more than ever but at the same time, the adversary has gotten so much more skilled.” \n \n Last week Jonathan Albright, an assistant professor of communications at Elon University in North Carolina, published the first detailed research on how rightwing websites had spread their message. “I took a list of these fake news sites that was circulating, I had an initial list of 306 of them and I used a tool – like the one Google uses – to scrape them for links and then I mapped them. So I looked at where the links went – into YouTube and Facebook, and between each other, millions of them… and I just couldn’t believe what I was seeing. \n \n “They have created a web that is bleeding through on to our web. This isn’t a conspiracy. There isn’t one person who’s created this. It’s a vast system of hundreds of different sites that are using all the same tricks that all websites use. They’re sending out thousands of links to other sites and together this has created a vast satellite system of rightwing news and propaganda that has completely surrounded the mainstream media system.” \n \n He found 23,000 pages and 1.3m hyperlinks. “And Facebook is just the amplification device. When you look at it in 3D, it actually looks like a virus. And Facebook was just one of the hosts for the virus that helps it spread faster. You can see the New York Times in there and the Washington Post and then you can see how there’s a vast, vast network surrounding them. The best way of describing it is as an ecosystem. This really goes way beyond individual sites or individual stories. What this map shows is the distribution network and you can see that it’s surrounding and actually choking the mainstream news ecosystem.” \n \n Like a cancer? “Like an organism that is growing and getting stronger all the time.” \n \n Charlie Beckett, a professor in the school of media and communications at LSE, tells me: “We’ve been arguing for some time now that plurality of news media is good. Diversity is good. Critiquing the mainstream media is good. But now… it’s gone wildly out of control. What Jonathan Albright’s research has shown is that this isn’t a byproduct of the internet. And it’s not even being done for commercial reasons. It’s motivated by ideology, by people who are quite deliberately trying to destabilise the internet.” \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest A spatial map of the rightwing fake news ecosystem. Jonathan Albright, assistant professor of communications at Elon University, North Carolina, “scraped” 300 fake news sites (the dark shapes on this map) to reveal the 1.3m hyperlinks that connect them together and link them into the mainstream news ecosystem. Here, Albright shows it is a “vast satellite system of rightwing news and propaganda that has completely surrounded the mainstream media system”. Photograph: Jonathan Albright \n \n Albright’s map also provides a clue to understanding the Google search results I found. What these rightwing news sites have done, he explains, is what most commercial websites try to do. They try to find the tricks that will move them up Google’s PageRank system. They try and “game” the algorithm. And what his map shows is how well they’re doing that. \n \n That’s what my searches are showing too. That the right has colonised the digital space around these subjects – Muslims, women, Jews, the Holocaust, black people – far more effectively than the liberal left. \n \n “It’s an information war,” says Albright. “That’s what I keep coming back to.” \n \n But it’s where it goes from here that’s truly frightening. I ask him how it can be stopped. “I don’t know. I’m not sure it can be. It’s a network. It’s far more powerful than any one actor.” \n \n So, it’s almost got a life of its own? “Yes, and it’s learning. Every day, it’s getting stronger.” \n \n The more people who search for information about Jews, the more people will see links to hate sites, and the more they click on those links (very few people click on to the second page of results) the more traffic the sites will get, the more links they will accrue and the more authoritative they will appear. This is an entirely circular knowledge economy that has only one outcome: an amplification of the message. Jews are evil. Women are evil. Islam must be destroyed. Hitler was one of the good guys. \n \n Fake news and a 400-year-old problem: we need to resolve the ‘post-truth’ crisis Read more \n \n And the constellation of websites that Albright found – a sort of shadow internet – has another function. More than just spreading rightwing ideology, they are being used to track and monitor and influence anyone who comes across their content. “I scraped the trackers on these sites and I was absolutely dumbfounded. Every time someone likes one of these posts on Facebook or visits one of these websites, the scripts are then following you around the web. And this enables data-mining and influencing companies like Cambridge Analytica to precisely target individuals, to follow them around the web, and to send them highly personalised political messages. This is a propaganda machine. It’s targeting people individually to recruit them to an idea. It’s a level of social engineering that I’ve never seen before. They’re capturing people and then keeping them on an emotional leash and never letting them go.” \n \n Cambridge Analytica, an American-owned company based in London, was employed by both the Vote Leave campaign and the Trump campaign. Dominic Cummings, the campaign director of Vote Leave, has made few public announcements since the Brexit referendum but he did say this: “If you want to make big improvements in communication, my advice is – hire physicists.” \n \n Steve Bannon, founder of Breitbart News and the newly appointed chief strategist to Trump, is on Cambridge Analytica’s board and it has emerged that the company is in talks to undertake political messaging work for the Trump administration. It claims to have built psychological profiles using 5,000 separate pieces of data on 220 million American voters. It knows their quirks and nuances and daily habits and can target them individually. \n \n “They were using 40-50,000 different variants of ad every day that were continuously measuring responses and then adapting and evolving based on that response,” says Martin Moore of Kings College. Because they have so much data on individuals and they use such phenomenally powerful distribution networks, they allow campaigns to bypass a lot of existing laws. \n \n “It’s all done completely opaquely and they can spend as much money as they like on particular locations because you can focus on a five-mile radius or even a single demographic. Fake news is important but it’s only one part of it. These companies have found a way of transgressing 150 years of legislation that we’ve developed to make elections fair and open.” \n \n Did such micro-targeted propaganda – currently legal – swing the Brexit vote? We have no way of knowing. Did the same methods used by Cambridge Analytica help Trump to victory? Again, we have no way of knowing. This is all happening in complete darkness. We have no way of knowing how our personal data is being mined and used to influence us. We don’t realise that the Facebook page we are looking at, the Google page, the ads that we are seeing, the search results we are using, are all being personalised to us. We don’t see it because we have nothing to compare it to. And it is not being monitored or recorded. It is not being regulated. We are inside a machine and we simply have no way of seeing the controls. Most of the time, we don’t even realise that there are controls. \n \n Facebook and Google move to kick fake news sites off their ad networks Read more \n \n Rebecca MacKinnon says that most of us consider the internet to be like “the air that we breathe and the water that we drink”. It surrounds us. We use it. And we don’t question it. “But this is not a natural landscape. Programmers and executives and editors and designers, they make this landscape. They are human beings and they all make choices.” \n \n But we don’t know what choices they are making. Neither Google or Facebook make their algorithms public. Why did my Google search return nine out of 10 search results that claim Jews are evil? We don’t know and we have no way of knowing. Their systems are what Frank Pasquale describes as “black boxes”. He calls Google and Facebook “a terrifying duopoly of power” and has been leading a growing movement of academics who are calling for “algorithmic accountability”. “We need to have regular audits of these systems,” he says. “We need people in these companies to be accountable. In the US, under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, every company has to have a spokesman you can reach. And this is what needs to happen. They need to respond to complaints about hate speech, about bias.” \n \n Is bias built into the system? Does it affect the kind of results that I was seeing? “There’s all sorts of bias about what counts as a legitimate source of information and how that’s weighted. There’s enormous commercial bias. And when you look at the personnel, they are young, white and perhaps Asian, but not black or Hispanic and they are overwhelmingly men. The worldview of young wealthy white men informs all these judgments.” \n \n Later, I speak to Robert Epstein, a research psychologist at the American Institute for Behavioural Research and Technology, and the author of the study that Martin Moore told me about (and that Google has publicly criticised), showing how search-rank results affect voting patterns. On the other end of the phone, he repeats one of the searches I did. He types “do blacks…” into Google. \n \n “Look at that. I haven’t even hit a button and it’s automatically populated the page with answers to the query: ‘Do blacks commit more crimes?’ And look, I could have been going to ask all sorts of questions. ‘Do blacks excel at sports’, or anything. And it’s only given me two choices and these aren’t simply search-based or the most searched terms right now. Google used to use that but now they use an algorithm that looks at other things. Now, let me look at Bing and Yahoo. I’m on Yahoo and I have 10 suggestions, not one of which is ‘Do black people commit more crime?’ \n \n “And people don’t question this. Google isn’t just offering a suggestion. This is a negative suggestion and we know that negative suggestions depending on lots of things can draw between five and 15 more clicks. And this all programmed. And it could be programmed differently.” \n \n What Epstein’s work has shown is that the contents of a page of search results can influence people’s views and opinions. The type and order of search rankings was shown to influence voters in India in double-blind trials. There were similar results relating to the search suggestions you are offered. \n \n “The general public are completely in the dark about very fundamental issues regarding online search and influence. We are talking about the most powerful mind-control machine ever invented in the history of the human race. And people don’t even notice it.” \n \n Good luck in making Google reveal its algorithm | John Naughton Read more \n \n Damien Tambini, an associate professor at the London School of Economics, who focuses on media regulation, says that we lack any sort of framework to deal with the potential impact of these companies on the democratic process. “We have structures that deal with powerful media corporations. We have competition laws. But these companies are not being held responsible. There are no powers to get Google or Facebook to disclose anything. There’s an editorial function to Google and Facebook but it’s being done by sophisticated algorithms. They say it’s machines not editors. But that’s simply a mechanised editorial function.” \n \n And the companies, says John Naughton, the Observer columnist and a senior research fellow at Cambridge University, are terrified of acquiring editorial responsibilities they don’t want. “Though they can and regularly do tweak the results in all sorts of ways.” \n \n Certainly the results about Google on Google don’t seem entirely neutral. Google “Is Google racist?” and the featured result – the Google answer boxed out at the top of the page – is quite clear: no. It is not. \n \n Google and Facebook are thinking long term. They have the resources, money and ambition to do whatever they want John Naughton \n \n But the enormity and complexity of having two global companies of a kind we have never seen before influencing so many areas of our lives is such, says Naughton, that “we don’t even have the mental apparatus to even know what the problems are”. \n \n And this is especially true of the future. Google and Facebook are at the forefront of AI. They are going to own the future. And the rest of us can barely start to frame the sorts of questions we ought to be asking. “Politicians don’t think long term. And corporations don’t think long term because they’re focused on the next quarterly results and that’s what makes Google and Facebook interesting and different. They are absolutely thinking long term. They have the resources, the money, and the ambition to do whatever they want. \n \n “They want to digitise every book in the world: they do it. They want to build a self-driving car: they do it. The fact that people are reading about these fake news stories and realising that this could have an effect on politics and elections, it’s like, ‘Which planet have you been living on?’ For Christ’s sake, this is obvious.” \n \n “The internet is among the few things that humans have built that they don’t understand.” It is “the largest experiment involving anarchy in history. Hundreds of millions of people are, each minute, creating and consuming an untold amount of digital content in an online world that is not truly bound by terrestrial laws.” The internet as a lawless anarchic state? A massive human experiment with no checks and balances and untold potential consequences? What kind of digital doom-mongerer would say such a thing? Step forward, Eric Schmidt – Google’s chairman. They are the first lines of the book, The New Digital Age, that he wrote with Jared Cohen. \n \n We don’t understand it. It is not bound by terrestrial laws. And it’s in the hands of two massive, all-powerful corporations. It’s their experiment, not ours. The technology that was supposed to set us free may well have helped Trump to power, or covertly helped swing votes for Brexit. It has created a vast network of propaganda that has encroached like a cancer across the entire internet. This is a technology that has enabled the likes of Cambridge Analytica to create political messages uniquely tailored to you. They understand your emotional responses and how to trigger them. They know your likes, dislikes, where you live, what you eat, what makes you laugh, what makes you cry. \n \n And what next? Rebecca MacKinnon’s research has shown how authoritarian regimes reshape the internet for their own purposes. Is that what’s going to happen with Silicon Valley and Trump? As Martin Moore points out, the president-elect claimed that Apple chief executive Tim Cook called to congratulate him soon after his election victory. “And there will undoubtedly be be pressure on them to collaborate,” says Moore. \n \n Journalism is failing in the face of such change and is only going to fail further. New platforms have put a bomb under the financial model – advertising – resources are shrinking, traffic is increasingly dependent on them, and publishers have no access, no insight at all, into what these platforms are doing in their headquarters, their labs. And now they are moving beyond the digital world into the physical. The next frontiers are healthcare, transportation, energy. And just as Google is a near-monopoly for search, its ambition to own and control the physical infrastructure of our lives is what’s coming next. It already owns our data and with it our identity. What will it mean when it moves into all the other areas of our lives? \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg: still only 32 years of age. Photograph: Mariana Bazo/Reuters \n \n “At the moment, there’s a distance when you Google ‘Jews are’ and get ‘Jews are evil’,” says Julia Powles, a researcher at Cambridge on technology and law. “But when you move into the physical realm, and these concepts become part of the tools being deployed when you navigate around your city or influence how people are employed, I think that has really pernicious consequences.” \n \n Powles is shortly to publish a paper looking at DeepMind’s relationship with the NHS. “A year ago, 2 million Londoners’ NHS health records were handed over to DeepMind. And there was complete silence from politicians, from regulators, from anyone in a position of power. This is a company without any healthcare experience being given unprecedented access into the NHS and it took seven months to even know that they had the data. And that took investigative journalism to find it out.” \n \n The headline was that DeepMind was going to work with the NHS to develop an app that would provide early warning for sufferers of kidney disease. And it is, but DeepMind’s ambitions – “to solve intelligence” – goes way beyond that. The entire history of 2 million NHS patients is, for artificial intelligence researchers, a treasure trove. And, their entry into the NHS – providing useful services in exchange for our personal data – is another massive step in their power and influence in every part of our lives. \n \n Because the stage beyond search is prediction. Google wants to know what you want before you know yourself. “That’s the next stage,” says Martin Moore. “We talk about the omniscience of these tech giants, but that omniscience takes a huge step forward again if they are able to predict. And that’s where they want to go. To predict diseases in health. It’s really, really problematic.” \n \n For the nearly 20 years that Google has been in existence, our view of the company has been inflected by the youth and liberal outlook of its founders. Ditto Facebook, whose mission, Zuckberg said, was not to be “a company. It was built to accomplish a social mission to make the world more open and connected.” \n \n The more we argue with them, the more they know about us. It all feeds into a circular system Jonathan Albright \n \n It would be interesting to know how he thinks that’s working out. Donald Trump is connecting through exactly the same technology platforms that supposedly helped fuel the Arab spring; connecting to racists and xenophobes. And Facebook and Google are amplifying and spreading that message. And us too – the mainstream media. Our outrage is just another node on Jonathan Albright’s data map. \n \n “The more we argue with them, the more they know about us,” he says. “It all feeds into a circular system. What we’re seeing here is new era of network propaganda.” \n \n We are all points on that map. And our complicity, our credulity, being consumers not concerned citizens, is an essential part of that process. And what happens next is down to us. “I would say that everybody has been really naive and we need to reset ourselves to a much more cynical place and proceed on that basis,” is Rebecca MacKinnon’s advice. “There is no doubt that where we are now is a very bad place. But it’s we as a society who have jointly created this problem. And if we want to get to a better place, when it comes to having an information ecosystem that serves human rights and democracy instead of destroying it, we have to share responsibility for that.” \n \n Are Jews evil? How do you want that question answered? This is our internet. Not Google’s. Not Facebook’s. Not rightwing propagandists. And we’re the only ones who can reclaim it.']",1,"– Robert De Niro is set to play NFL coach Vince Lombardi, but—in more casting news from a different film—the role of Captain America is still up for grabs.

Within a week, we created this website and posted an initial, detailed critique of the analysis and conclusions of those reports. Since then, independent critiques of the Wells and Exponent Reports have multiplied and scientists across the country who examined the PSI and weather data have concluded that science fully explains the PSI measurements found in the Wells Report. We have posted a collection of those positions on this website and they remain available for review here. Many thoughtful people have, with further information and consideration, revised their initial impressions, which were largely based on false information leaked by League personnel and on the interpretations put on ambiguous, at best, facts by the League and its lawyers. \n \n The League, however, in pursuing its legal strategies, has escalated its defense of the Wells Report and its conclusions, often at the expense of accuracy. In addition, to preserve the public impressions of the Wells Report and the League’s pursuit of Tom Brady, the League rejected the suggestion of measuring PSI during every game in the 2015 season and publishing the results. Instead, it chose to perform “random spot checks” during the season and then refused to release the results of those checks, no doubt because doing so would confirm that there was nothing unusual about footballs falling below regulation in cold weather. \n \n Many of the flaws in the Wells and Exponent Reports have been exposed. The detailed scientific critiques of the Exponent Report have been explored by experts. But many of the dubious bases for the Wells Report remain unexplored. For these reasons, we post below our counsel Daniel L. Goldberg’s further review of the circumstances that led to the League’s investigation and the League’s bases for continuing its pursuit of Tom Brady and the discipline imposed on the Patriots. We hope that it will induce added examination by those who are interested and allow them to reach their own conclusions regarding this matter and how the PSI of the footballs at the AFC Championship Game in January 2015 came to be under 12.5 PSI. \n \n The Background \n \n The day before the AFC Championship Game on Jan. 18, 2015, the general manager of the Indianapolis Colts sent an email to the League raising concerns about the air pressure of game balls used by the New England Patriots. He did not ask the League to take any steps before the game to keep control of the game balls the next day or do anything else to ensure that the game balls would meet regulation. Rather, he suggested that the game balls used by the Patriots be checked “as the game goes on.” In response, the League took no precautionary steps in advance of the game and did not notify the Patriots of the concerns. Nor did the League consider the potential impact of weather on PSI, because the League was completely unaware of such impact. When League personnel gauged footballs at halftime, it was the first time in the League’s 95 year history they had done so. They found that the PSI levels of the Patriots footballs used in the first half had fallen below the range prescribed by the Official Rules of the NFL. Unfortunately, the League drew conclusions about the reasons for those PSI levels without taking into account the effect of weather or the Ideal Gas Law, a scientific equation that explains that for every drop in temperature there will be a corresponding, and calculable, drop in PSI. \n \n The data collected that night showed expected drops in PSI. Unfortunately for all involved, the League leaked inaccurate PSI numbers to ESPN shortly after the AFC Championship Game. The leaked misinformation sparked a firestorm of speculation and a presumption of guilt that the Patriots and Tom Brady were forced to address. A recent ESPN public editor column addressed the League’s leak. The accurate data would not be revealed by the League until over 15 weeks later, on May 6, 2015, when the Wells Report was made public. In the 10 months since, the Wells Report and the accompanying report by Exponent, the scientific consultants hired by the League’s lawyers (despite Exponent’s history of questionable findings, including that second-hand smoke causes no health risks), have been widely criticized by journalists, professors, lawyers and countless others. For example, Malcolm Gladwell, the well-known author of “The Tipping Point,” has referred to the Wells Report as “astonishing garbage.” The scientific flaws of Exponent’s analysis have received extensive scrutiny by independent scientists, engineers and mathematicians, who have no link to any party but are interested in the science that formed the foundation of the Wells Report. Once these independent minds had a chance to review the true data — not the erroneous data leaked by the League at the outset — and match it up with science, the scientific explanation of the PSI of the footballs on Jan. 18 became undeniably clear and completely contradicted the findings in the flawed Wells and Exponent Reports. \n \n Rule 2 in the NFL’s Official Rule Book prescribes a range of 12.5 to 13.5 PSI for footballs used in games. This PSI range has been in place for decades. It did not derive from any competitive concerns over air pressure. There has never been a study of whether football air pressure has any impact on game play or whether minor differences in PSI are even discernible to the touch. Rule 2 was apparently based on a recommendation by the manufacturer of the footballs, much like a tire manufacturer provides consumers with a suggested PSI for its tires. In the history of the NFL, prior to January of 2015, the League never paid much attention to what happens to the PSI of footballs during a game, and the PSI of footballs was never measured during or after any game. \n \n Pursuant to Rule 2, footballs are gauged pre-game in the Officials’ Locker Room to check that they are in the permissible PSI range. Even if the footballs measure pre-game at the high end of the range at 13.5 PSI in a 72°F Officials’ Locker Room, due solely to temperature changes, they will be below regulation during the game if the temperature on the field is below 52°F. It is also a scientific fact that footballs that are gauged pre-game at the low end of the range, at 12.5 PSI, will be below regulation if the temperature on the field is even slightly below the temperature in the Officials’ Locker Room. Troy Vincent, the League’s top football operations official, who was present at halftime, testified in Tom Brady’s appeal hearing that he had “no idea” that footballs “were automatically going to lose pressure if it was cold outside compared to how warm it was inside.” He had no familiarity with the Ideal Gas Law. He was not alone. Apparently no game official or anyone at the League had any understanding about the impact of temperature changes on PSI. What was initially seen as scandalous (and, remarkably, continues to be characterized that way by the League) was that the Patriots’ footballs, which measured pre-game at 12.5 or 12.6 PSI, had fallen below regulation after being used in the first half. This circumstance is now generally understood to reflect a basic law of nature, since the 2014 AFC Championship Game was played at an outdoor temperature of 48°F and the footballs had measured at 12.5 or 12.6 PSI in the 72°F Officials’ Locker Room prior to the game. The reality is that every NFL game ever played in temperatures under 50°F likely involved use of under-inflated footballs if they were in the 12.5 to 13.5 PSI range when checked pre-game. The Patriots’ footballs were also wet, having been used in the rain, and it is a scientific fact that wet conditions also affect PSI. \n \n Given the total lack of understanding about how temperature and weather impact the PSI in footballs, accusations of cheating by the Patriots were already being made by League officials during the second half of the AFC Championship Game. Less than 24 hours later, this prejudgment of wrongdoing was officially adopted by the League. In this letter from League Official Dave Gardi to the Patriots the day after the game, Mr. Gardi advised the Patriots that the League had made a “preliminary finding” that there may have been tampering with the footballs and the League was launching an investigation of the team. The League still had no understanding of the Ideal Gas Law when it sent this letter. \n \n Despite League personnel having recorded the halftime PSI measurements, both Mr. Gardi’s letter to the Patriots and the information leaked by League sources contained significantly inaccurate PSI information, exaggerating the loss of PSI in the Patriots’ footballs. Both also inaccurately stated that, in contrast to the Patriots’ footballs, each of the Colts’ footballs had measured within the permissible PSI range. In actuality, three of the four Colts’ footballs, which started at or above 13.0 PSI, measured below regulation on the gauge that the Wells Report concluded was the proper gauge to consider. Had the actual PSI halftime measurements been released in the days following the game, there would have been a quick scientific assessment and explanation of the situation. Instead, the accurate information was inexplicably kept from the public (and the Patriots) by the League and the League’s lawyers for months. The false information was allowed to fester, creating largely inalterable and inaccurate public perceptions of what happened. \n \n As mentioned above, since the release of the Wells Report, numerous independent scientists have studied the data. Every scientist known to have examined this data since has concluded that the halftime PSI of the Patriots’ footballs was consistent with the Ideal Gas Law. (See, for example, http://sports.yahoo.com/news/1-year-after-deflate-gate-ballooned–science-shows-shame-of-it-all-073316233.html). There has also been widespread independent criticism of Exponent’s methodologies and conclusions. What has been largely overlooked is that even Exponent, the NFL’s paid consultant, found that the Patriots’ halftime PSI numbers were fully explainable by the Ideal Gas Law depending on when, during halftime, those footballs were measured. According to Exponent, if the 11 Patriots footballs were measured, on average, within the first two minutes of halftime, their PSI measurements were fully explained by the Ideal Gas Law. (See Exponent Report at pp. XIII, 54, and 67). Other scientists, taking into account that the Patriots’ footballs were wet, causing them to warm up more slowly, have put that time frame at over four minutes. \n \n The Myths \n \n Myth #1: The NFL’s lawyers told Exponent to assume it took up to 9 minutes of halftime to complete the initial gauging of 11 Patriots’ footballs. \n \n As the Wells Report concedes, “the analysis of the data is ultimately dependent on assumptions and information that is uncertain” (Wells Report at p. 12), and that “varying the applicable assumptions can have a material impact on the ultimate conclusions” (Wells Report at p. 13). Exponent’s conclusion that there was an available scientific explanation for the halftime PSI readings was undercut not by facts or science, but by assumptions given to Exponent by the NFL’s lawyers regarding the timing of events at halftime. \n \n According to the NFL’s lawyers, just the gauging of the 11 Patriots footballs took up to 9 minutes: 2 to 4 minutes to start to gauge them and an added 4 to 5 minutes to complete the gauging. No records were kept of the timing of the halftime PSI measurements. Seven League officials witnessed the halftime events, but no interviews recounted in the Wells Report state what any witness said about when the gauging of the Patriots’ footballs began, how long it took, or when it ended. No simulations were done to see how long it might have taken to start and complete the gauging. The information in the Wells Report from the interviews of seven League and Game Officials present at halftime was that: (i) the first thing the Officials did upon entering the Officials’ Locker Room was to gauge 11 Patriots’ footballs; (ii) the Colts’ footballs were gauged sometime thereafter; (iii) only four Colts’ footballs were measured because the Officials “were running out of time before the start of the second half” (Wells Report at p. 7); and (iv) halftime lasted 13.5 minutes. \n \n Information presented in the Wells Report reflects that the two minute average for measuring the Patriots’ footballs is very likely what happened. The officials hurried into the Officials’ Locker Room at halftime with a plan to gauge all of the Patriots’ and Colts’ footballs. They knew that time was limited and that they needed to act quickly. It takes two to three seconds to gauge a football, as confirmed by the highly-viewed video of a Game Official gauging a football before a 2013 Chicago Bears game, which video was part of a Peter King MMQB report. Further, it is a basic premise of the Wells Report (and of an Exponent study that appears as Appendix 2 to the Exponent Report) that one person, acting alone, can complete the following in less than 100 seconds: (i) enter a room; (ii) lock the door; (iii) take 12 footballs out of a bag; (iv) stick a needle in each of those footballs to remove air; (v) place them back into the bag; (vi) unlock and open the door; and (vii) leave the room. If all that can be completed by one person in roughly 1 minute and 40 seconds, it is reasonable to conclude Messrs. Blakeman and Prioleau could begin to gauge the Patriots’ footballs less than a minute into halftime and complete the gauging in two minutes — i.e., taking 5 seconds for each man to gauge each football. That timing would support Exponent’s conclusion that science can fully explain the PSI of the Patriots’ footballs. \n \n Under the timing assumptions of Myth #1, the Officials would not have finished their initial gauging of the 11 Patriots’ footballs until up to nine minutes into halftime. That would have left less than five minutes to re-inflate and re-gauge them and, as was their intent (see Wells Report footnote 35), to gauge all of the Colts’ footballs. Using a pump to re-inflate each of the 11 footballs, and then using a gauge to ensure each was within the range of Rule 2, would logically take as long or longer than the four to five minutes the NFL’s lawyers assumed it took just to gauge the 11 footballs in the first instance. If the NFL’s lawyers’ assumptions about timing were accurate, it would mean the Officials could not have completed all these actions, let alone gauging even four Colts’ footballs, during the 13.5 minutes of halftime. \n \n The League’s lawyers have refused to release the interview notes of the seven League witnesses to halftime gauging. They have also refused to release their communications with Exponent. There is no privilege or confidentiality around any of these communications — they were not attorney-client communications and they were not attorney “work product” (a term used to refer to materials prepared by lawyers in anticipation of litigation). These communications were made as part of what was supposed to be a transparent, independent fact-finding mission — not a mission to prepare for litigation. The NFL’s lawyers’ claim of a “work product” privilege for these interview notes is most curious. Unless there was a prejudgment that the investigation would find violations — the only circumstance that might lead to anticipated future litigation — there would be no reason at the time of the interviews to anticipate any litigation. In all events, the League has the right to waive any claims of privilege, and yet has held tight to this critical information. \n \n Myth #2: The Colts’ footballs were gauged immediately after the Patriots’ footballs were gauged, and before the Patriots’ footballs were re-inflated and re-gauged. The NFL’s lawyers told Exponent to assume that the Colts’ footballs were gauged before the Patriots’ footballs were re-inflated, yet the Wells Report does not describe what any of the seven League witnesses present at halftime actually said regarding the sequence of these events. The only relevant information recounted in the Wells Report is that: (i) only four Colts footballs were measured at halftime because the Officials were running out of time as halftime was ending; and (ii) Mr. Blakeman and Mr. Prioleau switched gauges at some point after they finished measuring the Patriots’ footballs and before they started measuring the Colts’ footballs. These facts strongly suggest that the Colts footballs were measured only after the Patriots’ footballs were re-inflated and re-gauged, and as the 13.5 minute halftime was ending. That would explain why, despite the officials’ plan to gauge all the footballs of both teams at halftime, they stopped after only getting to four of the Colts’ footballs. \n \n The most logical sequence of events would also mean the officials likely started to gauge the four Colts’ footballs at least 11 minutes into halftime, after they had warmed up and their PSI had naturally started to return to their original pregame air pressure. This additional time in the warm room fully explains why the Colts’ footballs appeared to lose less PSI than the Patriots’ footballs. However, despite admitted “uncertainty” about the sequence of these events, Exponent was told by the NFL’s lawyers to assume that the gauging of the Colts’ footballs followed immediately after the Patriots’ footballs were gauged and before the re-inflation and re-gauging of the Patriots’ footballs. (Exponent Report at p. 2). All of Exponent’s testing then relied on this instruction — every simulation done by Exponent was based on starting the gauging of the four Colts’ footballs less than 10 minutes into halftime. This assumed timing was so illogical that, as Exponent admitted, to account for it, Exponent had to manipulate the undisputed 72°F temperature of the Official’s Locker Room down to 67°F in some of its calculations. (See Exponent Report at p. 52). As numerous independent scientists have shown, using the more likely sequence of halftime events eliminates any mystery about why Colts’ footballs appeared to lose less PSI than the Patriots’ footballs. \n \n Myth #3: The Patriots’ footballs were not sufficiently wet to affect their PSI. This is another unfounded assumption the NFL’s lawyers told Exponent to make. The Patriots’ footballs measured at halftime were wet from being used in the rain for an extended period during the first half, and they had not been kept in plastic bags on the sidelines (as had the Colts’ footballs). Exponent correctly noted that the Patriots’ footballs were wet (Exponent Report at p. XIII) and that if footballs are wet, it slows the warming process and hence slows how quickly the PSI returns to its pre-game PSI levels. The wet condition of the footballs would impact the halftime PSI of the Patriots’ footballs and extend the two-minute average that Exponent concluded would provide a scientific explanation. )See Professor John Leonard’s transient analysis found here.) However, as stated in the Exponent Report (see p. 55), the NFL’s lawyers instructed Exponent to assume that the footballs were not sufficiently wet for these purposes. \n \n Myth #4: The two gauges used at halftime were the Logo and Non-Logo gauges brought to the Game by Referee Walt Anderson. The Wells Report assumes as fact that Anderson’s personal gauges were used at halftime, whereas the evidence suggests otherwise: (i) as recounted in a footnote buried in the Wells Report (footnote 37), neither Mr. Blakeman nor Mr. Prioleau recalled what gauge each used at halftime; (ii) Mr. Farley, the note-keeper at halftime, wrote down that one of the gauges used at halftime was the gauge brought to the Officials’ Locker Room pre-game by the Patriots (see Wells Report footnote 38); and (iii) the Exponent tests of the Logo and Non-Logo gauges showed they often varied from each other by as much as 0.75 PSI (Exponent Report at p. 29), while the two gauges used at halftime never varied by more than 0.45 PSI (Wells Report at p. 67). This strongly suggests that one of the two gauges used at halftime was actually the Patriots’ gauge — a gauge that was apparently used by League official James Daniel before halftime to measure the intercepted football (Wells Report footnote 36), but was never tested by Exponent. \n \n Myth #5: Referee Anderson used the Non-Logo gauge pre-game. Despite Mr. Anderson’s “best recollection” that he used the Logo gauge pre-game, the NFL’s lawyers rejected it. To determine PSI changes from pre-game to halftime, one would have to use the same gauge at halftime that was used by Referee Anderson pre-game, since gauges vary from each other in accuracy. The Logo gauge, at halftime, did not show as much PSI loss as did the Non-Logo gauge, so knowing which gauge was actually used before the game is critical. Referee Anderson expressed no uncertainty about which gauge he had used pre-game. This was not his first time gauging footballs pre-game — he was a very experienced Referee and likely had a longstanding routine as to which of his two gauges he used and which was the backup. He knew the gauges well. He had used one of the gauges for three or four years and had the other one for at least one year. He clearly knew the differences between them. His “best recollection” was that he used the Logo gauge before the game. One can imagine a line of questions asked by lawyers during his interview that could lead him to say it was “certainly possible” that his best memory might be wrong. But it is a fundamental flaw to rely on matters that are merely “certainly possible” as the foundation for concluding what is “more likely than not,” the required standard of proof of the investigation. Exponent then went to great lengths to try to bolster the lawyers’ rejection of Mr. Anderson’s best recollection of which gauge he used pre-game, but those efforts have been completely discredited by every subsequent scientific review. \n \n Myth #6: The PSI measurements pre-game and at halftime were scientifically reliable enough to base definitive conclusions on them. Referee Anderson measured 48 footballs pre-game in the Officials’ Locker Room with the footballs spread out around him on the floor. His mission was simply to make sure they were in the permissible range of Rule 2. He was not charged with recording the PSI of each football. The NFL had no protocols for recording any data during the pre-game gauging process, and despite the notice from the Colts, had not adopted any protocols for the AFC Championship game. He did not recall which team’s footballs he measured first. He did his best to recall, days or weeks later, the precise PSI numbers of what, at the time he gauged the footballs, were inconsequential specifics. The same NFL lawyers who rejected his recollection as to which gauge he used nonetheless chose to assume the accuracy of his recollections of precise pre-game PSI numbers of each of 48 footballs, down to a tenth of a pound of PSI. \n \n The halftime gauging and recording of PSI, the first time in the League’s history this was done, followed no prescribed protocols because there were none. The result was, at best, confused and imprecise. No records were kept of when any measurement was started, how long the gauging took, or the sequence of when the Colts’ footballs were measured. Mr. Blakeman and Mr. Prioleau, who did not recall which gauges they used, inadvertently switched the gauges that were being used between gauging the Patriots’ and the Colts’ footballs. They called out their gauge readings to Mr. Farley, who wrote them down but put some of the PSI figures in the wrong columns on the list he was keeping (Wells Report at footnote 41). There was so much apparent confusion, imprecision and lack of recollection that the Wells Report fails to address who re-inflated the Patriots footballs, who re-gauged them, whether each football was again gauged twice, what gauge (or gauges) was used to re-gauge them, when this was done, or even at what PSI the footballs were set after the re-inflation. Only four Colts’ footballs were gauged as halftime was running out. Three of the four Colts’ footballs measured were under regulation on one of the gauges, but no one thought — or had time to — re-inflate any of them. It is not difficult to picture the rush to accomplish what had never before been attempted at any halftime of any NFL game. The footballs were delayed getting back to the field for the second half. These halftime measurements were no more precise or reliable than the post-game PSI measurements, which Exponent concluded did not provide “a scientifically reasonable basis” on which to conduct an analysis even though the measurements were “recorded in conditions similar to those conducted at halftime.” (Wells Report footnote 44). Those post-game PSI measurements, discounted by the NFL’s lawyers, showed Colts’ footballs as still being below regulation on one of the gauges, suggesting the Colts played the entire game with below-regulation footballs. \n \n There was so much imprecision about the halftime events that no one seemed to notice there was an extra, unexplained Patriots’ football on Mr. Farley’s list. Rule 2 mandated that, prior to the game, Referee Anderson was to ensure that there were 12 footballs placed in the Patriots “primary bag” for use during the game. Of those 12 footballs, one was taken out of play and set aside as a souvenir in the first half after James Develin caught a touchdown pass. A second football — the one intercepted by the Colts — had been set aside and was not one of the 11 Patriots’ footballs measured at halftime. That left 10 Patriots footballs to be measured at halftime. However, Mr. Farley wrote down that 11 Patriots footballs were measured. Buried in a footnote of the Wells Report (p. 68) is the effort to explain this extra football. Utilizing the same “certainly possible” approach to witness interviewing, the Wells Report attributes to Mr. Anderson that it was “certainly possible” there were actually 13 footballs initially put in the primary bag, not the 12 he was responsible to ensure were there. The possibility of an extra football being put in the primary bag raises even further issues about the precision of the pre-game gauging, as well as about what Mr. Anderson actually said, which is in the unreleased interview notes. In all events, what is “certainly possible” is not “more likely than not,” which is the required standard of proof for the League to find a rule violation. \n \n Myth #7: The Jastremski/McNally texts are evidence of an ongoing, longstanding scheme to deflate footballs below regulation after the Referee’s pre-game inspection. Despite the absence of a single text ever referring to any a scheme to deflate footballs, the NFL’s lawyers concluded that the text messages evidenced such a scheme. The NFL’s lawyers had access to thousands of texts, starting well before the 2014 NFL season and continuing past the AFC Championship Game. Despite it being clear from the texts that neither Mr. Jastremski nor Mr. McNally thought their texts would ever be seen by others, not a single text directs or recounts a scheme to deflate footballs after the Referee’s pre-game inspection. Not a single text even suggests that Tom Brady would want footballs below regulation. The absence of any texts confirming a scheme to deflate footballs is compelling evidence that there was no such scheme. \n \n The NFL’s lawyers drew all of their inferences from ambiguous texts. Although noting that numerous texts were obviously just attempts at humor, the lawyers felt they could divine which were simply humorous, tongue-in-cheek comments and which were not. The NFL’s brief to the Federal Court of Appeals goes beyond interpreting texts and repeatedly mischaracterizes them. A prime example of manipulating the text evidence is the effort to create the myth that “deflator” was a frequently-used nickname for Mr. McNally. The Wells Report repeats the term numerous times (and the League’s appeal brief falsely asserts the term was used in texts throughout the 2014 season). It is an undisputed fact that, in the thousands of texts, the term was actually used only once, in a single text sent in the off-season (May 2014), some eight months before the AFC Championship Game. It appears in a string of texts that had nothing to do with footballs. The May 2014 text was so disconnected from footballs and the football season that, in over 20 hours of questioning of Mr. McNally and Mr. Jastremski, the NFL’s lawyers had overlooked it and never asked about it. \n \n Myth #8: The Jastremski/McNally texts did not contradict the existence of any deflation scheme. In fact, there are key texts which contradict the existence of a deflation scheme. Mr. Jastremski and Mr. McNally texted following the Jets game in October 2014, where the footballs used in the game had been significantly over-inflated. Had there been a conspiracy for Mr. McNally to deflate footballs after the Referee’s inspection, Mr. Jastremski’s texts to Mr. McNally would most likely have blamed Mr. McNally for not carrying out the scheme. He did just the opposite, blaming the referees for not re-checking the footballs after adding air to them: “The refs f’d up.” “They didn’t recheck them after they put air in them.” Mr. Jastremski also texted his fiancé about having gauged the footballs after the Jets game and finding they measured 16 PSI. Most tellingly, he texted: “They [are] supposed to be 13 lbs.” These texts are inconsistent with the hypothesized scheme to deflate footballs. But since they do not fit with the conclusions of the Wells Report, they were essentially ignored. \n \n Myth #9: McNally secretly left the Official’s Locker Room and sneaked into a nearby bathroom. Mr. McNally’s departure with the football bags from the Official’s Locker Room and his trip to the field with those bags was anything but secretive or surreptitious. The facts recounted in the Wells Report actually show his movements were open and obvious, in plain sight of countless League Officials. As the start of the AFC Championship Game approached, the Game Officials told Mr. McNally to take the two primary bags of footballs from the dressing room of the Official’s Locker Room, where the Game Officials were doing their last-minute game preparations, and into the separate sitting room. The sitting room was so crowded with League Officials that it was described in the Wells Report as being like “Grand Central Station.” Mr. McNally sat at one end of the sitting room with the two large bags of footballs at his feet, watching the NFC Championship Game on TV along with the League Officials. When the NFC overtime game ended abruptly, Mr. McNally hoisted the football bags on his shoulders, walked approximately 15 feet down the entire length of the sitting room, past the League Officials, and went out the door of the Official’s Locker Room into the hallway that leads to the field. He did this in plain sight of all those League Officials. No one stopped him or suggested he needed to be accompanied on his walk to the field. No one described his movements as furtive or hurried. Any League official who wanted to accompany him to the field had numerous opportunities to do so. The hallway, including the entrance to the bathroom, was also monitored by security personnel and a security camera, of which Mr. McNally was aware, given that he had worked in the Stadium on game days since it was built. There was no opportunity to “sneak” anywhere. Mr. McNally walked down the hallway past the security personnel and past Mr. Daniel, a League employee who was aware of the email sent by the Colts prior the game, who opted not to accompany him, but again certainly could have. \n \n The bathroom stop was inconsequential, and when asked, Mr. McNally fully explained it. Nonetheless, this supposedly surreptitious bathroom stop was part of the narrative used to manipulate public perception. The security tape showing Mr. McNally’s entrance to and departure from the bathroom was apparently leaked by someone at the League soon after the erroneous PSI information was leaked. It certainly appears that someone at the League wanted to influence public opinion and put pressure on the Patriots. \n \n Myth #10: Tom Brady, despite never having so-stated, and despite all the contrary evidence, wanted to use footballs that were below regulation. The investigation took months and involved dozens of witnesses. None could point to a single statement by Mr. Brady that he preferred under-regulation footballs – either in games or in practice. The Wells investigators could have sought out former teammates, including backup quarterbacks and receivers, obvious witnesses with whom to explore this issue. They could have probed whether Mr. Brady, at practice, wanted to use under-inflated footballs to prepare. They could have tested whether under-inflated footballs provide a competitive advantage. They could have tested if marginal differences in PSI are discernable to experienced quarterbacks. They did none of these things. \n \n There is not a single witness, text, or any other evidence which supports the premise that Tom Brady wanted footballs at less than 12.5 PSI. The fact that he wanted them at the low end of regulation range – a preference he stated for the first time on Oct. 16, 2014 after the Jets game when the footballs were vastly over-inflated — is clearly not evidence that he actually preferred them lower. Indeed, the footballs were set at a consistent PSI for his pre-game inspection and selection (12.6 after the Jets game; 12.7 or 12.8 before that game). Common sense would suggest consistency of footballs — whether used in practice, in home games, or in away games — is of obvious importance to a quarterback. If PSI of footballs were important to a quarterback, it is only logical that consistency of that PSI would also be important. But such consistency would only be compromised should someone haphazardly stick a needle in them to remove air, and be able to do so only at home games. The entire point of the 2006 rule change that Tom Brady and other quarterbacks championed was to achieve consistency of footballs used at home games and away games. For Mr. Brady, the key was consistency of tactile feel of the surface of the football. He likes the footballs to feel well-worn; other quarterbacks prefer different surfaces. Before that rule change, the home team prepared the footballs used by both teams, which led to inconsistency of the tactile feel of the footballs at home and away games. The 2006 rule change allowed each team to prepare the footballs they would use in every game, whether home or away. That promoted consistency. The deflation scheme hypothesized by the Wells Report could have happened only at home games, since it is the home team’s staff who takes the footballs from the team’s locker rooms to the Officials’ Locker Room and then to the field. So the purported deflation scheme would have been contrary to the purpose of the 2006 rule change. The Wells Report ignores this point. \n \n There is no evidence that marginal differences in PSI are even discernible to the touch, or that they matter to game play. One can search through every page of the Wells Report for evidence that anyone, including those experienced in handling footballs, can even tell the difference of one pound of PSI in the footballs. Even Rule 2 allows a one pound range. The Game Officials handle the footballs before and after every play and are the only ones who handle both teams’ footballs and can compare how they feel. If there were ascertainable differences in PSI, it is the Game Officials who would be in the position to notice them. They never have. \n \n Nor is there any evidence that differences in PSI provide any competitive advantage. The NFL’s lawyers did not commission any tests to see if there is a difference in feel or performance between, for example, 11.3 PSI footballs and 12.5 PSI footballs. They did not compare Tom Brady’s performances in home and away games. Peter King, in his MMQB column, has conducted that analysis and found there to be virtually no difference in Mr. Brady’s home and away performances. If the League wanted to assess whether there is a competitive advantage from lower PSI footballs, they could compare the performances in games played in cold weather (where the PSI will be lower) to performances in games played in warm climates. That has never been done. \n \n Myth #11: Tom Brady’s statement that he did not think that anyone would tamper with the PSI of the footballs without his knowledge somehow proves that there was tampering and that he knew of it. This statement does not make either the PSI tampering or Mr. Brady’s knowledge of it “more likely than not,” which is the League’s required standard of proof. It is totally consistent with his testimony that he knew nothing about any such scheme — and that he does not believe there was such a scheme. No court would allow a decision about his “guilt” to be premised on this statement. Nonetheless, when pressed by Judge Richard Berman for the evidence against Mr. Brady, this statement was a key part of the response from the NFL’s lawyers. \n \n Myth #12: Increased communications between Mr. Brady and Mr. Jastremski after the AFC Championship Game is proof that there was tampering and that Brady knew about it. This Myth is a pillar of the League’s case against Mr. Brady, but reliance on Mr. Brady’s increased texting and communications with Mr. Jastremski after the AFC Championship Game as evidence of guilt actually belies common sense. If one assumes there was the long-running scheme involving Messrs. Brady and Jastremski, then one would also have to assume that the absence of any texts between them while that scheme was being implemented was quite deliberate — part of a vigilantly followed code of silence. Of course, once the story broke, there would be even more reason to be sure there were no texts being exchanged between them, and particularly none that referred to the breaking story. In fact, of course, on the heels of the matter becoming public, they do just the opposite and start to text freely and frequently. Mr. Brady is obviously curious about the breaking story, which involves footballs that he knew Mr. Jastremski prepared for the AFC Championship game. It would have been far more curious if Brady was being asked about the issue by the media, as he was the morning after the game, and he had not then followed up with the person he knew prepared the footballs. And, independent of the breaking story, Mr. Brady knew that the Super Bowl the team had just qualified for would be an enormous task involving 100+ game balls and decisions about how the footballs would be prepared, when they would be sent to the Super Bowl venue, whether game balls would be available for practice, and a whole host of other immediate decisions as to which Mr. Jastremski had no experience, having not prepared game balls for previous Super Bowls in which the team participated. Mr. Brady was clear in his testimony before the Commissioner that both issues were discussed — the breaking story and the preparations for the Super Bowl, but the NFL’s lawyer, in arguing in the federal appeals court, repeated the Commissioner’s misstatement that Mr. Brady testified that he and Mr. Jastremski only discussed the Super Bowl (and therefore was not credible). None of the Brady-Jastremski texts even suggest that there had been a scheme of any kind to deflate footballs or to engage in a cover up of any such scheme. But when pressed by Judge Berman for the evidence against Brady, the increased texting was one of the only things to which the NFL’s lawyers could point. \n \n Myth #13: Autographing a handful of items upon request, or including Mr. Jastremski on a list of over a dozen team staff members for holiday gifts, is evidence of Tom Brady’s guilt. Mr. McNally, who supposedly carried out the deflation, never received anything from Mr. Brady except his autograph on three items Mr. McNally provided. Mr. Brady did not recall signing these items — not surprisingly, since he routinely is asked for, and provides, autographs, especially when the request is from someone in or around the team’s locker room. Like Many NFL players, Mr. Brady not only routinely signs autographs but also recognizes team staff members at the holidays. Mr. Jastremski, was one of over a dozen team staff members that Tom Brady included on his holiday gift list at Christmas. There is no basis to conclude, as the NFL’s lawyers have done, that there were any payments to induce or reward improper deflation of footballs. \n \n Myth #14: Tom Brady’s decision not to retain his phone reflects his guilt. Before the interview of Mr. Brady, his lawyers were specifically advised, in an email from the NFL’s lawyers, that Mr. Brady did not need to turn over his personal phone, and that a statement by his attorneys concerning messages on his phone was all that was needed. The February 28, 2014 email to Mr. Dubin, one of Mr. Brady’s lawyers, from Mr. Burns of the Paul Weiss firm (and with copies to his colleagues Messrs. Wells and Reisner, as well as to Mr. Pash, the General Counsel of the League) was very explicit: “We are not seeking to take possession of his phone or to image its contents.” Mr. Brady’s counsel confirmed to Mr. Wells that the phone would not be turned over due to privacy and precedential concerns. \n \n The only reason that the phone became a focus at all was because the League was being challenged by the NFLPA, in Mr. Brady’s appeal, on whether sanctions could be imposed on a player for supposed “general awareness” of a rule violation by others. That was the most that the Wells Report was able to conclude about Mr. Brady after months of investigation. The League’s lawyers realized that a sanction based on “general awareness” was legally vulnerable, and that no player had ever been sanctioned for being “generally aware” that someone else had allegedly violated a rule. It was therefore important, if sanctions were to be maintained, that there be some evidence in the appeal hearing that Mr. Brady’s involvement went beyond “general awareness.” No such evidence came to light during the all-day hearing before the Commissioner. All the evidence, including Mr. Brady’s sworn testimony, was to the contrary. There was simply no basis in the evidence that allowed the Commissioner to move from “general awareness” to finding actual involvement. Mr. Brady’s non-retention of his phone became the only available hook to do that. \n \n The League already had Mr. Jastremski’s and Mr. McNally’s uncensored texts, including all the texts between Mr. Jastremski and Mr. Brady (there were none between Mr. McNally and Mr. Brady). As part of his appeal, Mr. Brady actually provided the League with far more information about his texts than had been provided during the Wells investigation. The League could have gone to others with whom Mr. Brady texted (he provided a complete list) to ascertain the content of any other texts that they were curious about. Rather than investigate the list Mr. Brady provided, the League simply created the myth that the phone was “destroyed” because it must have contained evidence of wrongdoing. This myth was so important to the League’s spin on the story that it was the focus of the League’s press release when the Commissioner’s decision was issued. The League has escalated the importance of the phone even further, now equating Brady’s non-retention of a phone it never asked for to a player masking the use of banned substances. This inflammatory reliance on the phone’s non-retention reflects the League’s realization that there is simply no evidence that implicates Mr. Brady in any deflation scheme. \n \n Myth #15: There was no action by any League officials that reflected any predisposition against the Patriots or warranted any criticism. It is an old adage: Never bite the hand that feeds you. The lawyers selected by the League to do an independent investigation had a long and deep relationship with the League. There were serious issues about League conduct and prejudgments — issues that warranted thorough investigation. But the NFL’s lawyers never asked for a single text or email from any League or Game Official, and the Wells Report contains not a single criticism of any conduct by any League or Game Official. The list of acts and omissions which warranted serious investigation, if not critique, is remarkably long. It includes: (1) not advising the Patriots of the Colts’ concerns about PSI expressed the day before the game or taking other steps pre-game in order to help ensure there were no issues in the upcoming championship game ; (2) not keeping control of the footballs pre-game as the Referee is required to do by Rule 2; (3) despite the expressed pre-game concerns about PSI, not recording the pre-game PSI of game footballs (or the gauge used); (4) during the game, not bringing the Colts’ concerns about the intercepted football immediately to the attention of the Referee, who, under the rules, has sole responsibility to determine if footballs comply with the rules; (5) allowing the rest of the first half to be played with what were then presumed to be under-inflated footballs; (6) excluding the Referee from the halftime gauging and re-inflating despite these matters being the sole responsibility of the Referee under Rule 2; (7) despite Rule 2 having been in place for decades, having no understanding that PSI is affected by temperature changes and weather; (8) rushing to judgment, including accusing the Patriots of cheating in the second half of the AFC Championship Game and making a “preliminary finding” of tampering with the footballs the day after the game, despite the total lack of understanding of the Ideal Gas Law; (9) providing incorrect information to the Patriots about the PSI of both Patriots footballs and the Colts footballs in the formal League letter; (10) leaking incorrect PSI information to the press (ESPN has confirmed that the false information came from sources within the NFL); and (11) refusing to correct the false PSI information for months, despite seeing the media and public reactions, and the harm to the Patriots, caused by that false information. \n \n CONCLUSION \n \n This situation would have been brought to a quick close if the League had even a general awareness of the scientific impact of temperature and weather conditions on the PSI of footballs at the time of the AFC Championship Game. Prompt correction of misinformation leaked by the League would have allowed knowledgeable and objective people to assess the numbers and minimize the media frenzy and public furor. For reasons still unknown, the League and its lawyers refused to release the accurate information for months, doing so only in the context of a report which based its conclusions primarily on dubious interpretations of ambiguous texts. The Wells Report is written more as a piece of advocacy trying to support its predetermined conclusions than as an independent and dispassionate review of all the facts. The League’s lawyers have refused to produce their interview notes, their communications with Exponent, or the extent of the edits by the League’s General Counsel to drafts of the Wells Report. The League has also refused to provide the PSI data it collected during the 2015 “random spot checks.” If properly performed, those checks undoubtedly confirm that numerous games are played with below-regulation footballs due to the impact of weather conditions on footballs. The integrity of the League is of vital importance. One can only wonder if it has been seriously compromised by the League’s lack of transparency and what appears to be an ongoing effort to defend, rather than critically assess, the dubious conclusions and methodology of the Wells and Exponent Reports. \n \n D.L.G.']",2,"– It's a region that produces a new species every other day: Carnivorous plants that can eat mice, birds, and lizards.

60,"['I don’t remember the first time I did it, but I remember the first time I got caught. I was a freshman at U.C. Santa Cruz, the store was called Zanotto’s, the item was Neosporin. I took it out of its packaging, bent down as if to scratch my ankle, and then wedged the tube of triple-antibiotic ointment into my white ankle sock. When the guard grabbed my arm, I was so scared I peed on the floor. As we waited for the police to come, I had to watch a janitor clean up my pee with a mop. I was taken down to the station and formally arrested: fingerprints, mug shot—they really wanted to teach this nineteen-year-old, transparent-dress-wearing punk a lesson. The lesson I learned was that I was now legally an adult, so I didn’t have to worry that my parents would be called. I was free—even my crimes belonged to me alone. \n \n In time, I improved. I discovered that stealing required a loose, casual energy, a sort of oneness with the environment, like surfing or horse-whispering. And once I knew I could do it I felt strangely obliged to. I remember feeling guilty for not stealing, as though I were wasting money. After I dropped out of college and moved to Portland, Oregon, it became part of my livelihood. I stared at my shopping list like a stressed housewife, deliberating over which items to steal and which to buy with food stamps. My preferred purse was gigantic and discreetly rigid, like a suitcase. I packed it with blocks of cheese, loaves of bread, and lots of soy products, because I was a vegetarian. \n \n But it wasn’t just about the supermarket—the whole world was one giant heist. It goes without saying that I used magnets to reset the Kinko’s copy counters to zero, and carried scissors to cut alarm tags out of clothes. Everyone I knew did these things. I say this not to excuse myself but just so you can visualize a legion of energetic, intelligent young lady criminals. Anytime anyone we knew flew into Portland, we urged her to buy luggage insurance and allow us to steal her bag from the baggage carrousel. The visiting friend then had to perform the role of the frantic claims reporter and was given a cut of the insurance money. Some friends were up for this; others thought it was an inhospitable thing to ask. \n \n My first employer in Portland was Goodwill, which, yes, is a charitable organization, and, no, I did not have any qualms about slipping books and clothes and knickknacks into my bag. Because what is money, anyway? It’s just a concept some asshole made up. I also put red “Sold” tags on large appliances and entire living-room sets, and felt magnanimous as my friends gleefully loaded up their vans. One day, a co-worker was admiring a pink blouse that had just come in. I encouraged her to take it, and when she wouldn’t I put the blouse in a Goodwill bag and ran out of the store calling, “Sir! Sir! You forgot your bag!” Then I stuffed it in the bushes. At closing time, I fished it out with a halfhearted “What’s this?” and handed it to my prim co-worker. Prim and ungrateful, as it turned out. I was called into the boss’s office the next morning; the pink shirt was on her desk. “The good news is we’re not going to press charges,” she said. I wept as I walked over the river to the place where my girlfriend worked as a dog groomer. I’d never been fired before. It was a lot like dropping out of school or being arrested. All of these institutions, in their crude, clumsy way, seemed to be saying, You don’t need us, we’ll never understand you, and it’s important for you not to want us to. \n \n I took the message to heart. I labored obsessively over creative pursuits they would never recognize, hurtling through systems and hierarchies as if nothing that already existed were relevant to me. I performed at colleges and scanned the room for what I could take. Even a box of chalk slipped into my pocket reassured me that I still had my freedom—the freedom to steal, to self-destruct, to ruin everything. \n \n There was an exact moment when I decided to quit. I was sitting on a man’s lap and we had just determined that I was “his girl.” As we kissed, I thought, Well, I guess I have to stop stealing now. As if the idea of having a boyfriend, of being straight, required straightening out in other ways. I may have been looking for an excuse; I may have realized that I didn’t need to be a criminal to be an artist. Art itself could be the crime—could be scary and dangerous enough to shoulder my rebellion. After a while, I also stopped getting into physical fights, working in peepshows, bleaching my hair white, and wearing my tights over my shoes. Still, for a long time I thought my biggest heist was fooling everyone into believing that I was an upstanding citizen, a sweet girl. Then, just a few years ago, I realized that everyone feels secretly fraudulent. It’s the feeling of being an adult. ♦', 'Lion’s Gate wild animal sanctuary has euthanized all 11 of its animals, its hand forced when the Elbert County commissioners denied the refuge’s request to move, co-owner Joan Laub said. \n \n Laub told KMGH-Channel 7 that the animals had to be euthanized because recurring flooding on the property made conditions unsafe. \n \n The sanctuary euthanized three lions, three tigers and five bears on April 20, according to KUSA-Channel 9. \n \n On April 12, Elbert County commissioners unanimously voted to deny the sanctuary’s request to move from eastern Elbert County to a location near Elizabeth, the Denver Post reported. \n \n Commissioner Grant Thayer said the unanimous vote to deny the sanctuary a special-use permit was made because “it was felt that the community impact would be best served if it was denied.” \n \n It was the second time the board of commissioners voted against a move for the facility, with a previous board turning down a similar request by Lion’s Gate in 2006. \n \n For years, neighbors living near the proposed relocation site had said it was not appropriate for a rural neighborhood mostly known for an equine lifestyle. They worried about safety and complained about the possibility of lions roaring at all times of day and night. \n \n Lion’s Gate owners, Laub and Peter Winney, argued at a planning commission meeting in March that the animals were elderly and posed little security risk. As for noise, Laub said the sanctuary’s two male lions might roar once a day for only seconds at a time. \n \n The Colorado Parks and Wildlife Department told Denver7 officials were aware of the mass euthanasia and the burial of all 11 animals on the sanctuary grounds. But it said no regulations were violated. \n \n Pat Craig, the founder and executive director of the Wildlife Sanctuary in Keenesburg, which is the state’s largest with 450 animals, told Denver7 he was surprised the sanctuary’s owners didn’t try to find new homes for the animals. \n \n “In this specific case with Lion’s Gate, they have so few animals, they would easily be able to place every animal with another wildlife sanctuary,” Craig said.” “I can guarantee you that a lot of organizations would be glad to help.”']",2,"– Despite their fame and (sometimes) fortune, even celebrities occasionally turn to crime.

""That is why we have finished it a day ahead of time."" \n \n Batts said police would keep probing at the direction of the state\'s attorney, while Mosby stressed that her office is doing its own investigation. \n \n ""We are not relying solely on their findings but rather the facts that we have gathered and verified. We ask for the public to remain patient and peaceful and to trust the process of the justice system,"" her statement said. \n \n Batts left it to Deputy Commissioner Kevin Davis to release yet another official timeline of what happened to Gray after his arrest nearly three weeks ago. \n \n In all, the previously undisclosed stop now makes four stops between the time officers arrested Gray and his arrival at a police station, where he was found unresponsive. He was hospitalized in critical condition and died a week later. \n \n Batts and Davis said nothing more about when or how investigators obtained the previously undisclosed video or learned about the additional stop. However, five of the six officers gave statements to investigators the day Gray was injured, and as recently as a week ago, the stop was not part of the official timeline, suggesting investigators learned of it later. \n \n Gray was arrested after he made eye contact with an officer and ran. Officers chased him down and handcuffed him behind his back. Bystander videos recorded police loading him, dragging his legs, into one of two metal compartments in the back of the van. \n \n Police earlier said the van stopped once so that officers could put Gray in ""leg irons"" because he had become ""irate;"" stopped again because the driver asked for an additional unit to check on Gray\'s condition, and then again to put an additional prisoner in the van\'s other compartment before arriving at the station. \n \n Now police are saying an additional stop was made before the driver asked officers to check on his condition. They said nothing about this stop other than its location — at what appears to be a desolate intersection with three vacant lots and a corner store. Last week, Batts had said the second prisoner told investigators the driver did not speed, make sudden stops or ""drive erratically"" during the trip, and that Gray was ""was still moving around, that he was kicking and making noises"" up until the van arrived at the police station. \n \n Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake sought to dispel any notion that the police report would bring a swift and public conclusion to the case. ""Whatever time the state\'s attorney\'s office needs to make that determination, the family wants to get it right,"" she said Wednesday after meeting with Gray\'s family and legal team. \n \n ""This family wants justice and they want justice that comes at the right time and not too soon,"" said Hassan Murphy, one of the family\'s lawyers. \n \n Meanwhile, protests over Gray\'s death spread Wednesday night to other cities including Boston, New York and Washington, making it clear that tensions over the case are far from subsiding. The demonstrations were mostly peaceful, but police made many arrests, including at least 60 in New York. \n \n Gray\'s death was only the latest high-profile case of a black man dying as the result of a police encounter. Similar protests erupted over the killings of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri; Eric Garner in New York last year, and Walter Scott in South Carolina. Scott was shot in the back by a white officer who has since been charged with murder. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writers Ben Nuckols, Juliet Linderman, Matthew Barakat, Tom Foreman Jr., Jessica Gresko, Brian Witte and Jeff Horwitz contributed to this report.', 'Baltimore police have found that Freddie Gray suffered a serious head injury inside a prisoner transport wagon, with one wound indicating that he struck a protruding bolt in the back of the vehicle, according to sources familiar with the probe. \n \n New details of the investigation emerged as police officially turned over the case to city prosecutors Thursday. Police said they have ""exhausted every lead."" \n \n In announcing an early conclusion to the first phase of their investigation, police also revealed a previously unknown stop by the transport van driver.

Gray\'s family and their lawyers were seen leaving the state\'s attorney\'s office Thursday evening. \n \n ""While we have and will continue to leverage the information received by the department, we are not relying solely on their findings but rather the facts that we have gathered and verified,"" Mosby said. ""We ask for the public to remain patient and peaceful and to trust the process of the justice system."" \n \n Gray died April 19, a week after being arrested in West Baltimore. He suffered a spinal cord injury and crushed voicebox and had lapsed into a coma. \n \n Maryland\'s chief medical examiner, Dr. David R. Fowler, said his office has not completed an autopsy or turned any documents over to police or prosecutors. He said homicide detectives had observed the examination, a routine practice. \n \n ""Our first report will be final, and will go directly to the state\'s attorney\'s office,"" Fowler said. He said his office was conducting one of its last examinations and anticipated results would be available ""shortly."" \n \n Investigative files include everything assembled by detectives — incident reports, crime lab reports, photos, witness interviews, the results of search warrants, and other items. \n \n Video of the tail end of Gray\'s arrest shows him groaning and his feet dragging underneath him.

Video taken by citizens of Gray\'s arrest shows him yelling and dragging his feet as officers carry him to the van. \n \n But as protests erupted, police said they were focused on what happened inside the van and did not believe the catastrophic spinal injury occurred during his arrest. Police said earlier this month that a preliminary autopsy showed no indication that force was used. \n \n Video taken by citizens of Gray\'s arrest shows him yelling and dragging his feet as officers carry him to the van. \n \n Many residents and activists had been eyeing Friday as a day that findings of the police investigation might be released, but police and Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake had worked the previous day to dispel those expectations. \n \n ""The family of Mr. Gray wants answers.

63,"['Mirror, Mirror \n \n (out of 4) \n \n Starring Julia Roberts, Lily Collins, Armie Hammer and Nathan Lane. Directed by Tarsem Singh. 106 minutes. Opens March 30 at major theatres. PG \n \n The first volley in the froth-vs.-goth wars between two film versions of the Snow White fairytale has been fired with Mirror, Mirror. \n \n It opens Friday, two months ahead of the June 1 bow for the more sinister-looking Snow White and the Huntsman. \n \n Mirror, Mirror takes itself less seriously, presenting a pink confection of slapstick laughs and swashbuckling heroics that references the classic Disney cartoon liberally, with sly winks to the genre — right down to cliché teeth twinkles. \n \n The story gets a 2012 girl-power update: no more waiting for a prince to save the day. Women don’t escape the fairytale slap-down entirely, however; the villain is still a vain old gal who can’t deal with all of her stepdaughter’s fabulousness. But this Snow White will see to her own destiny. \n \n Director Tarsem Singh certainly knows his way around fantasy filmmaking (Immortals, The Fall) but can he also bring a light touch to the dramatics? It’s a legitimate question in the face of the horribly overwrought Immortals. Turns out he can, although don’t look for much more than that. This rambling version of Snow White’s tale is a pretty, spun-sugar confection, airy as a plate of Easter egg-coloured macarons and similarly devoid of substance. \n \n Everything about Mirror, Mirror echoes old-school animation and the entire thing is gorgeous, from the high-concept snow-covered forest to a human form of a game of Battleship, where three-masted vessels nestle atop players’ heads like fanciful hats. \n \n This is the last film for Oscar-winning (Dracula) Japanese costume designer Eiko Ishioka, who died in January. She and Singh teamed earlier on Immortals, The Fall and The Cell, and it’s fitting that the film is dedicated to her, given the lift her work gives Mirror, Mirror. The elaborate costumes are stunning, especially the fanciful animal-themed masked ball outfits with over-the-top headdresses. \n \n Julia Roberts stars as The Queen, nasty stepmother to Snow White (Lily Collins and her massive eyebrows), sliding from America’s sweetheart to icily evil beauty with ease. Easily bored and self-absorbed, the years are piling up and Queenie is hardly happy about it, using a magical mirror with a surprising inhabitant to keep herself looking fresh. \n \n The Queen’s devoted servant Brighton (Nathan Lane doing a fantastic Nathan Lane) simpers and cowers as he reluctantly does all her bidding. There’s no retirement plan for toadies in this kingdom. \n \n Snow spends most of her time locked up in her bedroom, missing her father, the King, who disappeared in the woods where he was likely devoured by the beast who lives there. Now 18, she’d like to get out of her room occasionally, but The Queen has other plans for her. \n \n The arrival of a handsome prince (Armie Hammer as Prince Alcott) stirs the pot. He’s buff and a bit of a buffoon, but the Queen sees a chance to help the kingdom she’s bankrupted with her party excesses by marrying him. Too bad he only has eyes for Show White, a wrinkle the Queen deals with by ordering Brighton to drop her rival off in the dark woods to be part of the beast’s buffet. \n \n Jason Keller, whose last screenplay was for the ham-fisted Machine Gun Preacher, delivers whimsy by the bucket here, teaming the abandoned Snow up with seven rebel forest dwellers who don’t take well to being called dwarves. Onetime model citizens and business owners banished to the woods by the Queen for looking “different,” they’ve found amusing means to measure up and prefer to make money the Robin Hood way rather than by toiling in a mine. \n \n Among them, we meet Grub (Joe Gnoffo), who loves food, perpetually lovesick Half Pint (Mark Povinelli) and writer Grimm (Danny Woodburn). London, Ont., actor Jordan Prentice plays Napoleon, the de facto leader of the group without a short man syndrome. \n \n Collins, daughter of musician Phil, does well in her first big leading role as a lively Snow, showing a good comic sensibility. But those Groucho Marx eyebrows are a constant distraction. \n \n From the CGI-created castle to the Bollywood-inspired final dance number, Mirror, Mirror is aimed straight at the eyeballs. But it bypasses the heart in the process.', 'Who’s the Most Self-Absorbed of Them All? ‘Mirror Mirror,’ Tarsem Singh’s Snow White Story \n \n Is it possible for filmmakers to still peddle the old “once upon a time” in the age of Katniss Everdeen, the ferocious teenage warrior from “The Hunger Games”? The answer, from the evidence of Tarsem Singh’s “Mirror Mirror,” a would-be comic and cheeky redo of Snow White, is yes, but not persuasively. The princess (Lily Collins) here smiles obligingly while flouncing about in a gown, but she also helps write her own happily ever after with a sword. Whether that makes her a feminist heroine or just another self-actualized Disneyesque waif may depend on your idea of empowerment. (In June the fairy tale gets another makeover in “Snow White and the Huntsman.” ) \n \n Written by, among others, the Brothers Grimm and waggishly retrofitted for “Mirror Mirror” by Marc Klein and Jason Keller, the essential story is as you probably remember it, only with jokes: a widower King remarries, giving the realm a new Queen (Julia Roberts, seemingly very self-amused), and his only child, Snow White, a mother. But when the King disappears, a turn that’s represented in the film by a striking animated sequence, Snow White falls into the grasping hands of the Queen, who turns out to be a pathological narcissist suffering from possible delusions. (She talks to her mirror.) You know the rest — seven dwarfs, a prince, a girl’s youth, a woman’s vanity — all familiar pieces that are both this movie’s strength and its gravest flaws. \n \n Mr. Singh started out directing music videos. The short form suits him. “Mirror Mirror” runs a long 95 minutes, but it’s a virtual breeze when compared with his previous movie, “Immortals,” a camp farrago set in ancient Greece (by way of a Vegas floor show), that runs an enervating 110 minutes. Critics like to take note of Mr. Singh’s eye-catching visuals, and there’s no doubt he knows how to swank up performers and sets or rather hire talented professionals to do the job for him. The costumes in “Mirror Mirror” — by turns ethereal as a dream and as ponderous as sculptured marble — were created by Mr. Singh’s regular collaborator, the Japanese designer Eiko Ishioka. (Ms. Ishioka, who also designed the costumes for Francis Ford Coppola’s “Dracula,” died in January.) \n \n Yet while Mr. Singh knows how to make performers and sets look good, he has trouble putting them into vibrant, kinetic, meaningful play, which effectively means that he’s a better window dresser than a movie director. “Mirror Mirror” is consistently watchable, even when it drifts into dullness because Mr. Singh always gives you something to look at, whether it’s the Queen’s blood-red gown, the sailing clouds decorating her bedroom or the dwarfs’ woodland home. Everything looks as if it has been meticulously selected for this or that spot, including the performers. Ms. Roberts, Ms. Collins and Armie Hammer, as Prince Alcott, look as pretty as fairy-book illustrations, but their performances are similarly one dimensional, as if they had been art directed into place instead of cut loose. \n \n The only lead performer to wiggle free of Mr. Singh’s heavy hand is Nathan Lane, who plays the Queen’s henchman, Brighton, and whose amusingly tremulous, cagey performance owes much to Bob Hope. Mr. Lane is the only performer who sounds comfortable delivering Mr. Klein and Mr. Keller’s often intentionally anachronistic dialogue, which, with its forced lightness and scattershot jokes, makes an awkward fit with Mr. Singh’s lugubriousness. All of the scripted yuks register as an attempt to modernize the movie, as does affording Snow the chance to play a role in her own rescue, mostly by giving her a sword and putting her in palazzo pants. That’s nice, even if in the end it comes down to the same old story of love, glory and the devastating cost of female wrinkles. \n \n “Mirror Mirror” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). Slapstick violence. \n \n Mirror Mirror \n \n Opens on Friday nationwide. \n \n Directed by Tarsem Singh; written by Marc Klein and Jason Keller, based on a story by Melisa Wallack; director of photography, Brendan Galvin; edited by Robert Duffy and Nick Moore; music by Alan Menken; choreography by Paul Becker; production design by Tom Foden; costumes by Eiko Ishioka; produced by Bernie Goldmann, Ryan Kavanaugh and Brett Ratner; released by Relativity Media.

There\'s no such downtime for the princess in the snappy retelling ""Mirror Mirror,"" a fractured fairy tale that occupies the divide between Disney and Grimm.A booster shot of testosterone lends kinetic kick to director Tarsem Singh \'s visually inventive interpretation, without shortchanging the requisite froufrou or sugarcoating the story\'s dark Oedipal heart. The mash-up can be choppy, but the fable zings along on the sharp comic timing of the cast, led by a royally wicked Julia Roberts The screenplay by Marc Klein and Jason Keller (a screen story credit goes to Melisa Wallack) pointedly rewrites the fairy-tale convention that finds every damsel helplessly imperiled until a prince delivers her from danger. This Snow White ( Lily Collins ) can get gussied up with the best of them, but she also holds her own in a fencing duel. And — hello, switcheroo — she rescues a prince in distress.When in exile, Snow (it\'s a first-name-informal kingdom) receives martial-arts instruction from the dwarfs. Like the famous septet from Disney\'s 1937 classic, this woods-dwelling crew provides collective-sidekick slapstick, and each has a character-defining shtick — most memorably the love-struck Half Pint (Mark Povinelli). But they\'ve also been restored to their folk tale roots as bandits and outcasts. They\'re action antiheroes with hearts of gold.Transforming Snow White to an action hero in her own right doesn\'t lessen the archetypal power of the stepmother-daughter, age-beauty conflict. Collins ( ""The Blind Side"" ) is a convincing foil for Roberts\' jealous Queen, personifying intelligence, innate goodness and fairest-of-them-all femininity. If a movie-star self-regard has crept into Roberts\' work over the years, here she uses it to winning effect, savoring the tension and silliness, and making an exceptionally entertaining evil monarch.Advised and chided by the alter ego who resides on the other side of her magic mirror — one of the film\'s more striking elements — the Queen sets her sights on an imperial merger with Prince Alcott ( Armie Hammer ), whose province\'s resources would save her from the brink of bankruptcy.Hammer, who brought an air of wounded regality to the Winklevoss twins in ""The Social Network"" and Clyde Tolson in ""J. Edgar,"" gets to shake off the aggrievement and let his princely flag fly, often without a shirt.Singh (a.k.a. Tarsem Singh Dhandwar or simply Tarsem) is a fantasist whose singular knack for spectacle can also be his weakness, set-piece razzle-dazzle not infrequently overwhelming the characters in his previous films: ""The Cell,"" ""The Fall"" and ""Immortals."" That weakness reveals itself in ""Mirror Mirror"" when he stops the story cold to indulge in a puppet sequence.But mostly the built-in structure of a well-known tale helps to rein him in, as does the propulsive rhythm of one-liners — some of the best are delivered with panache by Nathan Lane and Robert Emms, as mouthy servants. For most of its running time, the film strikes the right balance of make-believe enchantment and snark-infused lampoon, playing to older kids and adults alike.Crucial to the movie\'s magic are Tom Foden\'s lush and witty production design and the splendid costumes by Eiko Ishioka, the renowned designer\'s final screen work before her death in January. The finery and regalia of their contributions are integral to Singh\'s vision, giving this mostly conventional princess story its fair share of romantic froth and more than a little moxie.', 'Mirror Mirror \n \n March 28, 2012 \n \n Cast & Credits The Queen Julia Roberts \n \n Snow White Lily Collins \n \n Prince Alcott Armie Hammer \n \n Brighton Nathan Lane \n \n Napoleon Jordan Prentice \n \n Half Pint Mark Povinelli \n \n Grub Joe Gnoffo \n \n Grimm Danny Woodburn \n \n Wolf Sebastian Saraceno \n \n Butcher Martin Klebba \n \n Chuckles Ronald Lee Clark \n \n Charles Renbock Robert Emms \n \n Baker Margaret Mare Winningham \n \n Baron Michael Lerner \n \n King Sean Bean \n \n \n \n Relativity Media presents a film directed by Tarsem Singh.

Printer-friendly » \n \n E-mail this to a friend » \n \n ""Mirror Mirror"" is a sumptuous fantasy for the eyes and a pinball game for the mind, as story elements collide and roll around bumping into each other. This is not a faithful retelling of the versions by the Brothers Grimm or Walt Disney, but neither is it a satire, nor much of a story in its own right. But it\'s great to look at. If there\'s a major difference from the earlier versions, it\'s how this one has beefed-up roles for the seven dwarves, who here seem to be a merry band in search of Robin Hood. Nor do I recall earlier battles with a giant winged griffin. \n \n The look of the film owes everything to the director, Tarsem Singh, an India-born former TV commercial maker, famous for two of the best-looking movies I\'ve ever seen, ""The Cell"" (2000) and ""The Fall"" (2006). He\'s in love with spectacular landscapes and architecture, and in all of his films (including the underwhelming ""The Immortals"" in 2011) the costumes of the late Japanese designer Eiko Ishioka dominate every scene they\'re in and every character they\'re worn by. \n \n \n \n Julia Roberts seems particularly well-suited to wear them, and when first seen is wearing a magnificent orange gown and seated on a seashell throne which acts as a frame and a continuation of the costume. Roberts plays the Queen in a kingdom we\'re introduced to by her opening narration -- which uses animated dolls figures to fill us in on her early life, during which she was married to a King (Sean Bean) who promptly set off into the forest and was not seen again. That left her as the autocratic ruler of a kingdom with painfully high taxes, and the stepmother of Snow White (Lily Collins), who is a captive in the castle until she\'s 18. \n \n \n \n There is a financial crisis. Brighton (Nathan Lane), her aide and accountant, tells her she\'s broke. That comes at an inconvenient time, because Prince Alcott (Armie Hammer) has wandered into the kingdom, and the Queen knows if she marries him, he can solve her finances. Problem is, she can\'t even afford the royal ball at which she plans for them to fall in love. \n \n \n \n The Prince has already met Snow White; they were both wandering in the woods when they encountered the seven dwarfs, jolly bandits with good hearts. It is Snow White and not the Prince in this version who bestows a life-changing kiss. It\'s almost uncanny in some scenes here, how Lily Collins (daughter of Phil Collins) looks like Audrey Hepburn. \n \n \n \n She\'s all sweet, all innocent, but Julia Roberts steals the show with her imperious and autocratic Queen. She consults her own image in a mirror, located as only Tarsem would place it in a weird structure in the middle of a lake. She never asks who is the fairest of them all, and thus never has to hear the inevitable answer, but the Queen\'s vanity and fear of aging give Roberts some plum scenes. Consider the one where she\'s having a spa-style beauty makeover before the ball. Her lips become bee-stung with the help of real bees, she gets a manicure from disgusting wormy creatures, and her skin is refreshed with a preparation made up from parrot droppings. Yes, parrot droppings, and we see the parrots dropping them. \n \n \n \n All of this is in place and looks great, but the dialogue is rather flat, the movie sort of boring, and there\'s not much energy in the two places it should really be felt: Between the Queen and Snow White, and between Snow and the Prince. The story is a listless tale that moves at a stately pace through settings that could have supported fireworks. Indeed, the characters who seem to care the most about each other are the dwarfs.', 'The London School of Economics is investigating allegations that a Nazi-themed drinking game led to a brawl in which a Jewish student\'s nose was broken. \n \n The inquiry relates to a skiing trip to Val d\'Isère organised by the students\' union last month and attended by 150 students from the university\'s athletics union. \n \n According to a statement released by the LSE\'s Jewish society, the assault took place after a Jewish student objected to the drinking game. The violence was not serious enough for French police to be involved, a students\' union source said. \n \n The LSE said: ""These are disturbing allegations relating to events which took place on a foreign trip organised by the students\' union. Both the SU and LSE are investigating these events and are prepared to take disciplinary action if the allegations are shown to be true. \n \n ""Students must abide by clear standards of behaviour set by both LSE and the SU and breaches of those standards are taken very seriously. We do not tolerate antisemitism or any other form of racism."" \n \n According to the LSE\'s student newspaper, the Beaver, the game played was a Nazi-themed version of the drinking game Ring of Fire. This involved playing cards being arranged on a table in the shape of a swastika. Players were required to ""salute the Führer"", the paper said. \n \n Jay Stoll, president of the LSE\'s Jewish Society, said: ""Nazi glorification and antisemitism have no place in our universities, which should remain safe spaces for all students. \n \n ""There is simply no context for what has happened here. Those who believe the game was all in good humour need to realise that when a Jewish student is subject to violence and the Nazi ideology glorified it is no joke but a spiteful, collective attack on a community."" \n \n The Jewish student who suffered the injury told the Guardian: ""I\'ve seen this kind of game before, so it wasn\'t so much the game that offended me, as much as the antisemitic gibes that went with it. \n \n ""There was a mix of personal references and general Jewish insults. That was after I excused myself from the game. It made me extremely upset. That was the tipping point for me. It was a build-up during the game, and seeing the swastika obviously, but the comments built up to the point where I couldn\'t forgive myself if I let it slide. \n \n ""I feel angry about it now. There\'s no doubt it was an affront at my identity, but on a personal level it was extremely upsetting."" \n \n Alex Peters-Day, general secretary of the students\' union, said: ""This is so at odds with everything the LSE and the union stand for"". \n \n Most of the students at the university, founded by socialists Beatrice and Sidney Webb, are from overseas. \n \n Brendan Mycock, president of the LSE athletics union, condemned what he said were the actions of ""a small group of individuals"". \n \n ""The athletics union prides itself on our open and tolerant nature and behaviour of this sort is not acceptable and is not an accurate representation of the behaviour we uphold ourselves to. Being in the athletics union is about being a team, behaving with respect to our team-mates and athletics union peers and representing our union and our university."" \n \n Last November the Daily Telegraph reported claims that members of the Oxford University Conservative Association regularly sang an antisemitic song with Nazi references.']",5,"– The latest retelling of Snow White (before June's Snow White and the Huntsman) is a lot like its vain queen: visually stunning, but kind of shallow.

Do us proud. \n \n Read ‘Twilight’ Stars to Be Immortalized at Grauman’s Chinese Theatre TODAY! \n \n You know, it’s nice to see that Kate has finally moved on from that whole “NO! I MUST STAY IN TV NO MATTER WHAT!” state of mind. Finding a job in this economy isn’t easy, and odds are, you’re going to end up doing something you hadn’t thought you’d be doing, simply because it’s what will pay the bills. Believe me. I’ve been there. Unemployment is a bitch, and it’s not necessarily your “fault” that it’s where you’re at. But flexibility of thinking is a good skill to have no matter what, and it’s good to know that she’s starting to exercise it. And hey, she can still capitalize off of her reality fame in her new line of work, right? \n \n She might even be able to use her new gig to springboard back into television. I hear Extreme Couponing is pretty hot these days. Maybe they could use her couponing expertise? \n \n Lucia Peters is BettyConfidential’s associate editor.', 'Kate Gosselin: coupon expert. (Andy Kropa - GETTY IMAGES) \n \n When Kate Gosselin’s reality show “Kate Plus 8” got canceled in August, many of you were concerned about her potential employment options. \n \n All right, fine. You weren’t really that concerned. You were actually overjoyed. \n \n Still, Gosselin is a mom, like many of us, and she needs to support her kids. Which is why I am happy to find out that she has a new job: She is now a coupon blogger for the Web site CouponCabin.com. \n \n CouponCabin.com announced the news in a press release that conveyed the Web site’s excitement over its new hire, who is “a longtime advocate of couponing.” \n \n “Kate has embraced coupons her entire life,” said Jackie Warrick, president at CouponCabin.com, according to the press release. “We look forward to sharing the unique insight she has gained over the years.” \n \n Added Gosselin: “No matter what your financial situation is, there’s no reason not to use coupons. It’s like free money in your pocket!” \n \n The former reality star will begin her new job officially on Nov. 22, at which time she will blog about how to navigate Black Friday. Future topics, according to the press release, include how to stretch a budget for a large family and holiday shopping tips. \n \n Chuckle heartily over this tidbit all you like, but I genuinely think this is great news for three reasons. \n \n 1. It keeps Gosselin’s kids off of television . . . at least for now. \n \n As previously noted, a mom’s got to eat and she needs to make sure her children do, too. If she can do that by writing about the best way to save cash on detergent or action figures, what’s the harm? Of course, the CouponCabin.com blogging gig may not be enough to pay the bills. I mean, we can’t all engage in the mindblowingly lucrative work of blogging about celebrities and pop culture. (I just typed that sentence while gazing at my diamond-encrusted fingernails as they tappa-tapped on my keyboard, which is made out of genuine leather and features function keys ensconced in imported silk.) But even if this keeps her busy and semi-compensated for a while — and less focused on the new TV deal she said she wants earlier this week on “The View” — this is a good thing. \n \n 2. Her blog entries may provide fodder for Celebritology blog entries that compare Gosselin’s shopping tips to Gwyneth Paltrow’s shopping tips from Goop. \n \n And the comments on those Celebritology posts will be so rich with gleeful sarcasm that they may incite a phenomenon scientists have long predicted: the Big Snark Bang. Sure, both the blogosphere and the universe may immediately combust as a result. But it will be worth it. \n \n 3. As a result of Gosselin’s new job, CouponCabin.com just got a lot more publicity. \n \n And that’s super-exciting because, as Gosselin noted in the aforementioned press release, CouponCabin.com is the place where you can easily find the best deals on practically everything. \n \n And there are two things we all need more of in these challenging times: great deals on practically everything and Kate Gosselin.', 'Kate Gosselin can ease up on the ""freaking out"": The out-of-work reality star has a job now -- a part-time gig, at least. \n \n Gosselin, whose ""Kate Plus 8"" reality show took its last breath in September, will be a contributing blogger for click-and-save website Coupon Cabin. \n \n ""I\'ve never quit a job in my life without having something else lined up,"" she told People at the time.

67,"['JAMESTOWN, Tuolumne County (KPIX 5) — Weeks of rainy weather across Northern California and the storm runoff through the hills of gold country have triggered a new gold rush. \n \n “Miner Gary” Thomas said he always finds at least a little gold here on his property near Jamestown in Tuolumne County, but this year, there’s so much more runoff than normal and it’s shaking the gold from these hills. \n \n Thomas said it could provide a “Eureka” moment for those inclined to come up here and look for it. “(The runoff) kind of ‘etch-a-sketches’ everything,” said Thomas. “Eveything I had dug up and now my dig spots are all gone.” \n \n The known gold digs were washed out, trees uprooted, and landscape eroded. The runoffs have also removed gold out of the old abandoned mines and sent it down the river. \n \n “It’s going to bring down more gold,” said Thomas. “It’s going to bring up new areas that I never got to.” \n \n Thomas runs tour groups through his property and said now is the optimum time for gold hunting because the storms have just finished churning the landscape. \n \n Officials from the Bureau of Land Management say the erosion “concentrates” the gold by removing the lighter rock and soil. \n \n You may be wondering if this reporter found any during our time here. We did find some fine flakes of what they call “flour gold” and it was found more quickly than normal in just a couple of panning sessions. \n \n “Eureka!” said Thomas.”That’s hard to do.” \n \n But not as hard this year, now that Mother Nature has shaken up the motherlode. \n \n Thomas said one hot spot this year will be below the Oroville Dam, because the huge water releases from the spillway could reveal some new pockets of gold.', 'Joey Wilson, left, rings up Curtis Barwick for a gold pan and a portable slough Saturday at Adventures in Prospecting in downtown Oroville. Dan Reidel — Enterprise-Record \n \n Oroville >> Now is not the time to quit your day job in hopes of striking it rich. However, people with a new or renewed interest in gold mining may be spending more of their summer weekends near rivers and streams. \n \n Joey Wilson owns Adventures in Prospecting in Oroville, where he says there’s been more excitement among his gold mining customers. \n \n “There’s always been gold in the Feather River,” he said. What’s new is that the recent floods have moved things around. \n \n It’s not just the Feather River. Floods scoured the banks of the American River, the Mokelumne, the Yuba and just about any other waterway where 49ers once got their boots dirty. \n \n Curtis Barwick was in Oroville Saturday waiting for the prospecting store to open. He usually looks for gold closer to his home in Anderson, but decided to check out Oroville on his day off. He said gold mining gets him outdoors and helps him “recharge,” after a stressful week at work. It’s a lot like hiking, another of his hobbies, but with gold mining there’s a chance of a reward. \n \n “The odds are greater than winning the lottery,” he said. Even on days when he only finds a few flakes, it’s fun to turn over rocks and sand. \n \n He’s not alone. In fact, he’s a member of the Shasta Miners and Prospectors Association. \n \n Back in the day, miners in the 1850s did not have metal detectors. Barwick bought one a while back and said if “lead was gold, I’d be rich.” He had found more bullet casings than he cares to collect. Other finds include coins, and a 1944 nickel. He gave his girlfriend a ring he found in the dirt, and would recommend that anyone who buys a metal detector have some fun digging around in their own backyard. \n \n Others make gold mining an adventure. That’s one of the reasons Wilson named his shop “Adventures in Prospecting.” He sells wet suits and fins, and personally loves to dive when he hunts gold. \n \n Finding gold is a common thread for Cindy and Paul Pekarek, who were at the Montgomery Street miner’s supply shop Saturday. The couple belong to the Mother Lode Goldhounds, near Grass Valley, and for fun they travel to new digs, including Oroville. \n \n Paul Pekarek is a five-time gold mining champion, he said pointing to a pin on his wide-brimmed, black leather hat. The pin includes a miniature gold pan, pickaxe and shovel, with a real glob of gold in the center. To win the championships, he proved he could pan faster than most others. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Some people, like Mark Saposnik, are “pretty serious” about gold mining. Saposnik spent his summers during college dredge mining. It’s more difficult to find gold now that dredging is no longer allowed, he said. The recent floods have “rearranged the rivers,” he said, and he’ll spend more time stomping around. \n \n Spillway gold? \n \n Gold miners can speculate all they want about gold that may or may not have washed down the hillside near the Oroville spillway. Before hydraulic mining was outlawed, hillsides up and down the river were washed away to unearth gold. \n \n Gold is heavy, and prospectors would love to discover what is among the debris at the Diversion Pool. However, the area is closed except for the work crew. \n \n Recent word from Department of Water Resources acting director Bill Croyle was that he did not know if gold had been found in the area. \n \n It’s a moot point because “if anybody gets close to it they will be run off,” said Bob Van Camp, known locally as “Digger Bob.” \n \n Van Camp was the spokesman in 2014 when a 5.18 pound gold nugget was found in the Butte foothills. The man who found the nugget has remained anonymous, but Van Camp was allowed to tell the story. \n \n As for the spillway debris, Van Camp said he believes there is a gold vein that runs from Potter’s Ravine and south, including the area of the spillway. \n \n In addition to panning near waterways, prospectors look for quartz, especially chunks that have been worn smooth by water flow. “Then you go downstream.” \n \n He’ll also walk the higher ground with a metal detector, hoping some of that quartz will give him a strong signal. \n \n Ninety-nine percent of the time the quartz is just quartz, but “now and again,” the quartz will have “some sort of metal in it.” This might mean manganese or silver, “or there may be gold inside.” \n \n Part of the fun in finding gold is knowing it’s something that an old-time gold miner missed, Van Camp said. “I don’t do it for the money. I just do it for the adventure, for the challenge.” \n \n He would love to get his hands dirty in the Diversion Pool at Lake Oroville right now. However, he understands that DWR is working night and day to get the water flow back to normal. \n \n People will be looking at other areas, where gold panning is allowed. After the floods of the mid 1990s, “it was good getting for those of us who knew how to look,” he said. \n \n For an amateur, the adventure could lead to frustration. “But I don’t want to discourage people from learning about history, getting some fresh air and enjoying themselves, even if they don’t find anything.” \n \n Right now, the water is still high. When dry times arrive, more streambed will be exposed, he said. \n \n “I’m going to have a ball this summer.” \n \n Know the rules \n \n The rules have changed for gold miners. Suction dredge equipment is no longer allowed, which includes “mechanized or motorized” systems for removing material from the water. \n \n Contact reporter Heather Hacking at 896-7758.', 'Defense Secretary Ash Carter caused a stir Tuesday when he told the Senate Armed Services Committee that the $500 million program to train and equip “moderate” Syrian rebels to take on the Islamic State had so far yielded just 60 vetted candidates. \n \n Republicans quickly pounced on the number — far short of a goal for at least 5,400 fighters in the first year — as evidence that President Barack Obama’s strategy for defeating the terrorist group isn’t working, a day after the president defended the plan at a rare Pentagon press briefing. And Democrats quickly went into damage-control mode, noting there are valid reasons the number is so small. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) let Carter know during the Senate hearing that his remark had caused a ruckus on cable news, saying he’d just stepped out of the hearing for an appearance on CNN, and all the interviewer wanted to talk about, Nelson said, was Carter’s statement. \n \n The Pentagon chief acknowledged he’d caused a firestorm, saying he wasn’t surprised by all the attention his statement was getting but noting that Congress deserved “to know where things stand.” \n \n It wasn’t exactly the headline the White House was looking for the day after Obama reaffirmed at the Pentagon that his strategy to defeat the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant was working, especially with Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain blasting the president’s commitment to the strategy as delusional. \n \n But Carter’s acknowledgement that so few Syrians have made it through the vetting process also led a number of senators on both sides of the aisle to raise important questions about the viability of the train-and-equip program, asking why it’s so difficult to find moderate rebels willing to take on ISIL. \n \n Among the problems: stringent vetting standards, the U.S. requirement that rebels be willing to fight ISIL but not Syrian President Bashar Assad and the lack of a U.S. commitment to defend these troops from Assad’s advanced weapons. \n \n Carter told the Armed Services panel that about 7,000 volunteers were being screened for the train-and-equip program but that the vetting standards were slowing things down. \n \n The first problem is the basic vetting, which involves background checks, proof of identification and a pledge to obey the basic laws of war. Some volunteers have been booted from the program for simple reasons such as not meeting age requirements, one defense official told POLITICO, while others could not pass one or more layers of screening to protect the U.S. and allied troops conducting the effort. \n \n The second problem is the requirement that the Syrian volunteers must agree only to fight ISIL and not the Assad regime. U.S. officials say the “ISIL-first” strategy is essential because without a political structure in place to replace Assad if he died or left power, chaos in Syria would worsen and the state would fail, like in Libya. \n \n But many Syrians who have been brutalized in the civil war bear more animus toward Assad than toward ISIL, which is one reason why the “ISIL-first” commitment has winnowed out so many people who came forward. \n \n Still, Pentagon officials say they’re optimistic about increasing the throughput at the four sites that have been created for the train-and-equip effort in Turkey, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Qatar. \n \n “As training progresses, we are learning more about the opposition groups and building important relationships, which increases our ability to attract recruits and provides valuable intelligence for counter-ISIL operations,” Carter said. \n \n McCain and other Republicans on the panel were unmoved. \n \n “It is not that we are doing nothing,” the Arizona senator said. “It is that there is no compelling reason to believe that anything we are currently doing will be sufficient to achieve the president’s stated goal of degrading and ultimately destroying ISIL — either in the short term or the long term.” \n \n And he suggested there’s another major reason the U.S. has been having so much trouble with the “moderate” Syrian force — it won’t make any solid commitments to the people it’s recruiting. \n \n Unresolved questions about the support the U.S. would give the fighters have split the Obama administration for years, leading in part to the dismissal of Carter’s predecessor, then-Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel. Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey, who appeared with Carter before the committee Tuesday, acknowledged that a “debate” inside the administration continues about the effect that Assad has on the fight and to what degree his departure would help or hurt it. \n \n For McCain and other critics, the problems are more basic: People won’t sign up to risk their lives unless they’re certain the U.S. is willing to provide air cover, resupply them with ammunition and supplies, and offer other types of support, he said. McCain mocked Carter’s answer about the administration’s absence of a policy, saying that no wonder Syrians wouldn’t agree to join if the answer they got was that a “decision will be made later.” \n \n “It’s shameful to send people in and not assure them that we will defend them from attacks by barrel bombs,” McCain said. \n \n McCain, who has been Obama’s foremost foreign-policy critic, had several other heated exchanges with Carter during Tuesday’s hearing. The Pentagon chief sought to provide some cover for the president by offering examples of progress in the U.S.-led campaign to defeat the terrorist group that has declared its own state. \n \n Carter said the more than 5,000 airstrikes carried out by the United States and its coalition partners have “produced some clear tactical results,” putting ISIL “on the defensive,” with “its stronghold in Raqqah under pressure.” \n \n But the defense secretary also acknowledged setbacks, making clear the administration was not even close to where it had hoped to be in its efforts to train Iraqi and Syrian forces. \n \n As of June 30, he said, “we’ve only received enough trainees to be able to train” about 10,800 Iraqi troops, with an additional 4,600 in training. “I’ve told Iraqi leaders that while the United States is open to supporting Iraq more than we already are, we must see a greater commitment from all parts of the Iraqi government,” Carter said. \n \n And in Syria, he explained, the administration’s efforts to train and equip a force to take on ISIL were still in the “early stages.” \n \n “President Obama’s comments yesterday at the Pentagon reveal a disturbing degree of self-delusion,” McCain said. “None of the so-called progress that the president cited suggests that we are on a path to success.” \n \n Several Democrats stepped in to defend the defense secretary, including the panel’s ranking member, Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island. \n \n “The pipeline is about 7,000,” Reed told POLITICO. “From that I think you’ll start seeing increased numbers. And then when you reach a critical mass, you start raising the question of where are they deployed, how are they deployed, are they supported.” \n \n But, Reed was quick to add, “It’s going to take time.”']",3,"– This winter's flooding in Northern California has done more than bring relief after years of drought; it's created the prospect of the best gold prospecting in 20 years. Gold hunters in the area tell the Chico Enterprise-Record the floods have ""rearranged the rivers"" and ""move things around."" That means gold veins that have been hidden for 200 years are suddenly exposed. According to CBS San Francisco, the floods also swept gold out of abandoned mines and washed it downriver. While KCRA reports that gold can simply be picked off the ground following major flooding, the best prospecting will come in the summer months when the water has receded. Right now, rivers are still high and government workers are trying to keep would-be prospectors away while they get things under control. But in the summer—which experts say could be the busiest since the one that followed major flooding in 1997—stream beds will be exposed for better gold hunting. ""I'm going to have a ball,"" one prospector tells the Chico newspaper. The epicenter for the new gold rush could be the Oroville Dam, which nearly catastrophically flooded this winter and required the use of an emergency spillway for the first time.

You can get your toes shortened or lengthened, your bunions removed, and even get fat injected into the bottoms of your feet so you have a permanent Dr. Scholls made of flesh, according to the New York Times‘s report on the surgery-for-shoes phenomenon. \n \n Apparently women get surgery to correct “high heel foot” (when your foot is stuck in the shape of a high heel) or “hitchhikers toe,” (when your big toe sticks out.) Some doctors have even gotten requests for toe liposuction, which they’ve denied. Dr. Oliver Zong, who founded NYC Footcare and coined the term “toebesity,” once had a woman ask him to remove her pinkie toe (he didn’t do it.) \n \n “Cinderella surgery” is just the latest in a long line of gross things women do to fit into clothes. Some women elect to have botox injected into their calves to slim them down for certain boots and skinnyjeans (although the process is dangerous, because of the major arteries in the legs). People get butt implants to channel Beyonce and J.Lo. Even guys are getting beard implants so they can participate in the lumberjack fad. \n \n Let’s just take second to remember that in the original Grimm’s fairy tale, the evil stepsisters cut off their heels and toes to try to fit into the glass slipper. Then they got their eyes pecked out by pigeons for being shallow. Just saying. \n \n [NYT]']",3,"– The messiness continues between Goldie Hawn's oldest children and their father, Bill Hudson.

Bill Hudson broke his silence yesterday, saying that he was disowning his famous children. ""I would ask them to stop using the Hudson name,"" he says in what the Daily Mail calls a ""searingly raw interview."" ""They are no longer a part of my life.

There are the usual camp activities like ziplining and canoeing, alongside screenings of his films, ‘Blood Mary Bingo’, Hairspray karaoke, burlesque lessons, a ‘Scotch and Cigars’ session and a costume contest judged by the Prince of Puke.

72,"['Latter-day Saints believe that the marriage of one man and one woman is the Lord’s standing law of marriage. In biblical times, the Lord commanded some to practice plural marriage—the marriage of one man and more than one woman. 1 By revelation, the Lord commanded Joseph Smith to institute the practice of plural marriage among Church members in the early 1840s. For more than half a century, plural marriage was practiced by some Latter-day Saints under the direction of the Church President. 2 \n \n Latter-day Saints do not understand all of God’s purposes in instituting, through His prophets, the practice of plural marriage. The Book of Mormon identifies one reason for God to command it: to increase the number of children born in the gospel covenant in order to “raise up seed unto [the Lord].”3 \n \n Plural marriage did result in the birth of large numbers of children within faithful Latter-day Saint homes. It also shaped 19th-century Mormon society in many ways: marriage became available to virtually all who desired it; per-capita inequality of wealth was diminished as economically disadvantaged women married into more financially stable households; and ethnic intermarriages were increased, which helped to unite a diverse immigrant population. Plural marriage also helped create and strengthen a sense of cohesion and group identification among Latter-day Saints. Church members came to see themselves as a “peculiar people,” covenant-bound to carry out the commands of God despite outside opposition.4 \n \n The Beginnings of Plural Marriage in the Church \n \n Polygamy had been permitted for millennia in many cultures and religions, but, with few exceptions, it was rejected in Western cultures. In Joseph Smith’s time, monogamy was the only legal form of marriage in the United States. \n \n The revelation on plural marriage, recorded in Doctrine and Covenants 132, emerged partly from Joseph Smith’s study of the Old Testament in 1831. Latter-day Saints understood that they were living in the latter days, in what the revelations called the “dispensation of the fulness of times.”5 Ancient principles—such as prophets, priesthood, and temples—would be restored to the earth. Plural marriage, practiced by ancient patriarchs like Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Moses, was one of those ancient principles.6 \n \n The same revelation that taught of plural marriage was embedded within a revelation about eternal marriage—the teaching that marriage could last beyond death. Monogamous and plural marriages performed by priesthood power could seal loved ones to each other for eternity, on condition of righteousness.7 \n \n The revelation on marriage stated general principles; it did not explain how to implement plural marriage in all its particulars. In Nauvoo, Joseph Smith married additional wives and authorized other Latter-day Saints to practice plural marriage. The practice was introduced carefully and incrementally, and participants vowed to keep their participation confidential, anticipating a time when husbands and wives could acknowledge one another publicly. \n \n If you would like to learn more about the beginnings of plural marriage in the Church, click here. \n \n Plural Marriage and Families in 19th-Century Utah \n \n Between 1852 and 1890, Latter-day Saints openly practiced plural marriage. Most plural families lived in Utah. Women and men who lived within plural marriage attested to challenges and difficulties but also to the love and joy they found within their families. They believed it was a commandment of God at that time and that obedience would bring great blessings to them and their posterity. Church leaders taught that participants in plural marriages should seek to develop a generous spirit of unselfishness and the pure love of Christ for everyone involved. \n \n Although some leaders had large polygamous families, two-thirds of polygamist men had only two wives at a time. Church leaders recognized that plural marriages could be particularly difficult for women. Divorce was therefore available to women who were unhappy in their marriages; remarriage was also readily available. Women sometimes married at young ages in the first decade of Utah settlement, which was typical of women living in frontier areas at the time. At its peak in 1857, perhaps one half of all Utah Latter-day Saints experienced plural marriage as a husband, wife, or child. The percentage of those involved in plural marriage steadily declined over the next three decades. \n \n During the years that plural marriage was publicly taught, not all Latter-day Saints were expected to live the principle, though all were expected to accept it as a revelation from God. Indeed, this system of marriage could not have been universal due to the ratio of men to women. Women were free to choose their spouses, whether to enter into a polygamous or a monogamous union, or whether to marry at all. Some men entered plural marriage because they were asked to do so by Church leaders, while others initiated the process themselves; all were required to obtain the approval of Church leaders before entering a plural marriage. \n \n If you would like to learn more about plural marriage and families in Utah, click here. \n \n Anti-Polygamy Legislation and the End of Plural Marriage \n \n Beginning in 1862, the U.S. government passed laws against the practice of plural marriage. After the U.S. Supreme Court found the anti-polygamy laws to be constitutional in 1879, federal officials began prosecuting polygamous husbands and wives during the 1880s. Believing these laws to be unjust, Latter-day Saints engaged in civil disobedience by continuing to practice plural marriage and by attempting to avoid arrest by moving to the homes of friends or family or by hiding under assumed names. When convicted, they paid fines and submitted to jail time. \n \n One of the anti-polygamy laws permitted the U.S. government to seize Church property. Federal officers soon threatened to take Latter-day Saint temples. The work of salvation for both the living and the dead was now in jeopardy. In September 1890, Church President Wilford Woodruff felt inspired to issue the Manifesto. “Inasmuch as laws have been enacted by Congress forbidding plural marriages,” President Woodruff explained, “I hereby declare my intention to submit to those laws, and to use my influence with the members of the Church over which I preside to have them do likewise.”8 \n \n The full implications of the document were not apparent at first. The Lord’s way is to speak “line upon line; here a little, there a little.”9 Like the beginning of plural marriage in the Church, the end of the practice was gradual and incremental, a process filled with difficulties and uncertainties. \n \n The Manifesto declared President Woodruff’s intention to submit to the laws of the United States, and new plural marriages within that jurisdiction largely came to an end. But a small number of plural marriages continued to be performed in Mexico and Canada, under the sanction of some Church leaders. As a rule, these marriages were not promoted by Church leaders and were difficult to get approved. Either one or both of the spouses who entered into these unions typically had to agree to remain in Canada or Mexico. On an exceptional basis, a smaller number of plural marriages were performed within the United States between the years 1890 and 1904. \n \n The Church’s role in these marriages became a subject of intense public debate after Reed Smoot, an Apostle, was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1903. At the April 1904 general conference, Church President Joseph F. Smith issued a forceful statement, known as the Second Manifesto, making new plural marriages punishable by excommunication.10 Since President Smith’s day, Church Presidents have repeatedly emphasized that the Church and its members are no longer authorized to enter into plural marriage and have underscored the sincerity of their words by urging local leaders to bring noncompliant members before Church disciplinary councils. \n \n If you would like to learn more about the end of plural marriage in the Church, click here. \n \n Conclusion \n \n Plural marriage was among the most challenging aspects of the Restoration. For many who practiced it, plural marriage was a trial of faith. It violated both cultural and legal norms, leading to persecution and revilement. Despite these hardships, plural marriage benefited the Church in innumerable ways. Through the lineage of these 19th-century Saints have come many Latter-day Saints who have been faithful to their gospel covenants as righteous mothers and fathers; loyal disciples of Jesus Christ; devoted Church members, leaders, and missionaries; and good citizens and prominent public officials. Modern Latter-day Saints honor and respect these faithful pioneers who gave so much for their faith, families, and community. \n \n Resources \n \n The Church acknowledges the contribution of scholars to the historical content presented in this article; their work is used with permission. \n \n Originally published October 2014.', 'After receiving a revelation commanding him to practice plural marriage, Joseph Smith married multiple wives and introduced the practice to close associates. This principle was among the most challenging aspects of the Restoration—for Joseph personally and for other Church members. Plural marriage tested faith and provoked controversy and opposition. Few Latter-day Saints initially welcomed the restoration of a biblical practice entirely foreign to their sensibilities. But many later testified of powerful spiritual experiences that helped them overcome their hesitation and gave them courage to accept this practice. \n \n Latter-day Saints believe that monogamy—the marriage of one man and one woman—is the Lord’s standing law of marriage. 1 In biblical times, the Lord commanded some of His people to practice plural marriage—the marriage of one man and more than one woman. 2 Some early members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints also received and obeyed this commandment given through God’s prophets. \n \n Although the Lord commanded the adoption—and later the cessation—of plural marriage in the latter days, He did not give exact instructions on how to obey the commandment. Significant social and cultural changes often include misunderstandings and difficulties. Church leaders and members experienced these challenges as they heeded the command to practice plural marriage and again later as they worked to discontinue it after Church President Wilford Woodruff issued an inspired statement known as the Manifesto in 1890, which led to the end of plural marriage in the Church. Through it all, Church leaders and members sought to follow God’s will. \n \n Many details about the early practice of plural marriage are unknown. Plural marriage was introduced among the early Saints incrementally, and participants were asked to keep their actions confidential. They did not discuss their experiences publicly or in writing until after the Latter-day Saints had moved to Utah and Church leaders had publicly acknowledged the practice. The historical record of early plural marriage is therefore thin: few records of the time provide details, and later reminiscences are not always reliable. Some ambiguity will always accompany our knowledge about this issue. Like the participants, we “see through a glass, darkly” and are asked to walk by faith.3 \n \n The Beginnings of Plural Marriage in the Church \n \n The revelation on plural marriage was not written down until 1843, but its early verses suggest that part of it emerged from Joseph Smith’s study of the Old Testament in 1831. People who knew Joseph well later stated he received the revelation about that time.4 The revelation, recorded in Doctrine and Covenants 132, states that Joseph prayed to know why God justified Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, David, and Solomon in having many wives. The Lord responded that He had commanded them to enter into the practice.5 \n \n Latter-day Saints understood that they were living in the latter days, in what the revelations called the “dispensation of the fulness of times.”6 Ancient principles—such as prophets, priesthood, and temples—would be restored to the earth. Plural marriage was one of those ancient principles. \n \n Polygamy had been permitted for millennia in many cultures and religions, but, with few exceptions, was rejected in Western cultures.7 In Joseph Smith’s time, monogamy was the only legal form of marriage in the United States. Joseph knew the practice of plural marriage would stir up public ire. After receiving the commandment, he taught a few associates about it, but he did not spread this teaching widely in the 1830s.8 \n \n When God commands a difficult task, He sometimes sends additional messengers to encourage His people to obey. Consistent with this pattern, Joseph told associates that an angel appeared to him three times between 1834 and 1842 and commanded him to proceed with plural marriage when he hesitated to move forward. During the third and final appearance, the angel came with a drawn sword, threatening Joseph with destruction unless he went forward and obeyed the commandment fully.9 \n \n Fragmentary evidence suggests that Joseph Smith acted on the angel’s first command by marrying a plural wife, Fanny Alger, in Kirtland, Ohio, in the mid-1830s. Several Latter-day Saints who had lived in Kirtland reported decades later that Joseph Smith had married Alger, who lived and worked in the Smith household, after he had obtained her consent and that of her parents.10 Little is known about this marriage, and nothing is known about the conversations between Joseph and Emma regarding Alger. After the marriage with Alger ended in separation, Joseph seems to have set the subject of plural marriage aside until after the Church moved to Nauvoo, Illinois. \n \n Plural Marriage and Eternal Marriage \n \n The same revelation that taught of plural marriage was part of a larger revelation given to Joseph Smith—that marriage could last beyond death and that eternal marriage was essential to inheriting the fulness that God desires for His children. As early as 1840, Joseph Smith privately taught Apostle Parley P. Pratt that the “heavenly order” allowed Pratt and his wife to be together “for time and all eternity.”11 Joseph also taught that men like Pratt—who had remarried following the death of his first wife—could be married (or sealed) to their wives for eternity, under the proper conditions.12 \n \n The sealing of husband and wife for eternity was made possible by the restoration of priesthood keys and ordinances. On April 3, 1836, the Old Testament prophet Elijah appeared to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery in the Kirtland Temple and restored the priesthood keys necessary to perform ordinances for the living and the dead, including sealing families together.13 Marriages performed by priesthood authority could link loved ones to each other for eternity, on condition of righteousness; marriages performed without this authority would end at death.14 \n \n Marriage performed by priesthood authority meant that the procreation of children and perpetuation of families would continue into the eternities. Joseph Smith’s revelation on marriage declared that the “continuation of the seeds forever and ever” helped to fulfill God’s purposes for His children.15 This promise was given to all couples who were married by priesthood authority and were faithful to their covenants. \n \n Plural Marriage in Nauvoo \n \n For much of Western history, family “interest”—economic, political, and social considerations—dominated the choice of spouse. Parents had the power to arrange marriages or forestall unions of which they disapproved. By the late 1700s, romance and personal choice began to rival these traditional motives and practices.16 By Joseph Smith’s time, many couples insisted on marrying for love, as he and Emma did when they eloped against her parents’ wishes. \n \n Latter-day Saints’ motives for plural marriage were often more religious than economic or romantic. Besides the desire to be obedient, a strong incentive was the hope of living in God’s presence with family members. In the revelation on marriage, the Lord promised participants “crowns of eternal lives” and “exaltation in the eternal worlds.”17 Men and women, parents and children, ancestors and progeny were to be “sealed” to each other—their commitment lasting into the eternities, consistent with Jesus’s promise that priesthood ordinances performed on earth could be “bound in heaven.”18 \n \n The first plural marriage in Nauvoo took place when Louisa Beaman and Joseph Smith were sealed in April 1841.19 Joseph married many additional wives and authorized other Latter-day Saints to practice plural marriage. The practice spread slowly at first. By June 1844, when Joseph died, approximately 29 men and 50 women had entered into plural marriage, in addition to Joseph and his wives. When the Saints entered the Salt Lake Valley in 1847, at least 196 men and 521 women had entered into plural marriages.20 Participants in these early plural marriages pledged to keep their involvement confidential, though they anticipated a time when the practice would be publicly acknowledged. \n \n Nevertheless, rumors spread. A few men unscrupulously used these rumors to seduce women to join them in an unauthorized practice sometimes referred to as “spiritual wifery.” When this was discovered, the men were cut off from the Church.21 The rumors prompted members and leaders to issue carefully worded denials that denounced spiritual wifery and polygamy but were silent about what Joseph Smith and others saw as divinely mandated “celestial” plural marriage.22 The statements emphasized that the Church practiced no marital law other than monogamy while implicitly leaving open the possibility that individuals, under direction of God’s living prophet, might do so.23 \n \n Joseph Smith and Plural Marriage \n \n During the era in which plural marriage was practiced, Latter-day Saints distinguished between sealings for time and eternity and sealings for eternity only. Sealings for time and eternity included commitments and relationships during this life, generally including the possibility of sexual relations. Eternity-only sealings indicated relationships in the next life alone. \n \n Evidence indicates that Joseph Smith participated in both types of sealings. The exact number of women to whom he was sealed in his lifetime is unknown because the evidence is fragmentary.24 Some of the women who were sealed to Joseph Smith later testified that their marriages were for time and eternity, while others indicated that their relationships were for eternity alone.25 \n \n Most of those sealed to Joseph Smith were between 20 and 40 years of age at the time of their sealing to him. The oldest, Fanny Young, was 56 years old. The youngest was Helen Mar Kimball, daughter of Joseph’s close friends Heber C. and Vilate Murray Kimball, who was sealed to Joseph several months before her 15th birthday. Marriage at such an age, inappropriate by today’s standards, was legal in that era, and some women married in their mid-teens.26 Helen Mar Kimball spoke of her sealing to Joseph as being “for eternity alone,” suggesting that the relationship did not involve sexual relations.27 After Joseph’s death, Helen remarried and became an articulate defender of him and of plural marriage.28 \n \n Following his marriage to Louisa Beaman and before he married other single women, Joseph Smith was sealed to a number of women who were already married.29 Neither these women nor Joseph explained much about these sealings, though several women said they were for eternity alone.30 Other women left no records, making it unknown whether their sealings were for time and eternity or were for eternity alone. \n \n There are several possible explanations for this practice. These sealings may have provided a way to create an eternal bond or link between Joseph’s family and other families within the Church.31 These ties extended both vertically, from parent to child, and horizontally, from one family to another. Today such eternal bonds are achieved through the temple marriages of individuals who are also sealed to their own birth families, in this way linking families together. Joseph Smith’s sealings to women already married may have been an early version of linking one family to another. In Nauvoo, most if not all of the first husbands seem to have continued living in the same household with their wives during Joseph’s lifetime, and complaints about these sealings with Joseph Smith are virtually absent from the documentary record.32 \n \n These sealings may also be explained by Joseph’s reluctance to enter plural marriage because of the sorrow it would bring to his wife Emma. He may have believed that sealings to married women would comply with the Lord’s command without requiring him to have normal marriage relationships.33 This could explain why, according to Lorenzo Snow, the angel reprimanded Joseph for having “demurred” on plural marriage even after he had entered into the practice.34 After this rebuke, according to this interpretation, Joseph returned primarily to sealings with single women. \n \n Another possibility is that, in an era when life spans were shorter than they are today, faithful women felt an urgency to be sealed by priesthood authority. Several of these women were married either to non-Mormons or former Mormons, and more than one of the women later expressed unhappiness in their present marriages. Living in a time when divorce was difficult to obtain, these women may have believed a sealing to Joseph Smith would give them blessings they might not otherwise receive in the next life.35 \n \n The women who united with Joseph Smith in plural marriage risked reputation and self-respect in being associated with a principle so foreign to their culture and so easily misunderstood by others. “I made a greater sacrifice than to give my life,” said Zina Huntington Jacobs, “for I never anticipated again to be looked upon as an honorable woman.” Nevertheless, she wrote, “I searched the scripture & by humble prayer to my Heavenly Father I obtained a testimony for myself.”36 After Joseph’s death, most of the women sealed to him moved to Utah with the Saints, remained faithful Church members, and defended both plural marriage and Joseph.37 \n \n Joseph and Emma \n \n Plural marriage was difficult for all involved. For Joseph Smith’s wife Emma, it was an excruciating ordeal. Records of Emma’s reactions to plural marriage are sparse; she left no firsthand accounts, making it impossible to reconstruct her thoughts. Joseph and Emma loved and respected each other deeply. After he had entered into plural marriage, he poured out his feelings in his journal for his “beloved Emma,” whom he described as “undaunted, firm and unwavering, unchangeable, affectionate Emma.” After Joseph’s death, Emma kept a lock of his hair in a locket she wore around her neck.38 \n \n Emma approved, at least for a time, of four of Joseph Smith’s plural marriages in Nauvoo, and she accepted all four of those wives into her household. She may have approved of other marriages as well.39 But Emma likely did not know about all of Joseph’s sealings.40 She vacillated in her view of plural marriage, at some points supporting it and at other times denouncing it. \n \n In the summer of 1843, Joseph Smith dictated the revelation on marriage, a lengthy and complex text containing both glorious promises and stern warnings, some directed at Emma.41 The revelation instructed women and men that they must obey God’s law and commands in order to receive the fulness of His glory. \n \n The revelation on marriage required that a wife give her consent before her husband could enter into plural marriage.42 Nevertheless, toward the end of the revelation, the Lord said that if the first wife “receive not this law”—the command to practice plural marriage—the husband would be “exempt from the law of Sarah,” presumably the requirement that the husband gain the consent of the first wife before marrying additional women.43 After Emma opposed plural marriage, Joseph was placed in an agonizing dilemma, forced to choose between the will of God and the will of his beloved Emma. He may have thought Emma’s rejection of plural marriage exempted him from the law of Sarah. Her decision to “receive not this law” permitted him to marry additional wives without her consent. Because of Joseph’s early death and Emma’s decision to remain in Nauvoo and not discuss plural marriage after the Church moved west, many aspects of their story remain known only to the two of them. \n \n Trial and Spiritual Witness \n \n Years later in Utah, participants in Nauvoo plural marriage discussed their motives for entering into the practice. God declared in the Book of Mormon that monogamy was the standard; at times, however, He commanded plural marriage so His people could “raise up seed unto [Him].”44 Plural marriage did result in an increased number of children born to believing parents.45 \n \n Some Saints also saw plural marriage as a redemptive process of sacrifice and spiritual refinement. According to Helen Mar Kimball, Joseph Smith stated that “the practice of this principle would be the hardest trial the Saints would ever have to test their faith.” Though it was one of the “severest” trials of her life, she testified that it had also been “one of the greatest blessings.”46 Her father, Heber C. Kimball, agreed. “I never felt more sorrowful,” he said of the moment he learned of plural marriage in 1841. “I wept days. … I had a good wife. I was satisfied.”47 \n \n The decision to accept such a wrenching trial usually came only after earnest prayer and intense soul-searching. Brigham Young said that, upon learning of plural marriage, “it was the first time in my life that I had desired the grave.”48 “I had to pray unceasingly,” he said, “and I had to exercise faith and the Lord revealed to me the truth of it and that satisfied me.”49 Heber C. Kimball found comfort only after his wife Vilate had a visionary experience attesting to the rightness of plural marriage. “She told me,” Vilate’s daughter later recalled, “she never saw so happy a man as father was when she described the vision and told him she was satisfied and knew it was from God.”50 \n \n Lucy Walker recalled her inner turmoil when Joseph Smith invited her to become his wife. “Every feeling of my soul revolted against it,” she wrote. Yet, after several restless nights on her knees in prayer, she found relief as her room “filled with a holy influence” akin to “brilliant sunshine.” She said, “My soul was filled with a calm sweet peace that I never knew,” and “supreme happiness took possession of my whole being.”51 \n \n Not all had such experiences. Some Latter-day Saints rejected the principle of plural marriage and left the Church, while others declined to enter the practice but remained faithful.52 Nevertheless, for many women and men, initial revulsion and anguish was followed by struggle, resolution, and ultimately, light and peace. Sacred experiences enabled the Saints to move forward in faith.53 \n \n Conclusion \n \n The challenge of introducing a principle as controversial as plural marriage is almost impossible to overstate. A spiritual witness of its truthfulness allowed Joseph Smith and other Latter-day Saints to accept this principle. Difficult as it was, the introduction of plural marriage in Nauvoo did indeed “raise up seed” unto God. A substantial number of today’s members descend through faithful Latter-day Saints who practiced plural marriage. \n \n Church members no longer practice plural marriage.54 Consistent with Joseph Smith’s teachings, the Church permits a man whose wife has died to be sealed to another woman when he remarries. Moreover, members are permitted to perform ordinances on behalf of deceased men and women who married more than once on earth, sealing them to all of the spouses to whom they were legally married. The precise nature of these relationships in the next life is not known, and many family relationships will be sorted out in the life to come. Latter-day Saints are encouraged to trust in our wise Heavenly Father, who loves His children and does all things for their growth and salvation.55 \n \n Resources \n \n The Church acknowledges the contribution of scholars to the historical content presented in this article; their work is used with permission. \n \n Originally published October 2014.', 'Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

It provides a look at the cultural touchstones that shape the lives of students entering college this fall. The creation of Beloit’s Keefer Professor of the Humanities Tom McBride and former Public Affairs Director Ron Nief, it was originally created as a reminder to faculty to be aware of dated references, and quickly became a catalog of the rapidly changing worldview of each new generation. The Mindset List website at www.beloit.edu/mindset, the Mediasite webcast and its Facebook page receive more than 400,000 hits annually. \n \n The class of 2014 has never found Korean-made cars unusual on the Interstate and five hundred cable channels, of which they will watch a handful, have always been the norm. Since ""digital"" has always been in the cultural DNA, they\'ve never written in cursive and with cell phones to tell them the time, there is no need for a wrist watch. Dirty Harry (who’s that?) is to them a great Hollywood director. The America they have inherited is one of soaring American trade and budget deficits; Russia has presumably never aimed nukes at the United States and China has always posed an economic threat. \n \n Nonetheless, they plan to enjoy college. The males among them are likely to be a minority. They will be armed with iPhones and BlackBerries, on which making a phone call will be only one of many, many functions they will perform. They will now be awash with a computerized technology that will not distinguish information and knowledge. So it will be up to their professors to help them. A generation accustomed to instant access will need to acquire the patience of scholarship. They will discover how to research information in books and journals and not just on-line. Their professors, who might be tempted to think that they are hip enough and therefore ready and relevant to teach the new generation, might remember that Kurt Cobain is now on the classic oldies station. The college class of 2014 reminds us, once again, that a generation comes and goes in the blink of our eyes, which are, like the rest of us, getting older and older. \n \n Most students entering college for the first time this fall—the Class of 2014—were born in 1992. \n \n For these students, Benny Hill, Sam Kinison, Sam Walton, Bert Parks and Tony Perkins have always been dead. \n \n 1.

The essay explains that Smith was ordered to take multiple wives by an angel who visited him three times between 1834 and 1842; in the last instance, the angel was armed with a sword and threatened a reluctant Smith. The leader, then married to first wife Emma, took his first plural wife, Fanny Alger, in Kirtland, Ohio. Smith and Alger ultimately separated, and the church relocated to Nauvoo, Ill., where he married many more women. The oldest was 56, and the youngest was 14-year-old Helen Mar Kimball; some were already married, a revelation the New York Times describes as the ""biggest bombshell for some."" The essay explains that a number of marriages, including that with Kimball, were sealed ""for eternity alone,"" suggesting sexual relations weren't involved (the ones that did involve sex were ""for time and eternity""). What did Emma think of all this? Per the essay, she was none too pleased, though at one time she did accept four of Smith's wives into their home. And what was the reasoning behind what the essay describes as the ""wrenching trial"" of polygamy? Kimball said Smith told her that ""the practice of this principle would be the hardest trial the Saints would ever have to test their faith."" Two more essays discuss plural marriage in the church's later years; they're part of an effort the church is making to share ""reliable, faith-promoting"" info about its past, the church's historian tells the Times. (Part of that effort: an explanation of its undergarments.)"

John McCain of Arizona and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska — plus Blunt, Moran and South Dakota Sen.

Democratic state Attorney General Lisa Madigan has been mentioned as a candidate in Illinois. Former Sen. Russ Feingold (D-Wis.) could opt for a rematch against Johnson. And two names have surfaced in Pennsylvania: Attorney General Kathleen Kane and former Rep. Joe Sestak (D), who’s raising money for a rematch of his 2010 loss. \n \n Toomey’s war chest sits at $5.4 million in cash at the end of September, Kirk has $1.5 million and Johnson has $669,000.

Consider that Democrats lost 63 seats in the 2010 midterms are expected to lose five to 12 (or maybe more) seats on Tuesday. No president has lost as many in back-to-back midterms since Harry Truman lost 83 in 1946 and 1950, writes Stuart Rothenberg. Dwight Eisenhower managed to lose a total of 66, but Obama seems on track to top him. More typical is the pattern of Bill Clinton, who lost 54 in 1994 but bounced back with a gain of five in 1998. Still, if Tuesday is shaping up to be a night of celebration for the GOP, Politico offers a reality check, at least in the Senate: Several first-term Republicans in vulnerable states will be up for re-election in 2016. So even if Republicans win a small majority this year, they might have to give it right back two years later."
74,"['Humankind’s common ancestor with other mammals may have been a roughly rat-size animal that weighed no more than a half a pound, had a long furry tail and lived on insects. \n \n In a comprehensive six-year study of the mammalian family tree, scientists have identified and reconstructed what they say is the most likely common ancestor of the many species on the most abundant and diverse branch of that tree — the branch of creatures that nourish their young in utero through a placenta. The work appears to support the view that in the global extinctions some 66 million years ago, all non-avian dinosaurs had to die for mammals to flourish. \n \n Scientists had been searching for just such a common genealogical link and have found it in a lowly occupant of the fossil record, Protungulatum donnae, that until now has been so obscure that it lacks a colloquial nickname. But as researchers reported Thursday in the journal Science, the animal had several anatomical characteristics for live births that anticipated all placental mammals and led to some 5,400 living species, from shrews to elephants, bats to whales, cats to dogs and, not least, humans. \n \n A team of researchers described the discovery as an important insight into the pattern and timing of early mammal life and a demonstration of the capabilities of a new system for handling copious amounts of fossil and genetic data in the service of evolutionary biology. The formidable new technology is expected to be widely applied in years ahead to similar investigations of plants, insects, fish and fowl. \n \n Given some belated stature by an artist’s brush, the animal hardly looks the part of a progenitor of so many mammals (which do not include marsupials, like kangaroos and opossums, or monotremes, egg-laying mammals like the duck-billed platypus). \n \n Maureen A. O’Leary of Stony Brook University on Long Island, a leader of the project and the principal author of the journal report, wrote that a combination of genetic and anatomical data established that the ancestor emerged within 200,000 to 400,000 years after the great dying at the end of the Cretaceous period. At the time, the meek were rapidly inheriting the earth from hulking predators like T. rex. \n \n Within another two million to three million years, Dr. O’Leary said, the first members of modern placental orders appeared in such profusion that researchers have started to refer to the explosive model of mammalian evolution. The common ancestor itself appeared more than 36 million years later than had been estimated based on genetic data alone. \n \n Although some small primitive mammals had lived in the shadow of the great Cretaceous reptiles, the scientists could not find evidence supporting an earlier hypothesis that up to 39 placental mammalian lineages survived to enter the post-extinction world. Only the stem lineage to Placentalia, they said, appeared to hang on through the catastrophe, generally associated with climate change after an asteroid crashed into Earth. \n \n The research team drew on combined fossil evidence and genetic data encoded in DNA in evaluating the ancestor’s standing as an early placental mammal. Among characteristics associated with full-term live births, the Protungulatum species was found to have a two-horned uterus and a placenta in which the maternal blood came in close contact with the membranes surrounding the fetus, as in humans. \n \n The ancestor’s younger age, the scientists said, ruled out the breakup of the supercontinent of Gondwana around 120 million years ago as a direct factor in the diversification of mammals, as has sometimes been speculated. Evidence of the common ancestor was found in North America, but the animal may have existed on other continents as well. \n \n The publicly accessible database responsible for the findings is called MorphoBank, with advanced software for handling the largest compilation yet of data and images on mammals living and extinct. “This has stretched our own expertise,” Dr. O’Leary, an anatomist, said in an interview. \n \n “The findings were not a total surprise,” she said. “But it’s an important discovery because it relies on lots of information from fossils and also molecular data. Other scientists, at least a thousand, some from other countries, are already signing up to use MorphoBank.”', 'What\'s cute and furry and has a name only a paleontologist could love? \n \n A tiny theoretical creature dubbed the ""hypothetical placental mammal ancestor"" is stealing the hearts of some evolutionary biologists — and annoying others — as it raises new debate over just when our early mammal ancestors began diversifying across the globe. \n \n In a paper published this week in the journal Science, an international team of researchers described how they used a vast database of fossil and anatomical data, as well as DNA evidence, to reverse-engineer an ancestor to the largest group of living mammals. \n \n The scientists theorized that this hypothetical critter would have begun to diversify into new species of mammals after the demise of the dinosaurs roughly 66 million years ago — a concept at odds with some current thinking. \n \n ""This is fairly novel, to reconstruct an ancestor,"" said study coauthor and paleontologist Mike Novacek, the provost of science at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. ""I don\'t know of any other."" \n \n Placental mammals, including humans, make up the largest branch of the mammalian family tree. Only marsupials and a small number of egg-laying mammals are excluded. \n \n For the last several decades, scientists have debated just when it was that placental mammals began their explosive proliferation. Estimates based on DNA, or so-called molecular evidence, suggest that placental mammals appeared in the mid-Cretaceous period when dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurus rex and Triceratops still trod the Earth. \n \n However, scientists have yet to uncover evidence of placental fossils during this period, according to the authors of the new study. They argue that this is because placental mammals began to diversify only several hundred thousand years after the demise of non-avian dinosaurs, in the Paleocene epoch. \n \n ""An environment that radically changed may have offered more opportunities for a new group to take form and radiate,"" Novacek said. \n \n Using a vast online database called Morphobank, the team of 23 scientists built a composite of the hypothetical ancestor based on the morphology, or appearance, of existing and extinct animals, along with the DNA data. Study coauthor Maureen O\'Leary, a paleontologist at Stony Brook University in New York, likened the process to reassembling a crime scene from thousands of bits of evidence. \n \n Over a period of six years, the researchers developed a highly specific picture of an unassuming little animal whose descendants would one day include whales, bats, lions and people. \n \n ""The placental ancestor was a scampering species that had a diet of insects, a fleshy nose, a light underbelly in its fur, and a long tail,"" O\'Leary said. ""It was larger than a mouse, but smaller than a rat."" \n \n Based on their findings, the scientists said placental mammals began their spread about 36 million years later than estimates based on the DNA-derived molecular clock model. \n \n The research team also contradicted the molecular clock-based theory that placental mammals developed into different species because of the fragmentation of the supercontinent Gondwana, millions of years before the dinosaurs vanished. In addition, the study concluded that a subset of placental mammals known as Afrotheria, which includes elephants and aardvarks, did not originate in Africa as commonly believed; instead, authors say they arose in the Americas. \n \n Not all evolutionary biologists have fallen in love with the furry, hypothetical bug eater, however. Argument over the rise of placental mammals is likely to continue for some time. \n \n ""The bottom line is that this study is not convincing and will not settle the debate,"" said Mark Springer, an evolutionary geneticist at UC Riverside who was not part of the research team. \n \n Using fossils to establish branches of a family tree can result in mistaken groupings of species, Springer said, because some traits are passed along by related species while other traits develop in parallel with more distantly related species. This is known as convergent evolution, and Springer said he was not convinced that study authors had addressed that issue. \n \n Study coauthor Novacek said he did not expect the paper to end discussion on the matter, but he hoped it would add weight to an ongoing argument. \n \n ""I think this will reinforce the notion that the fossil record is not in agreement with what\'s been reconstructed by molecular clocks,"" Novacek said. ""As data accumulates, the case for this late origin becomes better and better."" \n \n Another debate is brewing over whether the hypothetical creature deserves a less cumbersome moniker. \n \n ""People who think this organism is cute have asked me for a name,"" Novacek said. ""I tell them we can\'t give it a Latin name, because it never really existed."" \n \n monte.morin@latimes.com', 'The study also found that older people still in first marriages have sex more often than those who have remarried \n \n While people in the early years of marriage have sex more frequently, and their sexual activity tapers off over time, a slight rebound occurs for those whose marriages endure longer than half a century, according to new research. \n \n The study also found that people who remain in their first marriages have sex more frequently than those who remarry. But frequency aside, marriage order made no difference when it came to actual physical pleasure and emotional satisfaction, said researchers from Louisiana State University, Florida State University and Baylor University. \n \n Their study -- ""Marital Characteristics and the Sexual Relationships of U.S. Older Adults: An Analysis of National Social Life, Health and Aging Project Data"" -- is published in the journal Archives of Sexual Behavior, the official publication of the International Academy of Sex Research. \n \n Researchers analyzed the relationship between marital characteristics and sexual outcomes among 1,656 married adults ages 57-85, using data from the first wave of the National Social Life, Health and Aging Project. They noted that people who survive until their 50th year of marriage -- among whom the slight rebound occurred -- are relatively few in number. \n \n ""Additionally, the study used a snapshot in time -- and therefore cannot prove that length and order of marriage caused sexual frequency,"" said former Baylor researcher Samuel Stroope, Ph.D., now an assistant professor of sociology at Louisiana State University. \n \n Nevertheless, the study provided ""intriguing results"" for one of the fastest growing age groups in the United States -- and one whose sexual behavior rarely has been studied, he said. \n \n One uncertainty that could be the subject of future research is the ""why"" of the findings. While sex becomes less of a novelty over time and frequency tends to diminish, ""it may be that the permanency of the relationship contributes to sexual relations picking up a bit at the end,"" Stroope said. \n \n ""Growing old as a couple, with the experience and knowledge that come with that, may play a part,"" he said. ""You are able to learn about your partner and build on that over time. You may have a higher level of trust when you feel that your spouse isn\'t going to go anywhere. The expectation that the relationship will continue may give you more reason to invest in the relationship -- including in sexual aspects of the relationship."" \n \n As to why ""remarrieds"" have less frequent sex than those in first marriages, ""it may be that those who have been married in the past may not have as strong of a sense of permanence or lasting investment,"" Stroope said. \n \n Michael McFarland, Ph.D., assistant professor of sociology and public health at Florida State University, was a study co-author. Researcher Jeremy Uecker, Ph.D., an assistant professor of sociology at Baylor and also a co-author, noted that ""we know a great deal about sexual behavior at younger stages of the life course. This study adds to a small but growing body of research on the sexual behavior of older adults."" \n \n Added Stroope: ""As people age, they tend to be more even-keeled, which may help cut down on marital conflict and facilitate regular sexual activity into advanced age."" \n \n The findings may surprise some in a society in which youth is the ideal and older adults are often subjected to ageism, researchers say. Despite stereotypes, the study joins other research in revealing that regular sexual activity remains a part of many older adults\' lives -- even with declining health and the death of a spouse on the horizon. \n \n ###', 'The saga of the illegally obtained nude photos of dozens of celebrities has taken a darker turn. According to Reddit administrators, photos of gymnast McKayla Maroney and MTV actress Liz Lee, shared to 130,000 people on popular forum r/TheFappening, constitute child pornography. \n \n Maroney’s lawyers have confirmed that the illegally obtained photos were taken while the gymnast was underage. The attorneys’ letter, sent to Porn.com and other websites, demands that the images be removed. \n \n Additionally, Reddit users have been sharing revenge-porn photos of the actress Liz Lee, whose photos were not part of the initial leaks, but were taken and leaked by her boyfriend when Lee was 16. \n \n The ongoing leak—dubbed #CelebGate, or more distastefully, “the Fappening”—includes naked photos of A-listers including Jennifer Lawrence and Kate Upton. It’s prompted outrage, and threats of legal actions from the women targeted. It has since emerged that the photos of at least one of the celebrities were taken when they were under 18. \n \n The Reddit community r/TheFappening has become the main hub for the leaked photos, due to the fact that Reddit is one of the few mainstream websites that isn’t proactively deleting all links to them. In an urgent post, the subreddit’s moderators warn the community that the site’s admins have informed them that Maroney was underage in the photos “and that we quickly need to remove them. \n \n “If we don’t remove them,” moderator SickOrSane continues, “this subreddit will most likely be banned, very quickly.” \n \n The moderator also warns against sharing Lee’s photos, which are apparently also being posted on the subreddit. \n \n \n \n \n \n Redditors have immediately begun to panic, discussing the potential implications of their downloading and sharing child pornography. \n \n \n \n \n \n Despite the proliferation of child pornography across r/TheFappening—in addition to the stolen intimate photos of adult celebrities—the Reddit admins have chosen not to remove the community, apparently content to let the moderators sort it out instead. They have, however, hidden the forum from r/all, a list of all content on Reddit. \n \n \n \n \n \n The focus, throughout the subreddit, is the potential ramifications community members may face for possessing child porn. \n \n Here, redditors respond to Classiest_Erection with step-by-step instructions for how to use software to wipe his hard drive, which ostensibly contains illegally obtained underage nudes. We’re watching a crime being aided and abetted in real time. \n \n In another instance, notwhoyouthinimnot goes out of his way to proactively encourage redditors to remove all record of their criminal activity. \n \n Other community members are only too eager to help. \n \n \n \n \n \n Some are more concerned with the fact that their community may be banned than the fact it’s being used to share flagrantly illegal material. \n \n The moderators, meanwhile, are joking about the fact that child porn has been found on their community. (The linked photo in the screenshot below is not pornographic.) \n \n Reddit admins may yet change course and decide to ban r/TheFappening. Even though redditors are using the site to instruct one another how to hide evidence of the child porn they downloaded via Reddit, administrators seem happy to allow the community to exist. \n \n It still remains unclear how the photos were leaked, though Apple has strongly denied early reports that hackers gained access to them through a vulnerability in iCloud. \n \n Photo via teuobk/Flickr (CC BY 2.0) | Remix by Fernando Alfonso III']",4,"– Say hello to your great-great-great-great-great-grandparents (times a few million or so)—Protungulatum donnae, a rat-sized insect eater believed to have lived 66 million years ago. A new six-year study of the mammalian family tree, looking at DNA and anatomical evidence in greater detail than ever before, has identified Protungulatum donnae as the most likely common ancestor for all 5,400 placental mammal species, reports the New York Times. The critter, however, is only hypothetical, notes the LA Times, explaining that scientists used data to ""reverse-engineer"" it. The study examined 83 mammals and fossils for more than 4,500 traits, creating a database 10 times larger than any previous database. Because Protungulatum donnae would have emerged 200,000 to 400,000 years after the great extinction that ended the dinosaurs—about 36 million years later than previous estimates—scientists say this is a clear sign the rise of the mammals was tied to that mass extinction.

75,"['In a rapid series of progressively escalating press releases by the Illinois Department of Public Health, it appears that a dangerous synthetic cannabinoid product called K2, spice, synthetic marijuana, legal weed or fake weed has now claimed its latest victim in an outbreak currently totaling 38 people whose severe bleeding is linked to exposure of this substance. The state division just announced the first death in this cluster. Over recent days, the toll of those harmed continues to increase with all being hospitalized for spontaneous excessive bleeding, including but not limited to coughing up blood, urinating blood, bloody stools, bleeding from the eyes, ears, nose and gums. \n \n Illinois government officials warn that these items were sold by convenience stores and dealers or obtained from friends. They have issued this advisory: \n \n “If you have purchased any of this product in the past month, do not use it. If you have used any of these products, and start experiencing severe, unexplained bleeding or bruising, please have someone take you to the hospital immediately or call 911. Do not walk or drive yourself. Tell your health care providers about the possible link between your symptoms and synthetic cannabinoid use.” \n \n What are synthetic cannabinoids? \n \n The agency goes on to inform about the varying misperceptions people have with respect to synthetic cannabinoids and their falsely perceived safety. As per their description, they are human-made, unregulated mind-altering chemicals that fall under a drug category called new psychoactive substances (NPS). These substances are sprayed on dried plant material for smoking or sold in liquid form to be used in vaporizing devices. \n \n They are sold and used recreationally under many names (e.g. herbal or liquid incense, K2, Spice, Black Mamba, Bombay Blue, Genie, Zohai, among others). Often pitched as being able to mimic the effects of cannabis because the chemical makeup is similar to those in the marijuana plant, the marketing of synthetic cannabinoids as synthetic “pot” can be deceptive and untrue. Synthetic cannabinoids have been found to impact the brain with greater potency, be volatile and life-threatening. \n \n What is causing the internal bleeding (and now death) in Illinois? \n \n According to the Chicago Tribune, \n \n “Consumption of synthetic cannabinoids previously has caused serious health problems such as seizures and kidney failure, but the side effect of severe bleeding is tied to the recent outbreak, said Dr. Patrick Lank, a medical toxicologist who works at Northwestern Memorial Hospital.” The article goes on to reveal “three of the hospitalized people tested positive for brodifacoum, more commonly known as rat poison.” \n \n You may be familiar with the drug coumadin - a blood thinning medication used to treat clots and prevent stroke - whose generic name is warfarin. Brodifacoum is often called a “superwarfarin” because it is extremely powerful with a long duration of action. \n \n Rat poison notoriously contains ingredients that have anticoagulant properties - or substances that impede someone’s ability to clot effectively. This particular compound antagonizes Vitamin K (which is necessary for proper clotting) and has an especially long half-life, so treatment for poisonings requires high doses at regular, continuous intervals for protracted periods of time. Over-the-counter options are not good enough given the severity of the problem and the urgency needed to correct it. And, therapies are mostly helpful when initiated before extensive bleeding and blood loss takes place. \n \n Once someone loses their ability to clot a cascade of untoward events follows. With such internal bleeding and blood loss, a person can go into shock, suffer a stroke, cardiac events, loss of consciousness and death. \n \n The bottom line… \n \n Efforts to liken synthetic cannabinoids to the active ingredient in marijuana by calling the products synthetic “pot” or “marijuana” are misleading misnomers. These “products” contain many highly potent, dangerous chemicals and you are taking big risks when using them. \n \n ADDENDUM (4/2/18, 8pm) \n \n The Illinois Department of Public Health now reports 2 deaths, 56 cases and expects these numbers to rise. See their link here for daily updates on this outbreak.', '(CNN) A fourth death in central Illinois has been connected to synthetic cannabinoid use, the Illinois Department of Public Health reported Tuesday. \n \n Since March 7, synthetic cannabinoids have sickened 153 people and been blamed in four deaths: a woman in her 30s, a man in his 40s and two men in their 20s. \n \n Synthetic cannabinoids across Chicago and parts of central Illinois have been found to contain brodifacoum, a rat poison, according to state health officials. \n \n Earlier this month, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned about life-threatening bleeding linked to the use of synthetic cannabinoids, often sold as spice, K2 or fake weed . A CDC ""outbreak alert"" noted that there were some bleeding cases also in Indiana, Maryland, Missouri and Wisconsin. \n \n Now, the number of hospitalizations and deaths is continuing to climb. \n \n ""We continue to see new cases of individuals experiencing severe bleeding after using synthetic cannabinoids,"" Dr. Nirav Shah, director of the Illinois Department of Public Health, said in a written statement Tuesday. \n \n ""Like so many other drugs, synthetic cannabinoids are addictive and people are not able to give them up. Alternatively, they think that it won\'t happen to them because they know their dealer or trust wherever they purchased the drugs,"" he said. ""If you know someone who uses synthetic cannabinoids, tell them these are deadly products and try to help them get treatment."" \n \n The US Attorney\'s Office charged three men with federal drug offenses and accused them of conspiring to sell synthetic cannabinoids at a Chicago convenience store, in connection with some of the cases. \n \n JUST WATCHED Police: Spike in synthetic marijuana overdoses in 2015 Replay More Videos ...

They can cause serious side effects that are different from those of marijuana. \n \n One study of a synthetic cannabinoid, published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2016, found that it was 85 times as potent as tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the mind-altering chemical in marijuana. \n \n Since the synthetic cannabinoids in Illinois were found to contain rat poison, most of the hospitalizations have been related to unexplained bleeding, such as coughing up blood, blood in the urine, bloody nose and bleeding gums. \n \n A chemical in rat poison prevents blood from clotting, causing the severe bleeding, according to the state health department. \n \n Health officials warn that anyone who has a reaction to synthetic cannabinoids, such as severe bleeding, should call 911 or be taken to an emergency department immediately. \n \n To treat the bleeding, doctors use high doses of vitamin K, up to 30 tablets a day for up to six months, which can help restore the blood\'s ability to clot. \n \n Follow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter. \n \n Since this rising number of cases calls for a large amount of vitamin K and long duration of treatment -- costing up to thousands of dollars for each patient -- the Illinois Department of Public Health announced that it\'s working to find a way to place no financial burden on patients tied to the synthetic cannabinoids outbreak. \n \n The Bausch Foundation, the charitable organization of Valeant Pharmaceuticals, donated nearly 800,000 tablets of vitamin K to the department.', 'Children should not be allowed to watch The Emoji Movie. Their impressionable brains simply aren’t set up to sift through the thick haze of corporate subterfuge clouding every scene of this sponsored-content post masquerading as a feature film. Adults know enough to snort derisively when, say, an anthropomorphic high-five drops a reference to popular smartphone game Just Dance Now (available for purchase in the App Store, kids!), but young children especially are more innocent and more vulnerable. \n \n The Emoji Movie is a force of insidious evil, a film that feels as if it was dashed off by an uninspired advertising executive. The best commercials have a way of making you forget you’re being pitched at, but director Tony Leondis leaves all the notes received from his brand partners in full view. The core conceit apes Tim Burton’s The Nightmare Before Christmas, where a spirited misfit hops between self-contained worlds styled in a single recognisable way. Instead of holidays, however, our hero here jumps from app to app, and the ulterior motive of pumping up download numbers drains every last drop of joy from Leondis’s efforts to enchant. \n \n The director wants us to think of Textopolis, the bustling city inside our smartphones, as a world of pure imagination. When a meh-face emoji named Gene (TJ Miller) is banished from his home for daring to express an emotion other than unimpressed nonchalance, Leondis takes his odyssey of self-discovery as an opportunity to imagine fantastical scenery. As a smiley-face emoji (Maya Rudolph) ruling Textopolis with a cheery iron fist tirelessly hunts him down, Gene gapes in awe at such marvels as a supercharged rollercoaster ride through raw data and a pixelated humpback whale that majestically glides over him. But because these glossy images are so nakedly in service of plugs for Dropbox and Spotify, it’s all but impossible to appreciate any incidental beauty they might possess. \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest Alex, voiced by Jake T Austin, in The Emoji Movie. Photograph: Sony Pictures/AP \n \n The pervasive falseness extends to the film’s thematic underpinnings, which make a clumsy lunge at vague, be-yourself positivity. The paramount importance of being true to one’s own spirit is made literal in Gene’s silly quandary; he’s forced to hide who he is for the sake of compulsory homogeneity, and only through tapping into his full range of emotions can he achieve his potential. While Leondis, who is gay, has stated he intends this as an allegory for the tribulations faced by the non-heterosexual community, any social commentary is stymied by the execution. The film’s insistent feel-goodery and occasional nods to feminism (delivered by a spunky blue-haired hacker emoji, voiced by Anna Faris) ring false. Product-placement mashups Toy Story and The Lego Movie had the purity of playtime to seal in the sentimentality; somehow it’s not as endearing in a film built around the apps we use to kill time while sat on the toilet. \n \n The ruthless mercenary details take the Emoji Movie beyond simply embarrassing and incompetent into something more manipulative and contemptible. One perplexing scene finds the emoji pals all doing a synchronised dance called “the emoji bop”. In a film so desperate to sell itself, this is clearly a craven bid to go viral, the cinematic equivalent of clickbait. The script practically begs for the approval of the tweens that elevated the lowly emoji to phenomenon status, but has only the slightest notion how they talk or act. Alex (Jake T Austin), the human in possession of the phone housing Gene and the rest of the cast, speaks like an dusty oldster. Alex’s awkward courtship of the cute girl in his class revolves around the deployment of emojis, but demonstrates no workable understanding of how the icons fit into adolescent life. Watching this fogeyish hero angle for edgy relevance is as uncomfortable as reading a fast-food chain’s Twitter account. \n \n However, the most disturbing part of this toxic film is the way it infects audiences with its ugly cynicism. A viewer leaves The Emoji Movie a colder person, not only angry at the film for being unconscionably bad, but resentful of it for making them feel angry. A critic can accept the truth that art and commerce will spend eternity locked in opposition. Nevertheless it’s still startling to see art that cheers commerce on while being stamped in the face by its boots.']",3,"– Another person in Illinois has died after using synthetic marijuana, reports the Chicago Tribune. The central Illinois woman, who was in her 30s, is the fourth person to die in the state after apparent use of the tainted substance. She's the third central Illinois victim; the fourth was from Chicago. In the last few weeks, more than 150 people across 13 counties have been hospitalized after using synthetic pot laced with what health officials believe to be a type of a rat poison known as brodifacoum, a powerful anti-coagulant. A widely used pesticide, when ingested by humans brodifacoum can cause bleeding from the nose or gums, as well as internal bleeding. Symptoms include coughing up blood and bloody urine, health officials say, and brodifacoum poisoning can be treated with vitamin K administered via IV to stabilize the blood’s clotting ability.

(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) (Associated Press) \n \n Obama spoke not long after Boehner\'s office issued a statement that insisted the two sides remained far apart and that Republicans had never, as the White House contends, agreed on $33 billion in cuts to the federal spending allotment for the remaining six months of the fiscal year that ends Sept. 30. \n \n Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, Boehner and Sen. Majority Leader Harry Reid met in the White House Tuesday as the clock ticked toward a midnight Friday expiration of the government\'s spending authority. \n \n ""We are closer than we have ever been to an agreement. There is no reason why we should not get an agreement,"" Obama said in a surprise appearance in the White House reporters briefing room. \n \n The president said Boehner and Reid were meeting later Tuesday, but if that session produced no agreement he would summon both men back to the White House Wednesday and daily thereafter, if necessary. \n \n ""Myself, Joe Biden, my team we are prepared to meet for as long as possible to get this resolved,"" Obama said. \n \n Obama had barely finished speaking when Boehner strode before microphones to insist that the White House and Senate Democrats bow to demands for deeper cuts. Boehner is under extreme pressure from newly elected House members, many with allegiance to the ultraconservative tea party, to slash spending, the size of government and lower taxes. \n \n Short of a long-term deal, Boehner has proposed an agreement that would keep the government running for one more week and cut another $12 billion in spending. Boehner has already orchestrated action by Congress to pass a pair of stopgap bills, so far cutting $10 billion from an estimated $1.2 trillion budget to fund the day-to-day operations of government through the fiscal accounting period. \n \n Obama said he would only accept another short-term funding extension, of two or three days, to get a longer-term deal through Congress. But he ruled out a longer extension to allow negotiations to continue. \n \n ""That is not a way to run a government. I cannot have our agencies making plans based on two week budgets,"" Obama said. ""What we are not going to do is once again put off something that should have been done months ago."" \n \n Boehner said Republicans ""will not be put in a box"" of accepting options they refuse to endorse. \n \n Democrats accuse Republicans of pushing for harmful spending cuts and attaching a social policy agenda to the must-pass spending bill. Boehner counters that the White House is pressing gimmicky budget cuts. \n \n As a government shutdown appeared increasingly inevitable, the White House has begun advising government agencies on the proper steps in preparation for a shutdown of the government. Republicans on Monday disclosed plans to instruct lawmakers ""on how the House would operate in the event Senate Democrats shut down the government."" \n \n And in a memo to agency officials, the deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget, Jeffrey Zients, urged agency heads to refine and update contingency plans in the event negotiators don\'t strike a deal by Friday\'s deadline. \n \n Boehner\'s one-week plan could reassure tea party-backed lawmakers who are among the most vocal in seeking to reduce the size and scope of the government. It could also put pressure on Democrats and the White House to offer greater spending cuts. \n \n But there\'s no visible movement on an impasse over Republican policy riders attacking Obama\'s health care and financial reform laws, cutting taxpayer funds to Planned Parenthood and reversing a host of Obama\'s environmental policies. \n \n On a separate long-term track, Republicans controlling the House have fashioned plans to slash the budget deficit by more than $5 trillion over the upcoming decade, combining unprecedented spending cuts with a fundamental restructuring of taxpayer-financed health care for the elderly and the poor. \n \n House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan unveiled the Republican budget blueprint Tuesday morning just as Boehner headed to the White House. \n \n Ryan\'s program includes a controversial proposal to convert the traditional Medicare health care program for the aged into a system by which private insurers would operate plans approved by the federal government. \n \n Current Medicare beneficiaries or workers age 55 and older would stay in the existing system. \n \n At the same time, Republicans propose to sharply cut projected spending on the Medicaid state-federal health program for the poor and disabled and transform it into a block grant program that gives governors far less money than under current estimates, but considerably more flexibility.', 'Play Facebook \n \n Twitter \n \n Embed Trump administration puts Iran \'on notice\' after missile test 3:23 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog \n \n Tension between the Trump administration and Iran continued to rise Wednesday when National Security Adviser Michael Flynn said the White House was putting Tehran ""on notice,"" an apparent threat of retaliation for a recent ballistic missile test. \n \n Flynn said in a statement that the launch defied a U.N.

They would not say whether Trump wants to pull out of the nuclear deal. \n \n Flynn\'s message was aimed to get Iran\'s attention, the officials said. \n \n Last week, Trump included Iran on a list of seven majority-Muslim countries whose citizens would be temporarily banned from entering the United States. \n \n Agreement wasn\'t meant to make Iran ""thankful to the US"" - it was intended to peacefully rollback Iran\'s nuclear program, which it did. https://t.co/VAkfctg3Z7 — Ben Rhodes (@brhodes) February 1, 2017 \n \n Iran used to be prohibited from test-firing ballistic missiles under previous U.N. resolutions.

""Iran will never use missiles produced in Iran to attack any other country."" \n \n Flynn\'s remarks Wednesday followed assertions Tuesday by Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, that the Trump administration would not ""show a blind eye"" to Iran\'s actions. \n \n ""We\'re gonna act, we\'re gonna be strong, we\'re gonna be loud and we\'re gonna do whatever it takes to protect the American people and the people across the world, because that\'s what the goal is supposed to be,"" she said. \n \n Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement that he planned to press Trump to renew sanctions against Iran and ""take care of this failed nuclear agreement."" \n \n He added, ""Iran\'s aggression must not go unanswered."" \n \n The National Iranian American Council called Flynn\'s statement ""reckless,"" and said it risked retaliatory behavior. \n \n ""While Flynn’s remarks could be construed as simply bluster, they will beget an Iranian response which in turn will beget further threats by the U.S.,"" NIAC President Trita Parsi said in a statement.

O\'Reilly asked. \n \n Williams, 56, responded that too much political correctness can get in the way of reality. \n \n ""I mean, look, Bill, I\'m not a bigot. You know the kind of books I\'ve written about the civil rights movement in this country,"" Williams said. ""But when I get on a plane, I got to tell you, if I see people who are in Muslim garb and I think, you know, they are identifying themselves first and foremost as Muslims, I get worried. I get nervous."" \n \n He went on to say that not everyone in a religious group _ Christian or Muslim _ should be lumped together with extremists. \n \n NPR CEO Vivian Schiller said that controversial opinions should not come from NPR reporters or news analysts and that whatever feelings Williams has about Muslims should be between him and ""his psychiatrist or his publicist."" \n \n Speaking Thursday at the Atlanta Press Club, Schiller also said Williams had veered from journalistic ethics several times before Monday\'s comments. \n \n Republicans blasted NPR\'s decision. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich told Fox News that Congress should investigate NPR for censorship and consider cutting off its public funding. NPR receives federal funding through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, but it amounts to a small part of its budget. \n \n ""Juan Williams: Going Rogue,"" former GOP vice presidental candidate Sarah Palin said Thursday in a Twitter message. ""NPR should receive NO fed tax dollars if it operates as intolerant, private radio. Mr. President, what say you?"" \n \n Goldberg also defended Williams on ""The View"" Thursday.

I\'ve been there more than 10 years,"" Williams said. He said Weiss responded that ""there\'s nothing you can say that would change my mind."" \n \n Before Williams was fired, the Council on American-Islamic Relations said such commentary from a journalist about other racial, ethnic or religious minority groups should not be tolerated. \n \n ""NPR should address the fact that one of its news analysts seems to believe that all airline passengers who are perceived to be Muslim can legitimately be viewed as security threats,"" CAIR National Executive Director Nihad Awad said. \n \n Later Wednesday, NPR issued a statement saying Williams\' remarks ""were inconsistent with our editorial standards and practices, and undermined his credibility as a news analyst with NPR."" \n \n ""Juan has been a valuable contributor to NPR and public radio for many years and we did not make this decision lightly or without regret,"" NPR spokeswoman Dana Davis Rehm said in an e-mailed statement. \n \n The discussion began with a chat about O\'Reilly\'s comments on ABC\'s ""The View"" opposing a proposed mosque near the World Trade Center site in New York.

""Divisiveness only serves to fuel the downward spiral of hate and misunderstanding between the Islamic and Western worlds."" \n \n Williams\' appearances on Fox have been an issue for NPR in the past, including his remarks about Michelle Obama on a 2009 episode of ""The O\'Reilly Factor."" \n \n ""Michelle Obama, you know, she\'s got this Stokely Carmichael in a designer dress thing going. ... her instinct is to start with this blame America, you know, I\'m the victim,"" Williams said, according to an account by NPR\'s Ombudsman Alicia Shepard. Carmichael was a civil rights activist. \n \n At the time, Shepard wrote that Williams was the network\'s biggest ""lightning rod,"" drawing hundreds of complaints. NPR executives then asked Williams to stop using the NPR name when he appears on O\'Reilly\'s show. \n \n On Monday, he was identified as a Fox News contributor. \n \n Williams was a longtime reporter, columnist and editorial writer at The Washington Post.

They included similar accounts of unwanted and unexpected kisses during business meetings. \n \n Meanwhile, a current NPR employee is going public with her account of filing a formal complaint with the network\'s human resources division in October 2015. Rebecca Hersher says she considers the incident less severe but nevertheless felt it crossed a line and made her uncomfortable. At the time a 26-year-old assistant producer on Weekend All Things Considered, she said Oreskes hijacked a career counseling session into a three-hour-long dinner that delved into deeply personal territory. \n \n Oreskes did not respond to multiple efforts to reach him for comment. NPR executives say that they cannot address individual personnel matters but that they take concerns of sexual harassment or other inappropriate workplace behavior seriously. \n \n According to The Washington Post, there were two separate complaints about Oreskes from his tenure as Washington bureau chief at The New York Times nearly 20 years ago. Both women tell similar stories: After meeting Oreskes and discussing their job prospects, they said he unexpectedly kissed them on the lips and stuck his tongue in their mouths. The Post did not disclose their names, stating they spoke on condition of anonymity because they did not want to damage future employment prospects. The women also shared their allegations with NPR management in mid-October. \n \n \n \n After joining NPR in the spring of 2015, Oreskes encouraged staffers to reach out to him to discuss their careers during his visit to NPR West in Culver City, Calif. At the time Hersher had been working a series of temporary assignments for NPR, and she took him up on his offer during a subsequent visit to Washington. An afternoon meeting was pushed off into evening and an invitation to dinner at a seafood restaurant near Union Station. \n \n Hersher, now a reporter and producer on NPR\'s science desk, says she wanted to tell him about her belief that she would need to leave NPR to transform from a producer to a reporter. Her dinner with Oreskes became increasingly uncomfortable as the conversation veered into personal matters involving relationships and sex. At one point, she says, he referred to a former flame as his first ""sex girlfriend."" \n \n Hersher says the conversation made her uncomfortable. \n \n ""From my point of view, every little thing that he or I said pointed to the relative difference in power,"" she said. ""Like he\'s the one with the power. He\'s the one who gets to decide what we talk about — and I am trying to keep up."" \n \n Hersher said he gave her what seemed like a nonromantic hug at the train station afterward, and that he did not otherwise touch her or suggest any physical involvement. \n \n Still, Hersher said Tuesday, the entire evening felt as though it devalued her as a professional. She suddenly questioned why a senior executive would care about her career. \n \n ""I went to the train station, and I called my best friend; I cried on the phone to her,"" Hersher says. ""I went home and then I cried to my boyfriend. It undercut my confidence in a way that was surprising to me."" \n \n Hersher reported the incident to NPR\'s human resources division. The network formally rebuked Oreskes and informed other top network executives. Hersher said she felt satisfied with the company\'s response and that she experienced no retribution. \n \n Two colleagues at NPR confirmed that Hersher told them of the incident at the time. I did considerable reporting on the episode in spring 2016. At that time, Hersher was not willing to go on the record for a news story, and I was unable to confirm a pattern of behavior by Oreskes. The incident did not involve anything physical, and there was no force, retribution or request for a romantic involvement, and Hersher said she believed the network had held Oreskes appropriately accountable. \n \n At the time, this reporter and editors of that story — who did not include Oreskes or anyone who reported directly to him — concluded that the incident on its own did not rise to the level of national news. \n \n The new allegations concerning Oreskes\' tenure at The Times changed the equation. \n \n In a note to staff on Tuesday, NPR CEO Jarl Mohn encouraged employees to come forward if they have been harassed. \n \n ""We take these kinds of allegations very seriously,"" Mohn wrote.

79,"[""LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May survived a confidence vote from her Conservative party on Wednesday, but more than a third of her lawmakers said she was no longer the right leader to implement Britain’s exit from the European Union. \n \n Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May speaks at Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons, London, Britain, December 12, 2018. Parliament TV handout via REUTERS \n \n Britain’s March 29 exit has been plunged into crisis by parliamentary opposition to the divorce deal she struck with the EU last month, which has opened up possibilities including a delay to Brexit or even another referendum on membership. \n \n May on Monday cancelled a parliamentary vote on her Brexit deal, designed to maintain close future ties with the bloc and agreed after two years of negotiations, after it became clear she would lose it badly. \n \n Eurosceptic critics of the deal within her own party triggered a no-confidence vote in her leadership hours after she returned from talks with European leaders aimed at winning additional assurances about her deal. \n \n After two hours of voting in Committee Room 14 in the House of Commons, Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee of Conservative backbenchers, said 200 Conservative lawmakers had voted in support of May as leader, and 117 against, indicating her party was bitterly divided over the direction of Brexit. \n \n Supporters said the result showed the party should now get behind her. But the hardline Brexit supporters who triggered the vote because they saw her deal as a betrayal of the 2016 referendum said she should now quit. \n \n “It is a terrible result for the prime minister,” Jacob Rees-Mogg, leader of a hard Brexit faction in the party, told BBC Television. “The prime minister must realise that, under all constitutional norms, she ought to go and see the queen urgently and resign.” \n \n But May loyalist Chris Grayling, her transport minister, said the party had endorsed her “comfortably”. \n \n ENDANGERING BREXIT? \n \n May, who voted to remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum, had warned opponents of her withdrawal deal - struck after two years of negotiations - that if they toppled her, Brexit would be delayed or stopped. \n \n Shortly before the vote, May sought to win over wavering lawmakers by promising to step down before the 2022 election. \n \n Brexit is Britain’s most significant political and economic decision since World War Two. Pro-Europeans fear the departure will weaken the West as it grapples with the U.S. presidency of Donald Trump and growing assertiveness from Russia and China. \n \n The outcome will shape Britain’s $2.8 trillion economy, have far-reaching consequences for the unity of the kingdom and determine whether London keeps its place as one of the top two global financial centres. \n \n Supporters of Brexit admit there may be some short-term pain for Britain’s $2.9 trillion economy, but say it will prosper in the long term when cut free from the EU, which they cast as a failing German-dominated experiment in European integration. \n \n May, 62, won the top job in the turmoil that followed the 2016 EU referendum, where Britons decided by 52 percent to 48 to leave the EU. She promised to implement Brexit while keeping close ties to the bloc, to heal a divided nation. \n \n Sterling jumped as high as $1.2672 GBP=D3 as the result came in but then fell to $1.2605, still up 1 percent on the day, after it emerged that the number of lawmakers who had voted against May was higher than many in the markets had expected."", 'Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Theresa May smiles at gathered journalists as she awaits the result \n \n Theresa May is awaiting the result of a vote by Conservative MPs on whether they want to keep her as their leader. \n \n The UK prime minister made a last-minute appeal for support at an emotional meeting of backbench MPs. \n \n She told them she will not lead the party into the next scheduled election in 2022 - but wants to stay on to deliver her Brexit deal, MPs said. \n \n She faces a vote of confidence in her leadership after 48 Conservative MPs called for one to be held. \n \n The majority of Conservative MPs have publicly said they will support the PM but it is a secret ballot and there were signs of nerves among party managers ahead of the vote in Committee Room 14 at the Palace of Westminster. \n \n Voting finished at 20:00 with the result expected within the next hour. \n \n The prime minister was greeted with applause, and the traditional banging of desks, as she went in to the committee room to address her MPs. Some of them were reported to be in tears. \n \n She is understood to have promised not to call a ""snap general election"" and told MPs that in her heart she would have liked to have led them into the next scheduled election, partly because of what had happened at last year\'s election, when she lost her majority. \n \n But, she added: ""I realise that the party would like a different leader to take them into that election."" \n \n Cabinet minister Amber Rudd said ""she was very clear that she wont be taking the general election in 2022"". \n \n But Jacob Rees-Mogg, a key figure in the campaign to oust Mrs May, said she had received a ""half-hearted"" reception from MPs. \n \n She had said it was not her ""intention"" to fight the next election, added Mr Rees-Mogg, which he said was a ""politician\'s word"". \n \n Marcus Fysh, who also submitted a no confidence letter, said Mrs May ""didn\'t really have anything new to say"" about Brexit. \n \n She vowed to involve more people in developing policy, the MP told BBC News, but he did not think that would happen. \n \n And he predicted that the prime minister would face a no-confidence vote of all MPs - not just Conservative ones - when she tried to get her Brexit deal through the Commons. \n \n ""Whatever happens tonight I don\'t think she will be able to command the confidence of the House for the type of Brexit she is trying to pursue."" \n \n Minister Margot James said she was ""proud"" to have voted for the PM, tweeting a picture of her ballot paper. \n \n Conservative Party rules say that if she wins tonight she can stay on as leader, undisturbed, for another 12 months. \n \n That takes one uncertainty off the table. But she would be weaker - lonelier - and with less authority to drive her Brexit compromise through. \n \n Already, cabinet ministers are speculating about which way she can tack. \n \n The parliamentary sums don\'t change on her current planned agreement with the EU. The cabinet, let alone the rest of the Commons, won\'t give their backing. \n \n Read Laura\'s blog \n \n Can she survive the confidence vote? \n \n Immediate statements of loyalty for the prime minister were issued by every member of her cabinet, including several who have been touted as possible successors. \n \n Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said Mrs May was ""the best person to make sure we actually leave the EU on March 29"", while Chancellor Philip Hammond suggested the vote would ""flush out the extremists"" in his party whose Brexit agenda was ""not in the interests of the British people"". \n \n So far, 174 Tory MPs have publicly said they will vote for her, with 34 publicly against, according to BBC research. She needs to secure the votes of 159 MPs to survive. \n \n If Mrs May wins the confidence vote she cannot be challenged as Conservative leader for at least another year. \n \n If she does not win the vote there would then be a Conservative leadership contest in which she could not stand. \n \n If Mrs May won - but not overwhelmingly - she may decide to stand down as party leader and trigger a leadership contest in which she could not stand. \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Sir Graham Brady says he phoned the prime minister to advise her the threshold of 48 letters had been reached \n \n What has Theresa May said? \n \n In her statement delivered early on Wednesday morning, Mrs May said: ""A leadership election would not change the fundamentals of the negotiation or the Parliamentary arithmetic. \n \n ""Weeks spent tearing ourselves apart will only create more division just as we should be standing together to serve our country. None of that would be in the national interest."" \n \n She said she was making progress in her talks with EU leaders and vowed to ""deliver on the referendum vote and seize the opportunities that lie ahead"". \n \n The Conservatives had to build a ""country that works for everyone"" and deliver ""the Brexit people voted for"". \n \n ""I have devoted myself unsparingly to these tasks ever since I became prime minister and I stand ready to finish the job."" \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption ""I stand ready to finish the job"" - Theresa May \n \n Will there be a new prime minister if she loses the vote? \n \n Not immediately.

The prime minister has negotiated her deal. She has told us it is the best and only deal available. \n \n ""There can be no more excuses, no more running away. Put it before Parliament and let\'s have the vote."" \n \n Mrs May said the vote will take place, and as Labour MPs shouted ""when?"" at her she said: ""We\'ve had a meaningful vote, we had it in in the referendum in 2016."" \n \n The PM added: ""And if he wants a meaningful date I\'ll give him one; 29 March 2019 when we leave the European Union."" \n \n Veteran pro-European MP Ken Clarke called the prospect of a leadership contest ""unhelpful, irrelevant and irresponsible"", prompting loud cheers from the Tory benches. \n \n But the SNP\'s leader at Westminster Ian Blackford called on Mrs May to stand down, saying her government was ""an embarrassment"". \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption \'The inconstant gardener\' - May\'s PMQs swipe at Labour \n \n Who is trying to oust Mrs May? \n \n Image copyright PA Image caption Jacob Rees-Mogg: In the national interest, she must go \n \n The challenge has been brought by Conservative MPs who think Mrs May has watered down the Brexit voters were promised in the 2016 referendum. \n \n The PM thought she had seen off an attempt by this group of Brexiteers to get rid of her last month. \n \n But her decision to cancel Tuesday\'s Parliamentary vote on her deal at the last minute proved to be the final straw for many who had previously given her the benefit of the doubt. \n \n There needed to be 48 MPs calling for her to go - out of 317 Conservative MPs - to trigger a confidence vote and this threshold was reached on Tuesday. \n \n Jacob Rees-Mogg, who has led backbench calls for her to go, said: ""Theresa May\'s plan would bring down the government if carried forward. But our party will rightly not tolerate it. \n \n ""Conservatives must now answer whether they wish to draw ever closer to an election under Mrs May\'s leadership. In the national interest, she must go."" \n \n And Bernard Jenkin said the survival of the Conservative government depended on the support of the Democratic Unionists, who he said had lost faith in Mrs May. \n \n Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston, who is campaigning for a further referendum, told BBC Radio 2 she hoped Mr Rees-Mogg\'s group would ""get a kicking"" in the vote and that their ""pompous gesturing"" will be exposed. \n \n Why are they trying to get rid of her? \n \n They don\'t like the deal she has struck with the EU, which they say will keep the UK tied to the EU indefinitely with no say over its rules and unable to strike trade deals around the world. \n \n Anger has focused on the so-called ""backstop"" to prevent the return of a physical border in Northern Ireland. \n \n Mrs May has said she is seeking guarantees that this clause will be ""temporary"" but the Democratic Unionist Party, which she relies on to win key votes, wants the backstop to be ditched altogether. \n \n And her Conservative critics think she will not be able to get anything more than cosmetic changes to her withdrawal deal because EU leaders say it can not be renegotiated. \n \n Who are the frontrunners to lead the party if she loses? \n \n Image copyright AFP Image caption Jeremy Hunt, Boris Johnson, Dominic Raab, Michael Gove, Sajid Javid and Amber Rudd \n \n There are many names being floated, with Home Secretary Sajid Javid, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, Environment Secretary Michael Gove and Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd among cabinet ministers rated by the bookmakers. \n \n Former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, ex-Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and ex-Brexit Secretary David Davis are the ex-cabinet ministers also judged to be in the running. \n \n But, as BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg says, the field of hopefuls could be much larger and, initially at least, resemble the start of a Grand National. \n \n What does it mean for Brexit? \n \n Whatever the outcome of the vote, Mrs May is still likely to represent the UK at Thursday\'s summit of EU leaders, although that might change if she loses the Tory leadership. \n \n She has been invited to update her 27 counterparts on the state of Brexit before they meet to ""adopt relevant conclusions"". \n \n European Council President Donald Tusk has said the ""seriousness"" of the situation in the UK means the EU must accelerate its no-deal planning. \n \n Mrs May met Germany\'s Angela Merkel and top EU officials on Tuesday as part of efforts to get changes to her EU deal to get it through the UK Parliament. \n \n But she was forced to call off talks with Irish premier Leo Varadkar, among others, on Wednesday to fight for her leadership. \n \n Mrs May says any new Conservative leader would have to delay Brexit to renegotiate a deal with the EU while she has also suggested a leadership contest will effectively hand control of the Brexit process to MPs - many of whom either back leaving without a deal or having another referendum. \n \n Many of those calling for her to go say they would be happy for the UK to leave the EU on World Trade Organization terms, without a deal. They say warnings of economic doom are exaggerated.', '19:29 \n \n What about the ‘meaningful vote’? \n \n The result clearly highlights May’s essential Brexit problem. The number of rebels at 117 is eyecatchingly similar to the 100 or so MPs who were planning to vote against her Brexit deal before she postponed the vote a day before its scheduled date of Tuesday. \n \n It is a blocking minority preventing the current deal, or anything like it, from being ratified by parliament. To win round that amount of rebels, May has to make dramatic progress in her talks with Brussels and persuade the right of her party that she can “bin the backstop”. \n \n However, the European Union has made it repeatedly clear that the legally binding 585-page withdrawal agreement – which contains the Northern Irish backstop – is not up for renegotiation. And without renegotiation, the backstop will endure and Tory rebels will almost certainly not vote for it. \n \n No 10 has promised that the vote will happen before 21 January, which in negotiating terms is very little time at all.

Later, he added, “We’ve only had six tornado warnings.” Although there were laughs all around, would Bergeron panic if he woke up Monday morning for the actual show and saw a gray sky? \n \n [D.C.-area forecast: Rain likely for the Fourth, but not necessarily a total washout all day and evening] \n \n Tom Bergeron, host of “A Capitol Fourth.” (Capital Concerts) \n \n “Oh, no,” he told us backstage. He’s not worried about potential rain. “The first rule of improv, as I was taught it, is you say yes to everything. You don’t tense up. … I’m open for anything. That doesn’t bother me.” \n \n Of course, it helps that Bergeron has seen basically everything in his decades as an Emmy-winning TV host, from “Hollywood Squares” to “America’s Funniest Home Videos.” He’s especially unfazed when it comes to live television, given that he has co-hosted ABC’s hit reality competition show “Dancing With the Stars” since 2005, and that’s always a frenzied couple of hours. \n \n So even though “A Capitol Fourth” (airing on PBS at 8 p.m., live-streamed on PBS.org and Facebook Live) is on a tight schedule, packed with performances from Smokey Robinson, Kenny Loggins, Sutton Foster, Yolanda Williams, Cassadee Pope and Christopher Jackson, you can expect some of Bergeron’s signature ad-libs between proceedings. He’s especially jazzed to meet Jackson, who plays George Washington in the smash musical “Hamilton”; Bergeron saw the show last month and loved it, although he quipped during rehearsal that he had to take out a second mortgage to afford tickets. \n \n And is Bergeron especially eager to have the best seat in the house for the fireworks, with his prime perch on the West Lawn? \n \n “To be honest with you, the fireworks — even though that gets such attention — is the least interesting part of it to me. I love that first moment walking out on the stage, seeing all the people, seeing the Capitol building … and there’s all the incredible talent,” Bergeron said. “Fireworks, they’re nice, but I’ve seen a lot of fireworks.

Though host Tom Bergeron initially laughed off concerns that the live concert and fireworks display over Washington would be rained out, per the Washington Post, the sky above the Capitol Building was foggy and overcast as the fireworks began. That made seeing the show a bit difficult—so PBS intervened. Mingled with misty footage of fireworks over the Capitol building, with scaffolding clearly visible, was stock footage of fireworks from previous celebrations. Viewers were quick to call out the ""fraudulent"" scheme—there was no disclaimer during the ""live"" broadcast—noting the stock footage showed a clear sky over the Capitol Building, and no scaffolding, per the Post.

(Bill O’Leary /The Washington Post) \n \n On the morning after Donald Trump’s inauguration, acting National Park Service director Michael T. Reynolds received an extraordinary summons: The new president wanted to talk to him. \n \n In a Saturday phone call, Trump personally ordered Reynolds to produce additional photographs of the previous day’s crowds on the Mall, according to three individuals who have knowledge of the conversation. The president believed that the photos might prove that the media had lied in reporting that attendance had been no better than average. \n \n Trump also expressed anger over a retweet sent from the agency’s account, in which side-by-side photographs showed far fewer people at his swearing-in than had shown up to see Barack Obama’s inauguration in 2009. \n \n According to one account, Reynolds had been contacted by the White House and given a phone number to call. When he dialed it, he was told to hold for the president. \n \n For Trump, who sees himself and his achievements in superlative terms, the inauguration’s crowd size has been a source of grievance that he appears unable to put behind him. It is a measure of his fixation on the issue that he would devote part of his first morning in office to it — and that he would take out his frustrations on an acting Park Service director. \n \n (The Washington Post) \n \n Word rapidly spread through the agency and Washington. The individuals who informed The Washington Post about the call did so on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the conversation. \n \n Neither Reynolds nor the Park Service would talk about it. \n \n “The National Park Service does not comment on internal conversations among administration officials,” agency spokesman Thomas Crosson said. \n \n White House deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the call simply demonstrated that Trump’s management style is to be “so accessible, and constantly in touch.” \n \n “He’s not somebody who sits around and waits. He takes action and gets things done,” Sanders said. “That’s one of the reasons that he is president today, and Hillary Clinton isn’t.” \n \n On Saturday, the same day Trump spoke with Reynolds, the new president used an appearance at CIA headquarters to deliver a blistering attack on the media for reporting that large swaths of the Mall were nearly empty during the event. \n \n “It’s a lie,” Trump said. “We caught [the media].

Experts, however, have estimated that the 2017 turnout was no more than a third the size of Obama’s eight years earlier. \n \n Reynolds was taken aback by Trump’s request, but he did secure some additional aerial photographs and forwarded them to the White House through normal channels in the Interior Department, the people who notified The Post said. The photos, however, did not prove Trump’s contention that the crowd size was upward of 1 million. \n \n Reynolds, who had served as the Park Service’s deputy director of operations for six months before assuming the post of acting director, is a third-generation employee who has worked there for more than 30 years. As deputy director, he oversaw the Park Service’s $2.8 billion budget and more than 22,000 employees. \n \n In the days since Trump’s election, the Park Service has become an unlikely protagonist in a battle between the new president and some career government employees. \n \n The trouble began late Friday, when the agency’s official Twitter account retweeted two messages that could be perceived as critical of the new administration: the one comparing the relative crowd size for Trump’s inauguration to that of Obama’s 2009 swearing-in, and another that noted policy pages that had been removed from the White House’s website. \n \n That prompted an “urgent directive” to Interior employees that they “shut down Twitter platforms immediately until further notice,” which was lifted early Saturday morning. Crosson then apologized on Twitter for “mistaken RTs from our account.” \n \n On Tuesday, the Badlands National Park’s Twitter account became a social-media sensation when it posted four tweets in a row about rising atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations and the threats posed by climate change. \n \n Those tweets were then deleted. An NPS official later explained that Badlands NPS officials learned they were posted by a former employee who still had access to the account, and decided to remove them. \n \n [Interior Department reactivates Twitter accounts after shutdown following inauguration] \n \n Spicer told reporters this week that White House officials had not dictated any agency to impose new restrictions on public communications and that some federal officials, such as those at the Park Service, were not in compliance with their own department’s policies. \n \n Trump, meanwhile, has continued to press the argument that the media has given a misleading account of the crowds that attended his inauguration. \n \n “I had a massive amount of people here,” the president told ABC News anchor David Muir in an interview Wednesday. “They were showing pictures that were very unflattering, as unflattering — from certain angles — that were taken early and lots of other things.” \n \n As he guided Muir through the West Wing, Trump paused at a photo on the wall, taken from behind him as he delivered his inaugural address: “Here’s a picture of the event. Here’s a picture of the crowd. Now, the audience was the biggest ever, but this crowd was massive. Look how far back it goes.

Roberts Jr. asked skeptically whether “the citizens in the South are more racist than citizens in the North.” Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, whose vote is probably crucial, asked whether Alabama today is an “independent sovereign” or whether it must live “under the trusteeship of the United States government.” \n \n Justice Antonin Scalia said the law, once a civil rights landmark, now amounted to a “perpetuation of racial entitlement.” \n \n That remark created the sharpest exchange of the morning, with Justice Sonia Sotomayor on the other end. “Do you think that the right to vote is a racial entitlement?” she later asked a lawyer challenging the law, with an edge in her voice that left little doubt she was responding to Justice Scalia’s statement. “Do you think that racial discrimination in voting has ended, that there is none anywhere?” \n \n The outcome of the case will most likely remain in doubt until the end of the court’s current term, in June. Many legal observers predicted that the justices would overturn part of the voting law in 2009, when the court had the same conservative-leaning majority, only to be proven wrong. \n \n One important change, however, is that Chief Justice Roberts suggested in the 2009 ruling that Congress update its formula to determine which parts of the country should remain subject to the law. Congress has not done so. \n \n The question at the heart of Wednesday’s argument was whether Congress, in reauthorizing the provision for 25 years in 2006, was entitled to use a formula based on historic practices and voting data from elections held decades ago. \n \n Should the court strike down the law’s central provision, it would be easier for lawmakers in the nine states to enact the kind of laws Republicans in several states have recently advocated, including tighter identification standards. It would also give those states more flexibility to move polling places and redraw legislative districts. \n \n The four members of the court’s liberal wing, citing data and history, argued that Congress remained entitled to make the judgment that the provision was still needed in the covered jurisdictions. The law passed the Senate unanimously and House overwhelmingly, by a vote of 390 to 33 in 2006. \n \n “It’s an old disease,” Justice Stephen G. Breyer said of efforts to thwart minority voting. “It’s gotten a lot better. A lot better. But it’s still there.” \n \n Justice Kennedy said that history taught a different lesson, referring to the reconstruction of Europe after World War II. “The Marshall Plan was very good, too,” he said. “But times change.” \n \n Justice Breyer looked to a different conflict. \n \n “What do you think the Civil War was about?” he asked. “Of course it was aimed at treating some states differently than others.” He also said that the nation lived through 200 years of slavery and 80 years of racial segregation. \n \n Debo P. Adegbile, a lawyer with the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, which joined the government in defending the law, echoed that point. “This statute is in part about our march through history to keep promises that our Constitution says for too long were unmet,” he said. \n \n The law was challenged by Shelby County, Ala., which said that its federal preclearance requirement, in Section 5 of the law, had outlived its usefulness and that it imposed an unwarranted badge of shame on the affected jurisdictions. \n \n The county’s lawyer, Bert W. Rein, said that “the problem to which the Voting Rights Act was addressed is solved.”']",4,"– President Trump may not have had the biggest inauguration crowd in history, but he may have made a bigger fuss about media coverage of it than any of his predecessors.

Reynolds, who has worked for the service for 30 years, was ""taken aback"" by the request, but he sent some aerial photos to Trump, according to the Post's sources. The photos did not, however, provide proof of Trump's claim that more than a million people had gathered to watch his inauguration.

The nonprofit Americans for Job Security donated $11 million to oppose the measure in what California authorities called ""campaign money laundering."" (Gary Friedman, Los Angeles Times / ) \n \n WASHINGTON — Tax-exempt advocacy groups that played an aggressive role in this year\'s election are coming under increasing scrutiny from state regulators, who are cracking down on organizations seeking to engage in campaigns without revealing their financial backers. \n \n The pressure in states with stringent campaign finance rules contrasts sharply with the federal level, where nonprofits that spent hundreds of millions of dollars to influence races this year have not been required to disclose their donors. \n \n This month, California\'s Fair Political Practices Commission forced an Arizona-based group to reveal the source of $11 million it gave for two ballot initiative campaigns. The funds were traced to a Virginia nonprofit that also does not reveal its donors. That hasn\'t satisfied the commission, which has begun an investigation to uncover the original source. \n \n Shortly before election day, judges in Idaho and Montana required the disclosure of contributors to two nonprofit organizations that had drawn the attention of state regulators with their political activity. \n \n ""Frankly, if we didn\'t take a stand on this, we might as well just pack up our campaign disclosure law and send it away,"" said Idaho Secretary of State Ben Ysursa. ""The fact that federal campaign laws are deficient or you\'ve got a deadlocked Federal Election Commission — that doesn\'t mean the states are powerless."" \n \n Ysursa sued a group called Education Voters of Idaho, which gave more than $200,000 for ads backing three state ballot measures, accusing it of failing to comply with the state\'s sunshine law. After the court order, the organization revealed it had received money from New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Albertsons supermarket scion Joseph P. Scott, among others. \n \n The clashes between state elections officials and advocacy groups are a byproduct of the U.S. Supreme Court\'s 2010 ruling in Citizens United vs. Federal Election Commission, which lifted the ban on direct political expenditures by corporations. That triggered a surge of election activity by groups incorporated under the tax code\'s section 501(c)4 as social welfare organizations, which are allowed to engage in issue advocacy. \n \n At the federal level, political action committees are required to report their contributors, but so far the nonprofits are not. \n \n The Federal Election Commission, which has six members split evenly between the major parties, is frozen in partisan gridlock on questions regarding nonprofit activity. The Internal Revenue Service said this summer that it had begun examining some of the groups, but had yet to take any public action. And efforts to pass new disclosure laws have so far foundered in Congress. \n \n But the picture is different in many states, where lawmakers have toughened disclosure rules to require any organization making a political expenditure to report its financial backers. \n \n Disclosure opponents have systematically challenged the state measures in court, arguing that the Supreme Court has said a group must have politics as its ""major purpose"" in order to be considered a political committee. \n \n Advocates for more campaign finance reporting have countered — largely successfully — that the high court has repeatedly endorsed disclosure and has not limited it to political committees. \n \n ""If you look at the federal issue, you would be inclined to throw up your hands,"" said Derek Cressman, vice president for state operations at Common Cause, which advocates for more transparency. ""The progress that some states are making proves that these disclosure issues are problems we can solve."" \n \n Take the case of Americans for Job Security, a Virginia-based nonprofit that has been a serious political player for at least a dozen years, spending millions on ads without disclosing its backers. \n \n In 2008, the FEC\'s general counsel concluded the trade group met the definition of a political committee that is required to report its donors, and requested approval to pursue a formal investigation. But the commission deadlocked, and no action was taken. \n \n Early this month, Americans for Job Security played a role in one of California\'s most closely watched election-year dramas — unmasked as the source of an $11-million donation to oppose Gov. Jerry Brown\'s tax increase measure and support another measure intended to curb the ability of unions to raise money for political activity. \n \n The money had first been routed to an Arizona group called the Center to Protect Patient Rights, which sent it to another nonprofit also based in Arizona called Americans for Responsible Leadership, which in turn gave the money to the conservative Small Business Action Committee in California to run ads about the ballot measures. \n \n State authorities called it ""campaign money laundering."" \n \n Ann Ravel, chairwoman of the Fair Political Practices Commission, said the contribution may have violated a rule implemented in May to prevent donors from anonymously shuttling money through nonprofits with the intention of spending it on California campaigns. If found in violation, the nonprofits involved could face millions of dollars in fines. \n \n The Small Business Action Committee could also be forced to pay $11 million to the state\'s general fund if authorities prove it knowingly failed to report the original source of its funds, Ravel said. \n \n The committee and Americans for Responsible Leadership have denied breaking any rules. \n \n State Sen. Leland Yee (D-San Francisco) said he planned to introduce legislation that would require more complete disclosure. \n \n ""How can anyone allow organizations of whatever kind to come into this state and not disclose the true source of money?"" he said. \n \n A similar fight is playing out in Montana, where a group called American Tradition Partnership has been locked in a battle with the agency that enforces the state\'s campaign finance rule. \n \n In October 2010, Montana\'s commissioner of political practices concluded that the group\'s activities, which included sending mailers attacking Democratic and moderate Republican lawmakers, meant it had to file reports as a political committee. ATP sued, challenging the disclosure laws as unconstitutional and arguing that it is an educational group. \n \n ATP has remained active in state politics, sending out a mock newspaper this fall that featured gubernatorial candidate Steve Bullock, the state\'s attorney general, in a photo array of sex offenders as part of an article that slammed his handling of the state\'s sex offender database. \n \n The legal wrangling between state officials and ATP is ongoing, but has already pulled back the curtain on the group\'s contributors. Shortly before election day, the state judge hearing the case released a cache of the group\'s financial documents that state prosecutors had subpoenaed from Wells Fargo. The documents, which the PBS show ""Frontline"" and the investigative website ProPublica had requested, showed that ATP donors have included nonprofits linked to Republican activists in Colorado, as well as some major GOP donors. \n \n In Maine, state ethics officials are investigating the National Organization for Marriage, which has refused to release the names of donors that financed its efforts to defeat a 2009 measure to legalize same-sex marriage. \n \n The nonprofit groups under scrutiny say they are caught between conflicting state and federal regulations. \n \n John Foster, the Boise-based lobbyist and political consultant behind Education Voters of Idaho, said he set it up as a 501(c)4 because its activities fall squarely within the IRS definition of a social welfare organization. Donors gave money for education reform, not earmarked for political campaigns, he said, so the group should not have to reveal names. \n \n ""We are very proud of our donors, and the prospect of releasing them publicly was never an issue for us,"" Foster said. ""It was always about whether we get to decide who we are, or whether a state regulator gets to decide who we are."" \n \n ""The rules are not entirely clear,"" he added. ""This just highlights the continuing need for a realistic, constitutional approach to campaign finance reform in this country."" \n \n matea.gold@latimes.com \n \n chris.megerian@latimes.com']",2,"– Jerry Sandusky and his wife, Dottie, blamed his victims for his sex abuse conviction in letters written to the judge before his sentencing earlier this week.

As in most other winter sports, the South is much stronger than the North. \n \n “Our players were really nervous,” Sarah Murray, South Korean women’s hockey head coach, told Reuters last month during the team’s training swing through the United States. \n \n “We can only take 23 players to the Olympics, and they thought these North Koreans are going to come in and take our spots”, Murray said. \n \n Chun, the South’s lead delegate, said the decision on a united ice hockey team is not yet finalised, as it requires the consent of the IOC and related international body. \n \n “We’re well aware of the people’s concerns and interests about this”, he told a news conference. \n \n “But I would like you to see the other side that it could make a positive contribution to peace of the Korean Peninsula and improving inter-Korean relations”. \n \n On Tuesday, the North said a 140-person orchestra would perform in South Korea during the Games. Pyongyang is also planning to send a large delegation in addition to the athletes and orchestra. \n \n Paik Hak-soon, the director of the Center for North Korean studies at Sejong Institute in South Korea, said North Korea was using the cheering squad to draw attention to its apparent cooperative spirit. \n \n “Seeing good results in competitions thanks to the cheering squad would enable the North Koreans to say they contributed to a successful Olympics and the South Korean government would likely agree,” said Paik. \n \n Slideshow (5 Images) \n \n “In the end, they are using this old tactic to get to Washington through Seoul.” \n \n Reclusive North Korea and the rich, democratic South are technically still at war because their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.

Mosby remaining at the helm of the prosecution. \n \n During a day of hearings in a downtown courtroom, Judge Barry Williams swiftly sliced through complex legal arguments in the first motions hearing. In three key rulings issued from the bench, he refused to dismiss the charges or recuse Mosby and decided that the case should be split to ensure that each officer gets a fair trial. \n \n Williams said that trying the officers together would not be ""in the interest of justice"" because key evidence that\'s admissible with regards to one officer may be inadmissible for another. The officers are charged with a range of offenses, from murder to misconduct, as each played a different role in Gray\'s arrest and transport. \n \n The case has sparked widespread protests in Baltimore — which continued Wednesday — and has become part of a national dialogue about police treatment of black citizens. Gray, 25, died in April one week after suffering a severe spinal cord injury while in police custody. \n \n Outside the courtroom, dozens of protesters gathered in peaceful demonstrations and marches through downtown that resulted in one arrest and snarled traffic. Even at this early stage of the court proceedings, organizers said they wanted their voices heard. \n \n ""It\'s a step in the right direction,"" Malcolm Wilson said of Williams\' rulings on defense motions to recuse Mosby and dismiss the case. The 23-year-old East Baltimore resident, who said he knew Gray, clutched a white cardboard sign that read, ""I am here for Justice for Mr. Gray."" \n \n Police, who had been criticized for their response to previous demonstrations and rioting, repeatedly ordered protesters to ""remain on the sidewalk"" and quickly responded to one tense moment near the Inner Harbor in which a protester was arrested and an officer suffered minor injuries. \n \n Interim Police Commissioner Kevin Davis said police wanted to treat ""a protest like a protest,"" and that ""by and large, that\'s exactly what happened."" Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake praised the department, saying she and police ""will vigorously defend the First Amendment rights of the protesters, but we will also vigorously enforce the order in our city."" \n \n In the courtroom, filled with legal observers and media after months of sharply written legal filings filled with accusations lobbed between the defense and prosecution, Williams sought to maintain order. \n \n He stopped the proceedings to remind those present to turn off all electronics, warning that he would remove everyone but the attorneys. He frequently interrupted the attorneys during their arguments, to seek clarification on a key point, wryly disagree or keep the attorneys on topic. \n \n The officers had waived their rights to attend Wednesday\'s hearing, and Gray\'s family did not attend. \n \n While the oral arguments on the dismissal and recusal motions largely reflected those made in written filings — which often centered on Mosby\'s actions — the arguments over whether to try the officers separately provided new insights into defense and prosecution theories. \n \n Officer Caesar R. Goodson Jr., the driver of the police van in which Gray was injured, is charged with second-degree depraved-heart murder. Sgt. Alicia D. White, Lt. Brian W. Rice and Officer William G. Porter are charged with manslaughter. Officers Edward M. Nero and Garrett E. Miller face lesser charges, including second-degree assault. All six have been charged with misconduct in office. \n \n Partially redacted statements by several of the officers were submitted to the court on Wednesday, though under seal, as were police dispatch tapes. \n \n Prosecutors previously indicated that they wanted to try Goodson, White, Nero and Miller together in one trial, and Porter and Rice together in a second trial. \n \n However, at the hearing Wednesday, they only sought to have Goodson, White and Nero tried together. Deputy State\'s Attorney Janice Bledsoe argued that much of the evidence in the case was relevant to those three officers. \n \n She said all of the evidence related to what happened to Gray from his arrest to his arrival unresponsive at the Western District police station would be needed to prove reckless endangerment on their part. \n \n But Marc Zayon, Nero\'s attorney, said Gray\'s arrest and transport constituted two separate incidents. He said evidence brought to support the felony charges against Goodson and White, including expert witness testimony on Gray\'s injuries sustained in the van and evidence regarding how Goodson was driving, would be highly prejudicial if introduced in a case against Nero. \n \n Defense attorneys also raised concerns that statements by the officers could incriminate one of the co-defendants, pitting one\'s right not to take the stand with another\'s right to confront his or her accuser. \n \n Matthew Fraling, an attorney for Goodson, also said he was concerned about a ""transfer of guilt"" and a ""spillover effect"" in the minds of jurors trying to categorize evidence against different defendants. \n \n In denying the state\'s motion to join the cases, Williams agreed that much of the evidence would not be ""mutually admissible."" His ruling means there will be six trials. \n \n Arguments over dismissing the charges and recusing Mosby came after a flurry of heatedly written motions over the past four months. In court Wednesday, Williams cautioned both sides to tone down their rhetoric. \n \n ""The unnecessary name calling and over-the-top rhetoric to which this court has been required to wade in order to get to the heart of the legal issues in this case is remarkable,"" Williams said.', 'A longtime U.S. postal carrier was found dead in her mail truck in Woodland Hills on Friday afternoon amid blistering summer temperatures, authorities confirmed Monday. \n \n Peggy Frank, 63, of North Hills was found unresponsive while seated in a postal vehicle in the 4800 block of Calderon Road by a co-worker or bystander, said Ed Winter of the Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner-Coroner’s office. \n \n Paramedics attempted to revive her without success, Winter said. Frank was pronounced dead at 3:35 p.m. Friday. \n \n UPDATE: Federal investigators launch probe into Woodland Hills mail carrier’s death on 117-degree day \n \n Temperatures soared to 117 degrees in the Woodland Hills area on Friday, surpassing the record of 106 degrees for that day, July 6, that was set in 1976. (The National Weather Service has kept records there since 1949, according to Keily Delerme, a NWS meteorologist.) \n \n But Winter could not say Monday whether the heat was a factor in Frank’s death. \n \n While her autopsy had been completed, the cause of death was deferred pending additional tests, Winter said. She also had some type of medical history that Winter declined to specify until the final cause of death is determined. \n \n “We want to express our thoughts and prayers for the employee’s family at this difficult time,” said Evelina Ramirez, a spokesperson with the U.S. Postal Service. \n \n She noted that carriers deliver mail in “all kinds of weather, including high temperatures.” \n \n “Safety is our top priority for all of our employees,” Ramirez said. “The Postal Service strives to ensure that they have the tools and training to do so safely.” \n \n Carriers are reminded daily to stay hydrated, wear appropriate clothing, such as hats, and get into the shade whenever and as much as possible, she said. \n \n “The most important thing is to make sure they have water and ice for their entire route,” Ramirez said. \n \n Employees at the Woodland Hills Post Office remembered Frank, a dog lover who had some 28 years working at the post office, as always upbeat and positive despite her health challenges. \n \n “She was a sweetheart – always happy, even when she wasn’t feeling good,” said co-worker Cindy Pritchard. \n \n Frank had recently returned from medical leave, according to colleagues. \n \n Co-worker Joni Hogan Salvatore, who started working at the Woodland Hills Post Office before Frank, called her colleague “amazing” and “a very hard worker.” \n \n “None of us are 20 (years old) anymore; it’s a hard job,” Salvatore said. “It’s a super-hard job, but she always had something nice to say. Never was a complainer or anything. She was just a really good person.” \n \n Salvatore said that when it’s 100 degrees outside, it can be 10-15 degrees hotter inside the mail trucks, which do not have air conditioning. \n \n “They make us lock them and seal them for safety of the mail, but it’s horrible in there,” she said. \n \n The National Weather Service had issued an excessive heat warning on Friday for the region. \n \n A spokesman for the U.S. Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), which has jurisdiction over federal employees, could not be reached late Monday for comment. \n \n In the fall of 2014, an administrative law judge upheld a willful citation to a U.S. Postal Service station in Independence, Mo., by the federal OSHA after a mail carrier died in July 2012, according to media reports. \n \n The mail carrier had collapsed while working his route and died as a result of his exposure to excessive heat, according to an OSHA investigation. \n \n That investigation found that the Postal Service “did not have procedures in place to address worker concerns during times of excessive heat,” according to the administrative agency. A willful violation is one that is committed with intentional, knowing or voluntary disregard for the law’s requirements or with plain indifference to worker or safety health. \n \n The Postal Service was required to pay a penalty of $70,000 in that case, according to the news site Fox4KC.com. \n \n In October of 2016, OSHA cited the Postal Service after two Des Moines, Iowa, workers suffered heat-related illness while delivering mail that past summer. The agency found that the two mail carriers, one of whom was told to continue walking her route despite feeling ill, were exposed to excessive heat. \n \n RELATED STORY: Employees should ‘force breaks’ in extreme heat, top LA County health official says']",3,"– Written motions finally evolved into verbal arguments this morning in Baltimore, where defense attorneys for two of the six officers charged in the arrest and death of Freddie Gray tried to have said charges dismissed and the office of State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby recused from the case—attempts that were both rejected by Judge Barry Williams, the Baltimore Sun reports. The defense attorneys argued, among other things, that Mosby had influenced the jury pool by ""[adopting] and [encouraging] the public's cry of 'no justice, no peace'"" when she publicly announced the charges against the officers in May. Another complaint by the defense: Mosby's judgment was influenced by her husband serving as councilman for a local district that saw a ""disproportionate amount of violence"" in the days after Gray's death, the AP reports. Williams called that assertion ""condescending"" and said while he was ""troubled"" by some of Mosby's comments during her May 1 news conference, the defendants' right to a fair trial wasn't compromised by her statements, per the AP. The hearing is expected to continue this afternoon to determine whether the trial for the six officers should be split up. (In a unrelated story, members of Freddie Gray's family, including Gray himself, were victims of lead poisoning and may have been misled by a settlement company.)"
88,"['In an open letter, Mira Sorvino has publicly apologized to Dylan Farrow, the estranged daughter of director Woody Allen—and expressed regret about working with the controversial filmmaker. Sorvino won an Oscar for her performance in his 1995 film, Mighty Aphrodite, but has since re-examined her decision to work with Allen due to Farrow’s accusations. (Farrow has repeatedly accused Allen of abusing her as a child; Allen denies the allegations.) Sorvino was prompted to speak out after she alleged to reporter Ronan Farrow, who is Dylan’s brother, that Harvey Weinstein (who produced Mighty Aphrodite) harassed her years ago. \n \n “I confess that at the time I worked for Woody Allen I was a naïve young actress,” Sorvino wrote in an essay for HuffPost. “I swallowed the media’s portrayal of your abuse allegations against your father as an outgrowth of a twisted custody battle between Mia Farrow and him, and did not look further into the situation, for which I am terribly sorry.” \n \n Sorvino stated clearly that her relationship with Allen on the film was “friendly, though not close, but in no way did he ever overstep his bounds with me.” \n \n “I never personally experienced what has now been described as inappropriate behavior toward young girls,” she said. “But this does not excuse my turning a blind eye to your story simply because I wanted desperately for it not to be so.” \n \n The actress writes that she spoke with Ronan in December, telling about the “aftermath” of sharing her Weinstein story. In her accusations against Weinstein, she said that he essentially blacklisted her from landing plum movie roles after her Mighty Aphrodite success, because she reportedly rebuffed him when he sexually harassed her and tried to pressure her into a physical relationship. (Weinstein denied the claims.) Her blacklisting allegations have been supported by directors like Peter Jackson and Terry Zwigoff; representatives for Weinstein released statements denying the claims from both directors. \n \n She also told Ronan that she wanted to learn more about Dylan’s accusations, and he pointed her toward “publicly available details of the case I had ruefully never known of, which made me begin to feel the evidence strongly supported your story.” \n \n “I am sorry it has taken me a few weeks to come out in support of you since that conversation, but it has been a process for me to own this truth and make this irrevocable break,” she writes. \n \n Sorvino is now the third actress to acknowledge Dylan Farrow and publicly distance herself from Woody Allen. Ellen Page, who starred in the 2012 Allen film To Rome with Love, kicked off the trend in November with a lengthy Facebook post. \n \n “I did a Woody Allen movie and it is the biggest regret of my career,” she wrote. “I am ashamed I did this. I had yet to find my voice and was not who I am now and felt pressured, because ‘of course you have to say yes to this Woody Allen film.’ Ultimately, however, it is my choice what films I decide to do and I made the wrong choice. I made an awful mistake.” \n \n Greta Gerwig was the next to join this group, telling The New York Times that she will never work with Allen again. \n \n “Dylan Farrow’s two different pieces made me realize that I increased another woman’s pain, and I was heartbroken by that realization,” Gerwig said. “I grew up on his movies, and they have informed me as an artist, and I cannot change that fact now, but I can make different decisions moving forward.” \n \n Get Vanity Fair’s HWD Newsletter Sign up for essential industry and award news from Hollywood.

A police source said the letter contained similar writings to those on Venner\'s website. \n \n ""We did not know him, he was not a regular at the cathedral,"" Jacquin said, adding that he believed it was the first time anyone had committed suicide inside the cathedral. \n \n Jacquin said masses had been cancelled and that church officials would hold a vigil later on Tuesday. \n \n ""We will pray for this man, as for so many others at their end,"" he said. ""This is terrible, we are thinking of him and his family."" \n \n In a final essay on his website, Venner railed against France\'s adoption of a ""vile law"" legalising gay marriage and adoption. It finally became law on Saturday after months of bitter political protests from the right. \n \n Venner also denounced immigration from north Africa which, he said, was the real ""peril"", calling on activists to take measures to protect ""French and European identities"". \n \n In what appeared to be a reference to his suicide, Venner wrote: ""There will certainly need to be new, spectacular, symbolic gestures to shake off the sleepiness... and re-awaken the memories of our origins."" \n \n ""We are reaching a time when words must be backed up with acts,"" he added. \n \n Venner had a long career publishing right-wing essays, military histories and books on weaponry and hunting. \n \n He was a soldier during France\'s war in Algeria and was a member of the OAS (Secret Armed Organisation), a short-lived paramilitary group that opposed Algeria\'s independence from France. \n \n Venner\'s publisher, Pierre-Guillaume de Roux, said his next book due in June was titled ""A Western Samurai"". \n \n He said the writer\'s death had ""an extremely strong symbolic power that approximates (Yukio) Mishima,"" the radical right-wing Japanese author who committed ritual suicide in 1970. \n \n Mishima had likely been an inspiration for Venner\'s suicide, Gollnisch, a Japan expert, added. \n \n Mishima, considered one of modern Japan\'s most important authors, killed himself in a dramatic, samurai-style disembowelment at a Self Defense Force camp in Tokyo at age 45 in a political protest. \n \n Minutes before his suicide he addressed the troops, condemning the post-war pacifist constitution and lamenting the decadence of modern Japan. He called on soldiers to rise up to build a nation with the emperor at its core. \n \n The Gothic Notre Dame Cathedral on an islet on the River Seine is one of the most visited sites in Paris, attracting 13.6 million visitors in 2011, and is this year celebrating its 850th anniversary. \n \n Copyright © 2013 AFP.

The actor reached out to Woody Allen's daughter Wednesday to apologize for starring in her father's Mighty Aphrodite—for which she won an Oscar—while ignoring Farrow's claims of sexual abuse against Allen. Farrow was 7 when she said Allen sexually touched her, and a judge later found her claims credible, though Allen has continually denied the allegations, Vulture reports. Sorvino says she was aware of Farrow's claims when she made Mighty Aphrodite but dismissed them ""as an outgrowth of a twisted custody battle"" because of her lifelong love of Allen's work. ""It is difficult to sever ties and denounce your heroes, your benefactors, whom you fondly admired and felt a debt of gratitude toward for your entire career’s existence,"" she writes. Sorvino says her experience opening up to Farrow's brother, reporter Ronan Farrow, about Harvey Weinstein made her want to learn more about Dylan Farrow's allegations, which led to her taking those allegations seriously. Sorvino says her love of Allen's work ""does not excuse my turning a blind eye to your story simply because I wanted desperately for it not to be so."" She says she won't work with Allen again, writing: ""We are in a day and age when everything must be re-examined. This kind of abuse cannot be allowed to continue.

He also owns property in Krasnodar, Russia. \n \n Caution: \n \n Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev, using the online monikers “lucky12345” and “slavik”, is wanted for his alleged involvement in a wide-ranging racketeering enterprise and scheme that installed, without authorization, malicious software known as “Zeus” on victims’ computers. The software was used to capture bank account numbers, passwords, personal identification numbers, and other information necessary to log into online banking accounts. While Bogachev knowingly acted in a role as an administrator, others involved in the scheme conspired to distribute spam and phishing emails, which contained links to compromised web sites. Victims who visited these web sites were infected with the malware, which Bogachev and others utilized to steal money from the victims’ bank accounts. This online account takeover fraud has been investigated by the FBI since the summer of 2009. \n \n Starting in September of 2011, the FBI began investigating a modified version of the Zeus Trojan, known as GameOver Zeus (GOZ). It is believed GOZ is responsible for more than one million computer infections, resulting in financial losses of more than $100 million. \n \n On August 22, 2012, Bogachev was indicted under the nickname “lucky12345” by a federal grand jury in the District of Nebraska on charges of Conspiracy to Participate in Racketeering Activity; Bank Fraud; Conspiracy to Violate the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act; Conspiracy to Violate the Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act; and Aggravated Identity Theft.

Tsai... (Associated Press) \n \n The Democratic Progressive Party\'s Tsai was poised to become the self-governing island\'s first female president in an election taking place amid concerns that the island\'s economy is under threat from China and broad opposition to Beijing\'s demands for political unification. \n \n Tsai had about 60 percent of votes while Nationalist Eric Chu had about 30 percent, with about half of votes counted. \n \n ""We failed. The Nationalist Party lost the elections. We didn\'t work hard enough,"" Chu said before a thin crowd of a few hundred supporters at his campaign headquarters. He followed his concession speech by making a long bow. \n \n ""As the Nationalist Party chairperson, I need to pay the highest level of responsibility. Dear all friends, Eric Chu apologizes to everyone. I\'m resigning as party chief,"" he said. \n \n Outgoing Nationalist President Ma Ying-jeou has served eight years and is constitutionally barred from another term. \n \n The outcome of the contest for a majority in the 113-seat legislature remained uncertain, with independents and smaller parties posing a threat to both the Nationalists and the DPP. \n \n ""Taiwan and China need to keep some distance,"" said Willie Yao, a computer engineer voting in Taipei who said he backed Tsai. ""The change of president would mean still letting Taiwanese make the decision."" \n \n Reflecting unease over a slowdown in Taiwan\'s once-mighty economy, undeclared voter Hsieh Lee-fung said providing opportunities to the next generation was the most important issue. \n \n ""Economic progress is related closely to our leadership, like land reform and housing prices. People aren\'t making enough money to afford homes,"" Hsieh said. \n \n A win for Tsai would introduce new uncertainty in the complicated relationship between Taiwan and mainland China, which claims the island as its own territory and threatens to use force if it declares formal independence. \n \n ""This is not about defeating the other party. This is about working to overcome the obstacles in Taiwan\'s path,"" Tsai told supporters in the rain at a final rally Friday night in front of the presidential office building in the center of the capital, Taipei. \n \n Tsai has pledged to maintain the status quo of de-facto independence for the island of 23 million, although she has refused to endorse the principle that Taiwan and China are parts of a single nation to be unified eventually. \n \n Beijing has made that its baseline for continuing negotiations that have produced a series of pacts on trade, transport and exchanges. Observers say China is likely to adopt a wait-and-see approach to Tsai\'s presidency, but might use diplomatic and economy pressure if she is seen as straying too far from its unification agenda. \n \n Taiwan was a Japanese colony from 1885 to 1945 and split again from China amid civil war in 1949. \n \n Chu was a late entry in the race after the party ditched its original candidate, Hung Hsiu-chu, whose abrasive style was seen as alienating voters. \n \n China has largely declined to comment on the polls, although its chief official for Taiwan affairs this month warned of potential major challenges in the relationship in the year ahead. \n \n Tsai supporters appeared confident that ties with China would weather a change in government. \n \n ""As long as Tsai doesn\'t provoke the other side, it\'s OK,"" said former newspaper distribution agent Lenex Chang, who attended Tsai\'s rally. ""If mainland China democratizes someday, we could consider a tie-up,"" he added. \n \n Candidates from across the political spectrum sounded a rare note of unity Saturday after a teenage pop star posted a video online apologizing for having waved the Taiwanese flag on a South Korean TV program. \n \n Sixteen-year-old Chou Tzu-yu, who performs under the name Tzuyu, had apparently been compelled to apologize after her South Korean management company suspended her activities in China for fear of offending nationalist sentiments on the mainland. \n \n Ma, Tsai and Chu all condemned what they described as the bullying of a young girl. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writer Ralph Jennings contributed to this report.', 'Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Tsai Ing-wen said people in Taiwan wanted a transparent government \n \n Tsai Ing-wen has been elected Taiwan\'s first female president. \n \n Ms Tsai, 59, leads the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) that wants independence from China. \n \n In her victory speech, she vowed to preserve the status quo in relations with China, adding Beijing must respect Taiwan\'s democracy and both sides must ensure there are no provocations. \n \n China sees the island as a breakaway province - which it has threatened to take back by force if necessary. \n \n In her speech, Ms Tsai hailed a ""new era"" in Taiwan and pledged to co-operate with other political parties on major issues. \n \n The will of the Taiwanese people would be the basis for relations with China, Ms Tsai said. \n \n ""I also want to emphasise that both sides of the Taiwanese Strait have a responsibility to find mutually acceptable means of interaction that are based on dignity and reciprocity. \n \n ""We must ensure that no provocations or accidents take place,"" Ms Tsai said, warning that ""any forms of suppression will harm the stability of cross-strait relations"". \n \n She thanked the US and Japan for their support and vowed Taiwan would contribute to peace and stability in the region. \n \n Ms Tsai had a commanding lead in the vote count when Eric Chu of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) admitted defeat. \n \n Mr Chu congratulated Tsai Ing-wen and announced he was quitting as KMT head. Taiwan\'s Premier Mao Chi-kuo also resigned. \n \n Read more about Taiwan\'s election \n \n Image copyright EPA \n \n Taiwan\'s first female leader, shy but steely \n \n Why does this election matter? \n \n Who is running? \n \n Is it all about the economy? \n \n What\'s behind the China-Taiwan divide? \n \n Taiwan profile \n \n The election came just months after a historic meeting between the leaders of Taiwan and China. \n \n However, the flagging economy as well as Taiwan\'s relationship with China both played a role in the voters\' choice, correspondents say. \n \n The KMT has been in power for most of the past 70 years and has overseen improved relations with Beijing - Ms Tsai\'s is only the second-ever victory for the DPP. \n \n The first was by pro-independence advocate Chen Shui-bian; during his time as president between 2000 and 2008 tensions with China escalated. \n \n Analysis: Cindy Sui, BBC News, Taipei \n \n The victory by Tsai Ing-wen marks a defeat for not only the pro-unification ruling party KMT but also China. \n \n Despite the past eight years of reduced tensions and much improved relations built by the KMT and China, Taiwanese voters have voted for Ms Tsai from the pro-independence party instead. Basically, they\'ve voted to keep Beijing at a distance. \n \n This reflects not only widespread dissatisfaction with President Ma Ying-jeou of the KMT over insufficient measures to improve the lacklustre economy, low wages and widening wealth gap - it also reflects growing worries by Taiwanese people that the island may become too economically dependent on China and that this will make it hard for Taiwan to fend off pressures by Beijing to reunify with it one day. \n \n The message voters have sent Beijing is that, while they want reduced tensions and good relations, they cherish Taiwan\'s sovereignty, democracy and self-rule even more. \n \n The challenge now is for Ms Tsai to find a way to work with China, the island\'s biggest export market, trade partner and security threat. \n \n Ms Tsai, a former scholar, has said she wants to ""maintain [the] status quo"" with China. \n \n She became chairwoman of the DPP in 2008, after it saw a string of corruption scandals. \n \n She lost a presidential bid in 2012 but has subsequently led the party to regional election victories. She has won increased support from the public partly because of widespread dissatisfaction over the KMT and President Ma Ying-jeou\'s handling of the economy and widening wealth gap. \n \n Image copyright AP Image caption Eric Chu\'s loss shows the KMT has lost a nearly 70-year monopoly on power \n \n Saturday\'s polls come after a historic meeting between President Ma and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Singapore in November for talks that were seen as largely symbolic - the first in more than 60 years. \n \n Eric Chu, 54, is the mayor of New Taipei City and stepped up to become chairman of the party in October. \n \n The KMT has lost its majority in the legislature for the first time in history. \n \n The former accounting professor was seen as popular with young people in the party, but had been unable to change public opinion that is increasingly unhappy with the party\'s friendly stance towards China and the island\'s economic travails. \n \n In 2014, hundreds of students occupied the parliament in the largest show of anti-China sentiment on the island for years. Labelled the Sunflower Movement, protesters demanded more transparency in trade pacts negotiated with China. \n \n Taiwan for all practical purposes been independent since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949, when the defeated Nationalist government fled to the island as the Communists, under Mao Zedong, swept to power.', '8 Things to Know about the Bull Market on Its 8th Birthday \n \n The stock market has accomplished something that only one other bull market in history has achieved — it survived to see its eighth birthday. \n \n It was eight years ago today that the Dow Jones industrial average sank to its recent nadir of 6,547, as hundreds of thousands of workers were losing jobs and the global financial system teetered on the edge of collapse. \n \n Since then, though, the Dow has skyrocketed more than 14,000 points to 20,855. The broader S&P 500 index of U.S. stocks has come roaring back too, returning an annual 20% to investors who had the nerve to stay in the scary market. \n \n But this was by no means a straight shot back up. In fact, the second-longest bull market in the post-World War II era has been unpredictable, puzzling, and rather peculiar. \n \n Here\'s how: \n \n 1. This Bull Has Been Unloved \n \n ""The current bull market has been the least loved, the most questioned and the most doubted bull that we certainly can recall in near 34 years of experience in the markets,"" noted Oppenheimer chief investment strategist John Stoltzfus in a recent report. \n \n That\'s an understatement. \n \n Even as this bull market more than tripled the value of stocks over the past eight years, the percent of households that actually own equities has sunk from 62% in 2008 to 52% last year, according to a survey by Gallup . \n \n That\'s the lowest level of stock ownership in the 19 years that Gallup has been tracking this data. \n \n 2. This Bull Has Been Persistent \n \n World events since 2009 have been anything but supportive for a major stock market rally. Major industries such as banks and automakers neared collapse. The Federal government shutdown for 16 days. And political posturing in Congress in the Obama years brought the nation close to defaulting on the national debt. \n \n Overseas, major European nations were crippled by a debt crisis, terrorists attacks spread around the globe, and China\'s economy endured a dramatic slump. \n \n Yet stocks kept chugging along. \n \n 3. This Bull Was Nearly Gored Last Year \n \n Since President Trump\'s election in November, the stock market has been on a a roll, as most major economic metrics have been pointing higher. So it\'s easy to forget that as recently as a year ago, there was real doubt that equities would make it to this anniversary. \n \n One year ago stocks were battered by a series of bad headlines, such as low growth in China and weak global demand for oil. A few months later U.K. voters decided to leave the European Union, and eventually Donald Trump was elected president — a plot twist that some analysts predicted would cause stocks to crash. \n \n And yet stocks rebounded from their disastrous 2016 winter to deliver 22% over the past 12 months, according to CFRA, the third biggest year-over-year gain since March 2009. \n \n 4. This Bull Has Been Surprisingly Calm \n \n Despite all of last year\'s uncertainty, stocks have been remarkably subdued. In fact, compared to the bull market of October 1990 to March 2000, investors could afford to take a long, deep breath for the past 12 months. \n \n ""During year eight, the S&P 500 recorded 85 [days of more than 1% gains or losses] in 1998, but only 23 in the year just past,"" according to CFRA\'s Sam Stovall. \n \n 5. This Bull Is Getting Expensive \n \n "" Most importantly for investors, both stocks and bonds are now significantly more expensive than eight years ago,"" says David Kelly, chief global strategist for J.P. Morgan Funds. \n \n The current price/earnings ratio for the S&P 500 now rests at 18 based on projected profits over the coming 12 months. That\'s about 12% above the market\'s 25-year average, per Kelly. That could be a result of investors hoping that a GOP-dominated federal government will unleash billions in tax cuts and spending to jumpstart persistently lackluster post-recession economic growth. \n \n By another P/E calculation, the market is even frothier. Based on 10 years of averaged corporate profits, the stock market\'s P/E now stands at 29.8. The only other times the market has been this expensive by this measure was during the dot.com bubble and the Great Depression. \n \n 6. This Bull Is Egalitarian \n \n Different sectors of the market have experienced their own highs and lows. Financial stocks, for instance, gained 149% from March 2009 - 2010, according to CFRA, but fell 9.5% two years later, before leading the pack last year. \n \n Two years ago sleepy, defensive-minded utility stocks earned investors the best return (14.8%), while energy companies lost big league (-16.2%). \n \n These rough edges, though, have smoothed out over the long haul. From 2009 to 2017, there\'s only a 1 percentage point difference in annual returns between the top and second best sectors — consumer discretionary 25.7% vs. real estate\'s 24.6%. Five sectors returned between 22% to 26% per year, while the weakest performer (energy) returned a respectable 9.4%. \n \n 7. This Bull Has Gotten a Big Assist from the Fed \n \n Normally, there\'s a pattern to bull markets. First, stocks rise, foreshadowing a rebound in economic growth. Then once the economy actually gets into gear, the Federal Reserve starts to tap on the brakes by raising interest rates to make sure the economy — and inflation — don\'t overheat. \n \n The cumulative effect of Fed rate hikes are often what helps bring about the end to bull markets. \n \n This time around, though, the Fed has kept interest rates at historically low levels throughout the eight years of this bull. The Fed has lifted rates only two times throughout this entire rally — each time by a mere quarter of a percentage point. \n \n But that may change as the Fed is expected to lift rates next week. \n \n 8. This Bull Will Turn 9 \n \n This bull market has dovetailed with one of the longest business cycles in American history. But all things end, which have some worried that a recession, and stock market declines, could eventually reappear. \n \n But old age would be the wrong cause of death, should it occur. \n \n ""Bull markets don’t die of old age, they die of fright,"" says Stovall. \n \n Which means there has to be something to cause investors to sell en masse and move their money into safer assets. And usually that involves concerns over negative economic growth, i.e. recessions. \n \n So will the economy contract in 2017? \n \n It doesn\'t appear likely. Demand for automobiles and homes remain strong, and the Fed has signaled multiple times that it believes the economy is strong enough to endure higher interest rates. \n \n But that doesn\'t mean you should expect prices to rise forever, or at least as much as they have in the recent past. \n \n ""With earnings growing more slowly, dividend yields and bond coupons low, and the potential for P/E ratios and real yields to mean revert, a traditional 60/40 U.S. stock/bond portfolio could well generate returns over the next five years that are less than half the roughly 8% annualized gain that such a portfolio provided over the past 25 years,"" says Kelly.']",3,"– Tsai Ing-wen promised a ""new era"" for Taiwan on Saturday after being elected as the island's first female president. The 59-year-old, from the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party, defeated the Nationalist Party's Eric Chu with around 60% of the vote, reports the Los Angeles Times. Tsai will take office in May. Nationalist President Ma Ying-jeou has already served two terms and Taiwan's constitution didn't allow him to seek a third, the AP notes. ""We failed. The Nationalist Party lost the elections. We didn't work hard enough,"" Chu told supporters at party headquarters, announcing his resignation as party chief. The election marks what the BBC calls a ""turning point in Taiwan's democracy and relationship with China,"" which still officially considers the island to be a renegade province. ""I am very happy. I feel I have finally accomplished something for Taiwan, so that Taiwan will have great autonomy instead of just following China,"" a 32-year-old engineer who voted for Tsai tells the LAT. Tsai has said she favors maintaining the status quo, though her refusal to support the principle of reunification between China and Taiwan makes it uncertain whether the closer ties with Beijing that Ma introduced will continue, reports the AP."

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. \n \n / Updated By Sarah Fitzpatrick, Tracy Connor, Tom Winter and Ben Collins \n \n Stormy Daniels\' attorney claimed Tuesday that President Donald Trump\'s personal lawyer Michael Cohen received $500,000 from a company controlled by a Russian oligarch, deposited into an account for a company also used to pay off the adult film actress. \n \n Daniels\' attorney, Michael Avenatti, also detailed other transactions he said were suspicious, including deposits from drug giant Novartis, the state-run Korea Aerospace Industries, and AT&T. \n \n Novartis confirmed it had paid Cohen\'s company, Essential Consultants, and said Special Counsel Robert Mueller had inquired about the arrangement in November. AT&T also confirmed it paid Cohen\'s company, for ""insights"" into the Trump administration. \n \n Avenatti\'s claims, made in a dossier posted to Twitter, could suggest a new dimension to the federal investigation into Cohen. NBC News has reviewed financial documents that appear to support Avenatti’s account of the transactions. \n \n ""This thing is a pig and they can try to put lipstick on a pig — tonight, next week, next month — but it\'s still gonna be a pig,"" Avenatti said on MSNBC\'s ""The Last Word with Lawrence O\'Donnell."" \n \n ""This thing\'s ugly and it\'s gonna get worse."" \n \n Cohen disputed Avenatti\'s accounting but provided no details. \n \n ""His document is inaccurate,"" he said as he left a Manhattan hotel and got into a cab Wednesday morning. \n \n Avenatti said his investigation uncovered that $4.4 million flowed through a First Republic account linked to Essential Consultants between October 2016 and January 2018. Essential Consultants is the company Cohen created before the 2016 election and then used to wire $130,000 to Daniels to stop her from going public with her account of an alleged sexual affair with Trump a decade ago. \n \n In particular, Avenatti identified eight transactions between January and August 2017, totaling half a million dollars, from U.S.-based Columbus Nova, which he said is controlled by Russian billionaire Viktor Vekselberg and Vekselberg\'s cousin Andrew Intrater. \n \n In a statement, an attorney for Columbus Nova said the management firm is owned and controlled by Americans and not Vekselberg, who is the president of the Russian conglomerate Renovo Group. \n \n ""After the inauguration, the firm hired Michael Cohen as a business consultant regarding potential sources of capital and potential investments in real estate and other ventures,"" the Columbus Nova statement said. \n \n ""Reports today that Viktor Vekselberg used Columbus Nova as a conduit for payments to Michael Cohen are false. The claim that Viktor Vekselberg was involved or provided any funding for Columbus Nova\'s engagement of Michael Cohen is patently untrue. \n \n ""Neither Viktor Vekselberg nor anyone else other than Columbus Nova\'s owners, were involved in the decision to hire Cohen or provided funding for his engagement."" \n \n This thing is a pig and they can try to put lipstick on a pig — tonight, next week, next month — but it\'s still gonna be a pig. \n \n Columbus Nova was listed on the website of the Renova Group as one of its ""companies"" until November 2017.

Columbus Nova itself is not now, and has never been, owned by any foreign entity or person including Viktor Vekselberg or the Renova Group."" \n \n A review of public election filings shows that the CEO of Columbus Nova, Andrew Intrater, made several political donations over the past two years. \n \n According to public record filings he donated $29,600 to the Republican National Committee in June 2017, $35,000 to the Trump Victory PAC the same month, and then $250,000 to the Trump Inauguration Fund.

He noted reports that said Trump met with Novartis\' CEO in January 2018. In a statement, Novartis said it had a one-year agreement with Essential Consultants, ""focused on U.S. healthcare policy matters,"" that expired in February. It was contacted in November by Mueller\'s office and ""cooperated fully,"" it said. \n \n AT&T made four payments of $50,000 each to Essential in late 2017 and early 2018.

AT&T confirmed its connection Tuesday evening. \n \n Avenatti did not reveal the source of his information or release documentation. But in a seven-page memo, Avenatti detailed what he said were wire transfers going into and out of the account Cohen used to pay Daniels $130,000 in October 2016 to stay silent about her alleged affair with the soon-to-be president. Trump denies having an affair with Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford. \n \n Financial documents reviewed Tuesday by The Associated Press appeared to back up Avenatti\'s report. \n \n The memo, containing highly specific dates and amounts, stated that Viktor Vekselberg, a Russian billionaire, and his cousin ""routed"" eight payments totaling approximately $500,000 to Cohen\'s company, Essential Consultants, between January and August 2017. The reason for the payment was not known. \n \n Speculating without offering proof, the Avenatti memo said, ""It appears these funds may have replenished the account following the payment to Ms. Clifford."" \n \n Avenatti\'s memo said the deposits into the account controlled by Cohen were made by Columbus Nova, an American investment company affiliated with the Renova Group, which is controlled by Vekselberg. \n \n Columbus Nova\'s attorney Richard Owens stressed in a statement that the company is ""solely owned and controlled by Americans"" and said that, after Trump\'s inauguration, the firm hired Cohen as a business consultant ""regarding potential sources of capital and potential investments in real estate and other ventures,"" but that it had nothing to do with Vekselberg. \n \n Owens said any suggestion that Vekselberg used Columbus Nova as a conduit for payments to Cohen was false. ""Neither Viktor Vekselberg nor anyone else, other than Columbus Nova\'s owners, were involved in the decision to hire Cohen or provided funding for his engagement,"" he said. \n \n Cohen and his attorney did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Cohen is currently under investigation by federal prosecutors in New York, but hasn\'t been charged. \n \n At the time of the payments, there was an active FBI counterintelligence investigation — which special counsel Robert Mueller took over last May — into Russian election interference and any possible coordination with Trump associates. \n \n Vekselberg was targeted for U.S. sanctions by the Trump administration last month. He built his fortune, currently estimated by Forbes at $14.6 billion, by investing in the aluminum and oil industries. More recently, he has expanded his assets to include industrial equipment and high technology. \n \n Offering confirmation for more of the payments, AT&T said in a statement that Essential Consultants was one of several firms it ""engaged in early 2017 to provide insights into understanding the new administration."" \n \n Avenatti alleged that the company made four $50,000 payments to Cohen totaling $200,000 in late 2017 and early 2018. \n \n AT&T said Cohen\'s company ""did no legal or lobbying work for us, and the contract ended in December 2017."" Cohen is not a registered lobbyist, according to public records. \n \n Such a confidential relationship would not violate federal lobbying laws if Cohen did not seek to influence Trump on the companies\' behalf. But hiring the president\'s personal attorney for advice on how to woo Trump would be highly unusual, especially given that Cohen was never formally involved in the campaign or Trump\'s administration. \n \n Making the arrangement even stranger, the blue-chip companies\' payments to Cohen were routed to Essential Consultants LLC — the same company Cohen used to buy Stormy Daniels\' silence about her alleged affair with the President. \n \n Trump\'s Justice Department has sued to block AT&T from an $85 billion merger with Time Warner, saying it would hurt competition and consumers would have to pay more to watch their favorite shows. \n \n Korea Aerospace, which is alleged to have paid Cohen $150,000 in November 2017, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for Novartis, a multinational pharmaceutical company, could not confirm or deny the payment, but said any agreements with Essential Consultants were entered before the company\'s current CEO took over in February of this year and have since expired. \n \n The memo alleges the company paid Cohen $399,920 in late 2017 and early 2018 in four payments — each amounting to $99,980. \n \n Trump had dinner with Novartis\' soon-to-be CEO Vasant Narasimhan, along with other European executives, at the World Economic Forum in Davos shortly after the date of the final payment. \n \n Larry Noble, senior director of the Campaign Legal Center, said there\'s nothing technically wrong with companies like Novartis and AT&T hiring people like Cohen to provide insight into the president\'s thinking. But he said the arrangement described by Avenatti ""certainly doesn\'t look good."" \n \n ""Why would you go to the president\'s private fixer?"" he asked. ""He\'s not known for policy and he\'s not in the administration. You\'re going to someone who can get you access and tell you about the person of the president. That\'s unusual."" \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writers Chad Day and Jeff Horwitz in Washington, Jake Pearson in New York and Mike Balsamo in Los Angeles contributed to this report.', '(CNN) Special counsel Robert Mueller \'s investigators have questioned a Russian oligarch about hundreds of thousands of dollars in payments his company\'s US affiliate made to President Donald Trump\'s personal attorney, Michael Cohen, after the election, according to a source familiar with the matter. \n \n Viktor Vekselberg, chairman of asset manager Renova Group, is an oligarch close to Vladimir Putin, and last month the Trump administration placed him on a list of sanctioned Russians for activities including election interference. The purpose of the payments, which predate the sanctions, and the nature of the business relationship between Vekselberg and Cohen is unclear. \n \n The scrutiny of the payments could add to the legal troubles for Cohen, whose home and office were raided last month as part of a criminal investigation by federal prosecutors in Manhattan. In court documents, the prosecutors said at least part of their inquiry stemmed from a referral from Mueller\'s office. \n \n The questions asked of Vekselberg suggest that Mueller investigators have been examining some of Cohen\'s business relationships as part of the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. Vekselberg is one of two Russian oligarchs the FBI stopped earlier this year after their private jets landed in New York-area airports as part of Mueller\'s investigation. \n \n Investigators also asked Vekselberg about donations the head of his US affiliate made to Trump\'s inaugural fund and campaign funds, sources said. \n \n The attorney for Stormy Daniels -- the porn star who received $130,000 to keep quiet about an alleged affair she had with Trump a decade ago -- produced information Tuesday evening that appears to add further details to CNN\'s reporting. Michael Avenatti alleged that Cohen received half a million dollars from a company affiliated with Vekselberg in the months after the presidential election. \n \n Avenatti alleged the $500,000 went into the bank account for Essential Consultants, a shell company that Cohen set up before the election that was used to pay Daniels. Avenatti added that the payments occurred from January to August 2017. \n \n CNN has reviewed documents that appear to show these payments. CNN has not independently authenticated the documents. \n \n Prosecutors have not accused Cohen of wrongdoing in regard to the payments or any other business dealings. \n \n What FBI agents wanted to know \n \n FBI agents asked Vekselberg about payments his company\'s American affiliate, Columbus Nova, made to Cohen, according to one source. The Russian was questioned as well about $300,000 in political donations by Andrew Intrater, Vekselberg\'s American cousin who is the head of Columbus Nova, sources said. \n \n Intrater was also questioned by Mueller\'s investigators, two sources told CNN. Last month, Vekselberg was placed on the US government\'s list of sanctioned individuals, prohibiting him from traveling to the US. \n \n The payments occurred at the same time Cohen was trying to build a consulting and legal business after the election and around the time he left the Trump Organization. At that time, he was still Trump\'s personal lawyer. Even last month, as Trump responded to questions about the payment to Daniels, the President deferred to Cohen and said, ""Michael is my attorney."" \n \n In court filings, Cohen\'s attorney said that Cohen has seven clients for whom he provides ""strategic advice and business consulting."" The attorney did not specify whether Columbus Nova was one of those clients. \n \n After publication, Columbus Nova provided a statement from its attorney, Richard Owens. \n \n ""Columbus Nova is a management company solely owned and controlled by Americans,"" the statement said. ""After the inauguration, the firm hired Michael Cohen as a business consultant regarding potential sources of capital and potential investments in real estate and other ventures. Reports today that Viktor Vekselberg used Columbus Nova as a conduit for payments to Michael Cohen are false. The claim that Viktor Vekselberg was involved or provided any funding for Columbus Nova\'s engagement of Michael Cohen is patently untrue. Neither Viktor Vekselberg nor anyone else other than Columbus Nova\'s owners, were involved in the decision to hire Cohen or provided funding for his engagement."" \n \n Later Tuesday, Eric Kosta, general counsel of Columbus Nova, sent this statement: ""As the General Counsel of Columbus Nova, I can confirm that the company is 100% owned and controlled by Americans. Any suggestion that at any point in time Viktor Vekselberg or any of his companies owned or exercised any control over Columbus Nova is patently untrue."" \n \n Intrater did not respond to requests for comment. An attorney for Vekselberg did not respond to a request for comment, nor did representatives for his company in Russia. Cohen did not respond to a request for comment. \n \n Prosecutors with the US attorney\'s office in Manhattan are investigating Cohen\'s personal financial dealings, including his taxi business and payments made to silence Daniels, sources have told CNN. The FBI raided Cohen\'s home, office and hotel room last month, seizing at least eight boxes of documents and more than a dozen electronic devices. Cohen\'s attorney said the inquiry was referred by Mueller\'s team. \n \n Campaign donations under scrutiny \n \n Vekselberg\'s cousin Intrater gave generously to support Trump. \n \n He donated $250,000 to the Trump inauguration fund, $35,000 to the Trump Victory Fund, and $29,600 to the Republican National Committee in June 2017, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. \n \n While it is illegal for foreigners to donate to US politics, Intrater is American. \n \n However, the donations were a sharp increase from previous cycles and may raise questions for investigators. Intrater\'s only previous political donations included $1,200 to Democrat Bill Richardson\'s presidential run in 2008 and $2,600 in 2014 for Republican Chris Day\'s congressional race in New York. Renova Group donated between $50,000 and $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation, but it\'s not clear when the contribution occurred, according to the foundation\'s public list of donors. \n \n Vekselberg may also be of interest to investigators because of his close ties to the Kremlin. He built his fortune following the collapse of the Soviet Union through a series of deals in the oil and gas sector. In 2004, he paid over $100 million to buy nine Faberge eggs from the American Forbes family, returning the second-largest collection of imperial eggs to Russia. Six years later, he was appointed by then-Russian president Dmitry Medvedev to lead the Skolkovo Innovation Center project, the Kremlin\'s answer to Silicon Valley. \n \n From 2007 until March 2012, Vekselberg was a shareholder and chairman of the board of Rusal, the aluminum company controlled by Oleg Deripaska. Deripaska has business ties to former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who has been indicted on fraud and tax related charges as part of Mueller\'s investigation. Manafort has pleaded not guilty. Deripaska, who also was added to the US sanctions list last month, has sued Manafort over a soured investment deal. \n \n Lamesa Investments Ltd, an affiliate of Renova, acquired a large stake in the Bank of Cyprus at the same time Wilbur Ross, then a private equity investor, made a capital infusion into the then-struggling bank. Lamesa now holds a 9.2% stake in the Bank of Cyprus. Ross resigned from his position as vice chairman of the bank after he was confirmed as Trump\'s commerce secretary. \n \n Vekselberg also attended the December 2015 dinner in Moscow for RT, the state-controlled television channel, where Michael Flynn, Trump\'s former national security adviser, sat beside Putin, according to NBC News. Flynn has pleaded guilty to lying about a call he had with the Russian ambassador during the presidential transition and is cooperating with the Mueller investigation. \n \n Update: This story has been updated to include Columbus Nova\'s latest statement.', 'Michael Cohen, a longtime lawyer for President Trump, was reportedly hired last year by the U.S.-based affiliate of a Russian billionaire with close ties to Russian President Vladi\xadmir Putin. (Seth Wenig/AP) \n \n President Trump’s personal attorney Michael Cohen was hired last year by the U.S.-based affiliate of a Russian business magnate who attended Trump’s inauguration and was recently subjected to sanctions by the U.S. government, the company said Tuesday. \n \n The New York investment firm Columbus Nova said it retained Cohen as a consultant “regarding potential sources of capital and potential investments in real estate and other ventures.” Though Columbus Nova has been described in federal regulatory filings as an affiliate of the Renova Group, founded by Russian billionaire Viktor Vekselberg, the company said Vekselberg was not involved with hiring or paying Cohen. \n \n The company’s confirmation came after Michael Avenatti, a lawyer for adult-film actress Stormy Daniels, circulated on Twitter a document purporting to show a detailed accounting of wire transfers made to Essential Consultants, a company established by Cohen in October 2016. \n \n The payments listed in the document began in the months after Cohen paid $130,000 to Daniels just before the November 2016 election, as part of an agreement that required her to not speak publicly about an affair she says she had with Trump a decade earlier. \n \n In the document, Avenatti claims that Cohen received $500,000 from Columbus Nova between January 2017 and August 2017. \n \n Avenatti did not provide supporting documentation for his claims, though Columbus Nova and AT&T;, another company named in the document, both released statements in the hours after Avenatti’s disclosure confirming that they had business relationships with Cohen. \n \n Avenatti alleged that Vekselberg might have provided funds that “replenished the account” following Cohen’s payments to Daniels. In a statement, a spokesman for Vekselberg said neither the Russian billionaire nor the Renova Group has any “contractual relationship” with Cohen. \n \n [Analysis: How money flowed through Michael Cohen’s multipurpose shell company] \n \n The payments from Columbus Nova point to a potential new financial tie between the president’s personal lawyer and a U.S. representative of a key Russian figure. Vekselberg, who is close to Russian President Vladi\xadmir Putin, was one of two dozen Russian business executives and government officials sanctioned in April as part of the U.S. response to the poisoning of a former Russian intelligence officer in southern England. \n \n Columbus Nova hired Cohen as U.S. investigators were ramping up their inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The chief executive of the U.S. affiliate is Vekselberg’s cousin, Andrew Intrater, a U.S. citizen who donated $250,000 to Trump’s inauguration and made additional contributions to a Trump campaign committee and to the Republican National Committee. \n \n More broadly, the revelations show that companies with business interests before the U.S. government hired Cohen, a longtime Trump associate, by paying him through Essential Consultants, which he also used to pay Daniels before the election. \n \n The document from Avenatti says AT&T; paid Cohen $50,000 a month for four months starting in October 2017, just weeks before Trump’s Justice Department filed suit to block AT&T;’s acquisition of Time Warner. \n \n A spokesman for AT&T; confirmed that the company engaged Essential Consultants, a company formed by Cohen in early 2017, “to provide insights into understanding the new administration.” \n \n “They did no legal or lobbying work for us, and the contract ended in December 2017,” the spokesman added. \n \n Cohen was receiving payments from Columbus Nova during the same months that Trump attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani has said Trump was paying Cohen $35,000 a month in legal fees. \n \n Giuliani has said Trump’s money served as a reimbursement for the funds Cohen provided to Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford. \n \n Stephen Ryan, a lawyer for Cohen, did not respond to requests for comment. \n \n Cohen’s finances are of intense interest to federal authorities in New York, who last month served search warrants on his home, office and hotel room, gathering documents related to the Daniels payment as well as to Cohen’s personal businesses. \n \n Cohen’s lawyers have fought in court to restrict prosecutors’ access to the material seized in those raids. As part of that legal fight, they told a judge that in 2017, Cohen had three legal clients and seven clients to whom he provided “strategic advice and business consulting.” \n \n Avenatti’s document might provide a road map to those clients. He claims that Cohen also received payments from the drug company Novartis Investments and from Korea Aerospace Industries. Each has important business considerations with the U.S. government. \n \n Shortly after the last transaction from Novartis identified by Avenatti, in January, Trump met with executives including the incoming CEO of Novartis, Vas Narasimhan, during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \n \n A Novartis spokesman said any agreements with Essential Consultants took place before the new CEO took over in February and have since expired. \n \n Korea Aerospace is in contention for a multibillion-dollar joint contract with Lockheed Martin to produce jet trainers for the U.S. Air Force. A company representative confirmed paying the Cohen company, but said the payments were to provide legal consulting to assist in the company’s reorganization of its “internal accounting system” and did not involve the Air Force deal or other lobbying. \n \n The company added that it learned only recently of Essential Consultants’ Trump ties. \n \n In a Wednesday morning tweet, Avenatti said it was “priceless” to watch the various companies that paid Cohen try to explain their reasons for doing so. \n \n “Watching all of the companies that sent money to the LLC slush fund come up with different alleged reasons for hiring Mr. Cohen — ‘accounting advice,’ ‘real estate consulting,’ ‘insight,’ etc. Who knew Mr. Cohen was such a brilliant renaissance man?” \n \n Vekselberg is a Russian billionaire who regularly participates in gatherings of Russian business leaders with Putin and sometimes meets one on one with the Russian president, according to news accounts and people familiar with his role. \n \n In March 2017, the two sat down to discuss infrastructure projects, according to Russian state news reports. Vekselberg funds several critically important prestige projects, including Skolkovo, the business incubator touted as Russia’s answer to Silicon Valley. \n \n Vekselberg’s spokesman Andrey Shtorkh confirmed to The Washington Post in January that Vekselberg had attended Trump’s inauguration as a guest of one of his American business partners. \n \n A person familiar with the inauguration said the partner was Intrater, and the New York Times has reported that Intrater and Vekselberg have both been interviewed by prosecutors working for special counsel Robert S. Mueller III. \n \n Two people familiar with Mueller’s probe told The Post that the special counsel is investigating whether foreign money helped fund Trump’s inauguration. By law, only U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents can donate to a U.S. inaugural committee. \n \n In addition to Intrater’s donation to Trump’s inauguration, an additional $1 million to support the inauguration came from Access Industries, which was founded by Leonard Blavatnik, a Soviet-born American British billionaire who is a longtime friend and business associate of Vekselberg. \n \n Shtorkh told The Post in January that Vekselberg had met the past three U.S. presidents as part of his efforts to expand Russia’s international economic relations but that this was the first time the magnate attended a presidential inauguration. \n \n Photographs also show that Vekselberg attended a December 2015 dinner in Moscow to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Russian television network RT. Another attendee of the dinner, seated next to Putin, was Michael Flynn, who later became Trump’s national security adviser. \n \n Alice Crites, Carol D. Leonnig, Beth Reinhard, Ashley Parker, Craig Timberg and John Wagner in Washington and Min Joo Kim in Seoul contributed to this report.']",4,"– Michael Cohen's legal woes appeared to deepen Tuesday night with a bombshell release from Stormy Daniels' attorney. According to financial records reviewed by the New York Times and NBC News, a company linked to a Russian oligarch targeted by US sanctions deposited around $500,000 into an account controlled by Essential Consultants, the shell company Cohen used to pay hush money to Daniels before the 2016 election. Michael Avenatti alleges that funds from oligarch Viktor Vekselberg may have ""replenished the account"" in a series of payments in 2017 after the Daniels settlement, though Columbus Nova, a US affiliate of a Vekselberg company, denies that he was involved in its payments to Trump's personal lawyer, the Washington Post reports. The purpose of the company's payments is unclear. Sources tell CNN that Robert Mueller's investigators have already quizzed Vekselberg about the payments to Cohen's company. Records reviewed by the Times show that around $4.4 million flowed through the Essential Consultants account between its creation weeks before the 2016 election and January this year, including hundreds of thousands of dollars from pharmaceutical firm Novartis, AT&T, and Korea Aerospace. AT&T confirmed the payments late Tuesday, saying Cohen's firm was among those it ""engaged in early 2017 to provide insights into understanding the new administration,"" the AP reports. Cohen isn't a registered lobbyist, and while the unusual payments may not have broken any laws, Trump and his attorney ""have a lot of explaining to do,"" Avenatti said in a tweet Tuesday."
93,"['On July 26, Shoukhrat Mitalipov woke up to headlines about his research: “First human embryos edited in US,” said one; “Genome of viable human embryos edited in controversial study,” said another. Normally, this would be a cause for celebration for the Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) professor. But in this case, all the media coverage did was stress him out—his study wasn’t supposed to be published until Aug. 2. \n \n “I don’t know how it got leaked,” Mitalipov said on July 28. “It’s likely because of a combination of hot words: Crispr, gene-editing, and designer babies.” \n \n He sounded annoyed, and justifiably so. The articles had rung alarm bells about “designer babies” engineered to have advantageous genetic traits, but his research was far from proving that a possibility. Although it did involve the use of human embryos—which is a union of egg and sperm—it also wasn’t particularly controversial. In 2015, after a long debate, experts at the US National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine concluded that this sort of research on human embryos should be encouraged. And in fact, one prominent news story that called Mitalipov’s study “controversial” actually contained testimonies from two bioethicists who supported the study (the headline has since been changed). \n \n Today (Aug. 2), Mitalipov’s study was published in the journal Nature. It shows the first highly successful use of the gene-editing technique called Crispr to improve human health: his team was able correct a genetic mutation that causes a life-threatening cardiac disease. None of the embryos were allowed to come to term. But if Mitalipov has his way, future projects could eradicate a disease that affects millions—one in 500 people carry the mutation—and even kills unsuspecting, seemingly fit adults. \n \n Picking the target \n \n On Mar. 4, 1990, Loyola Marymount University basketball player Hank Gathers dunked the ball to put the Loyola Lions well ahead of the University of Portland Pilots. Immediately afterwards he collapsed and stopped breathing. There were 13 minutes left in the basketball game; he’d given everything to the sport. The cause of death was later determined to be hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), the most common inherited cardiac disease and the most common cause of death in young athletes. \n \n Mitalipov began working on the project three years ago. He knew he wanted to try to use Crispr to cure a genetic disease, but first he needed to pick which mutation in the human genome to target. He could have chosen from thousands, but Sanjeev Kaul, a cardiovascular specialist at OHSU, convinced Mitalipov to go after the HCM gene mutation. \n \n “It’s such a terrible disease to deal with it, and it’s present in a large population,” Mitalipov says. “In India, for instance, nearly one in ten people carry it.” \n \n The most common cause of HCM is a genetic mutation in one of nine genes. Mitalipov’s research shows that you can take a human embryo with one such mutation, where the human genome is missing four base pairs (or letters of DNA) and simply correct it. In theory, if you let that embryo grow, it would develop into a human without HCM. \n \n Substitutes won’t do \n \n Next Mitalipov had to convince the OHSU review board to approve the use of human embryos. That part took about two years. \n \n Most research to understand what happens at the embryonic stage of human development is done on embryo-like cells, created by exposing adult stem cells to a special handful of chemicals. But though embryo-like cells have been a boon for research, they are not a perfect replacement for embryonic cells. Certain things, like DNA repair systems, can be quite different in embryos than they are in embryo-like cells. \n \n And DNA repair was key to Mitalipov’s research. Crispr is the most precise gene-editing technique we have, but it doesn’t actually “edit” genes. Instead, it seeks out the gene it has been programmed to target and then makes a snip. The next step almost always involves relying on the cell’s own DNA repair system, which finds the cut and does its best to fix it. \n \n In most cells in the body, there are two repair systems. The system most often used by the body requires less effort, but it also does a sloppy job: sometimes inserting a letter of DNA where it doesn’t belong and other times deleting a letter of DNA that should be there. The other repair system produces more accurate results, but the cells need to put in more effort to make it happen, so it’s rarely used. However, past research hinted that human egg cells tend to use the second system. Mitalipov needed this especially strong DNA repair system to accomplish his Crispr-HCM edit. \n \n With the case made and approval secured, Mitalipov’s team went into full gear. A group of collaborators recruited a man with the HCM mutation who would donate sperm, and a dozen healthy women who would donate eggs for the research. \n \n Beating China \n \n Three previous studies that used Crispr in human embryos—all conducted in China—produced poor results. The first, published in 2015, injected Crispr in 86 non-viable embryos (all discards from in-vitro fertilization treatment), in an effort to cure the inherited blood disorder β-thalassemia. It only worked in about 33% of the samples, and even then in those cases it was far from perfect: each had undesirable cuts in other locations on the genome (called “off-target effects”). \n \n Another attempt published in 2016 tried a different tack. Instead of removing a mutation, it sought to induce one that would provide resistance to HIV. Gene insertion was only successful in 25% of the 26 non-viable embryos, and many of those “successes” ended up with the wrong mutation. \n \n Earlier this year, the researchers made the case that the reason their 2016 study failed wasn’t because Crispr wasn’t doing its job. Instead, they suspected that the embryos used, because they were non-viable, were too abnormal to effectively test Crispr’s precision. But in a new study using six viable human embryos, they were still able to fully correct the mutation in only one. In another two, they fixed the mutation but in only some of the cells of the embryo—leading to a condition known as “mosaicism.” In these cases, if the embryo were to come to term, it would create a human whose body has some cells with the mutation and others without. The upshot would be that there’s no guarantee the adult would be free of the disease. \n \n Mitalipov had a plan to avoid both off-target effects and mosaicism. Instead of injecting Crispr after the embryo had formed, he decided to make the snip during the process of fertilization. So while injecting sperm, he also injected Crispr. \n \n OHSU The first sign of successful in vitro fertilization, after co-injection of a gene-correcting enzyme and sperm from a donor with a genetic mutation known to cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. \n \n The programmed Crispr system located the position in the sperm DNA where the man’s genome was missing the four key base pairs and it made a simple cut there. The fertilization process began with the cut in place. However, at some point during the early stages of the development of the embryo—and Mitalipov doesn’t know exactly when—the egg’s DNA repair system kicked in. The new embryo contained one strand of DNA from the mother, which the team knew to be healthy and without the HCM mutation, and another strand from the father that included a snip at the location of the HCM mutation. \n \n When the egg’s more accurate DNA repair system detects the cut in the paternal strand, it started fixing it, using the maternal strand as a model. And because the maternal strand was healthy, the repair system added the four missing base pairs to the paternal strand, and the HCM mutation in the embryo was corrected. (This method is only applicable to situations where one parent has the mutation; if both parents have the same mutation, this type of DNA repair system has no functional model to copy.) \n \n Mitalipov’s team tested their technique on a total of 163 viable embryos, and the mutation was corrected successfully in nearly 50% of them. Better still, only one of those embryos showed mosaicism and none showed any off-target effects. \n \n Two independent experts Quartz contacted—Dieter Egli of Columbia University and Maria Jasin of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center—weren’t sure Mitalipov’s claims were water tight. Based on the information provided in the study, Egli couldn’t confidently say for sure that the tests used to detect mosaicism caught all mosaics. In other words, it’s possible that results appear to be more positive than they actually are. Jasin pointed out that more evidence was needed to back up the claim that it was the more accurate method of DNA repair that the embryo used. She acknowledged that working with human embryos has extra constraints because researchers need to justify the use of every extra embryo, but still felt there were some gaps in the study. \n \n The father of human genetic engineering \n \n If the results do stand up, they are orders of magnitude better than the three previous Chinese attempts—both because of the rate of success and the number of viable embryos tested. But Mitalipov acknowledges that it’s still not good enough. “A 50% success rate is too low,” he says. \n \n Reuters/Richard Clement Shoukhrat Mitalipov of Oregon Health & Science University. \n \n His exacting standards have paid off in the past. Mitalipov’s groundbreaking work in the late 2000s paved the way for “three-parent babies;” last year, a technique he developed contributed to the birth of the first genetically engineered baby born with DNA from two females and one male. \n \n The technique cures mitochondrial disease, which is caused because of faulty mitochondria, the power packs in each human cell that converts sugar into a usable form of energy. Children born with mitochondrial disease either die young or live disabled lives. \n \n Most human genes are jammed into the cell’s nucleus, but there’s a tiny fraction (37 out of 20,000) present in mitochondria. These genes are only passed down from mother to child. Mitalipov developed the technique to replace a mother’s faulty mitochondria with healthy ones from a female donor. Though the baby will mostly still be the genetic child of one man and one woman, he or she will have a small number of genes from another woman, technically a third “parent.” \n \n “In 2009, when I published my research on mitochondrial replacement, people laughed at me,” he says. “They said ‘You will never bring it to clinic.’ Look where we are today.” \n \n He first developed the technique in monkeys, and then progressed to human embryos—reaching success rates of 99%. He has the same ambition for Crispr-edited human embryos. \n \n “I have a very strong opinion on clinical applications. I didn’t do this research to satisfy my curiosity,” Mitalipov says. “This was done to develop the technology and bring it to clinics. It may take a decade, but we will be there.” \n \n Slippery slope? \n \n Crispr-editing of human embryos is a much more complex endeavor than the three-parent baby technique. There is no guarantee, for instance, that the steps used by Mitalipov to fix the HCM mutation would work on other similar mutations or on more complex ones. However, if the technique is perfected, it will have a much greater impact on human health than anything the three-parent technique could ever offer. \n \n The complexity is also a safeguard against the use of the technique to, say, create babies with traits such as higher intelligence or greater strength. We don’t yet understand the sheer number of genes involved in the creation of those traits, let alone what it would take to make such detailed edits to the human genome. In other words, even if you think it’s an ethical hazard to the Crispr to provide advantageous mutations, there’s no reason to worry right now; those “designer babies” are decades away. \n \n A more immediate threat is unregulated use. Genetic engineering of humans has already begun, and there is real danger in people with inadequate understanding of the risks starting to use Crispr to edit out inherited illnesses and bring the embryos to term. The baby is likely to suffer mosaicism, off-target effects, or other as-yet-undetected consequences, and we don’t know what that could do to the person born with them. \n \n The first three-parent baby was born in Mexico, because at the time the country had no regulations on the use of the technique. Though the baby was reported to be healthy few months after birth, the risks of things going awry are much higher without the rigorous checks provided by clinical trials in a country with strong regulations. (The second three-parent birth was reported to have occurred in Ukraine.) \n \n OHSU Embryos after co-injection developing into blastocysts, which could someday be used in fertility clinics to help people trying to have children free of genetic disease. \n \n “Unfortunately, that’s a risk,” admits Paula Amato, a gynecologist who collaborates with Mitalipov at the OHSU. “Obviously, we would prefer clinical applications occur in a regulated environment. But it’s not something we can control.” In the US, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) forbids the use of human embryos in clinical trials. “So it’s not surprising to me that people would attempt to circumvent such restrictions,” Amato says. \n \n In the US, only pre-clinical research involving human embryos is allowed and even for that government funds aren’t available. Mitalipov’s work was supported mostly by OHSU’s institutional funds and the rest through charitable foundations. His collaborators in South Korea, where human embryo research is strictly forbidden, had to get lawyers and were only able to handle DNA extracts from the test embryos, and not the embryos themselves. \n \n There are some places that offer regulated environments without stifling experimentation and clinical use. Amato points to the UK, the first country to offer licenses to create three-parent babies, if those applying could make the case for it. The country spent years debating the topic among experts and holding public consultations before it reached that stage. \n \n Ultimately, if society would like to see the use of Crispr or other techniques to rid humanity of devastating diseases, countries will need to undertake a process similar to what the UK went through. Without hearing the voice of the public and putting the right regulations in place, the fear of “designer babies” could not only lead to dangerous experimentation in unregulated environments, but also quash the true potential of this powerful tool.', 'President Barack Obama ordered grisly photographs of Osama bin Laden in death sealed from public view on Wednesday, declaring, ""We don\'t need to spike the football"" in triumph after this week\'s daring middle-of-the-night raid.

The residents of Abbottabad seem to be confused and suspicious about the killing... (Associated Press) \n \n Several weapons were found in the room where the terror chief died, including AK-47 assault rifles and side arms, the officials said. They spoke on condition of anonymity as they offered the most recent in a series of increasingly detailed and sometimes-shifting accounts of bin Laden\'s final minutes after a decade on the run. \n \n Obama said releasing the photographs taken by the Navy SEAL raiders was ""not who we are"" as a country. Though some may deny his death, ""the fact of the matter is you will not see bin Laden walking this earth again,"" the president said in an interview taped for CBS\' ""60 Minutes."" \n \n He said any release of the photos could become a propaganda tool for bin Laden\'s adherents eager to incite violence. \n \n White House press secretary Jay Carney said the president\'s decision applied to photographs of bin Laden, said to show a portion of his skull blown away from a gunshot wound to the area of his left eye, as well as to a video recording of his burial several hours later in the North Arabian Sea. \n \n The president made no public remarks during the day about the raid, apart from the taped interview. But he arranged a visit for Thursday to ground zero in Manhattan, where the World Trade Center twin towers once stood. \n \n After two days of shifting accounts of the dramatic raid, Carney said he would no longer provide details of the 40-minute operation by the team of elite Navy SEALs. That left unresolved numerous mysteries, prominent among them an exact accounting of bin Laden\'s demise. Officials have said he was unarmed but resisted when an unknown number of commandos burst into his room inside the high-security compound. \n \n The officials who gave the latest details said a U.S. commando grabbed a woman who charged toward the SEALs inside the room. They said the raiders were concerned that she might be wearing a suicide vest. \n \n Administration officials have said bin Laden\'s body was identified by several means, including a DNA test. Members of Congress who received a briefing during the day said a sample from the body killed at the compound in Pakistan was compared to known DNA from bin Laden\'s mother and three sons. \n \n After two days of speculation about releasing the photographs, there was no detectable public debate in the U.S. about the merits of the raid itself against the man behind the terror attacks that killed nearly 3,000 Americans on Sept. 11, 2001. \n \n Attorney General Eric Holder told Congress the operation was ""entirely lawful and consistent with our values"" and justified as ""an action of national self-defense."" Noting that bin Laden had admitted his involvement in the events of nearly a decade ago, he said, ""It\'s lawful to target an enemy commander in the field."" \n \n Holder also said the team that carried out the raid had been trained to take bin Laden alive if he was willing to surrender. ""It was a kill-or-capture mission,"" he said. ""He made no attempt to surrender."" \n \n Bin Laden had evaded capture for nearly a decade, and officials said he had currency as well as two telephone numbers sewn into his clothing when he was killed, suggesting he was prepared to leave his surroundings on a moment\'s notice if he sensed danger. \n \n Administration officials said the two dozen SEALs involved in the operation were back at their home base outside Virginia Beach, Va., and the extensive debriefing they underwent was complete. Saluted as heroes nationwide, they remained publicly unidentified because of security concerns. \n \n In addition to bin Laden\'s body, the SEALs helicoptered out of the compound with computer files, flash drives, DVDs and documents that intelligence officials have begun analyzing in hopes the information will help them degrade or destroy the network bin Laden left behind. \n \n In New York on Thursday, Carney said, Obama will lay a wreath at the World Trade Center site and hold a private meeting with relatives of some of the victims of the attacks, in which jetliners hijacked by terrorists were flown into the side of first one tower, then the other. \n \n The buildings collapsed within minutes, dooming office workers as well as rescuers who had run in hoping to save them. \n \n A few days later, then-President George W. Bush stood amid the rubble and spoke through a bullhorn. When one worker yelled, ""I can\'t hear you,"" the president responded, ""I can hear you! The rest of the world hears you! And the people _ and the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon!"" \n \n A decade _ and long wars in Iraq and Afghanistan later _ Obama said he had no intention of gloating. \n \n Obama\'s decision not to release any photographs was unlikely to be the final word, though. \n \n Some members of Congress have been shown at least one photo of bin Laden, and others have asked to see it, an indication of the intense interest generated by the raid. \n \n The Associated Press on Monday requested through the Freedom of Information Act photos of bin Laden\'s body as well as other materials, including video taken by military personnel during the raid and on the USS Carl Vinson, the ship that conducted bin Laden\'s burial at sea. The government has 20 days to respond. \n \n Some family members of those who died in the 9/11attacks have pressed to have the photographs released to document bin Laden\'s death, as have some skeptics in the Arab world. But many lawmakers and others expressed concern that the photographic images could be seen as a ""trophy"" that would inflame U.S. critics and make it harder for members of the American military deployed overseas to do their jobs. \n \n Obama said he had discussed his decision with Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Defense Secretary Robert Gates ""and my intelligence teams, and they all agree."" \n \n Despite fears of revenge attacks, officials have yet to raise the national threat level. \n \n The disclosure that bin Laden was living in relative comfort inside Pakistan in Abbottabad has provoked some administration officials and lawmakers to question the Pakistani government\'s commitment to the decade-long search for the terrorist leader. \n \n Publicly, Pakistan issued a statement on Monday taking the U.S. to task for an ""unauthorized unilateral action"" that ""cannot be taken as a rule."" \n \n But privately, according to one official, Pakistani Army chief Ashfaq Kayani offered congratulations when Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, called to inform him after the operation, and urged a public release of the news. The official spoke on condition of anonymity, citing the sensitivity of the conversation. \n \n The White House also announced Obama would visit Fort Campbell, Ky., on Friday to greet troops returning from Afghanistan, which the United States attacked in 2001 after its leaders refused to turn over members of the al-Qaida leadership living there. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writers Matt Apuzzo, Nedra Pickler, Nancy Benac, Jim Kuhnhenn, Julie Pace, Donna Cassata and Alan Fram contributed to this report.']",2,"– A convicted killer who escaped from a Michigan prison yesterday and carjacked a woman has been arrested after a car chase in rural LaPorte Country, Indiana, WNDU reports. Michael David Elliot, 40, allegedly stole a woman's red jeep and abandoned it in the small town of Shipshewana, Indiana, this afternoon. A woman spotted the car and called police, who said the vehicle had been seen in the area as early as 5:30am. Knowing Elliot ""can go a lot of places in seven hours,"" police went door-to-door and had schools locked down before releasing students under a heavy police presence. Then a call about a stolen vehicle came in to the LaPorte County Sheriff's Office, and a deputy saw the vehicle and attempted a traffic stop, WOOD-TV reports. But the driver kept going and led authorities on a 5-minute chase. Stop sticks disabled his tires in Kankakee Township; Elliot jumped out and tried to run but was arrested and booked. He was serving five life sentences for the murders of four people when he broke out of the Ionia Correctional Facility yesterday by slipping through a gap in the fencing system."
94,"['""War by its nature entails waste. But the scale of the problems in Iraq and Afghanistan also reflects the toxic interplay of huge sums of money pumped into relatively small economies and an unprecedented reliance on contractors,"" the report said. \n \n Sen. James Webb, D-Virginia, who helped establish the commission three years ago, said Friday that its latest proposals deserve attention from Congress and the Department of Defense and called for a hearing on the matter. \n \n ""The report\'s specific recommendations to address the federal government\'s overreliance on contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan and failure to control the process underscore the importance of the Commission\'s charter,"" Webb said in a prepared statement. \n \n The report repeatedly criticized the federal government for turning to contractors for too many purposes, including monitoring other contractors. \n \n ""The government has abdicated its contracting responsibilities -- too often using contractors as the default mechanism, driven by considerations other than whether they provide the best solution, and without consideration for the resources needed to manage them,"" the report said. \n \n The commission is calling for major reforms to how the government awards and monitors contractors on military, reconstruction and training programs. \n \n ""When it comes to oversight of contingency contracting, we\'ve been driving beyond the reach of our headlights,"" Commission Co-Chairman Michael Thibault said in a statement released with the report. ""Reforms are badly needed."" \n \n The report says that contractors often face great risks. ""Between September 2001 and December 2010, over 2,200 contractor employees of all nationalities have died and over 49,800 were injured in Iraq and Afghanistan,"" the report says. ""These contractors\' deaths and injuries should not be ignored, but should be a part of the public debate on the cost of war."" \n \n Among the proposals to rein in contractors is the creation of special teams of full-time federal workers to be ready to deploy and monitor projects. The report says the government also should restrict reliance on contractors for security by embedding government workers responsible for command and control and oversight.', '-An ill-conceived project, no matter how well-managed, is wasteful if it does not fit the cultural, political and economic mores of the society it is meant to serve, or if it cannot be supported and maintained. \n \n \n \n -Poor planning and oversight by the US government, as well as poor performance on the part of contractors, have costly outcomes: time and money misspent are lost for other purposes. \n \n \n \n -Criminal behavior and blatant corruption sap dollars from what could otherwise be successful project outcomes and, more disturbingly, contribute to a climate in which huge amounts of waste are accepted as the norm. \n \n \n \n Since 2002, the United States has spent $117 billion on contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan. According to a new report by the non-partisan Commission on Wartime Contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan, tens of billions of those dollars have been wasted.The report\'s authors note that the ""waste, fraud, and abuse"" they have observed in these contract programs were caused by significant errors. A few of their points, quoted from the report:The U.S. has relied on contractors more heavily in these two wars than in previous others, hiring about 200,000 of them to ""guard bases, build facilities, provide food and laundry services, escort supply and personnel movements, and translate local languages,"" according to Susan Crabtree at Talking Points Memo. She points out that there are almost as many contracted employees working in Afghanistan and Iraq as there are military troops.The commission that put out the report is urging the government to reform its contracting programs and is holding a hearing to review the report\'s findings today.', 'WASHINGTON -- The chairmen of the bipartisan Commission on Wartime Contracting decried on Monday a federal system that has allowed contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan to commit fraud -- then get hired again and again. \n \n ""For the 200,000 people employed by contractors to provide support and capability in Iraq and Afghanistan, accountability is too often absent, diluted, delayed, or avoided,"" Republican co-chair Chris Shays, formerly a longtime congressman from Connecticut, said while calling to order a hearing of the commission Monday. \n \n There are so many barriers to suspending or banning contractors with violations that ""untrustworthy contractors can continue profiting from government work, responsible businesses may be denied opportunities, and costs to taxpayers can climb,"" Shays said in a statement co-authored with his Democratic co-chair, Michael Thibault, formerly the deputy director of the Defense Contract Audit Agency. \n \n The commission last week issued a blistering interim report to Congress: ""At What Risk? Correcting over-reliance on contractors in contingency operations,"" which concluded that ""misspent dollars run into the tens of billions"" out of the nearly $200 billion spent on contracts and grants since 2002 to support military, reconstruction and other U.S. operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. \n \n And that could well be an understatement, the commission noted, because ""it might not take full account of ill-conceived projects, poor planning and oversight by the U.S. government, and criminal behavior and blatant corruption by both government and contractor employees."" \n \n The report suggested that the government stop using contractors so routinely, start taking oversight more seriously and establish strong interagency standards. \n \n It called for an end to contractors\' current role in hiring other contractors, concluding that they tend not to erect the appropriate oversight firewalls. \n \n And most controversially, the report said the extensive use of private security contractors -- which has surged under President Barack Obama -- raises use-of-force issues and creates a gap in legal accountability \n \n So rather than let them run wild, the commission recommended that agencies relying on private security contractors be required to embed government personnel among them who would be ""responsible for leadership, command and control, and oversight of all security contractors and operations."" \n \n (The commission also promised that its final report, due this summer, will further address the over-reliance on private contractors to provide ""movement security"" for government workers in war zones. That\'s a shot across the bow of the State Department.) \n \n The commission\'s findings, however, are just the latest in a litany of official and journalistic reports about the enormous cost of waste, fraud and corruption in Iraq and, particularly, Afghanistan. \n \n Just last month, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction warned that the entire $11.4 billion for constructing and maintaining nearly 900 Afghan National Security Forces facilities is at risk due to inadequate planning. \n \n The Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction said in 2009 that an estimated $3 billion to $5 billion in U.S.-funded infrastructure contracting had been wasted there. \n \n McClatchy Newspapers have exposed example after example of waste and abuse in contracts for Afghan reconstruction. \n \n A State Department cable obtained by WikiLeaks revealed late last year that Afghanistan\'s vice president had been caught carrying $52 million in cash in a Persian Gulf tax haven. \n \n (See 10 more examples.) \n \n In his remarks at Monday\'s hearing, Scott Amey, general counsel for the nonprofit watchdog group Project on Government Oversight (POGO), testified that ""contract award dollars have increased from approximately $200 billion in fiscal year 2000 to over $535 billion in fiscal year 2010."" Meanwhile, however, ""contract administration and oversight have decreased because the acquisition workforce is stretched thin,"" he said. \n \n Since 2002, POGO has maintained a Federal Contract Misconduct Database, which served as the model for the government-created Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), due to become publicly available starting in April. \n \n Witnesses at Monday\'s hearing said, however, that the federal database doesn\'t adequately record contractors\' past performance. \n \n As it happens, the Obama administration recently caved to pressure from contractors and won\'t be making that past performance data available publicly. \n \n But even internally, witnesses said, the state of the data is abysmal. Of the 1,485 past performance reports required from the Department of Defense, only 140 had been entered into the database. Of the 174 required from the State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development, not a single one could actually be found, although USAID insisted 24 had been entered. \n \n And Dan Gordon, President Obama\'s administrator for federal procurement policy, said three-quarters of the performance reports that were filed still lacked required documentation. \n \n But judging from POGO\'s database, Amey testified: \n \n Some of the largest service contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan have checkered histories of misconduct, including instances of shooting civilians, false claims against the government, violations of the Anti-Kickback Act, fraud, retaliation against workers\' complaints, and environmental violations. \n \n Amey also raised an all-too-familiar concern, though from another context: \n \n The government\'s inability to hold all contractors accountable begs the question: Is the government so reliant on large contractors that bad actors are required to preserving legitimate competition and mission accomplishment? This might be the contracting version of ""too big to fail."" \n \n ************************* \n \n Dan Froomkin is senior Washington correspondent for the Huffington Post.

Andy Harris (R-Md.) complained loudly during freshmen orientation that his coverage wouldn\'t start immediately upon taking office. It took a new turn when Rep. Mike Kelly (R-Penn) and Bobby Schilling (R-Ill.) both said they would, in fact, forgo the coverage. It escalated even further when White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs called out Harris for the ""irony,"" and the municipal workers union AFSCME applied a similar charge to the whole GOP shortly thereafter. \n \n ""These Republicans want to repeal health reform, putting the insurance companies back in charge and putting affordable coverage out of reach of millions of Americans,"" said AFSCME President Gerald W. McEntee. ""If they enroll in the taxpayer-funded health care system provided to members of Congress, they deserve to be denounced as hypocrites."" \n \n There is an apparent double standard with respect to lawmakers trying to reduce health care for American workers while taking a subsidy for health care for themselves. And in a Public Policy Poll released on Tuesday, a full 53 percent of respondents (and 58 percent of Republicans) said that if a congressman is opposed to the president\'s health care reform law, he or she should decline to participate in government-sponsored health care. \n \n But another cudgel sits there on the sidelines waiting to be used by trouble-making Democrats. If the incoming Republican Congress is so concerned about the use of taxpayer funds, it could start by foregoing taxpayer-funded health care. How much money that would save is impossible to pinpoint with great accuracy. But it\'s possible to make some reliable estimates. \n \n According to the Los Angeles Times, ""the plan most favored by federal workers is Blue Cross Blue Shield, which covers a family for about $1,030 a month."" Of that total, ""taxpayers kick in $700."" So far there are 242 Republicans set to be seated in the incoming House of Representatives (that could only go higher) and 47 Republicans in the Senate. The taxpayer bill for insuring all those members over the course of a single year comes to just over $2.4 million ($700 X 12 months X 289 members). \n \n Chump change? Yes, it is. That said, chump change seems to always at the heart of the most provocative political battles. During the 2008 presidential campaign, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) made a big issue over the fact that $1 million was being appropriated for a Woodstock museum in upstate New York. \n \n UPDATE: Pete Sepp, the Executive Vice President of National Taxpayers Union -- one of the ultimate penny-pinching organizations in the D.C. area -- calls opting out of health care a ""symbolic and not insignificant"" gesture for congressional Republicans. \n \n ""If lawmakers are looking for ways to say that they feel solidarity with the American people this might be one way to do it,"" said Sepp. ""And, again, if you are looking at dollar amounts that\'s equivalent or a little more of equivalent to [congressmembers] taking a pay cut of about five percent. And, again, we have heard a lot of pledges to reduce the overall budget of Congress by ten percent. So opting out of health care coverage is one place to start.""', 'PARIS (AP) — Two Goodyear bosses held captive by workers spent the night inside a factory in northern France that the company wants to close. \n \n A worker at the Goodyear tire factory guards the human resources chief, Bernard Glesser, left, and the firm\'s production manager Michel Dheilly, right, who have been blocked from leaving the plant in...

(Associated Press) \n \n The plant, which Goodyear has tried to sell or shutter for five years, has become an emblem of France\'s labor issues, and the seizure Monday morning of the two managers — the plant\'s director and human resources chief — resurrected the once-common practice of boss-napping. \n \n Sylvain Niel, a labor lawyer who has worked on similar issues, said the tactic fell away because any agreements under pressure were later voided in courts. \n \n ""It\'s a reaction of despair,"" Niel said. ""They have no room to maneuver in the closing of the factory."" \n \n The Amiens plant has an especially contentious past. Goodyear\'s attempts to close it have been stalled by violent protests with huge tire bonfires, government concerns and France\'s prolonged layoff procedures. \n \n Boss-nappings typically have lasted from a few hours to a couple of days. They are punishable under French law by five years in prison and a 75,000-euro ($102,000) fine — as long as the boss goes free in under a week. \n \n But generally the workers are not prosecuted, and in many cases they have tried to make the manager\'s time in captivity more comfortable. \n \n Mickael Wamen, a union leader, told the Courrier Picard newspaper that the managers had refused offers of mattresses and blankets overnight. \n \n ""Things were sometimes animated, sometimes calm, but without any meanness,"" Michel Dheilly, the captive plant manager, told reporters allowed inside the factory. \n \n The other captive manager, Bernard Glesser, was less sanguine, saying he would not give any statements under duress. \n \n Niel said police rarely get involved, hoping to avoid inflaming the situation. \n \n ""These are basically honest people, in despair,"" he said.']",5,"– The US has misspent “tens of billions of dollars” on contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan—at minimum—according to a new report from a bipartisan commission set up to scrutinize the issue.

95,"[""BENSALEM, Pa. (CBS) — Several multi-vehicles crashes, involving as many as 100 cars and dozens of tractor-trailers stretched over several miles of icy highway, shut down the Pennsylvania Turnpike for most of the day today between Willow Grove and Bensalem, Pa. \n \n One crash area involved approximately 75 cars and several tractor-trailers in the eastbound lanes of the highway. The westbound lanes were closed to allow access by emergency vehicles. \n \n According to the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission, 30 people were injured and transported to local hospitals. Doylestown Hospital confirmed it was treating one victim who was in stable condition, while Abington was reportedly treating 16 people. St. Mary’s Medical Center, in Langhorne, was treating seven and Temple University Hospital was treating one. CBS 3 is told five of the injuries are classified as serious, but none are considered life-threatening. \n \n Dr. John Kelly, chief of staff at Abington, says the good news is none of the injuries are serious. \n \n “The word that we have is that we may have seen the most severely injured at this point in time, which we’re pleased to say did not include any life-threatening injuries that we are aware of.” \n \n Kelly explained what kind of injuries they were seeing, “In a blunt trauma situation, you’re going to have a lot of soft tissue and bone type injuries. I’m unaware of any fractures to date. We did have one patient who had a closed- head injury but appears to be recovering well from that.” \n \n The incident began about 8:30am in the eastbound lanes between Willow Grove and the Route 1 exits in Bensalem, Pa. \n \n Another crash happened closer to the Route 1 exit. That accident area involved approximately 30 cars and included a jackknifed tractor-trailer. \n \n Chopper 3 was over the scene where it appeared at least four cars were stuck under the jackknifed tractor-trailer. \n \n “We believe that it looks like at this point that the initial incident involved several tractor-trailer trucks. There have been reports of three to four. State police are working through sorting all that out right now,” Carl DeFebo of the Pa. Turnpike Commission said. \n \n \n \n “Scared to death, just thinking that it wasn’t going to stop,” remembered Kate Garwood. “You kinda think you’re going to continue to get hit.” \n \n “I was able to get off to the shoulder,” said Terry Foley, who drives the route to work every day. “I didn’t hit the car in front of me. I said, ‘I survived,’ and then somebody comes flying in the back of me.” \n \n CBS 3 traffic reporter Bob Kelly called this “the worst accident I have seen in the 20 years I have been doing this.” \n \n The Pa. Turnpike Commission reported around 3:30 p.m. that the tractor-trailer blocking all eastbound lanes was moved to allow trapped backlog to get past the scene in the left lane to continue eastbound on I-276. Disabled commercial vehicles remained, but all passenger vehicles in the backlog had been removed. \n \n Other crews were removing small portions of the concrete median, to allow drivers trapped on the eastbound turnpike to U-turn onto the westbound lanes (which were also shut down to all but emergency vehicles) and get off the turnpike. \n \n The turnpike was reopened to traffic just before 4pm — about 7½ hours after the first crash occurred. \n \n Investigators indicate icy conditions and sun glare are being blamed as likely culprits in causing the pileup. \n \n One driver said that road spray on windshields plus the sun low in the sky may have hindered visibility as drivers found themselves suddenly upon a stopped vehicle ahead with insufficient room to stop on the slick pavement. \n \n Terry Foley seemed to agree. \n \n “It’s all ice,” Foley said. \n \n A total of 75 cars and trucks, including six tractor trailers, were taken to Rob Liepziger’s tow yard in Bristol, Bucks County alone. Many of them have front-end damage, back-end damage and a lot of the vehicles have been totaled. \n \n Rob’s been in the towing business for more than 30 years. \n \n “I haven’t seen anything like this in forever that I’ve been out here,” Liepziger said. \n \n Top Content On CBSPhilly PHOTOS: Summer's Hottest Concerts \n \n VIDEO: Latest News & Weather \n \n AUDIO: Podcasts & Shows \n \n NEWS: Top Headlines \n \n PHOTOS: View The Best Galleries"", 'Get breaking news alerts on your mobile device direct from the FOX 29 news desk. \n \n Get breaking news alerts on your mobile device direct from the FOX 29 news desk. \n \n Get breaking news alerts on your mobile device direct from the FOX 29 news desk. \n \n Get breaking news alerts on your mobile device direct from the FOX 29 news desk. \n \n Text 46373 To \'NEWS\' To Get Breaking News Alerts From FOX 29 \n \n It was an all-day mess on the Pennsylvania Turnpike with the road shut down for miles after two major pileups and several other wrecks in between. \n \n The crashes left dozens of drivers stranded in the cold. Up to 50 cars were involved in those pileups. \n \n Here\'s what we know: \n \n The crashes on Interstate 276 were first reported just after 8 a.m. right in the middle of the morning rush, closing the turnpike between Willow Grove and the Philadelphia Interchanges in Bensalem; \n \n A total of 27 people were taken to hospitals, at least four of them with serious injuries; \n \n Drivers say the roadway was icy and incredibly slick. \n \n From the air, the long scene looked like an auto junkyard with dozens and dozens of cars and trucks scattered every which way. \n \n Drivers caught in the middle of the wreckage told us traffic had been moving smoothly at 50 to 55 mph until suddenly, ""All we saw was brake lights.

The first accident came at about 7:45am on the westbound side, causing a rubbernecking delay on the eastbound side—where the subsequent crashes occurred beginning at 8am, Fox 29 Philadelphia reports. Icy conditions are believed to be responsible—though residents say that stretch of road is so notoriously treacherous that accidents sometimes occur there in good weather. One crash site involves roughly 75 cars and several tractor trailers, CBS 3 Philadelphia reports. Another 30 cars were involved in another big wreck, in which a tractor trailer jackknifed, reportedly landing on top of at least four cars.

96,"['Confectionery giant Nestle has failed to convince European judges that it has the right to trademark the shape of its four-finger KitKat bar in the UK. \n \n The European Court of Justice said that the company had to demonstrate the public relied on the shape alone to identify the snack. \n \n The judges concluded this was difficult to prove if goods also showed a brand name such as KitKat. \n \n Rival Cadbury has battled to prevent Nestle obtaining the trademark. \n \n Both Nestle and Cadbury said they were ""pleased"" with the ruling. \n \n The case will now return to the UK High Court for a final decision. \n \n Nestle claimed that in the 80 years since the chocolate bar was introduced, the four fingers have become almost completely associated with KitKats. \n \n In June, a senior European court lawyer, the advocate-general, disagreed saying such a trademark did not comply with European law. \n \n Nestle has not sought to trademark the two-fingered bar. \n \n Sally Britton, intellectual property lawyer at Mishcon de Reya, said that Nestle was likely to continue arguing its case, ""even if, as now appears likely, the English court decides that the KitKat shape should not be registered as a trade mark"". \n \n She said Nestle had experience of trying to register difficult marks. \n \n It took more than 40 years for it to register the slogan ""Have a Break"" as a trade mark, finally succeeding in 2006, she added. \n \n Image caption Norway\'s ""Kvikk Lunsj"" looks similar to the KitKat and is available in some parts of the UK \n \n Chocolate wars \n \n Wednesday\'s ruling is the latest development in a more than 10-year legal battle between Nestle and Cadbury, which started when Cadbury tried to trademark the purple colour it uses on its Cadbury chocolate wrappers. \n \n Nestle objected and finally had the original decision allowing Cadbury to trademark the colour overturned in 2013. \n \n Now it would appear Cadbury, which is owned by US company Mondelez International, has scored a significant but not final victory in the continuing chocolate war. \n \n It has always argued the shape alone was not distinctive enough for consumers to associate it with the rival snack. \n \n A bar called the Kvikk Lunsj, meaning ""quick lunch"", launched in Norway in 1937 is available in some UK shops, and although less well known, looks similar to the four-finger KitKat. \n \n A ruling in favour of Nestle would stop other confectionery producers making chocolate bars of the same shape or size.', 'SHARE THIS ARTICLE Share Tweet Post Email \n \n Photographer: Jason Adlen/Bloomberg Photographer: Jason Adlen/Bloomberg \n \n Nestle SA may find it harder to convince U.K. judges that the shape of its KitKat chocolate bar is distinct enough to trademark after the European Union’s top tribunal set strict limits on what qualifies for the status. \n \n For a shape to deserve a trademark, owners must prove that consumers can recognize the product exclusively by that characteristic, and not in combination with another trademarked aspect, the EU Court of Justice said in a ruling Wednesday. The judgment gave both sides an opportunity to claim victory. \n \n The EU court decision will help guide a U.K. tribunal handling a clash between Cadbury, the U.K.’s biggest chocolate maker, and Nestle over the Swiss company’s 2010 application to trademark the four-fingered chocolate bar, which brought in 40 million pounds ($61.7 million) a year between 2008 and 2010 in the U.K. Cadbury separately is fighting an EU trademark Nestle got for the shape of its chocolate bar in 2006 in a case that’s been pending in a lower EU court since 2013. Any decision will determine whether or not the trademark is valid. \n \n The KitKat was first sold in Britain in 1935 by Rowntree & Co., with the shape changing very little since then. Nestle, the world’s biggest food company, bought Rowntree Plc in 1998. \n \n The U.K. Trade Marks Registry turned down the application to protect the shape of the chocolate bar in the U.K. in 2013 following the opposition from Cadbury. \n \n The EU court Wednesday said trademark protection can’t be given if a shape “contains three essential features, one of which results from the nature of the goods themselves and two of which are necessary to obtain a technical result.” \n \n Vevey, Switzerland-based Nestle said it was “pleased with the decision” and “now looks forward to the decision of the U.K. High Court.” Mondelez International Inc., which owns Cadbury, said in an e-mailed statement that the court’s ruling “is in line with our contention that the shape of the KitKat bar is not distinctive enough to be protected as a trademark.” \n \n Nestle won a U.K. Court of Appeal ruling in October 2013 blocking Cadbury from obtaining a trademark for the color purple it uses to package its milk chocolate. \n \n The case is: C-215/14, Societe de Produits Nestle SA v. Cadbury UK Ltd.', 'Federal prosecutors told a judge last week that they have started reassembling documents shredded by the Stanford Financial Group, whose owner, R. Allen Stanford, is charged with running a $7 billion Ponzi scheme. How do you reconstruct documents after they\'ve been passed through a shredder? \n \n With a computer. In a typical reconstruction process, technicians feed all the available shreds into a scanner. An automated software program then assigns a unique ID to each piece and analyzes a number of characteristics, including size, color, indentation, and font. Using a matching algorithm, the software then identifies potential neighboring shreds, displaying them onscreen for an operator to confirm. (For the home user, an Israeli company sells software that can turn any PC and scanner into an ""unshredder."") \n \n Advertisement \n \n \n \n Not all shredded documents can be put back together. The possibility and ease of reconstruction depends on the size of the shreds—the smaller and more numerous the pieces, the harder it is to reconstruct a document. Strip shredders cut paper into long strips 1/8- to 5/16-inch wide and are the most popular option because of their speed and low cost—but they\'re also the easiest to reassemble since they produce a relatively small number of large fragments. Cross-cut shredders, which slice paper into many tiny, confettilike pieces, are significantly more secure (and expensive), while shredders that pulverize paper into dust cost thousands of dollars but are essentially reconstruction-proof. (To secure top-secret information, the Department of Defense requires that the majority of shredded particles ""not exceed 5 square millimeters."") When using a strip-shredder, the slicing direction also has implications for reconstruction. Horizontal cuts may leave entire lines of text intact. Vertical shredding, which ensures that sentences are broken up, is more secure. \n \n Before advances in scanning and computer technology, documents had to be reconstructed by hand. Assuming all the pieces are in one place, reassembling a shredded document is a bit like solving a jigsaw puzzle; the reconstructionist must painstakingly sift through the shreds, looking for matches. During the 1979 Iranian Revolution, students and militants who took over the U.S. Embassy in Tehran turned to local carpet weavers to reassemble classified CIA documents they found that had been shredded. These pages were later published in a set of about 60 volumes called Documents From the U.S. Espionage Den. And in 2002, former FBI agent William Daly took about an hour to reassemble a shredded page from the dictionary on Good Morning America. \n \n Got a question about today\'s news? Ask the Explainer.']",3,"– It started with a candy wrapper and ended (for now) in a courtroom. Nestle's attempts to trademark the shape of its ""four-fingered"" KitKat have been rejected by the European Court of Justice, which ruled that shape alone isn't enough to recognize it as a KitKat, the BBC reports. The decision was a setback for Nestle—which manages the brand overseas; Hershey is licensed to sell the brand here in the US—and a victory for Cadbury, which was trying to block the trademark. The ruling means that, for now, other candy companies can make similar-looking chocolate bars. Nestle, which reaped more than $60 million a year from 2008 to 2010 in the UK from KitKat, argued that the four-fingered design has become inextricably associated with the KitKat brand over the past eight decades, Bloomberg notes. But Cadbury said the shape wasn't enough to make a consumer automatically think ""KitKat,"" and the court agreed. The BBC even notes that in Norway, a lesser-known chocolate bar called Kvikk Lunsj (""quick lunch"") has been around for nearly as long as KitKat. The fight between the two confectionary giants is the second major brouhaha they've had in recent years: In 2013, Nestle managed to block Cadbury's attempts to trademark its signature purple-colored chocolate wrappers, per Bloomberg. KitKat case now heads back to the UK High Court, which will render a final decision. (Claims of excess lead in Nestle noodles led to a major recall in India.)"

99,"['PAHOA, Hawaii (Reuters) - Residents on the Big Island of Hawaii were alerted on Thursday to rising levels of toxic gas from lava-oozing fissures, and geologists warned that new areas east of the erupting Kilauea volcano may be at risk of molten rock bursting from the ground. \n \n Hawaii County authorities sent a text message to residents of the southeast corner of the island warning them of a wind change that would bring rising levels of sulfur dioxide gas, which can be fatal if inhaled in large quantities. \n \n “It’s just horrible. You can’t breathe in there,” said evacuated resident Robynn Stagg, 58, who drove through the thick, orange sulfur dioxide haze earlier this week in a failed attempt to check on her home. \n \n Hawaii’s governor has warned that mass evacuations may be required as more fissures open in the ground and spew lava and gas into semi-rural residential areas on the east flank of Kilauea, one of the world’s most active volcanoes. \n \n During an evening meeting with community members, an official with the United States Geological Survey’s Hawaii Volcano Observatory said that while no new fissures have opened during the last 24 hours, there has been “quite a bit” of ground cracking over the last day and that they were releasing steam. \n \n “Because the lava intrusion is still active and earthquakes are still occurring, we still think there’s a decent chance of new eruptive activity at the surface,” Steven Brantley said. \n \n Authorities on Thursday completed the removal of highly flammable chemicals from a nearby geothermal power plant that was in the path of creeping lava. \n \n The latest upheaval at Kilauea began last week after the crater floor of a long-active side vent collapsed suddenly in a cloud of ash, triggering a similar plunge in the molten lake inside the larger crater at the volcano’s summit. \n \n What followed was a flurry of earthquakes as huge volumes of magma — the term for lava beneath the surface — drained back through deep-underground passages that carried the molten rock far downslope. The lava then forced its way back to the surface through large cracks, or fissures, that opened at ground level in a residential area miles (km) away. \n \n (GRAPHIC: Scorched earth - tmsnrt.rs/2IldVyS) \n \n ‘BALLISTIC BLOCKS’ \n \n Geologists said Kilauea may be entering a new phase of explosive eruptions not seen in nearly a century that could hurl “ballistic blocks” weighing up to 12 tons for half a mile (800 meters), and rain pebble-sized fragments for another mile or two (1.8 to 3.2 km). \n \n Deposits are seen on a road in Puna, Hawaii. Apau Hawaii Tours/via REUTERS \n \n However, the immediate vicinity around the summit, an area controlled by the National Park Service, was to be closed to visitors indefinitely, starting on Thursday night. \n \n Such blasts would likely also eject plumes of volcanic ash that could be carried farther downwind into neighboring communities, creating a nuisance and potential respiratory irritant, but not a life-threatening hazard, officials said. \n \n The Leilani Estates community remains in greatest danger, with 15 volcanic fissures so far having destroyed 36 structures, most of them homes, and forcing the evacuation of about 2,000 residents. \n \n But as the eruption progresses, “other areas of the lower East Rift Zone may also be at risk,” the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory said in a bulletin. \n \n “There is the potential for additional outbreaks,” Christina Neal, the chief scientist at the U.S. Geological Survey’s Hawaiian Volcano Observatory at Kilauea told a news briefing. “There are other communities, other residential neighborhoods that could, depending on the evolution of activity, be in harm’s way.” \n \n Hawaii Governor David Ige has requested federal disaster assistance as he said a mass evacuation of the lower Puna District, where Leilani Estates is located, would be beyond current county and state capabilities. \n \n Hawaii police said they arrested Alexandru Stingu-Dragomir, 29, on suspicion he burgled four houses in Leilani Estates after the mayor declared an emergency the area on last week. \n \n SURFING IN THE VOG \n \n Local meteorologists said the change in prevailing winds could send Kilauea’s volcanic smog, or vog, northwest to Maui and other islands in Hawaii. \n \n Surfers bobbing in the ocean off Kona on the west side of the Big Island complained of the smog that could be seen in a haze over the coast. \n \n “Does that hat protect against vog?” one surfer was heard quipping to another about the floppy sun hat he was wearing. \n \n In Pahoa, the nearest village to Kilauea, some schools remained closed after the area was hit by a 6.9 magnitude earthquake on Friday, the biggest since 1975. \n \n Lava advances towards a metal barrier in Puna, May 6, 2018.

In addition, acid rain damages vegetation and causes tools, barbed-wire fencing and items that can rust to do so a lot faster. \n \n Light winds may allow volcanic haze to become more widespread on the Big Island through Friday night, but weather forecasters said there did not appear to be enough southeast flow to carry the vog to other islands. By late Friday night or Saturday morning, tradewinds should be back, helping to push the vog out to sea. \n \n The primary pollutants in vog, or volcanic smog, are sulfur dioxide gas and fine particulate matter. \n \n The American Lung Association warned the public that sulfur dioxide can have harmful effects on the lungs and cause respiratory problems. Sulfur dioxide irritates the nose, throat and airways to cause coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath or a tight feeling around the chest — and can trigger asthma attacks. \n \n The effects of sulfur dioxide can be felt very quickly, according to the association, and are especially harmful to children, older adults and people with respiratory conditions. \n \n A two-person team from the Hawaii and Arizona National Guards monitored air quality near fissures in Leilani Estates Wednesday and found no dangerous levels of sulfur dioxide. \n \n Sgt. Milo Kalama of the Hawaii National Guard’s 93rd Weapons of Mass Destruction-Civil Support Team approached a steaming fissure on Leilani Avenue wearing a black, full-face mask.

We’re making sure we’re stocked so we’re ready to go.” \n \n Hilo Medical Center, however, has not seen an increase in respiratory patients, she said. \n \n The state Health Department has placed sulfur dioxide and particulate monitoring equipment around the eruption site.

100,"['Opening a door to hedge his political bets, Sen. Rand Paul has asked the leader of the Kentucky Senate for legislation to ensure that Mr. Paul can run both for the White House and for re-election to the U.S. Senate in 2016, The Washington Times has learned. \n \n “Yes, I am working on clarifying an ambiguous state law that Rand Paul believes is unconstitutional if it is interpreted to bar running for re-election to the Senate and for president at the same time,” Kentucky Senate Majority Leader Damon Thayer told The Times on Monday. \n \n “The purpose of the bill will be to make clear that Rand Paul or anyone in a similar situation in Kentucky can run for both offices in the same year,” Mr. Thayer explained. \n \n If things go Mr. Paul’s way, he could win the GOP presidential nomination, then run in the fall 2016 general election for the presidency and to retain his U.S. Senate seat. If he wins the presidency and the Senate re-election bid, he would relinquish his Senate seat. \n \n If he loses the presidential election but wins the Senate re-election race, he would become a second-term U.S. senator from Kentucky. \n \n Since winning his election in 2010, Mr. Paul has argued for creating term limits so members of Congress could serve a maximum of 12 years in each chamber. \n \n Mr. Paul and his office did not immediately respond to requests for comment Monday. But in a recent C-SPAN “Newsmakers” program, Mr. Paul said he and his team were looking at the possibility of running for the Senate and the White House simultaneously. \n \n “We just haven’t come to a conclusion yet,” he said at the time. \n \n The situation has grown more complicated for Mr. Paul since his election in 2010. His fellow Kentucky Republican, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, faces a serious challenge from the political right in his own party. \n \n If Mr. McConnell falls to the tea party candidate in the May primary or if a Democrat defeats Mr. McConnell in November, then Mr. Paul would become the senior U.S. senator from Kentucky. As such, he probably would become the recognized leader of his party in the state. \n \n Fellow Republicans are counting on Mr. Paul to help them keep the state Senate from tipping to Democrats. The Kentucky state House already is controlled by Democrats. \n \n Democrats have problems of their own in the state, including a sex scandal and accusations of a cover-up. Republicans think they have a shot at taking the House this fall, giving them two of the three power centers in state government. Gov. Steven L. Beshear is a Democrat. \n \n A veteran Republican Party operative in Kentucky said privately that House Speaker Greg Stumbo, a Democrat, has told colleagues there is no way he would allow such a bill to go through his chamber. \n \n “I’ve not spoken to the speaker about this and not heard publicly or privately what the Democrats in the House would do if Republicans passed it in the Senate,” Mr. Thayer said. \n \n Mr. Stumbo did not return a phone call from The Times on Monday. \n \n Story Continues →', 'Credit U.S. Senate \n \n A state Republican lawmaker is considering filing a bill that will permit U.S. Senator Rand Paul to run for re-election in Congress as well as President of the United States. \n \n Senate GOP Floor Leader Damon Thayer is mulling legislation that would clarify a state law that prohibits candidates from holding or running for two offices simultaneously. \n \n Thayer says that Paul discussed the issue with members of the Senate Republican caucus earlier this month, when Paul testified in Frankfort in support of a bill restoring felons’ voting rights. \n \n “He did … bring it up to the entire caucus,” Thayer said. “[He] explained much like I just did the situation in that he is running for the U.S. Senate in 2016, but that he is strongly considering seeking the Republican nomination for President. I hope he does.” \n \n Thayer denied that the caucus’ consideration of the idea was in exchange for Senate GOP support of House Bill 70, which would automatically restore voting rights for some felons -- an issue that has become a cornerstone as of late in Paul’s remodeling of the GOP brand in an effort to broaden the party’s base. \n \n Thayer says he will decide whether to file the bill by this Wednesday, when the filing window for introducing bills in the 2014 General Assembly expires. \n \n Paul, who is rumored to be a GOP frontrunner in the 2016 presidential race, has not officially announced his intention to seek higher office.', 'Rand Paul\'s flirtation with running for president is getting serious: he\'s asking Kentucky\'s senate to file a bill that would allow him to run for both the U.S. Senate and president in 2016. \n \n Kentucky\'s current law says a candidate\'s name cannot appear on a ballot more than once, which would seemingly force him to choose which office he wants to pursue rather than hedging his bets by running for both. \n \n State Senate Majority Leader Damon Thayer told the Washington Times: ""Yes, I am working on clarifying an ambiguous state law that Rand Paul believes is unconstitutional if it is interpreted to bar running for re-election to the Senate and for president at the same time."" \n \n According to WFPL, Paul brought the issue up to the state Senate\'s Republican caucus last month. \n \n ""He is running for the U.S. Senate in 2016, but that he is strongly considering seeking the Republican nomination for President,"" Thayer told WFPL. ""I hope he does."" \n \n Perhaps not so excited at the prospect are Kentucky\'s House of Representatives, which is (a very slight) majority Democrat. A ""veteran Republican Party operative"" told the Washington Times that he won\'t let the bill pass. \n \n Should the bill pass, it would be unusual for Paul to run for both Senate and president at the same time. It would also show that he doesn\'t have much faith in winning the presidency. That said, several people have run for vice president and Congress at the same time, including Joe Biden and Paul Ryan. \n \n Rand Paul is not reportedly considering a run for the House of Representatives, although if he\'s going to run for president and Senate at the same time, he might as well go for the hat-trick.', 'Our goal when we created Tesla a decade ago was the same as it is today: to accelerate the advent of sustainable transport by bringing compelling mass market electric cars to market as soon as possible. If we could have done that with our first product, we would have, but that was simply impossible to achieve for a startup company that had never built a car and that had one technology iteration and no economies of scale. Our first product was going to be expensive no matter what it looked like, so we decided to build a sports car, as that seemed like it had the best chance of being competitive with its gasoline alternatives. \n \n I suspected that this could be misinterpreted as Tesla believing that there was a shortage of sports cars for rich people, so I described the three step “master plan” for getting to compelling and affordable electric vehicles in my first blog piece about our company. This was unfortunately almost entirely ignored. \n \n In order to get to that end goal, big leaps in technology are required, which naturally invites a high level of scrutiny. That is fair, as new technology should be held to a higher standard than what has come before. However, there should also be some reasonable limit to how high such a standard should be, and we believe that this has been vastly exceeded in recent media coverage. \n \n How Does the Tesla Model S Fire Risk Compare to Gasoline Cars? \n \n Since the Model S went into production last year, there have been more than a quarter million gasoline car fires in the United States alone, resulting in over 400 deaths and approximately 1,200 serious injuries (extrapolating 2012 NFPA data). However, the three Model S fires, which only occurred after very high-speed collisions and caused no serious injuries or deaths, received more national headlines than all 250,000+ gasoline fires combined. The media coverage of Model S fires vs. gasoline car fires is disproportionate by several orders of magnitude, despite the latter actually being far more deadly. \n \n Reading the headlines, it is therefore easy to assume that the Tesla Model S and perhaps electric cars in general have a greater propensity to catch fire than gasoline cars when nothing could be further from the truth. \n \n Journalists with a deep knowledge of the car industry, such as the news editor of Automotive News, understand and attempt to rebut this notion, but they have been drowned out by an onslaught of popular and financial media seeking to make a sensation out of something that a simple Google search would reveal to be false. I would also like to express appreciation for the investigative journalists who took the time to research and write an accurate article. \n \n The degree to which this is outrageous is described well in the above-mentioned Automotive News article. There are now substantially more than the 19,000 Model S vehicles on the road that were reported in our Q3 shareholder letter for an average of one fire per at least 6,333 cars, compared to the rate for gasoline vehicles of one fire per 1,350 cars. By this metric, you are more than four and a half times more likely to experience a fire in a gasoline car than a Model S! Considering the odds in the absolute, you are more likely to be struck by lightning in your lifetime than experience even a non-injurious fire in a Tesla. \n \n Those metrics tell only part of the story. The far more deadly nature of a gasoline car fire deserves to be re-emphasized. Since the Model S went into production mid last year, there have been over 400 deaths and 1,200 serious injuries in the United States alone due to gasoline car fires, compared to zero deaths and zero injuries due to Tesla fires anywhere in the world. \n \n There is a real, physical reason for this: a gasoline tank has 10 times more combustion energy than our battery pack. Moreover, the Model S battery pack also has internal firewalls between the 16 modules and a firewall between the battery pack and passenger compartment. This effectively limits the fire energy to a few percent that of a gasoline car and is the reason why Dr. Shibayama was able to retrieve his pens and papers from the glove compartment completely untouched after the recent fire (caused by a high speed impact with a tow hitch). It is also why arsonists tend to favor gasoline. Trying to set the side of a building on fire with a battery pack is far less effective. \n \n What About Safety Overall? \n \n Our primary concern is not for the safety of the vehicle, which can easily be replaced, but for the safety of our customers and the families they entrust to our cars. Based on the Model S track record so far, you have a zero percent chance of being hurt in an accident resulting in a battery fire, but what about other types of accidents? Despite multiple high-speed accidents, there have been no deaths or serious injuries in a Model S of any kind ever. Of course, at some point, the law of large numbers dictates that this, too, will change, but the record is long enough already for us to be extremely proud of this achievement. This is why the Model S achieved the lowest probability of injury of any car ever tested by the US government. The probability of injury is the most accurate statistical figure of merit, showing clearly that the Model S is safer in an accident than any other vehicle without exception. It is literally impossible for another car to have a better safety track record, as it would have to possess mystical powers of healing. \n \n Further Actions \n \n While we believe the evidence is clear that there is no safer car on the road than the Model S, we are taking three specific actions. \n \n First, we have rolled out an over-the-air update to the air suspension that will result in greater ground clearance at highway speeds. To be clear, this is about reducing the chances of underbody impact damage, not improving safety. The theoretical probability of a fire injury is already vanishingly small and the actual number to date is zero. Another software update expected in January will give the driver direct control of the air suspension ride height transitions. \n \n Second, we have requested that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration conduct a full investigation as soon as possible into the fire incidents. While we think it is highly unlikely, if something is discovered that would result in a material improvement in occupant fire safety, we will immediately apply that change to new cars and offer it as a free retrofit to all existing cars. Given that the incidence of fires in the Model S is far lower than combustion cars and that there have been no resulting injuries, this did not at first seem like a good use of NHTSA’s time compared to the hundreds of gasoline fire deaths per year that warrant their attention. However, there is a larger issue at stake: if a false perception about the safety of electric cars is allowed to linger, it will delay the advent of sustainable transport and increase the risk of global climate change, with potentially disastrous consequences worldwide. That cannot be allowed to happen. \n \n Third, to reinforce how strongly we feel about the low risk of fire in our cars, we will be amending our warranty policy to cover damage due to a fire, even if due to driver error. Unless a Model S owner actively tries to destroy the car, they are covered. Our goal here is to eliminate any concern about the cost of such an event and ensure that over time the Model S has the lowest insurance cost of any car at our price point. Either our belief in the safety of our car is correct and this is a minor cost or we are wrong, in which case the right thing is for Tesla to bear the cost rather than the car buyer. \n \n All of these actions are taken in order to make clear the confidence we have in our product and to eliminate any misperceptions regarding the integrity of our technology and the safety of our cars.']",4,"– Oh, the difficulties faced by Rand Paul: He's considering running for president in 2016 but would like to run for re-election to the US Senate at the same time, just in case, and he's not sure Kentucky law currently allows him to do so.

101,"['It’s any barbecue-lover’s worst nightmare: You go to bed after enjoying a juicy burger or a smoky rack of ribs, only to awaken, covered in sweat and hives. You’ve become allergic to meat. An increasing number of meat lovers in the United States and around the world have had this horrific experience in recent years, and it’s all because of a tiny parasite. \n \n The culprit, the Lone Star Tick, spreads this potentially life-threatening allergy through its bites. Researchers don’t know exactly how the tick spreads the allergy, but they have identified which component of meat causes the allergic reaction. Mammal meat — pork and beef — contains a sugar called galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose (alpha-gal for short), and in people with the allergy, alpha-gal triggers an immune response that includes a massive release of histamines, much like your body would respond to other allergies. \n \n Wired reported that in 2004, University of Virginia immunologist Thomas Platts-Mills, Ph.D., identified the alpha-gal connection after examining blood work from people that experienced strange reactions not to meat but to a cancer drug called cetuximab. People in the southeastern U.S., they found, were 10 times more likely to be allergic to this effective cancer drug. Further investigation showed that the region was also home to people with meat allergies. Since cetuximab and mammal meat both contain alpha-gal, and the affected people’s blood contained alpha-gal antibodies, the researchers hypothesized that the sugar was behind the allergy. \n \n Most scientists agree that allergies occur when a foreign allergen — like alpha-gal — is mistakenly marked as an invader by the antibodies of the body’s immune system, which then releases chemical weapons to destroy it. One of those weapons is histamine, which triggers the inflammation necessary to deal with the allergen — but also causes the rest of your body to swell up, as well. \n \n Since cases of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, which is spread by the Lone Star Tick, also arise in the same southeastern region, researchers are pretty sure that it’s the tick bites that are causing the allergies to meat and cetuximab. While the details of the allergy-spreading mechanism have yet to be understood, they’re likely involved in priming the body’s immune system to react badly to alpha-gal invasions. \n \n As far as scientists know, this condition is lifelong. Unfortunately, the reaction is life-threatening, too, as anaphylaxis can cause a person’s airway to swell shut. \n \n These cases have previously occurred mostly in the southern, southeastern, and central U.S., reports of new meat allergies have surfaced in the northeast, including Pennsylvania and New York. It’s unclear whether this means that the tick’s range is spreading or whether the ability to confer this allergy has spread to other tick species. \n \n Original Could Kratom Solve the Opioid Crisis? \n \n If you want to avoid developing this allergy, take basic precautions when going out in the woods or high grass. Check yourself thoroughly when you get home, especially in your body’s folds and near waistbands or elastic parts of clothes. And if you experience sweating, itching, or difficulty breathing a few hours after you eat meat, seek immediate medical attention.', 'First comes the unscratchable itching, and the angry blossoming of hives. Then stomach cramping, and—for the unluckiest few—difficulty breathing, passing out, and even death. In the last decade and a half, thousands of previously protein-loving Americans have developed a dangerous allergy to meat. And they all have one thing in common: the lone star tick. \n \n Red meat, you might be surprised to know, isn’t totally sugar-free. It contains a few protein-linked saccharides, including one called galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose, or alpha-gal, for short. More and more people are learning this the hard way, when they suddenly develop a life-threatening allergy to that pesky sugar molecule after a tick bite. \n \n Yep, one bite from the lone star tick—which gets its name from the Texas-shaped splash of white on its back—is enough to reprogram your immune system to forever reject even the smallest nibble of perfectly crisped bacon. For years, physicians and researchers only reported the allergy in places the lone star tick calls home, namely the southeastern United States. But recently it’s started to spread. The newest hot spots? Duluth, Minnesota, Hanover, New Hampshire, and the eastern tip of Long Island, where at least 100 cases have been reported in the last year. Scientists are racing to trace its spread, to understand if the lone star tick is expanding into new territories, or if other species of ticks are now causing the allergy. \n \n The University of Virginia is deep in the heart of lone star tick country. It’s also home to a world-class allergy research division, headed up by immunologist Thomas Platts-Mills. He’d been hearing tales of the meat allergy since the ’90s—people waking up in the middle of the night after a big meal, sweating and breaking out in hives. But he didn’t give it much thought until 2004, when he heard about another group of patients all suffering from the same symptoms. \n \n This time, it wasn’t a plate of pork chops they shared; it was a new cancer drug called cetuximab. The drug worked, but curiously, patients that lived in the southeast were 10 times as likely to report side effects of itching, swelling, and a dangerous drop in blood pressure. \n \n Platts-Mills teamed up with cetuximab’s distributor, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and began comparing patient blood samples. He discovered that all the patients who experienced an allergic reaction had pre-existing antibodies to alpha-gal, and cetuximab was full of the stuff, thanks to the genetically modified mice from which it was derived. With that mystery solved, Platts-Mills turned to figuring out what made patients so sensitive to alpha-gal. \n \n The best hint he had was the geographic overlap between the cetuximab patients and previously reported meat allergies. The area perfectly matched where people came down with Rocky Mountain spotted fever—a disease carried by the lone star tick. But it wasn’t until Platts-Mills and two of his lab members came down with tick-induced meat allergies of their own that they made the connection. \n \n Over the next few years Platts-Mills and his colleague Scott Commins screened more meat allergy patients and discovered that 80 percent reported being bitten by a tick. What’s more, they showed that tick bites led to a 20-fold increase in alpha-gal antibodies. Since ethics standards prevented them from attaching ticks to randomized groups of patients, this data was the best they could do to guess how meat allergy arises. Something in the tick’s saliva hijacks humans’ immune systems, red-flagging alpha-gal, and triggering the massive release of histamines whenever red meat is consumed. \n \n Researchers are still trying to find what that something is. Commins has since moved to the University of North Carolina, where he’s injecting mice with lone star tick extracts to try to understand which molecules are setting off the alpha-gal bomb. It’s tricky: Tick saliva is packed with tons of bioactive compounds to help the parasite feed without detection. One of them might be an alpha-gal analogue—something similar-but-different-enough in shape that it sets off the human immune system. But it could also be a microbe—like a bacteria or virus—that triggers the response. Some have even suggested that residual proteins from the ticks’ earlier blood meals could be the culprit. \n \n Whatever it is, allergy researchers will be paying attention. Because, as far as anyone can tell, alpha-gal syndrome seems to be the only allergy that affects all people, regardless of genetic makeup. “There’s something really special about this tick,” says Jeff Wilson, an asthma, allergy, and immunology fellow in Platts-Mills’ group. Usually a mix of genes and environmental factors combine to create allergies. But when it comes to the lone star tick it doesn’t matter if you’re predisposed or not. “Just a few bites and you can render anyone really, really allergic,” he says. \n \n In the meantime, Platts-Mills, Commins, and Wilson are busy communicating the scale of the public health problem. Every day they check local news headlines to log new cases of catastrophic hamburger aversion, and spend hours on the phone gathering the latest intel from allergy clinics and academic centers around the country. They’re building the first real red meat allergy incidence map of the US—because state health departments aren’t required to report alpha-gal syndrome to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And it’s still rare enough outside the southeastern US that many doctors don’t correctly diagnose it. \n \n Wilson is trying to get blood samples from all the new outbreaks, to figure out if the patients’ antibodies correspond to the saliva of lone star ticks or a different tick species. That will tell him if the increases in the allergy are the result of changing range patterns, or if other ticks have developed the capacity to rewire human immune systems in the same way. That information would also provide further clues to the mechanism itself. As for a cure? There’s not much science has to offer on that front, besides Epipens and veggie burgers.', 'Please enable Javascript to watch this video \n \n CLEVELAND, Ohio -- This flu season shows no signs of slowing down as this week alone the Cuyahoga County Board of Health announces six additional adult flu-related deaths. \n \n The Cleveland Clinic states around 930 people have been hospitalized so far this season for the flu including totals from Akron General Hospital.

Experts say the lone star tick appears to be spreading from its home base in the southeastern US. Whereas other ticks can spread ailments such as Lyme disease, the lone star tick is bothersome because it is believed to trigger a potentially life-threatening and apparently lifelong meat allergy with its bite. The tick doesn't technically make people allergic to meat, but rather to a sugar molecule found in red meat known as alpha-gal. This alpha-gal allergy has typically been limited to the southeastern US, where the lone star tick is prevalent, but no more, reports Wired. Cases—in which the consumption of meat can result in hives, difficulty breathing, or death—have been reported in Minnesota, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and New York, per Inverse. Long Island has seen at least 100 cases in the last year. Researchers suspect the spread of the allergy coincides with the spread of lone star ticks, though it's also possible that other ticks are responsible. Either way, ""the nuisance level [for lone star ticks] is much higher than the black-legged tick,"" an expert tells the Weston Forum. ""It is aggressive and very abundant."" Researchers are currently studying the effect of a lone star tick bite on mice to determine why it triggers the allergy. (A toddler died after a tick bite.)"

When he reached the podium in the middle of Sullivan's courtroom, he removed his hat, as a gentleman would, and held it behind his back in both hands. \n \n As he swung his hat behind his back, a small square of folded paper fell from it and landed on the floor behind him. \n \n A local law enforcement officer was in the gallery, behind the threesome at the podium, and watched the whole thing. \n \n Recommended Stories For You \n \n At first, the officer thought the bindle had been dropped by one of the other two men at the podium. \n \n However, another officer in the courtroom suggested that since the courtroom is packed with video surveillance gear, they should invoke the courtroom equivalent of the NFL's video review rule and take a look at the replay. \n \n Sure enough, right there in slow motion was video evidence that Bibriesca, who we'll remind you was already in court on a felony drug charge, appeared to have cocaine in his hat, the hat from which that cocaine appeared to fall and land on the floor of a courtroom, mere yards from the front door of the Eagle County jail, to which he was whisked almost immediately. \n \n Bibriesca appeared Wednesday afternoon, Nov. 8, before District Court Judge Paul Dunkelman, where he learned that he now faces two more charges: narcotics possession and bond violation, both felonies. \n \n Bibriesca was born in Mexico and is reportedly in the country illegally, which means Immigration and Customs Enforcement will also want a word with him. \n \n Staff Writer Randy Wyrick can be reached at 970-748-2935 or rwyrick@vaildaily.com."", ""EAGLE, Colo.

Police were investigating if at least one recent death was caused by a heroin overdose. \n \n ""We suspect what is happening is the same thing that happened in 2006 when people were getting heroin that was cut with fentanyl, which is a very strong narcotic,"" said Diane Hincks, a registered nurse and emergency room director at Mount Sinai on the West Side. ""That\'s what we think is happening."" \n \n By early Friday afternoon, emergency crews had responded to 74 cases over 72 hours, more than double the same three-day period last year, said Larry Langford, spokesman for the Chicago Fire Department. \n \n Hincks said some of the 14 overdose victims treated at Mount Sinai had collapsed as soon as they injected themselves. The hospital typically sees two or three overdoses a day, she said. \n \n Two of Mount Sinai\'s patients were in intensive care, another was still undergoing treatment, seven had been discharged and a few more were still in the emergency room as of about 3 p.m, Hincks said. \n \n Chicago police said the drugs were purchased primarily at two locations on the West Side, one of them in the North Lawndale community. A sample of heroin recovered by police may have contained fentanyl, authorities said. \n \n The Drug Enforcement Administration is working with Chicago police to try to find the source of the dangerous batches of drugs. \n \n At City Council budget hearings Friday afternoon, Chief Mary Sheridan, head of the Fire Department\'s emergency medical services division, said all the recent overdose victims were stabilized with a single dose of Narcan, a heroin antidote carried by Chicago paramedics, and then transported safely to hospitals. But fire officials said the victims required additional doses of Narcan after arriving at hospitals. \n \n ""They\'re taking double and triple the doses of Narcan in order to bring them out of their stupor,"" Hincks told the Tribune. \n \n Paramedics and other Fire Department personnel were given extra Narcan for their medical runs, officials said. \n \n Chicago police, meanwhile, are looking into whether a 49-year-old man who died of an apparent drug overdose in the West Side\'s East Garfield Park neighborhood had ingested narcotics from one of the dangerous batches, according to law enforcement sources. \n \n Heroin overdoses are spiking in Chicago. Authorities think the illegal drug may be spiked with something. Oct. 2, 2015. (CBS Chicago) Heroin overdoses are spiking in Chicago. Authorities think the illegal drug may be spiked with something.

An autopsy on the victim Friday was inconclusive, pending toxicology studies that could take up to eight weeks to complete, according to a spokesman for the Cook County medical examiner\'s office. \n \n The Chicago Recovery Alliance, which helps drug users, trains the public in overdose prevention, provides HIV testing and conducts needle exchanges, urged caution. \n \n ""The best thing would be to have (Narcan),"" said Dan Bigg, the group\'s director. ""And watch each other\'s backs."" \n \n Fentanyl-laced heroin has been causing overdoses across the nation. The DEA issued a nationwide health alert in March. \n \n Dr. Steven Aks, chief toxicologist at Stroger Hospital and an emergency physician, said fentanyl is used for especially painful surgical procedures. \n \n The powerful synthetic painkiller adds a potent kick to heroin, making it attractive to suppliers seeking an edge with customers. \n \n The last major outbreak of fentanyl-related deaths took place between 2005 and 2007, killing more than 1,000 people across the country. Dozens in the Chicago area died of overdoses, including from fentanyl mixed with other drugs. \n \n Hincks recalled how busy Mount Sinai\'s emergency room was for a few weeks in 2006, when she was a charge nurse, because of the fentanyl-laced heroin. \n \n ""I remember how crazy it was,"" she said. ""It got to the point it was just full. We had everyone lined up in the halls on carts. ... It was very busy."" \n \n Cristina Villarreal, a spokeswoman for the Chicago Department of Public Health, said that by 8:30 a.m. Friday more than 20 people had been treated for heroin overdoses. Villarreal said the department was awaiting lab results to confirm if the heroin was laced with fentanyl. \n \n ""We are working closely to ensure that area hospitals are tracking individuals affected and are maintaining a necessary stock of medication supplies — including Narcan,"" Villarreal said in an email. \n \n John Callahan, coroner of Grundy County, said his office has seen three heroin-related deaths in the Morris and Coal City areas this year — but all of them came in August. \n \n He said he had been contacted by the DEA about two weeks ago. \n \n ""They\'re trying to trace back where this potent heroin came from,"" Callahan said. ""The way I understand it, there\'s a bad batch.\'\' \n \n Heroin overdose deaths have been on the rise statewide since 2011, according to data from the Illinois Department of Public Health. Last year, 633 heroin overdose deaths occurred in Illinois, up from 583 in 2013. In Cook County, heroin overdose deaths remained largely unchanged last year at 283, down eight from 2013. \n \n A recent Roosevelt University report concluded that the Chicago area is racking up more heroin-related emergency room visits than any other metro area in the country. Compounding the problem was that state-funded drug treatment had dried up, the report found. \n \n Illinois\' heroin crisis has drawn increasing attention from government officials in recent years, and lawmakers have proposed numerous measures aimed at attacking the problem. \n \n Chicago Tribune\'s John Byrne and The Washington Post contributed. \n \n jgorner@tribpub.com \n \n pnickeas@tribpub.com \n \n rsobol@tribpub.com']",3,"– Authorities say a man who was in a Colorado court for violating his bond on a drug charge is in even more trouble after a wad of cocaine fell from his hat while he was in front of the judge.

103,"['We have taken data available in Wikidata and DBpedia on \'Military Conflicts\' to create this interactive visualisation in nodegoat: \n \n Wikidata \n \n From the outside, it can be a challenge to keep up with all the developments within the ever expanding universe of wiki*/*pedia. So it\'s good to be reminded now and then of all the structured data that has become available thanks to their efforts: \n \n This looks pretty neat, especially since Wikidata currently has over 947 million triples in their data store. Since battles usually have a place and a date, it would be nice to import this data into a data design in nodegoat and visualise these battles through time and space (diachronic geospatiality ftw). \n \n So we checked the Wikidata sparql-endpoint to see what we can work with. Currently, there are 8049 instances of battles . If we select all the battles that have a location and a date, we are left with 410 battles. This query does not take into account that the location may be stored on a deeper level (as these battles may have a ‘place’ that has a location) and that the date may be stored as a ‘start time’ and ‘end time’. To take this into account, we use the following query: \n \n PREFIX wd: < http://www.wikidata.org/entity/> PREFIX wdt: < http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/> PREFIX rdfs: < http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> SELECT ?subject ?label ?coordinates (CONCAT(STR(DAY(?date)),""-"",STR(MONTH(?date)),""-"",STR(YEAR(?date))) as ?displaydate) (CONCAT(STR(DAY(?start)),""-"",STR(MONTH(?start)),""-"",STR(YEAR(?start))) as ?displaystart) (CONCAT(STR(DAY(?end)),""-"",STR(MONTH(?end)),""-"",STR(YEAR(?end))) as ?displayend) WHERE { ?subject wdt:P31 wd:Q178561 .

Eventually we gathered 2657 battles that have both a location and a date. After a bit of cleaning (you can do this in Open Refine, or even in LibreOffice Calc or Excel), we\'ve imported this set into nodegoat: \n \n You can use the timeline to scroll through time. We’ve added a colour scheme to differentiate between periods in time. Click here to view this in a new window. Clicking a dot opens a dialogue with a link to the object in Wikidata. \n \n DBPedia \n \n Last Friday, we noticed the buzz around the #dbpediadenhaag event and the discussions about the data DBPedia has harvested from Wikipedia. So we queried the DBpedia sparql-endpoint to see what battles they have in store. We found 12674 instances of MilitaryConflict. Of these, 4022 have date and location properties. \n \n SELECT DISTINCT ?battle (SAMPLE(?dates) as ?date) ?location WHERE { ?battle rdf:type dbo:MilitaryConflict . ?battle dbo:date ?dates . ?battle georss:point ?location . } \n \n If we look a level deeper for dates and locations we get 10116 battles that have a place and a date reference. The dates are messier than the dates available through Wikidata (as these have been harvested), so a bit more clean up is required here to get a workable list. Once we’ve imported this into nodegoat, we get this result. We can also combine both sets (with a total of 12703 records). And highlight the provenance of each dot. \n \n Most of the differences are a result of the messy dates in DBpedia. For example, compare dbp:date in this DBpedia record with the date in the infobox (which DPpedia harvests) of the original Wikipedia article. Other differences are due to the fact that we picked one location per battle and rounding of the latitude and longitude values. \n \n Furthermore, we found that very little statements in Wikidata had a proper reference and most of them referenced only to ‘French Wikipedia’/‘English Wikipedia’ etc (which was already noted by this report). See this article on the overlaps/differences between Wikidata and DBpedia. \n \n Connecting the Dots \n \n Once we had this up and running we checked what kind of objects relate to the events we found. There seems to be quite some data on the American Civil War in Wikidata, so we made a query to list the people who were present at the battles we identified earlier.

104,"['NASA is asking everyday terrestrials to come up with cosmic solutions to a very down-to-earth problem: how to deal with human waste when you’re trapped in a space suit for up to a week. \n \n The American space agency has launched a competition for participants to invent a hands-free system that routes and collects waste away from the astronaut’s body for up to six days. Inventors have the chance of winning $30,000, and have until Dec. 20 to submit their best “space poop” ideas. \n \n “I can tell you that space flight is not always glamorous,” said astronaut Rick Mastracchio, a veteran of Space Shuttle Soyuz, and Space Station missions speaking in a video promoting NASA’s call to action. “People need to go to the bathroom even in a spacecraft.” \n \n During spaceflight astronauts can be in their suits for more than 10 hours at a time. But with NASA planning on sending humans deeper into space, future missions will require the advancement of new technology to keep the astronauts alive and well. \n \n Currently, crews wear an absorbent diaper but these would not be suitable for flights longer than a day, according to a description on the contest’s website HeroX. While it goes without saying that nobody in their right mind would want to wear a diaper for a week, the issue is more than a matter of squeamishness, it’s a matter of life or death. \n \n Mastracchio said it is vital that the waste needs to be treated otherwise it could harm or even kill the astronaut. “Given enough time, infection, and even sepsis can set in. This is the problem we are asking you to help us with.” \n \n NASA said it aims to test the winning ideas in the next year and roll out successful systems in the next three.', 'NASA vowed to award up to three $30,000 prizes for the most promising in-suit waste management systems When you\'ve got to go, but you\'re out there in space, zipped up in a spacesuit, with no toilet in sight and a crew of other astronauts around, what do you do? \n \n NASA has launched a contest for inventors to solve this uncomfortable issue, and promises to award $30,000 to the best ""space poop"" solutions. \n \n Inventors have until December 20 to submit designs for a personalized waste-wicking system that will handle everything, hands-free, for a period of up to six days. \n \n ""The old standby solution consisted of diapers,"" said the description of contest details at www.herox.com/SpacePoop. \n \n ""However, the diaper is only a very temporary solution, and doesn\'t provide a healthy/protective option longer than one day."" \n \n Sometimes, astronauts have to wait even longer. The two men and one woman who packed themselves into a Russian Soyuz space capsule last week had to wait two full days between launching from Kazakhstan and arriving at the International Space Station. \n \n The Soyuz is equipped with a portable toilet, which looks like an air-powered pee jug. \n \n On future missions to deep space destinations like an asteroid or Mars, NASA suspects it could take up to 144 hours, or six days, to get to a proper toilet. \n \n In emergency situations, astronauts may need to zip themselves into a fully pressurized, bulky orange spacesuit, complete with helmet and gloves. \n \n ""While sealed, it is impossible for an astronaut to access their own body, even to scratch their nose,"" NASA said. \n \n That\'s where the inventors come in. Astronauts need some way to clear away urine, fecal matter and menstrual blood efficiently, or they risk infection. \n \n The problem is that in weightlessness, fluids can blob up and stick to surfaces, while solids float in the air. \n \n ""You don\'t want any of these solids and fluids stuck to your body for six days,"" NASA said, recalling how easy babies can get diaper rash. \n \n Currently, while at the International Space Station, astronauts use a toilet contraption that includes a vacuum and a tube to help evacuate fecal matter. \n \n To urinate, they use a funnel attached to a hose that can be adapted for a sitting or standing position, and uses air to move urine away. \n \n NASA vowed to award up to three $30,000 prizes for the most promising in-suit waste management systems. \n \n The goal is to test them within a year and fully implement them within three years. \n \n NASA says the first human missions to Mars could take place by the 2030s. \n \n Explore further: Soyuz capsule docks with International Space Station', ""Why would you ever need to know? Because of the Space Poop Challenge, that’s why. It’s a $30,000 incentive prize for a NASA-worthy system for spacesuits that routes human waste away from the body, hands-free. It could be the difference between life and death for astronauts in emergency situations that require extended (like days) periods of time spent contained to their spacesuit. Check out the challenge guidelines to learn more about the details of this challenge, and read on for some interesting factoids about dealing with bodily functions in space. \n \n Space is an extreme and unsafe environment even before you consider the issue of, um, using the bathroom. But that’s just it -- we have to consider that issue. So before you go running off to make space travel history by drumming up new solutions, let’s talk about the current situation in space. \n \n \n \n There are two space-age toilets on the ISS, located in the Tranquility and Zvezda modules. The second commode was put in just a few years ago, after the first unit was having some problems. Effectively managing human waste is critical for the health and safety of astronauts in space. \n \n \n \n Our terrestrial toilets use gravity to flush everything away, but doing your business in the weightlessness of outer space gets tricky. \n \n So, how exactly does one go number one, or number two, in space? \n \n The Amazing Zero-G John \n \n The toilets on the ISS are so different from yours, astronauts actually need some supplemental potty training to figure them out. And they're astronauts. \n \n Without getting into the nitty-gritty, let’s just say that relieving oneself in space these days is a lot better than it used to be. Today, going to the restroom in zero-g is a quick process, but it looks more complicated than using a car. Luckily, they get to practice on training toilets before blastoff (pun intended). \n \n There seem to be a lot of steps involved, so you probably don't want to be in a hurry. Liquid and solid waste are handled differently: there's a somewhat normal-looking toilet seat, along with what's known as a “urine hose.” \n \n The hole in the toilet seat is smaller than usual, so apparently, it can be a bit tough to get the alignment right at first. Women and men are equal here when it comes to number two, using the same setup, but urinating requires different … attachments. \n \n Space toilets use suction instead of gravity, for both urine and solid waste. You don't really sit in space, because you don't weight anything, so astronauts need to either strap themselves in or use handles to hold themselves down. \n \n You can actually check out a guided tour of the toilet cabin on the ISS, given by Italian astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti: \n \n Out of Sight, Out of Mind? \n \n On Earth, we get to flush our waste away and never see it again (unless something goes horribly wrong). But on the ISS, it's not that simple. \n \n Urine and solid waste are collected and dealt with separately. Urine and other waste water goes through a very advanced filtration and purification process, before it ends up being used again for - you guessed it - drinking water. In case you needed more proof, the space program really isn’t for the faint of heart. Think you could swing it? Before you answer, you should also know that the water they end up drinking is actually purer than the water most of us drink on a daily basis. I guess that's worth the view. \n \n Solid waste ends up getting packed up, compressed and sent off to burn up in the atmosphere like a shooting star. Make a wish! \n \n Astronauts try to take care of all their business on the space station, rather than in their spacesuits. But when nature calls on a spacewalk, they have to use the equivalent of an adult diaper for space travelers. \n \n Wearing a diaper is a reasonable solution for short term waste management for launch, reentry, and spacewalks, but future long distance missions might require astronauts to remain in a protective suit for up to 6 days. That’s a long time no matter how you slice it, and a diaper is simply not a safe or sustainable waste management tool. NASA is working on this challenge themselves, but as we prepare our species for interplanetary travel, they could use some help from the crowd with these kinds of details! \n \n The Space Poop Challenge \n \n As hard as it is for astronauts to use the toilet in the pressurized environments like ISS, it is an even bigger challenge when you have to wear a spacesuit (particularly if you have to wear it for more than a few hours), This is why the Space Poop Challenge is offering up to $30,000 for the best ideas to create a system that will collect waste and route it away from an astronaut's body, hands-free, while wearing a spacesuit. Check out the Space Poop Challenge page to learn more, get registered, and take your place in the annals of space travel history!"", 'NASA has initiated a ""Space Poop Challenge,"" and is calling on innovators to come up with new designs for a spacesuit waste management system. \n \n Sometimes the ""call of nature"" is really urgent – and if you\'re in a spacesuit, you can\'t easily rush to the bathroom. \n \n That\'s why NASA has created the ""Space Poop Challenge."" The agency is asking innovators to create fecal, urine and menstrual management systems for spacesuits, that would work for up to six days. Up to $30,000 in prize money is up for grabs. \n \n NASA astronauts wear diapers to take care of their bodily needs while they\'re launching, landing or spacewalking. However, these diapers are only good for a few hours; sitting in poop, urine or menstrual fluid for more than that is bad for your health, and your backside, besides. [How to Pee in Space (and What to Do If the Toilet Breaks)] \n \n ""Future missions may require long-duration waste management for use by a pressurized suited crew member,"" NASA wrote in a statement on HeroX, a website where people or organizations can host incentive-based competitions. \n \n ""In the event of cabin depressurization or other contingency, crew members may need to take refuge in their launch and entry suits for a long-duration: 144 hours,"" according to the statement. ""The crew member will have less than 60 minutes to get into and seal their spacesuit. To ensure the crew member\'s safety, the solution [proposed system] needs to take no more than five minutes [to set up and integrate with the spacesuit]."" \n \n Further complicating the challenge is the requirement that the system work in microgravity, in a pressurized spacesuit. This means would-be designers need to contend with floating water and debris that everybody really, really wants to keep far away from human orifices or vital spacesuit systems. \n \n The new system will be designed for NASA\'s Modified Advanced Crew Escape Suit, an improvement on the orange spacesuit used for shuttle launches and landings. That suit is expected to be used by astronauts on the Orion spacecraft. \n \n The submission deadline for the Space Poop Challenge is Dec. 20, and winners will be announced Jan. 31, 2017.

Original article on Space.com.', 'Challenge Overview \n \n The US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) seeks proposed solutions for urine, fecal and menstrual management systems to be used in the crew’s launch and entry suits over a continuous duration of up to 144 hours. An in-suit waste management system would be beneficial for contingency scenarios or for any long duration tasks. \n \n Waste management systems should address fecal, urine, and/or menstrual waste management in a pressurized survival suit environment for six days while protecting the safety and health of crew members. Solutions should provide for urine collection of up to 1L per day per crew member, for a total of 6 days. Fecal collection rates should be targeted for 75 grams of fecal mass and 75 mL fecal volume per crewmember per day for a total of 6 days duration. Menstrual collection systems should handle up to 80 mL over 6 days. \n \n NASA will award the Solutions it judges to be the most promising for implementation and use on missions in the next three or four years. NASA will consider collaborating with winners and/or other competitors, subject to NASA rules and regulations for contract procurement. \n \n Background \n \n Spaceflight launch and entry suits are worn for launch and entry activities to protect the crew from any off-nominal events. Up until now, a crew member could be in their launch and entry suit for more than 10 hours at a time leading up to either a launch or landing scenario, and former astronauts have worn diapers in case they need to relieve themselves. The diaper is only used temporarily until the crew has successfully launched from or returned to Earth. It is eventually removed along with the launch and entry suit. \n \n Future missions may require long-duration waste management for use by a pressurized suited crew member. In the event of cabin depressurization or other contingency, crew members may need to take refuge in their launch and entry suits for a long-duration (144-hour). The crew member will have less than 60 minutes to get into and seal their spacesuit. To ensure the crew member’s safety, the Solution needs to take no more than 5 minutes of that time. The crew member will remain in their suit at a pressure of 4.3 PSID and in 100% oxygen environment, with a few tasks to complete inside the depressurized vehicle prior to vehicle. A system to route and collect human waste away from the body without the use of hands, that operates in the prescribed environment, is being sought to keep astronauts alive and healthy over 144 hours. \n \n Current commercial products that provide urine waste management utilize gravity to route and collect urine away from the body. Some require the use of hands, and most are not meant to be used for 144 hours. No commercial products have been found that provide fecal waste management for a 144-hour period with or without the use of hands. While the implemented Solution can be discarded after each mission, it does have to function well for 6 days and multiple bowel and bladder evacuations. \n \n ABOUT POOPING IN SPACE…. \n \n This challenge does not require you to be working in a field involving microgravity or to fully understand how the body and fluids work in a microgravity environment. We are going to tell you a bit about what ‘s different. \n \n First, microgravity is what you might call “Zero Gravity”. Think vacuum. In a vacuum, solids, liquids and gases do not act the way they do on earth, where they are influenced by earth’s gravity. You probably have no problem imagining things floating around in space. Yes, sometimes solids, liquids, and gases do this. But they also might cling to the nearest surface due to surface tension. Imagine taking a shower up in space and having a glob of water under your armpit. Also, on earth, solids and liquids would likely mix together at least a little when in contact. Maybe not in microgravity. \n \n As for your bodily functions. Well, in space there is no gravity to direct your urine away from your body when you release it. Same for poop. There is no gravity to pull it away when you release it. Menstrual fluid? At least some of it will exit a woman’s body. You don’t want that traveling around your suit. And don’t forget, you can’t always count on poop being solid, especially if you are up in space and nervous about the fact that your vehicle cabin has depressurized. \n \n You don’t want any of these solids and fluids stuck to your body for 6 days. If you have ever taken care of a baby, you know how easy it is to get diaper rash. Left untreated, that can turn into a dangerous infection. You don’t want fecal matter getting into the urethra or the vagina, causing urinary tract or vaginal infections. Of course, you don’t want them to migrate to mouth, nose, ears or cuts. The point? Your Solution has to keep all of these materials away from the body, its orifices, and the spacesuit air inlet/outlet orifices. \n \n How has NASA handled this in the past? Well, for one thing, they weren’t handling it for 6 days. Maybe a few hours. In the recent past, astronauts have worn an extremely absorbent adult diaper. Most of the time the diaper is there for emergencies. Prior to that, men wore Urine Collection and Transfer Assembly (UCTA) and Fecal Collection Systems (FCS). Women have never had anything besides the adult diaper while wearing a suit. When not wearing a suit, but within the vehicle, women had a choice of 3 versions of cup-type urine collection systems that used air flow to effectively cause urine to swirl away from a woman’s body. No matter how you look at it, getting rid of wastes has been complicated, crude, uncomfortable, and messy, even with the use of hands. And now we are saying that you don’t have use of your hands – at least not inside the suit next to your body. \n \n ABOUT THE SPACE SUIT \n \n You will design a solution that can be incorporated into the orange Modified Advanced Crew Escape Suit (MACES). MACES has been adapted for missions of longer duration than the original Advanced Crew Escape Suit (ACES) was designed for. \n \n The whole suit, including the gloves, is pressurized to 4.3 PSID to enable the body to function properly. Without pressure the body swells, loses most of its circulation, and of course, causes extreme pain. The gloves are attached by metal bearings to the sleeves to ensure a proper seal. Once the suit is sealed, it must remain sealed until the astronaut enters another pressurized environment. While sealed, it is impossible for an astronaut to access their own body, even to scratch their nose. \n \n Gas (100% oxygen) enters at 4.5 cubic feet per minute through a waist level connector to fill the 2” space between the astronaut’s body and the suit, and circulates out through another waist level connector to be cleaned and brought back to the suit. A mesh cover protects against particles getting into the air connectors. If they did get inside, they could easily block the flow of air. \n \n This gas supply is clearly a very precious commodity. While a very small amount is lost to leakage, the Solution must not add to this leakage. However, careful use of 1000 cubic centimeters per minute (0.01 cubic feet per minute) over a period of 3 minutes per use would not jeopardize the integrity of the suit. \n \n The suit allows the astronauts to move around, get into tight spaces, and sit down and buckle up for long periods of time. Your Solution should be comfortable in all of these situations. \n \n Finally, a small power sources of up to 28V with current below 100mA could be provided inside or outside of the suit. \n \n To learn more about the functionality of space suits in general, see NASA’s What is a Space Suit and Wikipedia’s Space Suit. To read the detailed specifications of the MACES, click here. \n \n PLANS FOR THE WINNING SOLUTIONS \n \n NASA is ideally looking for Solutions that are comprised of technologies at a minimum Technical Readiness Level (TRL) of level 4, such that the Solution can be tested within 1 year and fully implemented within 3 years. However, for breakthrough innovations, NASA will consider Solutions that are at a lower TRL and therefore a longer implementation timeline. \n \n NASA will consider collaborating with winners and/or other competitors, subject to NASA rules and regulations for contract procurement. \n \n Prizes \n \n The challenge offers up to $30,000 USD in prizes to innovative solutions for long duration waste management in a microgravity environment. NASA will award up to three prizes for the best ideas. \n \n NASA will award the Solutions it judges to be the most promising for implementation and use on missions in the next three or four years. \n \n How do I win? \n \n To be eligible for an award, the solution must, at minimum: \n \n Keep urine and/or fecal waste away from a crew member’s body for a minimum of 144 hours while in a space suit \n \n Operate in a microgravity scenario \n \n Operate within a full launch and entry suit at an internal pressure of 4.3 PSID and 100% oxygen environment which cannot be opened for manual access within the 144 hour time period \n \n Operate while a crew member is moving, bending, and/or seated and strapped into a chair \n \n Manage at least one of the three following human wastes for up to 6 days Manage up to 1L per day of urine per crew member (based on planned liquid intake during mission) Manage up to 75 grams of fecal mass and 75mL fecal volume per crew member (based on planned food intake during mission). Fecal matter may range from liquid to solid, but the Solution is not required to handle uncontrollable, ongoing diarrhea. Manage up to 80 mL of menstrual fluid over 6 days \n \n Require less than five minutes for a crew member to, on their own, set up and secure the Solution to their body, prior to, or along with, getting into their launch and entry suit. \n \n Operate effectively for both men and women of varying size and weight within the range of 1% to 99% on the Airforce ANSUR anthropometric database. Please refer to the Resource Page and this document for ranges in relevant measurements for your solution, which might include, but not be limited to: waist circumference (24.2 to 43.5”), Buttock circumference (33.1 to 45.2”), Hip breadth, sitting (31.5 to 46.5”), Waist back (15.4 to 22”) and Waist depth (5.9” to 11.8”). \n \n The Solution may include a variety of approaches, including, but not limited to: \n \n Using different management systems for urine versus fecal versus menstruation output and/or males versus females or by size or weight \n \n Integrating all hardware into one garment that is easy to don \n \n Keeping collected urine and fecal matter inside the suit or routing it outside the suit, allowing for customization for each crew member, etc. \n \n The judging panel will rank the eligible Solutions submitted against the following criteria: \n \n Criteria Description Percent Importance Soundness and Technical Readiness of the design Likelihood that the Solution will work as described to satisfy the minimum requirements with a minimum of risk. This includes the technical readiness level (TLR) of the design. 20 Gas Conservation Effectiveness at ensuring the conservation of gas in the crew member’s suit 10 Health and Safety Level of health and safety the Solution will provide to the crew member including dryness and prevention of pain, infection and permanent injury 15 Suit Integrity Effectiveness ensuring the integrity of the crew member’s suit, including the number of entry/exit points required 15 Speed Ease and feasibility of integrating the Solution with the body and the suit within 5 minutes. 10 Ease of Use/ Constraints Ease of use given the constraints required for using (e.g., clean shaven, limitations on timing of waste elimination, requirement to be near a specific technology, etc.) 10 Comfort Level of physical, emotional, and psychological comfort the crew member will experience using the Solution, including while donning, moving around, and seated and strapped in 10 Ease of Incorporation Ease of incorporating into existing suits and vehicle, 5 Other Benefits Other benefits that the judges identify or the competitor points out that do not fall into the above categories. Could also include judge preferences, such as for simplicity. 5 \n \n Participation Eligibility: \n \n The Prize is open to individuals, age 18 or older, private teams, public teams, and collegiate teams. Individual competitors and teams may originate from any country, as long as United States federal sanctions do not prohibit participation (see: https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Pages/Programs.aspx).

Tolda / Special to the Sun \n \n WHERE SHE CHANGED Angle softened her rhetoric on phasing out Social Security and retreated from statements about people exercising “Second Amendment remedies” if conservatives don’t prevail this year. \n \n WHERE SHE DIDN'T Angle held firm in opposing extension of unemployment benefits. She also restated her opposition to abortion, saying government should not have gotten involved in the issue. \n \n Sun coverage More Sun politics stories \n \n In her first mainstream media interview since winning the Republican nomination in the U.S. Senate race, former Assemblywoman Sharron Angle softened her rhetoric on “phasing out” Social Security and fearing the electorate would take up arms if conservatives didn’t win at the ballot box. \n \n But on other issues, such as abortion and her belief that unemployment benefits deter the jobless from applying for work, she stridently defended herself amid criticism from her Democratic rival, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, that her views are “wacky” and “dangerous.” \n \n In a raucous 30-minute interview on “Face to Face With Jon Ralston,” Angle was pressed to explain the positions she took during the Republican primary to a general election audience, as well as to a cadre of political observers waiting to see how much she will change now that she faces a major Democrat for the first time in her political career. \n \n Only once did she flatly admit her pre-primary language was too strong, when asked to explain her comments that the citizenry will resort to “Second Amendment remedies” — referring to the right to bear arms — if conservatives didn’t win this election. \n \n “I admit it was a little strong to say,” she said. “That’s why I changed my rhetoric to ‘defeat Harry Reid.’ ” \n \n She also appeared to moderate her belief that the Social Security program should be “phased out.” Far from advocating an end to the program, she said existing benefits should be protected, more money should be put into the system and, in the future, younger workers should be given the choice between a “personal account” and Social Security benefits. \n \n But when it came to one of the most severe problems facing Nevada, the 14 percent unemployment rate that is higher than any other state’s, Angle stuck to her view that unemployment benefits should no longer be extended. \n \n Instead, she said jobs exist that those on benefits should be taking. \n \n “They keep extending unemployment benefits to the point where people are afraid to go out and get a job because the job doesn’t pay as much as the benefit,” Angle said. “There are jobs that do exist.” \n \n Unemployment benefits should be reworked to supplement lower wages, rather than being eliminated once a job is found, she argued. \n \n She vehemently restated her view that a “system of entitlements” has “spoiled our citizenry.” \n \n Angle also worked to stay true to her core conservative beliefs on social issues. She said the separation of church and state is a doctrine meant to “protect the church” and that elected officials should “bring our values to the political system.” She sidestepped her comments from the 1990s that the separation of church and state is an “unconstitutional doctrine.” \n \n After the interview Reid spokesman Jon Summer commented, “For someone who talks so much about the Constitution, you would think she would actually know what is in it. It’s shocking to hear her say that the separation of church and state isn’t part of the Constitution, when it is laid out in the First Amendment.” \n \n The interview itself was significant because while Angle has been available to conservative talk shows, she has been viewed as evading mainstream news organizations. \n \n When Ralston challenged her comments to a Reno conservative talk show host that abortion should not be available even in the case of rape or incest, Angle said she values life. \n \n “You want government to go and tell a 13-year-old child who’s been raped by her father she has to have that baby?” Ralston asked. \n \n “I didn’t say that,” she said. “I always say that I value life.” \n \n She went further to say she believes government should stay out of the issue of abortion, but it decided to insert its control after the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. \n \n “The government decided to get involved in this, not me,” she said. “I’m just defending my position.” \n \n When she was in the Legislature, Angle repeatedly sponsored a bill that would require the “dissemination of information concerning the scientific link between induced abortion and increased rate of breast cancer.” \n \n Concerning Yucca Mountain, Angle said she believes the state should abandon its decades-old fight to keep the federal government from burying the nation’s most radioactive waste 90 miles outside of Las Vegas. \n \n “We need to make lemonade out of lemons,” she said, arguing jobs could be created by accepting the waste. \n \n Throughout the interview, Angle tried to pivot to attacking Reid, blaming him for the high unemployment rate, expanding the federal deficit and bailing out big businesses. \n \n “We’re nitpicking on all of these little topics that Harry Reid has thrown out there,” she said. “I would like to see Harry Reid come into this studio and have a real debate on the issues. And the issues to me are the high unemployment, the high foreclosure rate and the high bankruptcy rate.”""]",6,"– Pooping in space ""isn't glamorous, but it is necessary for survival,"" an astronaut explains—yet it's presenting quite a challenge for NASA. See, while the International Space Station has a pretty fancy toilet, an astronaut must wear a diaper during launch and landing activities or while spacewalking. But as NASA looks toward future missions in deep space, it's also looking for a way for astronauts to relieve themselves while remaining in their space suits for up to six days, reports Time. That's where you come in. The agency is offering a $30,000 prize in a ""space poop challenge"" if someone can create ""a system inside a space suit that collects human waste for up to 144 hours and routes it away from the body, without the use of hands."" There are plenty of stipulations. For example, the system ""needs to take no more than five minutes [to set up]"" as an astronaut might be forced to jump into their suit quickly in an emergency, per Space.com. While such a challenge might seem humorous, a solution ""could be the difference between life and death,"" notes the contest website. ""You don't want any of these solids and fluids stuck to your body for six days,"" NASA adds in a release. ""Given enough time, infection, and even sepsis can set in,"" says astronaut Rick Mastracchio in a video. Inventors have until Dec. 20 to submit their entries. NASA plans to test the top entries next year, with a solution executed within three years. (A scientist thinks humans could get to Mars in a month.)"

106,"['The South Korean military says North Korea attempted to launch a missile on April 15, the birthday of the country’s ""eternal president,"" Kim Il Sung, but that it failed. (Reuters) \n \n North Korea tried but failed to launch an intermediate-range missile Friday, American and South Korean military officials said, dealing the regime an embarrassing blow on the most important day of the year on the North Korean calendar. \n \n To mark the 104th anniversary of the birthday of the country’s ""eternal president,"" Kim Il Sung, North Korea launched a missile from its east coast at about 5:30 a.m. local time. But it deviated from a ""normal"" trajectory, an official from South Korea\'s Joint Chiefs of Staff told reporters in Seoul. \n \n “North Korea appears to have tried a missile launch from the East Sea [Sea of Japan] area early morning today, but it is presumed to have failed,” the official said. \n \n But South Korea\'s military is still on high alert. ""We are preparing against the possibility that the North could carry out heavyweight provocations at any time, including the fifth nuclear test,"" a military official said, according to the Yonhap News Agency. \n \n [North Korea unveils homemade engine for missile capable of striking U.S.] \n \n A U.S. defense official said that the U.S. Strategic Command systems had also “detected and tracked” the missile. “We assess that the launch failed,” he said. \n \n Initial analysis suggested that the missile was a Musudan, also known as a BM-25, the kind that South Korean authorities had detected being moved Thursday near Wonsan on North Korea’s east coast. \n \n The Musudan is an intermediate-range ballistic missile capable of traveling 1,500 to 2,500 miles — putting the U.S. territory of Guam within reach — and of carrying a 1.3-ton nuclear warhead, according to the Nuclear Threat Initiative. \n \n North Korea has displayed the Musudan at its military parades and is believed to have supplied assembly kits for the missile to Iran, but it had never tested this model of missile before. \n \n \n \n Jeffrey Lewis, head of the East Asia program at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies in California, said the failure would “reinforce the persistent denial” about North Korea’s capabilities. \n \n “But in fact, they will have learned a lot from this launch. Not as much as they would have learned if it had succeeded, but still something,” Lewis said. \n \n The Musudan uses the same sort of engine as the submarine-launched ballistic missile that North Korea tested last year but that also failed. \n \n “Clearly they have a problem, but maybe next time it will work. It took them a couple of launches to get the Taepodong-2 going,” Lewis said, referring to the ballistic-missile technology that has now put two North Korean satellites into orbit. \n \n At the same time, North Korea has been making a series of claims about technological advances, from building solid-fuel rocket engines to miniaturizing nuclear warheads. The regime recently claimed that it could send a \xadnuclear-tipped missile to the U.S. mainland. \n \n [North Korea claims it could wipe out Manhattan with a hydrogen bomb] \n \n Although this has not been proved, U.S. military officials and nonproliferation experts say that North Korea is clearly working toward this goal. The Musudan test could be part of this program. \n \n At a hearing of a Senate Armed Services subcommittee this week, Brian McKeon, a senior Pentagon official, said North Korea’s weapons and missile programs pose a growing threat to the United States and its allies in East Asia. \n \n North Korea is “seeking to develop longer-range ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons to the United States and continues efforts to bring [a road-mobile intercontinental ballistic missile] to operational capacity,” he said. \n \n Although an untested long-range missile was unlikely to be reliable, North Korea’s successful satellite launches showed it was mastering the technologies that would be needed, McKeon said. \n \n China’s official Xinhua News Agency said North Korea’s failed firing of a mid-range ballistic missile Friday was “the latest in a string of saber-rattling that, if unchecked, will lead the country to nowhere.” \n \n Since Kim Jong Un ordered his military to conduct a fourth nuclear test in January — which North Korea claimed was a hydrogen-bomb explosion, although outside experts are highly skeptical — there has been a steady stream of projectiles emanating from North Korea. \n \n 1 of 50 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × What life looks like inside North Korea View Photos Scenes from the hermit kingdom.

Security Council resolutions from launching ballistic missiles or carrying out nuclear tests, but it continues to do so. \n \n The international community has responded to North Korea’s latest provocations with tough sanctions aimed at cutting off the state’s ability to procure parts and finance its weapons-of-mass-destruction program. \n \n This push coincided with two-month-long drills between the U.S. and South Korean militaries, during which they are practicing their response to the collapse of North Korea. The drills, which conclude at the end of this month, include computer-simulated “decapitation strikes” on the North Korean leadership. \n \n Amid this background of heightened tensions, North Korea has been preparing for two key events — the anniversary of Kim Il Sung’s birth and the first congress of the communist Workers’ Party in 36 years. \n \n The country is in the grip of a “70-day campaign” to prepare for the congress, set for early next month. Analysts expect Kim Jong Un to use the event to bolster his legitimacy. \n \n Kim, who is 33, is not only incredibly young by the standards of Korea, where age is revered, but he also did not have the kind of long preparation and introduction that his father and predecessor, Kim Jong Il, enjoyed. \n \n Read more: \n \n North Korea scolds Obama by adopting the voice of Abraham Lincoln \n \n What it’s like to be an American held in North Korea \n \n The weird world of North Korea’s restaurants abroad', ""SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea attempted and failed to launch what experts believe was an intermediate-range ballistic missile on Friday in defiance of U.N. sanctions and in an embarrassing setback for leader Kim Jong Un, drawing criticism from major ally China. \n \n North Korea leader Kim Jong Un smiles as he visits Sohae Space Center in Cholsan County, North Pyongan province for the testing of a new engine for an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) in this undated photo released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) on April 9, 2016. REUTERS/KCNA \n \n The U.S. Defense Department called the test of the road-mobile missile, which came as North Korea celebrated the birthday of Kim’s grandfather and North Korea’s founding father Kim Il Sung, a “fiery, catastrophic” failure. \n \n The test, on North Korea’s so-called “Day of the Sun,” followed its fourth nuclear test in January and a long-range rocket launch in February, which led to new U.N. sanctions that have failed to halt Pyongyang’s weapons programs. \n \n South Korean officials and international experts said the failed test heightened the possibility that North Korea would conduct a fifth nuclear test, possibly within weeks. \n \n The U.S.-based 38 North website, which specializes in North Korea, said there has been activity at the country’s nuclear site based on satellite imagery and on Wednesday said the possibility of a fifth nuclear test “could not be ruled out.” \n \n U.S. officials said the missile tested on Friday never got off the launch pad but further tests were expected. \n \n “We’re still assessing the specifics of it but I can tell you that it was a fiery, catastrophic attempt at a launch,” Pentagon spokesman Captain Jeff Davis told a briefing. “It was not successful.” \n \n Davis said the U.S. military thought the device was a road-mobile missile because the launch occurred at a coastal site where Pyongyang ordinarily does not test rockets. \n \n He said North Korea, which regularly threatens to destroy South Korea and the United States and often fires missiles during periods of tension, remained a security concern in spite of the failure. \n \n “We know that this is a capability that they are aiming towards,” he said. It’s ... a missile system that they’ve displayed on multiple occasions and that is why we have a ballistic missile defense system that we have invested in very heavily to be able to outpace that threat as that threat develops further.” \n \n CHINA ANGERED \n \n The White House strongly condemned the latest launch attempt and said Washington would work with China and other countries to put pressure on North Korea, which faced the prospect of further isolation. \n \n China, North Korea’s most important economic and diplomatic backer, has been angered by Pyongyang’s nuclear tests and rocket launches and has backed U.N. sanctions. \n \n “The firing of a mid-range ballistic missile on Friday by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), though failed, marks the latest in a string of saber-rattling that, if unchecked, will lead the country to nowhere,” China’s official Xinhua news agency said in an English language commentary. \n \n “... Nuclear weapons will not make Pyongyang safer. On the contrary, its costly military endeavors will keep on suffocating its economy.” \n \n Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said the U.N. Security Council was clear on North Korean rocket launches. \n \n “At present, the situation on the peninsula is complex and sensitive,” he told reporters. “We hope all parties can strictly respect the decisions of the Security Council and avoid taking any steps that could further worsen tensions.” \n \n In 2012, Kim Il Sung’s birthday was also marked by an attempted long-range rocket launch, which also failed. \n \n The missile was likely a Musudan, South Korea’s Yonhap news agency said, an intermediate-range ballistic missile with a design range of more than 3,000 km (1,800 miles) that can be fired from a road mobile launcher but which has never been flight-tested. \n \n Experts see North Korea’s Musudan test as part of an effort to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach the mainland United States. The Musudan theoretically could reach the U.S. Pacific island of Guam. \n \n North Korea is to hold a congress of its ruling Workers Party - the first such meeting in 36 years - in early May, at which Kim Jong Un is likely to trumpet his achievements in building up Pyongyang’s weapons prowess. \n \n South Korean officials and experts say he will be keen to go into that with a show of strength, not a failed rocket launch, making the possibility of another nuclear test more likely. \n \n North Korean leader Kim Jong Un watches the ballistic rocket launch drill of the Strategic Force of the Korean People's Army (KPA) at an unknown location, in this undated file photo released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) in Pyongyang on March 11, 2016.

An American military official says the US also detected and tracked the failed launch, which took place on the most important day in Pyongyang's calendar, the birthday of Kim Il Sung. Officials suspect the missile was a Musudan intermediate-range missile, also known as a BM-25, which Pyongyang has displayed in military parades but never tested before. The country fired a different kind of medium-range missile into the sea last month. Even North Korea's closest ally denounced the latest launch attempt, reports Reuters.

And starting on Jan. 13th, Apple will do just that. \n \n The company said Wednesday that China will be among 22 countries that soon will get the newest iPhone, one of Apple's hottest-selling yet. The iPhone now accounts for nearly half of Apple's annual revenue, and some analysts believe it earns the company more than 60% of its profits. \n \n China is one of the world's largest mobile device markets, with close to a billion cellphone users by some estimates. Apple currently partners with China Unicom, one of the larger carriers with close to 200 million cellular subscribers. \n \n Apple said Wednesday it had no current plans to announce a partnership with China Mobile, the country's largest carrier with more than 630 million subscribers (a user base that, somewhat amazingly, is more than twice the size of the U.S. population). But for months now Apple has been rumored to be nailing down a deal with China Mobile, and millions of the carriers' customers are already using the iPhone by modifying the device to work on their network. \n \n Will Siri actually be able to speak and understand Mandarin?

108,"['CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida (Reuters) - A 1-ton European science satellite plunged back into Earth\'s atmosphere and incinerated with debris most likely landing in the southern regions of the Atlantic Ocean, officials said on Monday. \n \n The last contact by ground tracking stations with Europe\'s Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer, known as GOCE, was at 5:42 p.m. EST (2242 GMT) on Sunday as the spacecraft flew just 75 miles above Antarctica, the European Space Agency said. \n \n Extrapolating from computer models, officials believe GOCE hit the upper atmosphere about 50 miles above the planet\'s surface no later than 7:16 p.m. EST Sunday (0016 GMT Monday) near the Falkland Islands. \n \n ""This would put the main area over which any possible GOCE remnants fell to the southernmost regions of the Atlantic Ocean,"" the space agency wrote in a status report on its website. \n \n ""No damage to property has been reported from any debris,"" the report said. \n \n About 25 percent of the car-sized satellite was expected to have survived re-entry. \n \n GOCE was launched in 2009 to map variations in Earth\'s gravity. Scientists assembled the data into the first detailed global maps of the boundary between the planet\'s crust and mantle, among other projects. \n \n The satellite ran out of fuel on October 21 and had been steadily losing altitude since, tugged by Earth\'s gravity. \n \n The 1.2-ton (1,100-kg) GOCE satellite is small in comparison to other spacecraft that recently crashed back into the atmosphere. \n \n In January 2012, Russia\'s failed 14-ton (12,700-kg) Phobos-Grunt Mars probe returned. In 2011, NASA\'s 6.5-ton (5,900-kg) Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite and Germany\'s 2.4-ton (2,177-kg) X-ray ROSAT telescope re-entered the atmosphere. \n \n (Editing by Kevin Gray)', 'Image caption Goce needed its engine power to stay in orbit \n \n The European Space Agency\'s (Esa) Goce satellite has re-entered the Earth\'s atmosphere, burning up in the process. \n \n US tracking data suggests any surviving debris fell into the South Atlantic, just off the tip of South America, south of the Falkland Islands. \n \n Dubbed the ""Ferrari of space"" because of its sleek looks, Goce is the first Esa mission to make an uncontrolled re-entry in more than 25 years. \n \n The gravity mapping probe\'s plunge was inevitable once it ran out of fuel. \n \n The mission was operating in an extremely low orbit - at 224km altitude, the lowest of any scientific satellite - and needed to constantly thrust an electric engine to stay aloft, but last month its reserves of xenon fuel were exhausted. \n \n Pre-return modelling had indicated that perhaps a fifth to a quarter of Goce\'s one-tonne mass could have endured the fiery fall through the atmosphere. \n \n Its sophisticated gradiometer - the instrument used to make gravity measurements - incorporated composite materials which were expected to ride out the destructive forces that would ordinarily incinerate traditional components. \n \n Tracking project \n \n The Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee - the global forum on ""space junk"" - chose Goce as its special study project for 2013. This meant a large number of tracking and surveillance facilities around the world were activated to monitor the satellite\'s descent to Earth. \n \n A signal from Goce was last acquired at 22:42 GMT on Sunday as it passed 121km (75 miles) above Antarctica. Data from the United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) indicated that re-entry occurred a little over one orbit of the Earth later, with the spacecraft starting to break up at 00:16 GMT on Monday at an altitude of about 80km. \n \n This would have put any debris fall in the South Atlantic just east of Tierra Del Fuego. \n \n ""Goce survived for a few minutes longer than we expected - but since re-entries are difficult to predict, this is not very surprising,"" Holger Krag from Esa\'s Space Debris Office told BBC News. \n \n Image caption Goce\'s principal objective was to make maps of the variation in the pull of gravity across the Earth \n \n Goce\'s slender, fin-shaped construction, combined with its magnetic attitude-control system, maintained a stable orientation until very late in the descent. Engineers monitoring the last hours of the satellite from Europe\'s Space Operations Centre in Darmstadt, Germany, observed Goce to keep a straight-on approach as it dipped deeper and deeper into the atmosphere. \n \n ""This was due to the shape of Goce, which was designed in such a way that it was aerodynamically stabilised,"" said Dr Krag. \n \n Statistics show that there is typically at least one piece of tracked space ""junk"" re-entering the Earth\'s atmosphere every day; with, on average, one intact defunct spacecraft or old rocket body coming back every week. \n \n Esa\'s last mission to make an uncontrolled re-entry was the magnetosphere explorer Isee-2, which came back in 1987. \n \n The agency does, however, regularly manage controlled re-entries. Its space station freighter, the Automated Transfer Vehicle, can weigh some 13 tonnes when it comes back to Earth. \n \n It has fuel and thrusters to direct its destructive dive towards the vast and uninhabited waters of the Southern Ocean, east of New Zealand. \n \n Goce (Gravity Field and Steady-State Ocean Circulation Explorer) was launched in 2009 as part of a series of innovative environmental research satellites. \n \n Its super-sensitive gradiometer was used to detect the tiny variations in the pull of gravity across the surface of the Earth. \n \n Its maps have very broad applications. The data is a key reference in civil engineering for relating heights measured at widely separated locations, and for the computer models that need to understand how the oceans move to forecast future changes in climate.']",2,"– After four years of mapping our planet's gravity, the European Space Agency's GOCE satellite has plunged back to Earth. The GOCE—Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer—was last heard from 75 miles over Antarctica, Reuters reports. It is believed to have burned up on re-entry, with hundreds of pounds of surviving debris scattering somewhere in the Western Pacific. Its gradiometer, the instrument used to make gravity measurements, is made of materials tough enough to survive the fall to Earth, the BBC notes. GOCE—the planet's lowest-flying scientific satellite—mapped Earth's gravitational field in never-before-seen detail, revealing how gravity's pull is uneven across the world. The satellite's fall to Earth, which was inevitable after it ran out of fuel a few weeks ago, was the ESA's first uncontrolled re-entry in decades. But since GOCE was relatively light at 1.2 tons, it didn't attract the same attention as other recent re-entries, including the crash of a failed Russian probe last year."

Simon, who was accused nearly 40 years ago of killing 14 random victims and wounding seven others on San Francisco streets, died alone in his cell of unknown causes Thursday night, according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. He was pronounced dead at 11:59 p.m. inside the prison. \n \n “The cause of death is pending an autopsy,” said Krissi Khokhobashvili, a spokeswoman for the corrections department. “All that can be released at this point is that he was unresponsive in his cell.” \n \n The 69-year-old Simon was convicted in San Francisco of two counts of first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit murder and assault with a deadly weapon in 1976 after the killing spree, which prompted what authorities said was the biggest manhunt in the city’s history. He was serving a life sentence with the possibility of parole when he died. \n \n Simon and three other black men — Larry Green, Manuel Moore and Jessie Lee Cooks — went on a six-month rampage from October 1973 to April 1974. They targeted white people, mostly at night along the Divisadero Street corridor. \n \n The 14 victims were mostly shot in the back or the back of the head execution-style. The slayings were called the “Zebra” murders because of the special radio band, the Z channel, that investigators used. \n \n The seven victims who survived the attacks were crucial in finding the culprits, detectives said. \n \n One of the survivors was future Mayor Art Agnos, who was then a 35-year-old social worker. He had left a meeting in Potrero Hill on Dec. 13, 1973, and was walking to his car when he said he heard a loud popping noise at Wisconsin and 23rd streets. Agnos at first tried to calm the people fleeing the gunshots when he realized he had been shot twice in the back. \n \n The intensive manhunt, overseen by Mayor Joseph Alioto, lasted several months and included a $30,000 reward for information about the killers. At one point the mayor authorized police to stop and question any black man who resembled witnesses’ descriptions. The practice, which resulted in the questioning of hundreds of innocent men, was eventually halted by a federal judge. \n \n Police, acting on a tip by an informant, eventually raided an apartment complex at 844 Grove St., in the old Fillmore district. Seven men were arrested, but only Cooks, Green, Moore and Simons were charged. \n \n The killings were among several horrific and bloody events in the late 1960s and 1970s by San Francisco radicals, including the Zodiac serial killer, the Symbionese Liberation Army and the Rev. Jim Jones, who forced his followers to drink cyanide-laced punch. Dan White also murdered Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk that decade. \n \n The four Zebra killers were convicted and sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole, which has been denied repeatedly. \n \n Green, 63, is serving his sentence at California State Prison-Solano in Vacaville; Moore, 70, is at Ironwood State Prison (Riverside County); and Cooks, 70, is at Richard J.

The incidents allegedly occurred in 2015. \n \n Hwang claims that when she was brushing dandruff off Savage’s clothing for a shoot, he “violently struck” her on her arm three times. \n \n Hwang also alleges that Savage would often roll his eyes and glare at her, and that he had a reputation for being verbally abusive to female crew members. \n \n In a news conference Wednesday, Hwang alleged that she was “scared of the abuse and what [she’d] have to encounter on any given day” at work, and claimed that her superiors encouraged her not to report Savage’s conduct because they were scared of losing their jobs. \n \n She specifically notes in the suit that an executive producer told her, “I’m not even sure what Fred did constituted harassment and I don’t think you should report it to HR,” per TMZ. \n \n Hwang is seeking unspecified damages for emotional distress. \n \n Savage told Page Six in a statement Wednesday that the claims against him are “absolutely untrue.” \n \n I have witnessed tremendous courage over these past few months, watching brave women who have come forward publicly fighting through the shame and stigma of harassment. I’ve seen first-hand the growing support in this movement that has always felt so lacking. As someone who has always tried to live honorably and with integrity, it never dawned on me that my name could be on the other side. I was made aware that a woman working in the costume department of a show I was on almost three years ago has claimed that I treated her harshly on set simply because she was a woman. These accusations are completely without merit and absolutely untrue. Fox conducted an extensive internal investigation into her claims, a process in which I fully participated. After concluding a thorough investigation, Fox determined that there was absolutely no evidence to support these accusations. None of her claims could be substantiated because they did not happen. I have been working in the entertainment industry my whole life and have always endeavored to treat everyone on any set I work on respectfully and professionally. While none of the accusations being leveled at me are true, I wholeheartedly support all people who feel they are being mistreated come forward and speak to human resources and those in charge. We have witnessed so much bravery from those speaking out recently, but I will just as boldly protect myself and my family from those seeking to tarnish my good name. I cannot let these people in particular denigrate me while harming the message of thousands of women and others who have suffered and continue to suffer. \n \n Fox also defended Savage. \n \n “Fox takes all allegations of improper conduct very seriously. We conducted a thorough investigation into these allegations and found no evidence of any wrongdoing on the part of Mr. Savage, ” a rep for the network told Page Six on Wednesday. “We will vigorously defend against these unfounded claims.” \n \n However, Hwang’s attorney, Anahita Sedaghatfar, alleges that Fox did not conduct an independent investigation into the claims, and says that Savage’s attorneys have refused to speak with her or Hwang. \n \n Sedaghatfar also claims that other women on the set of “The Grinder” filed complaints with Fox about Savage’s behavior, too, though she would not expound on who the other women are or what abuses they had alleged. \n \n “The Grinder” ran from 2015 to 2016. \n \n This isn’t the only complaint about Savage’s on-set behavior. \n \n In January, it was revealed that the actor was sued for sexual harassment in 1993 during his tenure on “The Wonder Years.” \n \n The suit, filed by a costume designer on the show, alleged that then-16-year-old Savage made sexual comments aimed at her and asked to have an affair with her. She claimed she was fired from the show as a result. \n \n The suit, which also went after Savage’s co-star Jason Hervey, was eventually settled for an undisclosed sum. \n \n Savage’s onscreen mother, Alley Mills, claims the show would have continued if it weren’t for the suit, which she dubbed “ridiculous.”']",3,"– A man who went on a murder rampage against white people in San Francisco 40 years ago has died at San Quentin.

110,"['To email or not to email? For those in love, it\'s better than leaving a voice message \n \n Sept. 1, 2015 \n \n FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE \n \n \n \n BLOOMINGTON, Ind. -- In her hit single, Carly Rae Jepsen may have sung, ""Here\'s my number, so call me maybe."" But according to a new research study from Indiana University, she might be more successful in finding love if she asked him to send her an email. \n \n The research, which has been accepted for publication in the journal Computers in Human Behavior, suggests that, in this digital age, an email can be more effective in expressing romantic feelings than leaving a voicemail message. \n \n Previous research and conventional wisdom suggested the opposite, that a voicemail message is a more intimate way to connect with others, but that may not be true, particularly among millennials. \n \n “The bottom line is that email is much better when you want to convey some information that you want someone to think about,” said one of the authors, Alan R. Dennis, the John T. Chambers Chair of Internet Systems in IU’s Kelley School of Business. \n \n Dennis and co-author Taylor M. Wells, an assistant professor of management information systems at California State University-Sacramento, set out to learn more about how we respond emotionally to these newer forms of communication. \n \n Although voicemail, email and texting are part of everyday life, very little is known about how their characteristics influence and distort communication in work and personal settings. \n \n Using psychophysiological measures from 72 college-age people, Dennis and Wells found that people who sent romantic emails were more emotionally aroused and used stronger and more thoughtful language than those who left voicemails. \n \n “When writing romantic emails, senders consciously or subconsciously added more positive content to their messages, perhaps to compensate for the medium’s inability to convey vocal tone,” Dennis and Wells wrote in the paper, “To Email or Not to Email: The Impact of Media on Psychophysiological Responses and Emotional Content in Utilitarian and Romantic Communication.” \n \n “Email enables senders to modify the content as messages are composed to ensure they are crafted to the needs of the situation. Voicemail lacks this feature,” they added. “A sender records a voicemail in a single take, and it can be sent or discarded and re-recorded, but not edited. Thus senders engage with email messages longer and may think about the task more deeply than when leaving voicemails. This extra processing may increase arousal.” \n \n Previous research suggests that email and text chat are considered poor for communicating emotion. This is believed to be the first research study on how we respond to email using physiological measures. \n \n Dennis and Wells’ findings weren’t just about pulling heartstrings -- the use of email induced more arousing psychophysiological responses than voicemail, regardless of whether the message was utilitarian or romantic. Gender was not found to be a factor and was omitted in the final analysis. \n \n In an interview, Dennis noted that their findings run counter to media naturalness theory, a commonly held evolutionary standard suggesting that the further we get away from face-to-face communications, the less natural and less effective it becomes. \n \n “In this case, we found people adapted,” Dennis said. “Email’s been in the popular consciousness since the 1990s, and if you look at the new generation of millenials, and that’s who we studied, they’ve grown up with email and text messaging. So it may not be as unnatural a medium as we at first thought. \n \n “There’s a lot of theory that says email and other text communications don’t really work very well,” Dennis added. “We should probably go back and reconsider a lot of the stereotypical assumptions that we hold about email and text messaging that may not hold true when we take a deeper look at how people react physiologically.” \n \n The researchers did not see much use of emoticons and emojis in their emails. Rather, they found that when writing emails, subjects took more time to choose their words carefully to make sure the language conveyed the full meaning. \n \n The study also demonstrated that the medium used can shape the content of the message. Senders of utilitarian messages sent less positive emails than voicemails for the same communication task. However, when composing romantic messages, senders included the most positive and most arousing emotional content in emails and the least positive and least arousing emotional content in voicemails. \n \n “We expected that using email for romantic communication would be more frustrating than using voicemail, but our data do not show this,” the authors wrote. “There was neither greater emotional arousal nor greater negative emotional valence when using email for romantic tasks versus utilitarian tasks. \n \n “These results taken together suggest that ‘the medium is the message’ (as famously coined by philosopher Marshall McLuhan in 1964) in a more fundamental way than we have previously understood,” they added. “Our results show that the medium changes how message senders feel and what they say.” \n \n Dennis warns managers against misinterpreting these findings to suggest that face-to-face meetings, personal phone calls and other direct forms of communications aren’t as useful. \n \n “If something isn’t really clear and you want to make sure that everyone has the same understanding of what something means, that’s best done in phone calls, face-to-face meetings or video conferencing,” Dennis said. “You have different cues, and it’s also synchronous discussion, as opposed to email, where time goes by before the receiver gets to it.” \n \n The research was conducted by placing skin sensors on the subjects’ faces to measure muscle movement associated with positive and negative emotion, and on their feet to measure arousal. Subjects were randomly chosen to do voicemail or email first and produce a utilitarian or a romantic message first. \n \n Wells conducted the research with Dennis while he was a doctoral candidate at the Kelley School. \n \n Related Links', 'The San Francisco Board of Supervisors unanimously voted today to approve the ordinance that looks to regulate electric scooters in San Francisco. The ordinance seeks to establish regulation and a permitting process that would enable the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency or Department of Public Works to take action against scooters from companies that don’t have an official permit from the city. \n \n “Part of the brouhaha has been really the function of the fact, which was admitted yesterday, was that some of these companies have been a little bit fast and loose with the truth,” Supervisor Aaron Peksin, a sponsor of the ordinance, said today at the Board of Supervisors meeting.* \n \n Peskin is referencing the fact that Lime, Spin and Bird deployed their respective scooters without permission from the city. The permitting scheme the city has in mind, Peskin said, is very similar to the one San Francisco has in place around stationless bike-sharing. \n \n “This is a basic permitting scheme to allow the professional staff at SFMTA to permit these with sensible, regulatory frameworks and to be able to confiscate unpermitted vehicles or devices,” Peskin said. \n \n He added that these electric scooters can absolutely serve some benefits to people in San Francisco, but that it does not mean the city should have to sacrifice its sidewalk space. The next step is for the BOS to continue working with the SFMTA to develop this regulation. At a hearing yesterday, the SFMTA said it hopes to open up the permitting process by May 1. \n \n Earlier in the meeting today, the BOS adopted a resolution to develop a working group to inform future legislation around emerging technologies. One of the resolution’s sponsors, Supervisor Norman Yee, noted how he’s heard from seniors and people in wheelchairs who are “being imperiled and inconvenienced because they are having to navigate around scooters and bikes.” \n \n He later added, the purpose of the working group would be to ensure the city is mindful of both the intended and unintended consequences of emerging technologies. \n \n Yesterday, SF City Attorney Dennis Herrera sent cease-and-desist letters to Lime, Bird and Spin, but that doesn’t seem to be making any difference to Lime, Bird and Spin. All three of their respective scooters were found on the streets of San Francisco this morning. \n \n “As it says in the letter, the City Attorney has laid out some recommendations for operation that he will like to see implemented by April 30; he has not requested an immediate stoppage of service,” a Bird spokesperson told TechCrunch. “We are taking his concerns very seriously and reviewing his recommendations for improving Bird in San Francisco.” Lime says it’s taking the City Attorney seriously, as well as the vote by the BOS today. “In response, we are updating our current community outreach plan to address the City’s concerns about pedestrian safety, parking compliance, and rider education,” a Lime spokesperson told TechCrunch. “We plan to roll out new initiatives, along with our complete response to the City Attorney by the end of next week.” Lime says it will also provide helmets to users, which will we able for pickup starting April 22. Similar to Bird, Lime will also start requiring people to submit a photo of their properly parked scooter at the end of the ride. Additionally, Lime says it will more clearly state that riding on or blocking sidewalks is illegal. I’ve reached out to Spin about its operations in San Francisco. I’ll update this story if I hear back. \n \n An earlier version of this story misattributed Supervisor Aaron Peskin’s quotes to another supervisor.', 'America \n \n Report: Threat Of Mandatory Minimums Used To Coerce Guilty Pleas \n \n i itoggle caption Stephen Lam/Reuters /Landov Stephen Lam/Reuters /Landov \n \n A new report says the Justice Department regularly coerces defendants in federal drug cases to plead guilty by threatening them with steep prison sentences or stacking charges to increase their time behind bars. \n \n And for the first time, the study by Human Rights Watch finds that defendants who take their fate to a judge or jury face prison sentences on average 11 years longer than those who plead guilty. \n \n In all, a whopping 97 percent of defendants plead guilty — no surprise, says author Jamie Fellner, given the enormous and essentially unchecked power that federal prosecutors wield. \n \n ""As long as there are mandatory minimums, prosecutors dictate the sentences by the charges they bring,"" Fellner told NPR in an interview. \n \n The issue matters because about half of the people in costly and overcrowded U.S. prisons got there after being charged with and convicted of drug offenses. Even though many of those inmates worked on the ground floor of drug operations, they still serve long prison sentences because of five- and 10-year mandatory terms that Congress breathed into life during the heart of the crack cocaine scare in the 1980s. Prosecutors have the option of adding more charges based on a person\'s prior offenses, including low-level drug possession cases. \n \n Fellner\'s interviews with prosecutors, judges and public defenders and her review of sentencing data uncovered dozens of cases where defendants got sent to prison for nearly a half-century for first-time drug offenses. \n \n In one such case, the Human Rights Watch report said, Mary Beth Looney refused a plea deal that would have sent her to prison for 17 years for dealing methamphetamines and having guns in her house. Prosecutors added more charges against her. Ultimately, after trial and conviction, she was sentenced to more than 45 years behind bars. As a federal appeals court noted, mandatory minimum sentences left the trial judge with little discretion but to impose ""effectively a life sentence"" on the 53-year-old Texas woman who had no prior convictions. \n \n For others with a history of small-time drug possession raps, the ability of the Justice Department to stack on those old histories adds up, too. One judge wrote that he was dismayed by the life sentence that prosecutors tried to impose on a defendant for carrying such a small amount of drugs over the course of his criminal history that the substance ""would rattle around in a matchbox."" But too often, Fellner wrote, judges find their hands are tied by the mandatory sentencing system. \n \n ""To have a judge and a jury relegated to essentially museum pieces, it\'s not healthy,"" Fellner said. ""It doesn\'t lead to trust in the results. When you have innocent people tempted and also maybe pleading guilty just to avoid the possibility of a really long sentence, that doesn\'t give you a whole lot of faith in the integrity of the system."" \n \n Updated at 9:30 a.m. ET: DOJ Responds: \n \n Justice Department spokeswoman Ellen Canale said in an email to NPR that ""it is critical to ensure the criminal justice system operates fairly in every case, and the Department\'s charging policies reflect that goal."" \n \n She added: ""Under the Department\'s policy, prosecutors are instructed not to file sentencing enhancements unless the defendant is involved in conduct that makes the case appropriate for severe sanctions. This seeks to ensure that these enhancements are reserved for serious, high-level, or violent drug traffickers. The Department agrees that the enhancements should not be used to coerce defendants."" \n \n Our original post continues: \n \n In August, Attorney General Eric Holder told federal prosecutors not to hit low-level drug offenders with charges that carry mandatory minimum sentences, part of an effort to reduce U.S. incarceration levels, to reorient the criminal justice system toward violent criminals, and to become more ""smart"" on crime. Human Rights Watch says it\'s too early to say how prosecutors around the country will interpret that broad guidance. There\'s no apparent remedy if prosecutors refuse to follow the directive. And Fellner said she already has found some cases where the Justice Department appeared to do just that. \n \n Fellner said Congress needs to restore discretion to federal judges, by getting rid of mandatory minimums or giving judges more power to depart from sentencing guidelines based on the facts in an individual case. The Senate Judiciary Committee, led by Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., will consider some of these options when the Senate returns from recess next week. Fellner said Holder, in the meantime, should bar prosecutors from threatening longer sentences because defendants in drug cases refuse to plead guilty.']",3,"– If you want to convey something affectionate or romantic and you can't do it in person, it may be better to send an email than leave a voicemail. So report researchers at Indiana University Bloomington in the journal Computers in Human Behavior after analyzing both the messages being sent and the physical state of those doing the sending. Contrary to previous research and conventional wisdom suggesting that a voicemail message is more intimate than email, this study finds that, at least among the 72 college-age millennials analyzed, the act of writing produced in the sender far more emotional arousal and greater use of emotional language. The effect endures, too, since people tend to respond to messages using the same medium, thus the recipient may in turn experience similarly heightened emotions when replying, reports Pacific Standard. ""When writing romantic emails, senders consciously or subconsciously added more positive content to their messages, perhaps to compensate for the medium's inability to convey vocal tone,"" Dennis and Wells wrote in the paper. ""Senders engage with email messages longer and may think about the task more deeply than when leaving voicemails. This extra processing may increase arousal."" What's more, the students they studied have, they feel, adapted to the medium. ""If you look at the new generation of millennials, and that's who we studied, they've grown up with email and text messaging,"" one researcher says. ""So it may not be as unnatural a medium as we at first thought."" Or, perhaps, voicemail is just more awkward. (Check out how men and women tend to differ during breakups.)"
111,"['(CNN) -- The search continued Thursday for a gay porn actor suspected of dismembering his acquaintance, posting the video of the incident online and mailing the severed limbs to different locations in Ottawa, including to a political party\'s headquarters, according to a source with direct knowledge of the investigation. \n \n Authorities are searching for Luka Rocco Magnotta, 29, who they allege is responsible for a human torso discovered in Montreal, thought to be linked to a human hand and foot that were separately mailed from Montreal to Ottawa. \n \n Magnotta, also known as Eric Clinton Newman, is a Montreal resident who allegedly knew the victim, identified only as a white male, Montreal police spokesman Ian Lafreniere told reporters Wednesday. \n \n The suspect has no criminal background, and his image and information related to him were later recovered from a ""very graphic"" website, Lafreniere said. \n \n The source later confirmed that at least one of the websites examined by authorities was a pornographic site. \n \n It\'s possible the body parts all came from the same dismembered victim, Lafreniere said, but police are still awaiting the results of forensic testing for confirmation. \n \n ""The two parts of the body that were found in Ottawa ... we\'ve got all the reasons to believe that it\'s linked to our homicide,"" he added, referring to the human torso found in Montreal. \n \n Authorities said they are asking the public for help in locating Magnotta, after a ""coast-to-coast"" warrant was issued for his arrest. Police say they plan to charge him with murder once he\'s apprehended. \n \n Lafreniere said authorities have also found other body parts, potentially from the same attack, which is believed to have been committed in Montreal. It would be the 11th homicide there this year. \n \n ""It wasn\'t a random attack,"" Lafreniere said. ""They knew each other."" \n \n Lafreniere added that Magnotta had been ""involved in some stuff on the Web, that\'s for sure,"" though he would not elaborate. \n \n The human foot was sent to the Conservative Party of Canada headquarters in Ottawa, prompting a hazardous materials team to investigate. The officers who responded noticed what appeared to be bloodstains on the box, police said. \n \n Ottawa police Sgt. Steve Hodgson told reporters outside the office that the package had been addressed to the Conservative Party. Staffers had begun to open the package before calling police, he said. \n \n The hand was intercepted by workers at a Montreal postal terminal. \n \n Ottawa\'s major-crimes unit is checking with other police departments for similar cases and looking back through missing-persons files for any clues, according to Constable Marc Soucy, an Ottawa police spokesman. \n \n ""We\'re going to look at every avenue,"" he said. \n \n In Montreal, the human torso was found behind an apartment building, authorities said. \n \n CNN\'s Jake Carpenter, Paula Newton and Matt Smith contributed to this report.', 'Vic Toews, Public Safety Minister, and Jason Kenney, Minister of Citizenship, have denounced the discovery of a severed hand at an Ottawa mail depot and delivery of foot to Tory headquarters. \n \n Jason Kenney and Vic Toews Sean Kilpatrick/THE CANADIAN PRESS Vic Toews, Public Safety Minister, and Jason Kenney, Minister of Citizenship, have denounced the discovery of a severed hand at an Ottawa mail depot and delivery of foot to Tory headquarters. \n \n A police officer removes a package containg a human foot from the Conservative Party headquarters in Ottawa on Tuesday. \n \n Body parts found Sean Kilpatrick/THE CANADIAN PRESS A police officer removes a package containg a human foot from the Conservative Party headquarters in Ottawa on Tuesday. \n \n Police have named Magnotta a suspect in the shocking case where dismembered body parts were mailed to Ottawa, including the headquarters of the governing Conservative party. \n \n Luka Magnotta THE CANADIAN PRESS Police have named Magnotta a suspect in the shocking case where dismembered body parts were mailed to Ottawa, including the headquarters of the governing Conservative party. \n \n Police have named Magnotta a suspect in the shocking case where dismembered body parts were mailed to Ottawa, including the headquarters of the governing Conservative party. \n \n Luka Magnotta SUBMITTED IMAGE Police have named Magnotta a suspect in the shocking case where dismembered body parts were mailed to Ottawa, including the headquarters of the governing Conservative party. \n \n Andrew Chung \n \n Quebec Bureau \n \n \n \n WARNING: THIS REPORT CONTAINS GRAPHIC DETAILS \n \n MONTREAL—What began as a case of a severed foot sent to Canada’s ruling party headquarters has spiralled into an astonishing murder case involving a self-professed porn actor with links to Karla Homolka who’s accused of killing and dismembering a man in a Montreal apartment. \n \n Police have launched a Canada-wide manhunt for Luka Rocco Magnotta, 29, a Toronto native who appears in several dubious places on the Internet. He’s accused, among other things, of torturing and killing kittens and being romantically linked to notorious sex killer Homolka, though in a 2007 newspaper report he denied this last allegation. \n \n The police hunt follows the discovery Tuesday of a headless torso inside a brown suitcase next to a pile of rubbish at a dingy Montreal apartment building. Police say a foot and hand mailed to Ottawa belonged to the body. \n \n Late Wednesday, CTV News was reporting there was a note in the box containing the severed foot sent to the Conservative headquarters. The note reportedly said it was the first of six body parts, and it indicated the killer would kill again, according to CTV. \n \n In another shocking twist, a grotesque video has emerged on the Internet that appears to show a man stabbing a naked and bound victim dozens of times with an ice pick, defiling the corpse and cutting off the head and limbs. \n \n Montreal police said they are investigating the video, which sources say appears to be authentic. \n \n Though the actual Montreal crime scene appears similar to the one shown in the murder video, police have not confirmed that the video does indeed show the murder of the man whose body parts were mailed to Ottawa. \n \n However, a police source said, “Everything looks like this is the person we’re talking about.” \n \n More: Second body part discovered in Ottawa after severed foot sent to Conservative party headquarters \n \n The sources added there is a “very strong possibility” that the man whose body parts were sent to Ottawa is an Asian male who was reported missing by family members several days ago. \n \n “The suspect and victim knew each other,” Montreal police Cmdr. Ian Lafrenière confirmed. He didn’t identify the victim. \n \n A source said the victim apparently attended the suspect’s apartment willingly. \n \n “I’ve been doing this job for close to 30 years now and I’ve never seen and never heard of something like this,” Lafrenière said. “It’s like watching a very bad movie. \n \n “It’s important to stay sensitive to these things. Some people might say ‘this happens’ in society. I don’t think so. It’s something very shocking.” \n \n The macabre discovery on Tuesday of a severed foot, delivered to the downtown Ottawa headquarters of the Conservative Party of Canada, set alight confusion and concern on Parliament Hill and made international headlines. \n \n Hours later, Ottawa police confirmed a hand had been found in a package at a Canada Post processing facility. It had apparently been addressed to the Liberal party headquarters. \n \n On Wednesday, the situation escalated as Montreal police said they believed the body parts belonged to the same victim. They asked for the public’s help in finding Magnotta. \n \n The suitcase was reportedly sitting in the rubbish pile since last Friday. The video was posted online on May 25. \n \n Videos from the Toronto Star. \n \n Police spent much of Tuesday combing through the grimy second-floor studio apartment where the torso was found. Its windows look on to a major Montreal expressway. \n \n A poster from the 1942 film Casablanca is visible from outside. The poster can also be seen in photos posted on the Internet appearing to feature Magnotta. \n \n Neighbours had reported a strong foul odour emanating from the studio. Inside, the bed sheets and mattress were soaked with blood. \n \n “There was blood all over the bed,” said building manager Eric Schorer, 59. \n \n There was also a pool of what appeared to be blood on the bottom shelf of the refrigerator. Traces were found too in the freezer. \n \n Inside the closet, a message scribbled in red ink reads: “If you don’t like the reflection, don’t look in the mirror. I don’t care.” \n \n Magnotta arrived in Montreal and rented the furnished apartment about four months ago for $490 a month, Schorer said. His rent was paid up to June 1. \n \n “He came from Toronto and wanted to start a job as a caregiver and to be closer to his child,” Schorer recalled. \n \n According to Schorer and other neighbours, Magnotta kept to himself, slept late into the day, going out in the late afternoon, perhaps to work. \n \n Neighbour Derek Mackinnon, 56, said Magnotta spoke to no other neighbours except himself, “maybe because I was gay too.” \n \n “He’s probably one of the coldest people you’ve ever met in your life,” Mackinnon said. \n \n Mackinnon, a former actor who starred in the 1980 horror film Terror Train, said Magnotta asked him how to make the transition from porn into legitimate acting. “He said his porn career was over.” \n \n He said he saw Magnotta bring home a male five nights ago, an unusual sight because he never previously saw the young man with anyone. He saw Magnotta leave the building the next morning wearing a red wig. “I thought, ‘What is going on with that?’ ” \n \n Mackinnon then began to cry, as he revealed that Magnotta had asked him to come to his apartment to see him, also five days ago. \n \n “I wonder,” he whispered, “if that could have been me.” \n \n The suspect legally changed his name in 2006. His birth name is Eric Clinton Newman. Police said he also goes by the pseudonym Vladimir Romanov. \n \n An online profile pegs him as a bisexual porn actor. He has been targeted as a cat torturer and killer by animal rights activists, who have posted horrific videos to support their accusations. In one, a cat is placed in a plastic bag and the air is sucked out with a vacuum. \n \n The suspect’s Facebook page lists a variety of heroes, from Madonna to Joseph Stalin. \n \n “There is such things as Monsters, Demons and Ghosts,” says a quote typed onto that page. “They live inside of us, and sometimes they win.” \n \n He also appears in an online blog posting about necrophilia. And a piece under Magnotta’s name posted in 2009 is titled, “How to Completely Disappear and Never Be Found.” \n \n “When making the decision to disappear, it is very important to understand that this is not a process that can be successfully accomplished overnight,” the article explains. \n \n Two top Conservative ministers denounced the posting of the body parts as a “criminal” act. \n \n “Bizarre and completely horrifying,” said Immigration Minister Jason Kenney, saying it was clearly a “completely disgusting criminal act.” \n \n Conservative Party spokesman Fred DeLorey said the package, when it arrived at headquarters on Tuesday, was brought to Jenni Byrne, a former senior adviser to Prime Minister Stephen Harper and the campaign manager in the 2011 election, “because it looked suspicious.” \n \n “It was opened. Ms. Byrne examined it, saw the blood and smelled the odour and made the decision to call police.” \n \n Delorey said that “staff are very upset and disturbed by what happened yesterday.” \n \n With files from Tonda MacCharles and Allan Woods \n \n ALSO FROM THE STAR: \n \n Who is Luka Rocco Magnotta? \n \n Body parts sent to Conservative party headquarters', 'View larger image Luka Rocco Magnotta is shown in a photo from the website www.luka-magnotta.com.

While both killer and victim lay naked, he dismembered the corpse and committed sexual and cannibalistic acts on it. \n \n That same person apparently videotaped the gory scene and posted it on the Internet. The video is now being reviewed by Montreal police, who are investigating a case that has shocked the country. \n \n A man by the name of Luka Rocco Magnotta is wanted in connection with a three-step crime: a killing, a dismemberment and a mailing of body parts to Ottawa. He is believed to be from Toronto and to have repeatedly used aliases and changed his name over the years. \n \n His new name, Luka Rocco Magnotta, has a prolific presence in the darkest corners of the Internet. For nearly two years, it has been notorious among animal-rights activists looking for a man who tortured and killed cats and posted videos of it online. \n \n He is also a low-budget porn actor. \n \n His online presence is much vaster, however, than bisexual porn videos.

His multiple identities were confusing enough that even police had to issue a second press release Wednesday after originally identifying him as ""Rocco Luka."" \n \n The geographic epicentre of their investigation is a grimy apartment building in Montreal\'s west end. \n \n Magnotta was renting Apartment 208 in the brick mid-rise, by the bustling Decarie Expressway. Behind that building, a man\'s torso was found Tuesday in a locked suitcase, buried in a pile of garbage. \n \n On the same day, a foot was found in a package opened at Conservative headquarters and a hand was found at an Ottawa postal warehouse -- the latter package addressed to the Liberal party. \n \n The building manager told The Canadian Press that Magnotta had been living there for about four months. In the manager\'s words, he seemed like a nice guy. \n \n Police in masks were combing through the blood-soaked apartment Wednesday, having zeroed in on that particular unit from which a rotten stench was drifting out, says a building resident. \n \n The neighbour said police were showing neighbours pictures of two men -- the suspected victim and the homicide suspect. \n \n The packages in Ottawa came from a common source. They carried parts from the same male victim, and they were both mailed from Montreal. \n \n Police shared a few new details about the case Wednesday. \n \n ""The suspect and victim knew each other,"" Montreal police Cmdr. Ian Lafreniere told reporters. ""It isn\'t linked to organized crime."" \n \n It apparently took a few days for anyone to find a body part. A resident in the building described the scene in the trash-filled laneway behind the complex. \n \n ""I saw the suitcase and I was tempted to go get it,"" said Richard Payette, 60. ""It didn\'t look too damaged. I said, \'Maybe I\'ll go down and get it.\' But I changed my mind."" \n \n The grisly discovery was made later, by someone else living nearby. \n \n Police were milling about the second-floor apartment Wednesday, where there were still traces of blood and, reportedly, still some body parts stored. Payette said the door of Apartment 208 was left open for part of the day, and the smell of rotten meat was drifting out into the hallway. \n \n The building manager said Magnotta had lived there for four months but hadn\'t been seen around in a while. He said there were never any complaints about noise in the unit, and that Magnotta passed a credit test to rent there. \n \n ""He seemed like a nice guy,"" said the manager, Eric Schorer. \n \n Police said Magnotta has no criminal record. \n \n What isn\'t clear is why body parts were mailed to Ottawa, including a foot received at the offices of the Conservative party and a hand found at a Canada Post warehouse. \n \n Finding him might not be easy. \n \n ""When making the decision to disappear, it is very important to understand that this is not a process that can be successfully accomplished overnight,"" said the online disappearance tips, penned under Magnotta\'s name. \n \n ""For best results under normal circumstances, a minimum of four months is really necessary to successfully carry out the heroic actions necessary to leave your old life behind. \n \n ""This is certainly not an undertaking to be entered into lightly.""', 'Montreal police say Luka Rocco Magnotta is wanted in a homicide investigation in connection to the delivery of a human foot to the Conservative Party of Canada headquarters in Ottawa, and body parts discovered in both cities. \n \n Police said Magnotta, 29, is wanted on a Canada-wide warrant and police are asking for the public\'s help to find him. \n \n Magnotta is also known as Eric Clinton Newman and as Vladimir Romanov.

112,"['Reuters \n \n The American Center for Law and Justice is suing a Maryland community college after a student was denied admittance into a program because he said God is the most important thing in his life. \n \n Brandon Jenkins, a prospective student in the radiation therapy program at the Community College of Baltimore County, exceeded the minimum requirements for entry into the program, but after completing his exam and interview process, he received a notice informing him that he was not selected for the fall 2013 term. \n \n When Jenkins followed up with members of the CCBC staff to find out why he was not being admitted into the program because he wanted to reapply the next term, he was told that among the reasons why he was not selected is because his chosen field is ""not the place for religion."" \n \n During his interview process with a five-person panel, Jenkins was asked: ""What is the most important thing to you?"" And he replied, ""My God."" \n \n But according to ACLJ, a Washington, D.C.â€“based organization that focuses on defending constitutional and human rights laws worldwide, this was the only time Jenkins commented on his belief in God. The ACLJ also noted that he only did so because he was responding to a question asked by one of the CCBC representatives. \n \n A federal lawsuit was filed Monday on Jenkins\' behalf by the ACLJ, which is asking that Jenkins be granted admission into the program, and that he be awarded damages related to the delay in his admission. \n \n After Jenkins requested feedback from the CCBC about his being denied admittance into the program, Adrienne Dougherty, director and coordinator of radiation therapy, told Jenkins: ""I understand that religion is a major part of your life and that was evident in your recommendation letters, however, this field is not the place for religion."" \n \n She continued, ""We have many patients who come to us for treatment from many different religions and some who believe in nothing at all. If you interview in the future, you may want to leave your thoughts and beliefs out of the interview process."" \n \n ACLJ Senior Counsel David French told The Christian Post Wednesday that Dougherty\'s statement to Jenkins is not only ""flatly illegal, but also bigoted."" He also noted that the ""college\'s own lawyer said that he (Jenkins) shouldn\'t wear his faith on his sleeve."" \n \n ""Under what circumstance would answering that God is the most important thing in his life mean that he would be unable to treat people from other religions or from no religion?"" French asked. ""That was an assumption on the college\'s part and had no basis on anything Jenkins said at any point during the interview process."" \n \n French told CP that in all the years he\'s been litigating religious liberty cases, he\'s never seen one like Jenkins,\' where the university specified an applicant\'s religion as being one of the reasons for denying admission. \n \n ""I\'ve been working on cases involving religious liberty on campus for a long time, and I can honestly say, I\'ve never seen it as blatant in the admissions process as you have here,"" he said. \n \n ""The problem is that you have a guy who is qualified in all areas, and in the rejection letter, they single out his faith as a reason for his rejection. That\'s just flatly unlawful,"" French asserted. ""It\'s every bit as unlawful as singling out his race, or singling out his gender. To single out his religion is just as unlawful, and it violates the Constitution."" \n \n French described Jenkins as a ""high-character individual,"" and noted that before he applied to the radiation therapy program, he was helping to run a halfway house, which is work that he continues to do today. \n \n ""He\'s a model citizen,"" he added. ""He\'s exactly the kind of student that community colleges exist to serve. Someone who\'s a productive member of society who wants to broaden their career skills."" \n \n French also emphasized his belief that the question posed to Jenkins â€“ ""What is most important in your life"" â€“ is not an academic question. ""It\'s not related to the radiation therapy program. They asked a question that went far beyond the bounds of the academic program itself, and they got an honest answer, from a Christian, about what\'s most important to him; and then they discriminated against him on that basis. It\'s absurd."" \n \n In the lawsuit that was filed in federal court earlier this week, the ACLJ is asking for an injunction against the university, for Jenkins to be admitted into the program, and for him to be paid damages for the unplanned expenses he incurred because he thought he was going to be a full-time student, but instead had to restart his business after learning his was denied admittance into the physical therapy program. \n \n French told CP that ACLJ sent a letter to the CCBC in an attempt to avoid a lawsuit, but instead, they ""doubled down"" on Jenkins\' Christianity being a disqualifier for admittance into the program. \n \n ""We didn\'t want to sue the college. We wanted the college to do the right thing and consider his application without reference to his faith. Not only did they reaffirm their decision to not admit him, but they doubled down on discussing his faith,"" he said. \n \n The other reasons Dougherty provided to Jenkins for denying his admission into the program included his 3.2 GPA being lower than other applicants; his statement that he preferred to work in Maryland as a radiation therapist instead of relocating to a different state; and one criminal charge on his record from 10 years ago, which they said could make it difficult for him to find employment.', ""Obama's Harvard law professor says 'President MUST be defeated in 2012' (even though he's the man Barack used to have on speed dial) \n \n \n \n Roberto Unger, 65, is respected author and Brazilian politician \n \n Taught Obama about 'reinventing democracy' at Harvard Law School \n \n \n \n Professor was an adviser during the 2008 election campaign \n \n \n \n A former professor of Barack Obama has turned against his one-time student and publicly urged voters not to re-elect him. \n \n \n \n Roberto Unger posted a video on YouTube detailing the reasons why he believes the President does not deserve a second term in the White House. \n \n \n \n Mr Unger, a prominent Brazilian politician and an adviser to Obama in 2008, said: 'President Obama must be defeated in the coming election.

113,"[""Italian Space Agency President Roberto Battiston holds a pamphlet reading in Italian 'Colonize Mars, Friday, Oct. 19, 2016, in front of a rendering showing the Schiaparelli Space Module and the planet... (Associated Press) \n \n BERLIN (AP) — Europe's experimental Mars probe hit the right spot — but at the wrong speed — likely ending up in a fiery ball of rocket fuel when it struck the surface at high speed, scientists said Friday. \n \n Pictures taken by NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter show a black spot in the area where the Schiaparelli lander was meant to touch down Wednesday, the European Space Agency said. The images end two days of speculation following the probe's unexpected radio silence 50 seconds before the planned landing. \n \n Schiaparelli was meant to test technology for a more ambitious European Mars landing in 2020, and scientists say the data it sent back before going silent will prove highly useful for that mission. ESA also stressed that Schiaparelli's mother ship was successfully placed into orbit Wednesday and will begin analyzing the Martian atmosphere in search for evidence of life. \n \n Still, the crash-landing is a painful reminder of how hard it is to put a spacecraft on the surface of the red planet. Europe's Beagle 2 probe reached the surface in 2003 but failed to deploy properly. Only NASA has repeatedly succeeded in landing several robotic vehicles on Mars, including the Opportunity and Curiosity rovers. \n \n ESA said that, according to what its scientists have been able to piece together so far, Schiaparelli suffered problems during the last 50 seconds of its descent through the harsh Martian atmosphere. \n \n Instead of achieving a soft landing it probably plummeted the last 2-4 kilometers (1.4-2.4 miles) onto the surface, therefore impacting at a considerable speed, greater than 300 kilometers (186 miles) per hour. \n \n The pictures taken by NASA suggest that the probe's thrusters — which were meant to slow its final descent — failed, causing it to hit the surface with almost fully loaded tanks of rocket fuel and explode on impact. \n \n While Schiaparelli was able to beam back some 600 megabytes of data before the crash, scientists won't get any of the close-up photos the probe took during its descent. Those were meant to be transmitted after the landing. \n \n ___ \n \n ExoMars mission: http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/ExoMars"", 'Michael Horn admits carmaker was dishonest with US regulators as France calls for Europe-wide inquiry into emissions-fixing scandal \n \n The US chief executive of Volkswagen has said the company has “totally screwed up” over the emissions scandal that has rocked the automotive industry. \n \n \n \n Michael Horn admitted at an event in Brooklyn, New York, on Monday night that VW had been dishonest with regulators and the public. \n \n VW scandal: what the emissions revelations mean Read more \n \n The world’s second-biggest carmaker could face a fine of up to $18bn (£11.6bn), criminal charges for its executives, and legal action from customers and shareholders due to US claims it used a defeat device to falsify emissions data. The device recognises when the car is being tested and immediately cuts emissions to a level that is much lower than normal and unsustainable under usual driving conditions. \n \n Shares in Volkswagen fell by another 5% on Tuesday after losing almost a fifth of their value on Monday. \n \n \n \n In further developments, France’s finance minister called for a “Europe-wide” investigation into diesel cars to “reassure” the public. \n \n Michel Sapin told French radio: “This is not a minor subject, it’s not about speed or the quality of leather. What we are dealing with is making sure people avoid being poisoned by pollution.” \n \n South Korea said on Tuesday it would investigate emissions of the VW Jetta and Gold models plus Audi A3 cars produced in 2014 and 2015. If problems are found, South Korea’s environment ministry said its inquiry could be expanded to all German diesel imports, which have surged in popularity in recent years in a market long dominated by local producers such as Hyundai. \n \n VW scandal must change how we think about transport and the environment | Letters Read more \n \n The US Congress also confirmed it is investigating the scandal. The House energy and commerce committee chairman, Fred Upton, and the oversight and investigations subcommittee chairman, Tim Murphy, announced that the oversight and investigations subcommittee will hold a hearing. \n \n In addition, the US Department of Justice could conduct a criminal investigation into Volkswagen. \n \n Horn, speaking at an event to launch a new version of the Passat sedan, which featured rock star Lenny Kravitz, said: “Our company was dishonest with the EPA, and the California air resources board and with all of you, and in my German words: we have totally screwed up. \n \n “We must fix the cars to prevent this from ever happening again and we have to make this right. This kind of behaviour is totally inconsistent with our qualities. \n \n “We are committed to do what must be done and to begin to restore your trust. We will pay what we have to pay.” \n \n The comments from Horn are the first in public by a senior VW executive since the scandal emerged, although the company apologised on Sunday. He left the event without taking questions. \n \n One of the officials involved in uncovering the alleged behaviour has told the Guardian that the emissions-fixing scandal could extend to other companies and countries. \n \n Billions of pounds have been wiped off the value of global carmakers amid growing concerns that emissions tests may have been rigged across the industry. \n \n \n \n “We need to ask the question, is this happening in other countries and is this happening at other manufacturers? Some part of our reaction is not even understanding what has happened exactly,” said John German, one of the two co-leads on the US team of the International Council for Clean Transportation (ICCT), the European-based NGO that raised the alarm. \n \n The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said on Friday that VW had installed illegal software to cheat emission tests, allowing its diesel cars to produce up to 40 times more pollution than allowed. The US government ordered VW to recall 482,000 VW and Audi cars produced since 2009. \n \n \n \n In response, Martin Winterkorn, chief executive of VW, said in a statement on Sunday he was “deeply sorry” for breaking the trust of the public and ordered an external investigation. \n \n A British expert in low-emission vehicles claimed the manipulation of air pollution data could be widespread and that tests in Europe are “much more open to this sort of abuse”. \n \n \n \n Greg Archer, a former government adviser and head of clean vehicles at the respected Transport & Environment thinktank, said: “I am not surprised. There has been a lot of anecdotal evidence about carmakers using these defeat devices. All credit to the EPA for investigating and finding the truth.” \n \n Archer, the former managing director of the UK’s Low Carbon Vehicle Partnership and non-executive director for the government’s Renewable Fuels Agency, said the scandal could spread into petrol cars and CO2 levels. “It is probably not limited to diesel and not limited to emissions,” he added. \n \n The devices are thought to work by injecting more urea – an exhaust fluid – into the car when it is being tested. This limits nitrogen oxide emissions to a fraction of their usual level. The car detects it is being tested because devices such as the anti-collision systems have to be turned off when it is in the laboratory. The extra urea is not injected into the car when it is on the road because it would quickly run out. \n \n Archer claims European tests are more open to abuse because they are conducted before the car goes into mass production and by companies that have been paid by the carmakers. These testing companies have been verified by regulators in each country, such as the Vehicle Certification Agency, but in the US the tests are conducted by an independent body. \n \n \n \n Industry leaders in Britain claimed there was no evidence that manufacturers are cheating the system in Europe but admitted it needs to be reformed. \n \n Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, the industry trade body, said: “The EU operates a fundamentally different system to the US – with all European tests performed in strict conditions as required by EU law and witnessed by a government-appointed independent approval agency. There is no evidence that manufacturers cheat the cycle. \n \n “The industry acknowledges, however, that the current test method is outdated and is seeking agreement from the European commission for a new emissions test that embraces new testing technologies and is more representative of on-road conditions.” \n \n The US allegations involve a series of diesel cars produced by VW and the brands it owns, such as Audi. These include the Audi A3, VW Jetta, Beetle, Golf and Passat models. VW has halted sales of these models.']",2,"– Get ready for a deluge of information in the Trayvon Martin/George Zimmerman case, as prosecutors today released a cache of related documents.

114,"['“Let it be an arms race … we will outmatch them at every pass and outlast them all,” President-elect Donald Trump told MSNBC’s “Morning Joe."" | AP Photo Trump threatens to upend U.S. nuclear weapons policy \'We will outmatch them at every pass and outlast them all,\' Trump says. \n \n In a series of impromptu statements about nuclear weapons, Donald Trump is threatening to upend longstanding U.S. nonproliferation policy, even as his advisers contradict him and muddy his intentions. \n \n The president-elect had alarmed and perplexed some experts and others in Washington when he pronounced, without offering more details, via Twitter on Thursday that the U.S. “must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes.” \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n He further escalated his call on Friday, telling the MSNBC program “Morning Joe” that he is fine with the country taking part in an “arms race” if it puts the U.S. in a stronger position against foreign adversaries. \n \n “Let it be an arms race … we will outmatch them at every pass and outlast them all,” Trump said in an off-air conversation on Friday. \n \n After the remark was reported on MSNBC, though, incoming Trump press secretary Sean Spicer pushed back and insisted that the remarks came from a “private conversation” with “Morning Joe” host Mika Brzezinski. While he told the “Today” Show’s Matt Lauer that “there is not going to be” an arms race, he told CNN that Trump is not going to “take anything off the table,” either. \n \n It remains unclear where the president-elect stands, but given longstanding bipartisan support for preventing nuclear escalation, if followed through Trump’s statements would represent an extraordinary shift in how the U.S. approaches the role of weapons of mass destruction in its own defenses and throughout the world. President Barack Obama has advanced a vision of “America\'s commitment to seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons.” \n \n At first, after his Thursday tweet, Trump’s own supporters had tried to downplay what it meant. It was unclear, for example, whether Trump was advocating the U.S. increasing the size of its nuclear arsenal, which would be a major change, or if he was speaking of modernizing it. Such a suggestion would be in line with ongoing efforts and not necessarily controversial. \n \n Kellyanne Conway, Trump’s former campaign manager who was recently named incoming counselor to the president, told an irate Rachel Maddow on Thursday night that Trump may have meant the latter. Regardless, Conway insisted during the heated exchange on MSNBC, the tweet did not necessarily represent a policy change, but Trump “talking about keeping us safe and secure.” \n \n “There are a lot of people hiding under the bed right now because it doesn’t seem like he knows what he’s talking about on this issue,” Maddow said. \n \n “That’s not fair,” Conway responded, later adding, “He’s not making policy on Twitter. … Again, perhaps he is also echoing what President Obama himself has tried to do here, which is get upgrades to our nuclear systems.” \n \n Jason Miller, a Trump spokesman, had also said on Thursday that the president-elect was talking about expanding nonproliferation efforts, not stoking an arms race. \n \n ""President-elect Trump was referring to the threat of nuclear proliferation and the critical need to prevent it — particularly to and among terrorist organizations and unstable and rogue regimes,"" Miller said in a statement. ""He has also emphasized the need to improve and modernize our deterrent capability as a vital way to pursue peace through strength.” \n \n Trump’s comments Friday, of course, seemed to directly contradict that. \n \n The controversy started after Russian President Vladimir Putin called on his country to “strengthen” its nuclear forces. “We need to strengthen the military potential of strategic nuclear forces, especially with missile complexes that can reliably penetrate any existing and prospective missile defense systems,” he said earlier this week, according to multiple news reports. \n \n But Putin at an annual news conference on Friday said Russia has no interest in a nuclear arms race and seemed to normalize Trump’s statements, calling his tweet unsurprising. \n \n “Of course the U.S. has more missiles, submarines and aircraft carriers, but what we say is that we are stronger than any aggressor, and this is the case,” Putin said, adding, “As for Donald Trump, there is nothing new about it, during his elections campaign he said the U.S. needs to bolster its nuclear capabilities and its armed forces in general.” \n \n During the election season, Trump made contradictory statements about nuclear proliferation. He suggested that some countries — including Japan, South Korea and Saudi Arabia — should be allowed to develop them, despite efforts to prevent more countries from doing so. But he also told The New York Times in March that “it’s a very scary nuclear world.” \n \n “Biggest problem, to me, in the world, is nuclear, and proliferation,” Trump said at the time. \n \n Trump’s more recent comments about expanding America’s nuclear capability go against decades of policy to reduce the stockpile of nuclear warheads and could potentially violate an arms control treaty with Russia. The U.S. has a stockpile of roughly 4,500 nuclear warheads and nearly 1,500 deployed warheads (Russia’s armaments are nearly identical, as both nations account for more than 90 percent of the world’s nuclear warheads). \n \n The U.S. and Russia are due to meet nuclear reduction targets by February 2018 under the New START Treaty, which can be extended for another five years in 2021. \n \n Experts remain confused and in some cases unnerved by the nature of Trump’s foray into the nuclear weapons discussion. On Thursday, John Tierney, a former Democratic congressman and current executive director of the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, presented Trump’s tweet as perilous. \n \n “It is dangerous for the President-elect to use just 140 characters and announce a major change in U.S. nuclear weapons policy, which is nuanced, complex, and affects every single person on this planet,” he said in a statement, warning that an expansion threatens a nuclear arms race. \n \n “The potential consequences of changing U.S. nuclear weapons policy so drastically are simply unimaginable,” he warned. “Current plans already call for spending $1 trillion over the next three decades to modernize and maintain the U.S. nuclear arsenal, which the Pentagon has expressed concern about being able to afford. The President-elect will have to explain why any increase is necessary both financially and strategically.” \n \n Joseph Cirincione, the president of the global security foundation Ploughshares Fund and a nuclear weapons expert, called Trump\'s actions “bizarre, unprecedented and completely out of bounds behavior for a president-elect.” \n \n Incoming presidents usually wait until they take office to make pronouncements on a topic like nuclear policy, Cirincione said. Beyond that, he said he is alarmed by the cavalier attitude Trump seems to have toward as enormously sensitive an issue as weapons of mass destruction. While Trump might see Twitter as a means to convey strength to his constituents at home, Cirincione said, “the rest of the world is watching,” and other countries could respond with actions of their own. \n \n “You can’t use Twitter to make nuclear policy,” Cirincione said. “Look, you should at least wait until you’re president. But this is why — this kind of view that he’s breaking with convention, he wants to shake things up, I understand that, but not on nuclear policy. There are reasons why people spend days crafting the language of nuclear policy.” \n \n “These things can be very complicated,” he continued, “and every word matters.”', 'This is probably not the first day on the job that Sean Spicer imagined it would be. \n \n Already he has done a merry-go-round of morning show appearances since it was announced Thursday that he will serve as our nation’s next White House Press Secretary, set to take office with the Trump administration next month. However, his first day is off to an, uhh, let’s call it interesting start; during an off-air conversation this morning with Mika Brzezinski of MSNBC, the President-elect surprisingly said of nuclear proliferation, “Let it be an arms race, we will outmatch them at every pass. And outlast them all.” \n \n Spicer a half hour later told TODAY’s Matt Lauer, “There is not going to be” an arms race, forced to clarify Trump’s comments that the MSNBC morning show reported on earlier in the day. \n \n Then, remarkably, an hour later on CNN’s New Day, Spicer shrugged off the Brzezinski report altogether; during his interview with Alisyn Camerota, Spicer sheepishly admitted, “That was a private conversation. I was not privy to that.” He promptly shifted the focus of his response, telling the CNN anchor, “He is somebody who gets things done,” discussing the recent conversations over Carrier jobs in Indianapolis. \n \n What’s unclear is if Trump’s comments to Brzezinski, then, were ever intended to be reported on, or if they were — as Spicer alleged on New Day — just a private comment made over the phone. Although Spicer himself appeared on Morning Joe earlier in the day, during a commercial break he spoke on the phone with Mr. President-elect who was then handed over to Brzezinski. It was then that he reportedly made his comment, “Let it be an arms race,” which the MSNBC anchor promptly reported on as breaking news when the show came back on air. Morning Joe ran “BREAKING NEWS” chyrons about the ‘arms race’ admission throughout the rest of the program. \n \n We have reached out to MSNBC for comment. Watch Spicer’s comment to CNN above. \n \n UPDATE 9:22 a.m. EST: A MSNBC spokesperson has confirmed to Mediaite that Trump’s comments to Brzezinski were reportable. \n \n — \n \n [image vis screengrab] \n \n Have a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com', 'TRUMP: Well you see, I don’t know that, you know, when I talk about unpredictability, I’m not sure that we should be talking about me – On the assumption that I’m doing well, which I am, and that I may be in that position, I’m not sure that I would want to be talking about that. You understand what I mean by that, David. We’re so open, we’re so, “Oh I wouldn’t do this, I wouldn’t do that, I would do this, I would do that.” And it’s not so much with Merkel, but it’s certainly with other countries. You know, that really, where there’s, where there’s a different kind of relationship, and a much worse relationship than with Germany. So, you know there’s so, there’s such predictability with our country. We go and we send 50 soldiers over to the Middle East and President Obama gets up and announces that we’re sending 50 soldiers to the Middle East. Fifty very special soldiers. And they now have a target on their back, and everything we do, we announce, instead of winning, and announcing when it’s all over. There’s such, total predictability of this country, and it’s one of the reasons we do so poorly. You know, I’d rather not say that. I would like to see what they’re doing. Because you know, many countries, I can’t say Germany, but many countries are spying on us. I think that was a great disservice done by Edward Snowden. That I can tell you. \n \n How to Defeat ISIS \n \n HABERMAN: Mr. Trump, you have talked about your plans to defeat ISIS, and how you would approach it. Would you be willing to stop buying oil from the Saudis if they’re unwilling to go in and help? \n \n SANGER: On the ground? \n \n TRUMP: Oh yeah, sure. I would do that. The beautiful thing about oil is that, you know, we’re really getting close, because of fracking, and because of new technology, we’re really in a position that we weren’t in, you know, years ago, and the reason we’re in the Middle East is for oil. And all of a sudden we’re finding out that there’s less reason to be. Now, now, we’re in the Middle East for really defense, because we can’t allow them, I mean, look, I was against the war in Iraq. I thought it would destabilize the Middle East, and it has destabilized it, it’s totally destabilized the Middle East. The way Obama got out of the war was, you know, disgraceful, and idiotic. When he announced the date certain, they pulled back, and they said, “Oh, well.” As much as they don’t mind dying, they do mind dying. And they pulled back, and then, you know, it’s a, it was a terrible thing the way he announced that, and then he didn’t leave troops behind so that, you know, whatever there was of Iraq, which in my opinion wasn’t very much, because I think that, you know, the government was totally corrupt, and they put the wrong people in charge, and you know, that in its own way led to the formation of ISIS, because they weren’t given their due. But, I think that President Obama, the way he got out of that war was unbelievable. I think Hillary Clinton was catastrophic in those decisions, having to do with Libya and just about everything else. Every bad decision that you could make in the Middle East was made. And now if you look at it, if you would go back 15 years ago, and I’m not saying it was only Obama, It was Obama’s getting out, it was other people’s getting in, but you go back 15 years ago, and I say this, if our presidents would have just gone to the beach and enjoyed the ocean and the sun, we would’ve been much better off in the Middle East, than all of this tremendous death, destruction, and you know, monetary loss, it’s just incredible. ’Cause we’re further, we’re far worse off today than we were 15 years ago or 10 years ago in the Middle East. Far worse. \n \n SANGER: But I just want to make sure I understand your answer to Maggie’s question. So you said earlier this week that we should use air power but not send in ground forces. That had to be done by the regional Arab partners. We assume by that, you mean the Saudis, the U.A.E. and others from whom we might purchase oil or have alliances. I think Maggie’s question, if I understood it right, was if these countries are unwilling to send in ground troops against ISIS, and so far they have been, despite President Obama’s efforts to get them in, would you be willing to say, “We will stop buying oil from you, until you send ground troops?” \n \n TRUMP: There’s two answers to that. The answer is, probably yes, but I would also say this: We are not being reimbursed for our protection of many of the countries that you’ll be talking about, that, including Saudi Arabia. You know, Saudi Arabia, for a period of time, now the oil has gone down, but still the numbers are phenomenal, and the amount of money they have is phenomenal. But we protect countries, and take tremendous monetary hits on protecting countries. That would include Saudi Arabia, but it would include many other countries, as you know. We have, there’s a whole big list of them. We lose, everywhere. We lose monetarily, everywhere. And yet, without us, Saudi Arabia wouldn’t exist for very long. It would be, you know, a catastrophic failure without our protection. And I’m trying to figure out, why is it that we aren’t going in and saying, at a minimum, at a minimum it’s a two-part question, with respect to Maggie’s question. But why aren’t we going in and saying, “At a minimum, I’m sorry folks, but you have to, under no circumstances can we continue to do this.” You know, we needed, we needed oil desperately years ago. Today, because – again, because of the new technologies, and because of places that we never thought had oil, and they do have oil, and there’s a glut on the market, there’s a tremendous glut on the market, I mean you have ships out at sea that are loaded up and they don’t even know where to go dump it. But we don’t have that same pressure anymore, at all. And we shouldn’t have that for a long period of time, because there’s so many places. I mean, they’re closing wells all over the place. So, I would say this, I would say at a minimum, we have to be reimbursed, substantially reimbursed, I mean, to a point that’s far greater than what we’re being paid right now. Because we’re not being reimbursed for the kind of tremendous service that we’re performing by protecting various countries. Now Saudi Arabia’s one of them. I think if Saudi Arabia was without the cloak of American protection of our country’s, of U.S. protection, think of Saudi Arabia. I don’t think it would be around. It would be, whether it was internal or external, it wouldn’t be around for very long. And they’re a money machine, they’re a monetary machine, and yet they don’t reimburse us the way we should be reimbursed. So that’s a real problem. And frankly, I think it’s a real, in terms of bringing our country back, because our country’s a poor country. Our country is a debtor nation, we’re a debtor nation. I mean, we owe trillions of dollars to people that are buying our bonds, in the form of other countries. You look at China, where we owe them $1.7 trillion, you have Japan, $1.5 trillion. We’re a debtor nation. We can’t be a debtor nation. I don’t want to be a debtor nation. I want it to be the other way. One of the reasons we’re a debtor nation, we spend so much on the military, but the military isn’t for us. The military is to be policeman for other countries. And to watch over other countries. And there comes a point that, and many of these countries are tremendously rich countries. Not powerful countries, but – in some cases they are powerful – but rich countries. \n \n SANGER: One more along the lines of your ISIS strategy. You’ve seen the current strategy, which is, you’ve seen Secretary Kerry trying to seek a political accord between President Assad and the rebel forces, with Assad eventually leaving. And then the hope is to turn all those forces, including Russia and Iran, against ISIS. Is that the right way to do it? Do you have an alternative approach? \n \n TRUMP: Well, I thought the approach of fighting Assad and ISIS simultaneously was madness, and idiocy. They’re fighting each other and yet we’re fighting both of them. You know, we were fighting both of them. I think that our far bigger problem than Assad is ISIS, I’ve always felt that. Assad is, you know I’m not saying Assad is a good man, ’cause he’s not, but our far greater problem is not Assad, it’s ISIS.', 'A Russian Topol-M intercontinental ballistic missile with a range of some 11,000 kilometres (6,800 miles) and capable of carrying a warhead of up to one megaton, the equivalent of one million tons of TNT explosive (AFP Photo/DMITRY KOSTYUKOV) \n \n Moscow (AFP) - Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday called for the country to reinforce its military nuclear potential and praised the army\'s performance in its Syria campaign. \n \n In a speech that recapped military activities in 2016, Putin said the army\'s preparedness has ""considerably increased"" and called for continued improvement that would ensure it can ""neutralise any military threat"". \n \n ""We need to strengthen the military potential of strategic nuclear forces, especially with missile complexes that can reliably penetrate any existing and prospective missile defence systems,"" the Kremlin strongman said. \n \n ""We must carefully monitor any changes in the balance of power and in the political-military situation in the world, especially along Russian borders, and quickly adapt plans for neutralising threats to our country."" \n \n He said Russia\'s military had successfully demonstrated its capabilities in Syria, showcased its technology to potential arms buyers and helped the Syrian army make considerable advances. \n \n ""The Syrian army received considerable support, thanks to which it carried out several successful operations against militants,"" he said. \n \n ""The effective use of Russian weapons in Syria opens new possibilities for military-technical cooperation. \n \n ""We must take maximum advantage of this.

115,"['Trump picks Perry to lead Energy Department he once vowed to kill Conservatives view Perry as someone with management experience who would be willing to question the agency’s status quo. \n \n On a presidential debate stage five years ago, Rick Perry blanked on the Energy Department\'s name when trying to include it in a list of agencies he promised to abolish — memorably concluding with ""oops."" \n \n Now Donald Trump has chosen the former Texas governor to lead the sprawling department, which oversees the security of the nation\'s nuclear weapons and has played major roles in President Barack Obama\'s climate agenda and nuclear deal with Iran. Three sources close to the transition confirmed the choice Tuesday. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n Conservatives had favored the former Texas governor for the job, viewing him as someone with management experience who would be willing to question the agency’s status quo. They believe Perry might bring serious reform to the agency because he isn\'t wedded to energy programs, such as DOE\'s fossil and efficiency offices, that conservatives have criticized as unnecessary, market-distorting schemes. \n \n Trump\'s choice of his fellow climate skeptic and former 2016 presidential primary rival comes just a year and a half after Perry described the brash New Yorker as a “cancer on conservatism.” It also arrives at a time of heightened political pressure for DOE, which has a $29.6 billion budget and more than 100,000 federal employees and contractors sprawled around the country. \n \n The conservative Heritage Foundation last month urged the next president to eliminate vast swaths of the department, including all the research, development, regulatory and loan programs that the Obama administration has used to drive advances in green energy, as well as its 700-million-barrel Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And last week, Trump\'s transition team asked DOE to supply the names of all agency employees who had worked on Obama\'s climate initiatives, a request that Democrats and former staffers denounced as a ""witch hunt."" \n \n A Trump spokesman, when asked Tuesday whether the incoming president planned to dismantle the agency in its current form, declined to rule it out. \n \n ""We haven\'t made any comments or plans as far as specific agencies. The one thing we\'ve seen from the president-elect so far is he won\'t be shy calling out -- whether it\'s taxpayer fraud or abuse or certain deals put together that aren\'t doing right by the taxpayers,"" Trump spokesman Jason Miller told reporters. \n \n Perry, the longest-serving governor in Texas history, also had the Energy Department in his sights during the 2012 presidential campaign, when he called for eliminating it as part of his program to shrink the federal government. \n \n That was the origin of Perry’s “oops” moment in November 2011, when he said during a Republican debate that “it’s three agencies of government when I get there that are gone: Commerce, Education and the, uh, uh, what’s the third one there, let’s see?” Pressed on whether he could name the third agency, he confessed: “I can’t. Sorry.” \n \n Perry later said the third agency would have been the Energy Department. \n \n That memory hiccup seemed to be the least of his worries in appealing to Trump, whom he had scorched during his short-lived second bid for the GOP presidential nomination last year. Besides likening Trump to cancer in July 2015, Perry called the New Yorker\'s campaign “a toxic mix of demagoguery, mean-spiritedness and nonsense that will lead the Republican Party to perdition if pursued” — a rhetorical assault arguably harsher than the later salt-the-earth attacks that Mitt Romney launched on the GOP nominee. \n \n By May, however, Perry endorsed Trump saying, ""He wasn\'t my first choice, wasn\'t my second choice, but he is the people\'s choice."" \n \n Perry, a former Air Force captain, made at least two visits to Trump Tower in recent weeks, which kicked off speculation that he was angling for a national security-related post, such as secretary of Defense. He also met with Trump at the Army-Navy football game in Baltimore on Saturday and visited the Tower on Monday. \n \n He also went to bat for Trump when the real estate mogul drew criticism for going after Khizr Khan, the father of a fallen U.S. soldier, who had delivered a scathing rebuke at the Democratic National Convention this summer. The elder Khan then continued to assail the Republican nominee on television. \n \n “Mr. Khan is the one that went out and struck the first blow,” said Perry in August. “And in a campaign, if you\'re going to go out and think you can take a shot at someone and not have incoming coming back at you, shame on you.” \n \n Perry was once a Democrat and even served as Al Gore\'s state chairman during the 1988 presidential campaign — a fact Perry found himself defending during his first White House run. “This was Al Gore before he invented the internet and got to be Mr. Global Warming,” Perry told an Iowa radio station in August 2011. (Gore’s later rejoinder: ""I don\'t know what has happened to him since then."") \n \n After leaving the governor\'s office in 2015, Perry landed a job as chief strategy officer at MCNA Dental, a dental insurance company that had been a major donor to his presidential campaign. Early this year he ran afoul of a Florida ethics law by failing to register as a lobbyist before meeting with Gov. Rick Scott to discuss MCNA\'s role in the state’s Medicaid program, as POLITICO reported at the time. \n \n Rep. Frank Pallone, the top Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said Perry\'s expected nomination ""defies all logic,"" citing the former governor\'s previous interest in dismantling the agency. \n \n The New Jersey lawmaker, who won\'t get to vote on Perry\'s nomination, also zinged the incoming DOE chief for his reality show adventure earlier this year: ""It is also deeply unsettling that our current Secretary of Energy, a renowned nuclear physicist, could be succeeded by a contestant on Dancing with the Stars. Governor Perry is simply not qualified for this position and should be rejected.” \n \n ""Dancing with the Stars"" began trending on Twitter Tuesday morning. \n \n By taking charge of the Energy Department, Perry would be leading an agency often slighted by presidents — for many presidents-elect, including Trump, it\'s among the last Cabinet posts to be filled — despite its significant national security footprint. While the agency writes efficiency regulations, runs energy research programs and funds basic science, it’s also the overlooked guardian and caretaker of the nation’s nuclear weapons stockpile. \n \n DOE and its network of national labs also played an integral part in the Obama administration’s formulation and defense of last year’s Iran nuclear deal. It has also issued billions of dollars in loans and loan guarantees for green-energy projects backed by companies like Tesla and Google, helping foster a boom in projects such as large wind farms and utility-scale solar power installations — although Republicans have preferred to focus on its $535 million loan guarantee to the failed solar manufacturer Solyndra. The much-maligned program, overall, is now a net profit for the federal government, although many conservatives believe such projects should be left to the private sector on principle. \n \n Nuclear weapons maintenance and Cold War nuclear waste cleanup projects consume about two-thirds of DOE’s budget every year, and Perry is likely to be paired with a deputy energy secretary with a greater expertise in those areas. In addition, lawmakers are expected to restart the long-stalled nuclear waste project underneath Yucca Mountain, Nev. — long bottled up by opposition from retiring Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid — putting the issue back on DOE’s agenda. \n \n During Perry’s White House campaigns he repeatedly called for “energy independence,” along with a rollback of regulations coming out the Interior Department and the EPA. \n \n The oil business is a home state industry for Perry, and he\'s on the board of directors for Energy Transfer Partners, the developers of the controversial Dakota Access pipeline, which would ship as much as 570,000 barrels a day of oil from the shale fields of North Dakota across four states. That $3.7 billion project — the target of months of heated protests — experienced a setback earlier this month when the Army Corp of Engineers announced that it would study alternative routes for the pipeline. \n \n According to disclosures with the SEC, Perry received nearly $237,000 in cash and shares from the company last year. While DOE doesn\'t have a direct responsibility for pipeline projects, Perry likely will have to step down from the board and sell any stock he might have in the company should be get confirmed. \n \n Almost anyone Trump selected for DOE was expected to shift away from the Obama administration’s emphasis on addressing climate change, and Perry fits the bill. Where Trump has called climate change a “hoax,” Perry has gone even further by alleging a profit motive, asserting that “a substantial number of scientists ... have manipulated data so that they will have dollars rolling into their projects.” \n \n While the levers of energy regulation are limited at DOE when compared to agencies like EPA, Perry could slow-walk the department’s appliance efficiency mandates and de-emphasize its research on climate science. Those efficiency regulations account for half of the greenhouse gas reduction targets that Obama made part of his Climate Action Plan in 2013. And there\'s no undoing them in one fell swoop: Dozens of rulemakings are involved and would require a massive, years-long effort to go after them one by one. \n \n Renewable energy research at DOE may also take a hit under Perry, even though he presided over a massive boom in Texas’ wind power production fueled by federal incentives — enough that the state’s been looking to sell its excess power across the border into Mexico. \n \n The Heritage Foundation has urged the incoming Trump administration to go even further, saying the next secretary should take an ax to much of the department to “end the destructive role played by the federal government in the energy sector.” \n \n Although many in Congress, including Republicans, would resist overhauling too much of the agency, a Heritage “blueprint” released last month said DOE should eliminate all spending on research, development and commercialization of energy technologies, and put the private sector in charge of managing nuclear waste. It went on to call for getting rid of its programs on green energy, efficiency and energy reliability, and revoking Obama’s mandates that federal agencies get more of their electricity from renewable sources. \n \n The conservative group also said the department should draw down and sell all the oil in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the stockpile that the government has held for decades to guard against foreign-driven shocks to the global oil markets. “Eliminating the government-controlled stockpile will reveal that private inventories and reserves are sufficient to meet U.S. needs, and private markets will respond more efficiently to supply shocks,” the group said.', 'Image copyright AP Image caption Rick Perry at Trump Tower \n \n Donald Trump has picked ex-Texas Governor Rick Perry as his energy secretary, a department whose name he famously forgot in a TV debate. \n \n The nomination puts Mr Perry in charge of an agency he proposed abolishing in a failed 2012 White House bid. \n \n Environmental groups called the oil-drilling advocate\'s selection ""an insult to our functioning democracy"". \n \n In the role, the recent Dancing with the Stars contestant would oversee America\'s nuclear arsenal. \n \n Trump appoints another military veteran \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption \'Oops\': Rick Perry\'s debate disaster \n \n Mr Trump said in a statement: ""As the governor of Texas, Rick Perry created a business climate that produced millions of new jobs and lower energy prices in his state, and he will bring that same approach to our entire country as secretary of energy."" \n \n If confirmed by the Senate, green activists fear Mr Perry will shift the department away from renewable energy and towards fossil fuels. \n \n During 14 years as governor, he called for lighter regulation of the oil industry, and referred to the science around climate change as ""unsettled"". \n \n Mr Perry is on the board of directors at Energy Transfer Partners, the company building the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota. \n \n Accepting the nomination, Mr Perry said: ""I look forward to engaging in a conversation about the development, stewardship and regulation of our energy resources, safeguarding our nuclear arsenal, and promoting an American energy policy that creates jobs and puts America first."" \n \n Image copyright ABC Image caption Mr Perry was the second contestant eliminated on this season\'s Dancing with the Stars \n \n He was briefly frontrunner in a previous Republican White House race until a disastrous brain freeze on live television. \n \n During the November 2011 forum, Mr Perry vowed to ditch three cabinet-level departments if elected. \n \n After mentioning the departments of Commerce and Education, he said: ""I can\'t.

Here's what you need to know about him. (Bastien Inzaurralde,Julio Negron,Osman Malik/The Washington Post) \n \n President-elect Donald Trump picked Rick Perry to head the Energy Department on Wednesday, seeking to put the former Texas governor in control of an agency whose name he forgot during a presidential debate even as he vowed to abolish it. \n \n Perry, who ran for president in the past two election cycles, is likely to shift the department away from renewable energy and toward fossil fuels, whose production he championed while serving as governor for 14 years. \n \n His nomination — announced officially by Trump’s transition team a day after sources leaked the decision — stirred further alarm from environmental groups and others worried that the Trump administration will roll back efforts to expand renewable energy and give a powerful platform for officials questioning the scientific consensus on climate change. \n \n The Energy Department was central to the 2011 gaffe that helped end his first presidential bid. Declaring that he wanted to eliminate three federal agencies during a primary debate in Michigan, Perry then froze after mentioning the Commerce and Education departments. “The third one, I can’t. Sorry. Oops.” \n \n [Trump taps Montana congressman Ryan Zinke, who frequently votes against environmentalists, as Interior secretary] \n \n Later during the debate, Perry offered: “By the way, that was the Department of Energy I was reaching for a while ago.” \n \n Speaking to reporters once the event was over, he said, “The bottom line is I may have forgotten energy, but I haven’t forgotten my conservative principles, and that’s what this campaign is really going to be about.” \n \n Despite its name, most of the Energy Department’s budget is devoted to maintaining the nation’s stockpile of nuclear warheads and to cleaning up nuclear waste at sites left by military weapons programs. The department runs the nation’s national laboratories, sets appliance standards and hands out grants and loan guarantees for basic research, solar cells, capturing carbon dioxide from coal combustion and more. \n \n Four years after his first Oval Office bid, the former governor sought it once again in the big Republican field that included Trump. Perry touted the high rate of job growth and the low tax rate his state enjoyed under his leadership. At one point, he dismissed Trump’s campaign as a “barking carnival act.” \n \n [What Rick Perry’s wink says about his own art of the deal] \n \n The child of a cotton farmer and county commissioner from west Texas, Perry immersed himself in politics from a young age. He was elected as a Democrat to the state legislature but switched to the GOP when he ran for Texas agriculture commissioner. \n \n As governor, he recruited out-of-state firms to Texas. In 2013, he starred in an ad that aired in California in which he declared that companies should visit his home state “and see why our low taxes, sensible regulations and fair legal system are just the thing to get your business moving. To Texas.” \n \n Salo Zelermyer, who served as a senior counsel at the Energy Department’s general counsel’s office under President George W. Bush and is now a partner at the Bracewell law firm, said Perry has proven “it is indeed possible to successfully balance appropriate environmental regulations with domestic energy production and use.” \n \n “During his time in office, Perry embodied the type of ‘all of the above’ approach to U.S. energy production that many have advocated on both sides of the aisle,” Zelermyer said. “Rick Perry’s Texas was not only a world leader in oil and gas production; it was also a global leader in wind power and renewable energy investment. This approach is a big reason Texas experienced such enormous job growth during Perry’s tenure.” \n \n [Trump says ‘nobody really knows’ if climate change is real] \n \n But environmentalists take a dim view of Perry. The former governor has repeatedly questioned scientific findings that human activity is helping drive climate change. In 2011 during a presidential debate, he compared the minority of scientists who challenged this assumption to 17th-century astronomer Galileo, who was persecuted by the Catholic Church after suggesting that the Earth revolved around the Sun, rather than the reverse. \n \n “The science is not settled on this. The idea that we would put Americans’ economy at jeopardy based on scientific theory that’s not settled yet to me is just nonsense,” Perry said at the time. “Just because you have a group of scientists who stood up and said here is the fact. Galileo got outvoted for a spell.” \n \n In his 2010 book, “Fed Up!” Perry described the science showing that climate change was underway and caused by humans as a “contrived phony mess,” writing that those who embraced this idea “know that we have been experiencing a cooling trend, that the complexities of the global atmosphere have often eluded the most sophisticated scientists, and that draconian policies with dire economic effects based on so-called science may not stand the test of time.” \n \n [Yes, Trump met with Al Gore. But his transition tells a very different climate story] \n \n “Al Gore is a prophet all right, a false prophet of a secular carbon cult, and now even moderate Democrats aren’t buying it,” he added, referring to the former vice president and environmentalist. Gore met with Trump recently to discuss climate change. \n \n Later, during the 2012 presidential campaign, Perry said, “There are a substantial number of scientists who have manipulated data so that they will have dollars rolling into their projects.” \n \n In fact, the top 10 hottest years on record have all been since 1998, and 2016 is expected to be the hottest year since formal record-keeping began in 1880. The 2014 summary report for policymakers by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which was endorsed by officials from nearly 200 countries, stated, “Human influence on the climate system is clear, and recent anthropogenic [human caused] emissions of greenhouse gases are the highest in history.” \n \n [Trump has picked the most conservative EPA leader since 1981. This one will face much less resistance.] \n \n “There is no doubt that Rick Perry is completely unfit to run an agency he sought to eliminate — and couldn’t even name. Perry is a climate change denier, opposes renewable energy even as it has boomed in Texas, and doesn’t even believe CO2 is a pollutant,” League of Conservation Voters President Gene Karpinski said in a statement. “Not only that, he is deep in the pocket of Big Polluters, who have contributed over $2.5 million to his presidential campaigns, a disturbing sign that they expected him to protect their profits in office, not do what’s best for the American people.” \n \n Bill Richardson, who was energy secretary under President Clinton, said that Perry was a deal maker, political presence and good manager, and therefore a “sensible choice.” But he said that “my big concern is that he’s too tied to the fossil fuel industry and because of Donald Trump’s positions he will try to dismantle the very valuable renewable energy and climate change programs and policies that are a huge part of the DOE.” \n \n Wind power did expand under Perry during his tenure in Texas — from 200 megawatts in 2000 to 14,098 megawatts in 2014, according to the American Wind Energy Association — and he supported the construction of transmission lines nearly a decade ago that helped bring wind-generated electricity to market. \n \n “He created an environment conducive to economic investment through robust infrastructure and competitive power markets that allowed new technologies to enter,” said Tom Kiernan, the chief executive of the American Wind Energy Association, in a statement. “The Texas model under Gov. Perry’s leadership enabled the growth of low-cost wind energy that made the grid more diverse and reliable while saving consumers money.” \n \n [Energy Dept. rejects Trump’s request to name climate change workers, who remain worried] \n \n “The fact that Gov. Perry refuses to accept the broad scientific consensus on climate change calls into question his fitness to head up a science-based agency like DOE,” said Ken Kimmell, president of the Union of Concerned Scientists. But, he added, as governor Perry “increased the ambition of the state’s Renewable Energy Standard, directed state funds to innovative wind energy R&D initiatives, and created a ‘Competitive Renewable Energy Zone’ that helped expand transmission of renewables, bringing clean wind energy from rural communities to new state markets.” \n \n However during a 2015 Iowa Agriculture Summit in Des Moines, the former governor said he opposed extending the federal tax credit for wind power. “I do if a state wants to do it,” he said. “I don’t at the federal level. I think all of these need to be looked at, whether it’s oil and gas, whether it’s the wind side, whether it’s the [Renewable Fuel Standard program] — I think all of them need to be put on the table, prove whether or not these are in fact in the best interest of this country.” \n \n Referring to renewable sources, Jennifer Layke, the World Resources Institute energy program director, said: “The Department of Energy leads essential programs that drive innovation and fill important gaps to get new technologies off the ground. These are vital to keep the U.S. at the frontier of energy technology. In recent years, the Department of Energy has given U.S. businesses a significant boost to accelerate the development of battery storage, solar panels and electric vehicles. These programs must continue.” \n \n Perry sits on the board of Energy Transfer Partners, the firm that is trying to complete work on the Dakota Access Pipeline on the Great Plains. Under President Obama, the Army Corps of Engineers recently decided to withhold a key permit from the company that is needed to finish the oil pipeline. The pipeline has drawn protests from activists who say that segment of the pipeline would disturb American Indian burial grounds and pollute the drinking water of the nearby Indian reservation. The Energy Department has not played a role in that decision-making process, however, and Trump has indicated he would allow the project to move forward once he takes office. \n \n [DOE leaders refuse to identify specific climate change employees for Trump transition team] \n \n The Energy Department Perry would take over has changed substantially since its creation in 1977 under President Carter on the heels of the oil crisis that struck after the Arab countries of OPEC imposed an embargo on the United States. In the 1970s, the agency focused on weapons maintenance and regulations. In the 1980s, nuclear weapons research took center stage. In the 1990s, arms control and anti-proliferation took priority. \n \n But the last two secretaries, physicists Steven Chu and Ernest Moniz, have moved laboratories and other energy programs toward finding ways to slow climate change. The much derided loan and loan guarantee program — which stumbled with a half billion loss linked to solar panel maker Solyndra — has as of September had issued $31.98 billion in loans and loan guarantees for 30 projects, which have leveraged $50 billion in total project investment and created or saved 56,000 jobs. More than $1.65 billion in interest payments have already been paid. \n \n Moniz also used his knowledge of physics and nuclear weapons, and the department’s national laboratories to play a key role in talks aimed at limiting Iran’s nuclear program. Perry brings lacks that knowledge. \n \n If confirmed, Perry would walk into an agency where many career civil servants are likely to be wary of him, not only because of his past pledge to abolish the department. Employees there are already on edge, given the fact that Trump’s transition team gave a questionnaire to DOE officials asking that they identify which employees have worked on either international climate negotiations or domestic initiatives to cut carbon. \n \n Current DOE leaders have declined to provide any individual names of employees to Trump transition team members. \n \n Speaking to reporters Tuesday, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said the administration needed to resist “what certainly could have been an attempt to target civil servants, career federal government employees … who are critical to success of the federal government’s ability to make policy, and their work transcends the term of any one president. That’s by design.” \n \n “Our principle — this is principle that presidents of both parties have long abided by — is that we should observe the protections that are in place, that ensure that career civil servants are evaluated based on merit, and not on politics,” Earnest added, before tweaking Trump for his latest Cabinet pick. “And I’m sure the president-elect used the same kind of criteria when choosing his new Department of Energy Secretary as well.

He was widely perceived as the acting president during the final months of the Nixon administration. \n \n He kept the White House running as the distraught and despondent commander in chief was driven from power by the threat of impeachment in 1974. “He was the president toward the end,” William B. Saxbe, the United States attorney general in 1974, was quoted as saying in “Nixon: An Oral History of His Presidency” (HarperCollins, 1994). “He held that office together.” \n \n Henry A. Kissinger , his mentor and master in the Nixon White House, also said the nation owed Mr. Haig its gratitude for steering the ship of state through dangerous waters in the final days of the Nixon era. “By sheer willpower, dedication and self-discipline, he held the government together,” Mr. Kissinger wrote in the memoir “Years of Upheaval.” \n \n Mr. Haig took pride in his cool handling of a constitutional crisis without precedent. \n \n “There were no tanks,” he said during a hearing on his nomination as secretary of state in 1981. “There were not any sandbags outside the White House.” \n \n Serving the Nixon White House from 1969 to 1974, Mr. Haig went from colonel to four-star general without holding a major battlefield command, an extraordinary rise with few if any precedents in American military history. \n \n But the White House was its own battlefield in those years. He won his stars through his tireless service to President Richard M. Nixon and Mr. Nixon’s national security adviser, Mr. Kissinger. \n \n Mr. Haig never lost his will. But he frequently lost his composure as Mr. Reagan’s secretary of state. As a consequence, he lost both his job and his standing in the American government. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Mr. Nixon had privately suggested to the Reagan transition team that Mr. Haig would make a great secretary of state. Upon his appointment, Mr. Haig declared himself “the vicar of foreign policy” — in the Roman Catholic Church , to which he belonged, the pope is the “vicar of Christ” — but he soon became an apostate in the new administration. \n \n He alienated his affable commander in chief and the vice president, George H. W. Bush , whose national security aide, Donald P. Gregg, described Mr. Haig as “a cobra among garter snakes.” \n \n Mr. Haig served for 17 months before Mr. Reagan dismissed him with a one-page letter on June 24, 1982. \n \n Those months were marked by a largely covert paramilitary campaign against Central American leftists, a heightening of nuclear tensions with the Soviet Union, and dismay among American allies about the lurching course of American foreign policy. \n \n Sixteen months after his departure came the deaths of 241 American Marines , sailors and soldiers in a terrorist bombing in Beirut and, two days later, the American invasion of the Caribbean nation of Grenada . \n \n “His tenure as secretary of state was very traumatic,” John M. Poindexter , later Mr. Reagan’s national security adviser, recalled in the oral history “Reagan: The Man and His Presidency” (Houghton Mifflin, 1998). “As a result of this constant tension that existed between the White House and the State Department about who was going to be responsible for national security and foreign policy, we got very little done.” \n \n Mr. Haig said the president had assured him that he “would be the spokesman for the U.S. government.” But he came to believe — with reason — that the White House staff had banded together against him. \n \n He blamed in particular the so-called troika of James A. Baker III , Edwin Meese III and Michael K. Deaver. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n “Reagan was a cipher,” Mr. Haig said with evident bitterness. “These men were running the government.” \n \n He reflected: “Having been a White House chief of staff, and having lived in the White House under great tension, you know that the White House attracts extremely ambitious people. Those who get to the top are usually prepared to go to extraordinary lengths to get there.” \n \n Mr. Haig briefly considered running for president in 1980 and became a candidate in 1988, but his campaign attracted virtually no popular support. \n \n A spokesman for Johns Hopkins, Gary Stephenson, said Mr. Haig’s death was caused by staphylococcal infection that he had before his admission to the hospital. Mr. Haig is survived by his wife, the former Patricia Fox, 81; their three children, Alexander Patrick Haig Sr. and Barbara Haig, both of Washington, and Brian Haig of Hopewell, N.J.; and eight grandchildren, according to the Rev.

Douglas MacArthur, the supreme allied commander and American viceroy of the Far East. \n \n In 1950, Mr. Haig married the general’s daughter. \n \n Introduction to War \n \n Mr. Haig’s first taste of war was brutal. In the first months of the Korean War, he served on the staff of Maj. Gen. Edward M. Almond, chief of staff of the Far Eastern Command. Official Army histories depict General Almond as a terror to his underlings and as one of General MacArthur’s most uncompromising disciples. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Following orders, General Almond sent thousands of American soldiers north toward the Chinese border in November 1950. They met a ferocious surprise counterattack from a far larger Chinese force. \n \n General Almond and Lieutenant Haig flew to the forward outpost of an American task force on Nov. 28, where the general pinned a medal on a lieutenant colonel’s parka, told him the Chinese were only stragglers, and then flew off. Of that task force, once 2,500 strong, some 1,000 were killed, wounded, captured or left to die. In all, within two weeks, American forces in Korea took 12,975 casualties, in one of the worst routs in American military history. \n \n After the Korean War, the young officer served at the Pentagon and eventually become a deputy special assistant to Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara . He served in Vietnam in 1966 and 1967 as a battalion and brigade commander of the First Infantry Division, and received the Distinguished Service Cross. \n \n In 1969, Colonel Haig became a military assistant on the staff of Mr. Kissinger’s National Security Council . He distinguished himself as the hardest worker in an ambitious and talented cohort. Soon he was a brigadier general and Mr. Kissinger’s deputy. \n \n Vietnam consumed General Haig. He made 14 trips to Southeast Asia from 1970 to 1973. He later said that Mr. Kissinger “got snookered” in negotiations with the enemy, and that he would have chosen to be more forceful. “That is how Eisenhower settled Korea,” Mr. Haig said. “He told them he was going to nuke them. In Vietnam, we didn’t have to use nuclear weapons; all we had to do was to act like a nation.” \n \n Then Watergate consumed the White House. In 1973, after a brief stint as the Army’s vice chief of staff, General Haig was summoned back as chief of staff, replacing H. R. Haldeman, who later went to prison. \n \n All this, in the course of a few weeks in the fall of 1973, fell on Mr. Haig’s head: \n \n Vice President Spiro T. Agnew pleaded no contest to taking bribes. The next man in line under the Constitution, House Speaker Carl Albert, was being treated for alcoholism . The president himself, by some accounts, was drinking heavily. War broke out in the Middle East . When the president tried to fire the Watergate special prosecutor, Archibald Cox , rather than surrender his secret White House tapes, the attorney general, Elliot L. Richardson, and his deputy, William D. Ruckelshaus, resigned. Impeachment loomed. \n \n What began with the arrest of several men breaking into Democratic headquarters at the Watergate complex in Washington in June 1972 had poisoned the presidency. Days after the break-in, the president and his closest aides had discussed how to cover up their role and how to obtain hush money for the burglars. The discussions, secretly taped by the president, were evidence of obstruction of justice. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n General Haig was one of the first people, if not the very first person, to read transcripts of the tapes the president had withheld from the special prosecutor. “When I finished reading it,” he says in “Nixon: An Oral History,” “I knew that Nixon would never survive — no way.” \n \n On Aug. 1, 1974, the general went to Vice President Gerald R. Ford and discussed the possibility of a pardon for the president. Mr. Nixon left office a week later; the pardon came the next month. Public outrage was deep. Mr. Haig soon departed. \n \n After leaving the White House in October 1974, he became supreme allied commander in Europe , the overseer of NATO . In 1979, he resigned and retired from the Army. He served for a year as president of United Technologies . \n \n A “Haig for President” committee was formed but dissolved in 1980. Mr. Haig made a full-fledged run for the Republican nomination in 1988. But he placed last among the six Republican candidates in Iowa , where he barely campaigned, and he withdrew before the New Hampshire primary. He had been, he said, “the darkest of the dark horses.” \n \n In his 80s, Mr. Haig ran Worldwide Associates, a firm offering “strategic advice” on global commerce. He also appeared on Fox News as a military and political analyst. \n \n His Way With Words \n \n He had a unique way with words. In a 1981 “On Language” column, William Safire of The New York Times , a veteran of the Nixon White House, called it “haigravation.” \n \n Nouns became verbs or adverbs: “I’ll have to caveat my response, Senator.” (Caveat is Latin for “let him beware.” In English, it means “warning.” In Mr. Haig’s lexicon, it meant to say something with a warning that it might or might not be so.) \n \n Haigspeak could be subtle: “There are nuance-al differences between Henry Kissinger and me on that.” It could be dramatic: “Some sinister force” had erased one of Mr. Nixon’s subpoenaed Watergate tapes, creating an 18 1/2- minute gap. Sometimes it was an emblem of the never-ending battle between politics and the English language: “careful caution,” “epistemologically-wise,” “saddle myself with a statistical fence.” \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n But he could also speak with clarity and conviction about the presidents he served, and about his own role in government. Mr. Nixon would always be remembered for Watergate, he said, “because the event had such major historic consequences for the country: a fundamental discrediting of respect for the office; a new skepticism about politics in general, which every American feels.” \n \n Mr. Reagan, he said, would be remembered for having had “the good fortune of having been president when the Evil Empire began to unravel.” But, he went on, “to consider that standing tall in Grenada, or building Star Wars, brought the Russians to their knees is a distortion of historic reality. The internal contradictions of Marxism brought it to its knees.” \n \n He was brutally candid about his own run for office and his subsequent distaste for political life. “Not being a politician, I think I can say this: The life of a politician in America is sleaze,” he told the authors of “Nixon: An Oral History.” \n \n “I didn’t realize it until I started to run for office,” he said. “But there is hardly a straight guy in the business. As Nixon always said to me — and he took great pride in it — ‘Al, I never took a dollar. I had somebody else do it.’ ”""]",7,"– News that Donald Trump has settled on Rick Perry to run the Energy Department prompted a slew of stories Tuesday with one common refrain, and the former Texas governor must be thrilled with it.

116,"['NEW YORK (AP) — Rescue crews are searching Indonesian waters for AirAsia Indonesia Flight 8501, which disappeared Sunday with 162 passengers and crew onboard. The plane was flying from Surabaya, Indonesia\'s second-largest city, and was about halfway to its destination, Singapore, when it vanished from radar. \n \n ___ \n \n Q: WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED? \n \n A: It is way too early to know for sure, but here are some options. The plane was in the safest part of flight: Just 10 percent of fatal crashes from 2004 through 2013 occurred while a plane was at cruise elevation, according to a safety study published by Boeing in August. \n \n Passing through bad weather such as severe thunderstorms could have been a factor. Airbus jets have sophisticated computers that automatically adjust to wind shears or other weather disruptions. But weather — combined with pilot errors — has played a role in past air disasters that occurred at cruise elevation, including the 2009 Air France Flight 447 crash over the Atlantic Ocean. \n \n Another possibility is some type of catastrophic metal fatigue caused by the cycle of pressurization and depressurization associated with each takeoff and landing cycle. This A320 had had 13,600 takeoffs and landings. Many occurred in humid climate, which speeds corrosion. Still, metal fatigue is unlikely because this plane is only 6 years old. \n \n Finally, there\'s the possibility of terrorism or a mass murder by the pilot. There\'s no evidence of either action, but neither can yet be ruled out. \n \n ___ \n \n Q: WHAT DID THE PILOTS SAY TO AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS? \n \n A: The last communication between the pilot and air traffic control was at 6:12 a.m. Sunday (6:12 p.m. EST Saturday) when the pilot ""asked to avoid clouds by turning left and going higher to 38,000 feet (11,582 meters)."" The last radar contact occurred three minutes later. There was no distress call. But pilots are trained to focus first on the emergency at hand and then communicate only when free. \n \n ___ \n \n Q: ISN\'T THIS THE THIRD MALAYSIAN JET TO CRASH THIS YEAR? \n \n A: Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared with 239 people aboard soon after takeoff from Kuala Lumpur for Beijing on March 8. Its whereabouts and what happened remain one of the biggest mysteries in commercial aviation. Another Malaysia Airlines flight, also a Boeing 777, was shot down over rebel-controlled eastern Ukraine while en route from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur on July 17. All 298 people aboard were killed. AirAsia is also based in Malaysia. Flight 8501 was operated by AirAsia Indonesia, a subsidiary that\'s 49 percent owned by the Malaysian parent company. So technically, it\'s an Indonesian airline. But the AirAsia brand is closely tied to the people of Malaysia. \n \n ___ \n \n Q: IS THERE A CONNECTION AMONG ALL THESE CRASHES? \n \n A: No. It\'s just a very unfortunate year for Southeast Asia. But that doesn\'t stop conspiracy theories from sprouting. Ideas about what happened to Flight 370 — both logical and bizarre — keep appearing. The unsolved nature of that disappearance could generate more attention for Flight 8501 and create a new batch of hypotheses. \n \n ___ \n \n Q: HOW FAR COULD THE JET HAVE FLOWN? \n \n A: Looking at the flight\'s paperwork, the plane had more than 18,000 pounds of jet fuel at takeoff, enough to fly about 3½ hours, according to Phil Derner Jr., the founder of aviation enthusiast website NYCAviation.com and a flight dispatcher for a U.S. airline. He notes that that\'s less fuel than most flights tend to carry from New York to Florida. \n \n ___ \n \n Q: WHAT\'S NEXT? \n \n A: Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia are conducting a search-and-rescue operation near Belitung island in the Java Sea, the plane\'s last known whereabouts. Assuming that the jet didn\'t veer far off course, the searchers should find wreckage, which can provide clues about what happened. Investigators will also try to recover the flight data and cockpit voice recorders, which often have the most detailed information about the plane\'s final moments. Those so-called black boxes have homing beacons that help searchers find them. \n \n ___ \n \n Q: IS THE AIRBUS A320 A SAFE JET? \n \n A: The plane is a workhorse of modern aviation. Similar to the Boeing 737, the single-aisle, twin-engine jet is used to connect cities that are between one and five hours apart. Worldwide, 3,606 A320s are in operation, according to Airbus, which also makes nearly identical versions of the plane: The smaller A318 and A319 and the stretched A321. An additional 2,486 of those jets are flying. The A320 family has a good safety record, with just 0.14 fatal accidents per million takeoffs, according to the Boeing safety study. \n \n ___ \n \n Q: WHAT ABOUT AIRASIA? \n \n A: Low-cost AirAsia has a strong presence in most of Southeast Asia, and it recently expanded into India. Though most of its flights are just a few hours long, it has tried to expand into long-distance flying through its sister airline AirAsia X. None of its subsidiaries has lost a plane before, and it has a generally good safety record. But it does fly in a part of the world where air travel has expanded faster than the number of qualified pilots, mechanics and air traffic controllers. \n \n ___ \n \n Q: WHAT ABOUT FLYING IN INDONESIA? \n \n A: The country has had a bumpy safety record. In 2007, the crash rate and safety standards were so bad that the European Union barred all of Indonesia\'s airlines from flying into any of its member countries. Than ban was lifted in 2009. But Indonesia\'s main airline — fast-growing Lion Air — is still banned by the EU. \n \n ___ \n \n Q: WHAT\'S IT LIKE TO FLY THROUGH A THUNDERSTORM AT 34,000 FEET? \n \n A: Planes flying through thunderstorms experience severe turbulence, with the aircraft moving up, down, sideways and rolling. Anything not secured can float around in the cabin, bouncing off things and people. Overhead bins can open up, spilling contents. Airsickness is common. \n \n ___ \n \n Q: WHAT DO PILOTS DO TO AVOID THUNDERSTORMS? \n \n A: If at all possible, airline pilots fly around thunderstorms, even if it means going far out of their way. Airliners like the A320 typically are equipped with radar that provides highly accurate weather information. Pilots can see a thunderstorm forming from over 100 miles away, giving them time to plot a way around the storm cluster or to look for gaps to fly through. It\'s usually not a problem for commercial planes to go 100 or more miles out of the way. \n \n ___ \n \n Q: HOW HIGH CAN AN A320 SAFELY FLY? AND WHAT IF IT EXCEEDS THAT LIMIT? \n \n A: The A320 is certified to fly up to 39,000 feet, its maximum altitude before its rate of climb begins to erode. The plane has an absolute flight limit of 42,000 feet. But it can begin to experience problems as low as 37,000 feet, depending on temperature and weight, including fuel, cargo and passengers. The plane\'s computers should reveal the maximum altitude at which the plane can fly at its current weight and temperature. Planes that exceed their maximum altitude may lose lift, causing an aerodynamic stall. Or they can experience a pressurization blowout, damaging the plane. \n \n ___ \n \n Q: HOW DOES A PLANE JUST FALL OFF RADAR? \n \n A: It\'s still unclear what traffic controllers saw on their screens when the plane disappeared from radar. Authorities haven\'t said whether they lost only the secondary radar target, which is created by the plane\'s transponder, or whether the primary radar target, created by energy reflected from the plane, was lost as well. If a plane came apart in the air or suffered a loss of electrical power, the secondary target would be lost, but the primary target is often still visible on radar. But if the plane were descending at rate of over 6,000 feet a minute — typical of a plane about to crash — the primary target might be lost as well. \n \n ___ \n \n Q: HOW VITAL IS AIR TRAVEL TO THE REGION? \n \n A: For many people, it\'s the only option. Indonesia is a sprawling archipelago of 250 million people. To get from one island to another, the easiest way is to fly. As the region\'s economy has grown, so have the number of people flying. The International Air Transport Association recently named Indonesia as one of the world\'s five fastest-growing air travel markets, predicting an additional 183 million passengers would take to the sky within two decades. \n \n Routes to, from and within the Asia-Pacific region are predicted by the industry trade group to see an extra 1.8 billion annual passengers by 2034, for an overall market size of 2.9 billion. Within two decades, the region is expected to account for 42 percent of global passenger traffic. \n \n The increase in regional airline traffic reflects rapid economic growth. The International Monetary Fund expects the Southeast Asian economies of Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam to grow faster this year and next than anywhere except China, India and sub-Saharan Africa. \n \n ___ \n \n Scott Mayerowitz can be reached at http://twitter.com/GlobeTrotScott \n \n ___ \n \n Lowy contributed from Austin, Texas. Paul Wiseman in Washington also contributed to this report.', '(CNN) -- An oil slick, the sound of a distant ""ping,"" objects in the water, and now this: smoke spotted rising from an island in the Java Sea. \n \n As ships, planes and helicopters scour the waters off Indonesia\'s coast for missing AirAsia Flight QZ8501, there have been several reports of possible signs of the missing plane. \n \n So far, officials say, none of them have panned out. \n \n On Tuesday, search teams will be checking the area where Indonesian navy helicopter crews saw the smoke, the head of search and rescue in the province of Bangka-Belitung told CNN Indonesia. But authorities don\'t know whether there\'s any connection to the missing jet. \n \n Local media in Indonesia reported the smoke was seen on Long Island, one of thousands that make up the archipelago that forms Indonesia. \n \n Searchers have been scanning the water\'s surface for signs of the plane, which went missing with 162 people aboard on Sunday as it flew between the islands of Belitung and Borneo, a heavily traveled shipping channel with shallow waters. \n \n ""Our early conjecture is that the plane is in the bottom of the sea,"" said Bambang Sulistyo, the head of Indonesia\'s search-and-rescue agency. That belief is based on the plane\'s flight track and last known coordinates, he said. \n \n Several possible signs of the missing plane, including an oil slick within the search zone and the sound of a faint ""ping,"" have been discounted, according to Indonesian authorities, who are heading the search. \n \n Indonesia Vice President Jusuf Kalla said there were ""some reports from Australia"" about possible objects found, but it was unclear whether they were from the plane. \n \n Because there is a great deal of traffic along the water in the search area, authorities have cautioned that objects found might have nothing to do with the missing aircraft. \n \n Rescuers say weather was probably a factor in the plane\'s disappearance, and it has made finding traces of the plane more difficult. \n \n Large waves and clouds hampered the search for the plane on Sunday and Monday. \n \n ""It is not easy, of course ... the operation in the sea, especially in the bad weather like this,"" Kalla said. \n \n But Kalla said his country will not give up or set a time limit for the operation. \n \n The search area is expanding, with six zones added to the operation on Tuesday, Sulistyo told reporters. \n \n Now, he said, teams in the air, on sea and on land are searching 13 zones over an area that stretches about 156,000 square kilometers (60,200 square miles). \n \n What role did weather play? \n \n Report: Higher altitude request denied \n \n AirAsia says air traffic controllers lost contact with the aircraft at 7:24 a.m. Sunday, Singapore time (6:24 a.m. in Indonesia). \n \n The plane, flying from the Indonesian city of Surabaya to Singapore, went missing as it flew over the Java Sea between the islands of Belitung and Borneo -- a heavily traveled shipping channel with shallow waters -- Indonesian authorities said. \n \n Before the plane, an Airbus A320-200, lost contact with air traffic controllers, one of the pilots asked to change course and fly at a higher altitude because of bad weather, officials said. Heavy thunderstorms were reported in the area at the time. \n \n Air traffic control approved the pilot\'s request to turn left but denied permission for the plane to climb to 38,000 feet from 32,000 feet, Djoko Murjatmodjo, an aviation official at the Indonesian Transport Ministry, told the national newspaper Kompas. \n \n The increased altitude request was denied because there was another plane flying at that height, he said. \n \n Djoko suggested that Flight 8501 ascended despite air traffic control denying it permission. \n \n AirAsia CEO Tony Fernandes said storm clouds caused the pilot to ask for a flight plan change. But he added, ""We don\'t want to speculate whether weather was a factor. We really don\'t know."" \n \n Once the aircraft is found, there will be a proper investigation, Fernandes said. \n \n AirAsia CEO takes to Twitter \n \n Relatives to be flown over search area \n \n Amid the anxious wait, family members of the passengers have attended closed-door briefings with airport and airline officials at the airport in Surabaya. \n \n Oei Endang Sulsilowati and her daughter were looking for information about her brother, his wife and their two children. \n \n ""We don\'t know what to do,"" Sulsilowati said. ""We are just waiting for news."" \n \n A specially chartered plane will fly relatives of passengers over the search area Wednesday, AirAsia Indonesia CEO Sunu Widjatmoko told reporters in Surabaya on Tuesday. \n \n The chartered Airbus A320 that will take families from Surabaya over the zone has room for as many as 180 people, he said. \n \n Some police said authorities were seeking additional materials to help identify passengers, such as photos with close-ups of teeth, DNA, or fingerprints. But police officials later told CNN they were not immediately seeking these materials. \n \n East Java Police have set up a disaster victims identification area at the Surabaya airport. \n \n Of the people on board the passenger jet, 155 are Indonesian, three are South Korean, one is British, one is French, one is Malaysian and one is Singaporean, the airline said. \n \n Eighteen children, including one infant, are among the passengers, the carrier said. Seven of the people on board are crew members. \n \n Families of AirAsia flight passengers given support through the \'nightmare\' \n \n International search team \n \n Since the flight disappeared in Indonesian airspace, Indonesia is heading up search efforts. \n \n More than 1,100 search and rescue personnel from Australia, Singapore, Malaysia, South Korea, Japan and New Zealand are joining the search alongside Indonesia\'s teams, CNN Indonesia reported. \n \n The missing plane is made by Airbus, a French company. And France has dispatched two investigators to Indonesia. They are due to arrive in Jakarta on Monday, France\'s Foreign Ministry said. \n \n Malaysia\'s transportation minister said his country has deployed three vessels and three aircraft to assist in the search. And the Royal Australian Air Force said Monday that it was deploying a patrol plane to help. \n \n The USS Sampson is on its way to the Java Sea to assist in the search for the missing AirAsia plane, a senior U.S. military official told CNN Chief National Security Correspondent Jim Sciutto. The Sampson, a guided-missile destroyer based in San Diego, deployed in October to take part in ""maritime security exercises and training"" in the Pacific. \n \n China will dispatch aircraft and ships to participate in search and rescue efforts, the Chinese Ministry of National Defense said Tuesday. \n \n The MH370 mystery \n \n AirAsia, a successful budget airline group headquartered in Malaysia, had a clean safety record until the disappearance of Flight 8501. The missing plane is operated by the company\'s Indonesian affiliate. \n \n The loss of contact with the plane comes nearly 10 months after the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which dropped off radar over Southeast Asia on March 8 with 239 people on board. \n \n AirAsia and MH370 cases are very different \n \n Searchers have yet to find any remains of Flight 370, which officials believe went down in the southern Indian Ocean after mysteriously flying thousands of kilometers away from its planned route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. \n \n But some aviation experts don\'t think the search for Flight 8501 will be as challenging as the hunt for MH370. \n \n ""We are not talking about the deep Indian Ocean here,"" CNN aviation correspondent Richard Quest said.

Azieza Uhnavy also contributed to this report.', 'MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian forces freed a hijacked Russian oil tanker in a helicopter-backed operation on Thursday, rescuing its crew and, according to one report, killing a Somali pirate. \n \n Pirates on Wednesday hijacked the MV Moscow University in the Gulf of Aden with its 23-member crew and a cargo of crude oil worth $52 million. \n \n The European Union’s naval force said the Russian warship Marshal Shaposhnikov had sent in a helicopter that returned fire after being shot at by pirates. \n \n “Eventually the pirates surrendered and a boarding team from the Marshal Shaposhnikov arrived on board the tanker, captured all the pirates and freed the crew.

The New York Times runs through some of the differences with AirAsia Flight 8501: Unlike with Flight 370, there has been no sign that anybody on Flight 8501 intentionally disabled any onboard systems, meaning that investigators should have the normal automatic transmissions from the flight to help the search. Flight 370 disappeared on a clear night, while Flight 8501 was believed to have encountered stormy weather, with weather agencies having reported lightning strikes along its route. The AirAsia pilot's last communication with air traffic control was a request ""to avoid clouds by turning left and going higher to 38,000 feet."" Flight 370's pilot was very experienced, with more than 18,000 hours of flying time, while the combined experience of Flight 8501's pilot and co-pilot is believed to be less than half that. Neither Flight 370 nor Flight 8501 issued an emergency distress call, but, as the AP notes, ""pilots are trained to focus first on the emergency at hand and then communicate only when free,"" and there's no sign that the AirAsia flight diverted sharply from its intended course the way the Malaysia Airlines flight did. Another major difference is the search area for Flight 8501, which is much smaller and shallower than the vast area that has been searched for Flight 370.

(Associated Press) \n \n Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump talks about his tax plan during a news conference, Monday, Sept. 28, 2015, in New York. The Republican front-runner is calling for an overhaul of the tax... (Associated Press) \n \n Trump\'s plan for an overhaul of the U.S. tax code would eliminate federal income taxes on individuals earning less than $25,000 and married couples earning less than $50,000. He said those individuals would receive ""a new one page form to send the IRS saying, \'I win.\'"" \n \n Trump\'s plan would also disproportionally benefit wealthy earners by lowering the highest income tax rate from 39.6 percent to 25 percent, and businesses by cutting their tax rate — from major corporations to mom-and-pop shops — to no more than 15 percent. \n \n ""There will be a major tax reduction,"" Trump said at a news conference at his Trump Tower skyscraper in Manhattan. ""It\'ll simplify the tax code. It\'ll grow the American economy at a level that it hasn\'t seen for decades."" \n \n Trump said he wants to eliminate the so-called ""carried interest loophole"" that allows managers of hedge funds and private equity firms to pay a lower tax rate than most individuals, and would reduce or eliminating most deductions and loopholes for both individuals and corporations. ""In other words, it\'s going to cost me a fortune,"" he said. \n \n The billionaire real estate mogul said those changes would pay for the tax cuts, along with an increase in tax revenue generated by economic growth. Trump estimated that his plan would lead the economy to grow at least 3 percent a year, and as much as 5 or 6 percent — a rate of growth that most economists say is unrealistic. \n \n Trump said his plan would also bring in new sources of revenue to the Treasury by allowing corporations to bring money held in overseas accounts back to the United States after paying a one-time tax of 10 percent. He would also prevent companies from deferring taxes paid on income earned abroad. \n \n In sum, he says, the changes he wants to enact would not add to the annual federal budget deficit or the national debt. \n \n ""We have an amazing code,"" Trump said of his tax system. ""It will be simple. It will be easy. It will be fair."" \n \n Trump said the plan had been crafted with the help of leading economists, but refused to say who they are during his news conference. He also said his plan didn\'t suit any particular political agenda, describing it as a ""common sense approach."" \n \n The tax plan is the third major policy proposal from Trump, who has also outlined plans for immigration and guns.

The president and I also disagree on the extent of the entitlement problem and what is necessary in order to solve it.” \n \n Boehner insisted that “the House cannot pass a bill that raise taxes on job creators. The House can only pass a debt-limit with spending cuts larger than a hike in the debt limit, as well as real restraints on future spending.” \n \n The Ohio Republican also called for passage of a balanced-budget amendment.

At the time, researchers found almost 6.5 million credentials belonging to site users. It's not clear if the new number of affected accounts is news to LinkedIn. In the days following discovery of the 2012 breach, company officials implemented a mandatory password reset for affected users. A statement from company officials on Wednesday saying that they're working to change any passwords still in use leaves open the possibility that they were unaware the number was so high. \n \n According to posts on social media sites, the data was advertised on a dark Web site known as The Real Deal by someone with the user name peace_of_mind. It offers data for 167 million accounts for five bitcoins, which at current exchange rates is worth about $2,200. \n \n In an e-mail, LinkedIn officials wrote: \n \n In 2012, LinkedIn was the victim of an unauthorized access and disclosure of some members' passwords. At the time, our immediate response included a mandatory password reset for all accounts we believe were compromised as a result of the unauthorized disclosure. Additionally, we advised all members of LinkedIn to change their passwords as a matter of best practice. Yesterday, we became aware of an additional set of data that had just been released that claims to be email and hashed password combinations of LinkedIn members from that same theft in 2012. We are taking immediate steps to invalidate the passwords of the accounts impacted, and we will contact those members to reset their passwords. We have no indication that this is a result of a new security breach. We take the safety and security of our members' accounts seriously. For several years, we have hashed and salted every password in our database; and we have offered protection tools such as email challenges and dual factor authentication. We encourage our members to visit our \n \n safety center to ensure they have two-step verification authentication and to use strong passwords in order to keep their accounts as safe as possible. \n \n The LeakedSource post breaks down the most commonly used passwords and they reveal a stunning lack of care on the part of end users—and more to the point, on the part ofr LinkedIn for allowing them in the first place. The most widely used passcode was 123456, with 753,305 accounts. It was followed by linkedin with 172,523, password with 144,458, 123456789 with 94,314, 12345678 with 63,769, and 111111, with 57,210. Many sites are reluctant to forbid the use of such weak passwords out of a fear of alienating users. The leak underscores just how much a new approach is needed."", ""Quite literally, every day someone gets hacked. Whether that's a telecommunications company having its customer data stolen, or another chain of businesses being ripped for all the credit cards it processes, today one hack just seems to melt into another. \n \n In our series Another Day, Another Hack, we do short posts giving you what you need to know about the hack, so you can figure out whether your bank account, website logins or anything else might be at risk. Because, even if the hack might not be the most sophisticated, real people are still getting fucked over somewhere, and should know about it. \n \n A hacker is trying to sell the account information, including emails and passwords, of 117 million LinkedIn users. \n \n The hacker, who goes by the name “Peace,” told Motherboard that the data was stolen during the LinkedIn breach of 2012. At the time, only around 6.5 million encrypted passwords were posted online, and LinkedIn never clarified how many users were affected by that breach. \n \n Turns out it was much worse than anybody thought. \n \n Peace is selling the data on the dark web illegal marketplace The Real Deal for 5 bitcoin (around $2,200). The paid hacked data search engine LeakedSource also claims to have obtained the data. Both Peace and the one of the people behind LeakedSource said that there are 167 million accounts in the hacked database. Of those, around 117 million have both emails and encrypted passwords. \n \n “It is only coming to the surface now. People may not have taken it very seriously back then as it was not spread,” one of the people behind LeakedSource told me. “To my knowledge the database was kept within a small group of Russians.” \n \n A screenshot of the listing on The Real Deal \n \n LeakedSource provided Motherboard with a sample of almost one million credentials, which included email addresses, hashed passwords, and the corresponding hacked passwords. The passwords were originally encrypted or hashed with the SHA1 algorithm, with no “salt,” which is a series of random digits attached to the end of hashes to make them harder to be cracked. \n \n One of the operators of LeakedSource told Motherboard in an online chat that so far they have cracked “90% of the passwords in 72 hours.” \n \n Troy Hunt, a security researcher who maintains the breach notification site “Have I Been Pwned?,” reached out to some of the victims of the data breach. Two of them confirmed to Hunt that they indeed were users of LinkedIn and that the password he shared with them was the one they were using at the time of the breach. Motherboard was able to confirm a third victim. \n \n One of the victims told Motherboard that the password in the sample was their current one, though he changed it as soon as Hunt reached out no notify him of the breach. \n \n “Having a password out there feels like someone being able to let themselves in to your private space whenever they like, without you knowing,” the victim, who asked to remain anonymous, said in an email. \n \n When reached for comment on Tuesday, LinkedIn spokesperson Hani Durzy told Motherboard that the company’s security team was looking into the incident, but that at the time they couldn’t confirm whether the data was legitimate. Durzy, however, also admitted that the 6.5 million hashes that were posted online in 2012 were not necessarily all of the passwords stolen. \n \n “We don’t know how much was taken,” Durzy told me in a phone call. \n \n The lesson: For LinkedIn, the lesson is the same as four years ago: don’t store passwords in an insecure way. As for LinkedIn users, if you didn’t already change your password four years ago, change it again, especially if you use it on other services (and please stop reusing passwords). \n \n “The prevalence of password reuse means we’ll see that unlock other accounts too,” Hunt told me. \n \n Another lesson is that even old hacked data can sometimes be valuable, given that some of these passwords might still be valid. \n \n UPDATE, May 18, 12:32 p.m. ET: LinkedIn confirmed on Wednesday that the new data is legitimate. \n \n “Yesterday, we became aware of an additional set of data that had just been released that claims to be email and hashed password combinations of more than 100 million LinkedIn members from that same theft in 2012,“ the company's chief information security officer Cory Scott wrote in a blog post. “We are taking immediate steps to invalidate the passwords of the accounts impacted, and we will contact those members to reset their passwords. We have no indication that this is as a result of a new security breach.“ \n \n Scott also encouraged users to use two-factor authentication and use strong passwords."", 'Image copyright Shalabh Kumar \n \n US presidential candidate Donald Trump has spoken a few words of Hindi in a video aimed at wooing Indian-American voters. \n \n He is appropriating Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\'s popular campaign slogan ""Abki bar Modi sarkar"" (""This time Modi government""). \n \n The video was made to air on Indian TV channels in the US, Buzzfeed quoted Shalabh Kumar, a member of Trump\'s Indian-American Advisory Committee, as saying.

Something like a dam breaking,"" said Koyukuk Mayor Patrick Madros. \n \n Koyukuk sits about 14 miles downriver from the ice jam that caused massive flooding and a near-complete evacuation of Galena this week. It\'s the latest community to put life on hold as the annual river breakup winds down the Yukon. \n \n The ice dam began flooding Galena on Sunday and by Wednesday an estimated 300 or more people had fled by plane to Fairbanks, Anchorage or other villages. The local school district estimated 30 to 40 people stayed behind, camping with their dogs at the airport, taking shelter in former Air Force barracks and eating military-style ""meals ready to eat."" \n \n The jam showed signs of weakening by 11 a.m. Wednesday, and by 5 p.m. the Weather Service reported that part of the dam had peeled away. It was still blocking the river, but water levels had already began rising downstream, the agency said. \n \n The Weather Service expected the jam to break and water to began draining from Galena by late Wednesday or Thursday. When it does, a surge of water was expected to flood Koyukuk, where the service has issued a flood warning through 4 p.m. Thursday. \n \n The damage to Galena has been devastating, said Weather Service hydrologist Ed Plumb. \n \n Plumb has been stationed in Galena, where a dike surrounding the airport and a few government buildings has created a dry ""island"" in the middle of bobbing ice and debris. \n \n ""There\'s a lot of cars that are totally submerged in water and floating around,"" Plumb said. ""There are houses that are totally submerged in water up to the roof."" \n \n ""You can see sheens of fuel across the floodwaters and spilled fuel tanks,"" Plumb said. Water inundated the sewage lagoon, which ""is just part of the flood now,"" he said. \n \n There is no power in the village, no working bathrooms and limited food. ""All we\'ve had is the shirt on our backs,"" Plumb said. \n \n The flooding began with a few fingers of water covering the roads, said Paul Apfelbeck, a teacher. Sometime on Monday afternoon it began to surge, seemingly climbing by a foot at a time. It sounded like Niagara Falls, he said. \n \n ""People were scrambling all over the neighborhood, putting their cars up on higher ground."" \n \n Apfelbeck flew to Fairbanks late Tuesday on an Alaska Air National Guard HC-130. The plane carried 32 people and 19 dogs. Alaska State Troopers flew another six people and seven pets to Fairbanks at about the same time. \n \n Some Galena residents, including schools superintendent Chris Reitan, said the state waited too long to help with widespread evacuations given the alarming surge of flood waters Monday night. No one has been killed or reported missing. Nearly every home in town has been damaged, residents said. \n \n Gov. Sean Parnell visited Galena Tuesday and members of his cabinet met Wednesday to discuss whether the state should declare a disaster emergency, said Jeremy Zidek, spokesman for the Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management. \n \n A disaster declaration could unlock state relief money for the village, he said. The state Emergency Management team in Galena asked for additional supplies for those remaining in the community, including 10 cases of bottled water and 12 cases of MREs. \n \n In Koyukuk, a Koyukon Athabascan community about 30 miles downriver, residents were already preparing for the worst, Madros said. \n \n They hauled water and wood to higher ground. They prepared to shut the power off in the town of about 75 people and evacuated the sick and elderly Tuesday on a plane to Fairbanks. Madros, the mayor, stood on flood watch from 5 a.m. to 3 p.m. Wednesday. \n \n ""This is the worst flood we\'ve ever seen in Galena so we\'re expecting a lot of water once that dam breaks to come this way,"" he said. \n \n The Weather Service expects the surge to take about four hours to reach Koyukuk once the ice jam breaks.

Narongsak Osatanakorn said Tuesday morning that a navy SEAL team will make the final call on the evacuation method. He said one method being considered is for the group to be coached to swim using special breathing masks. \n \n He said other efforts will continue, such as draining water from the cave and exploring the mountainside for shafts and other entrances to the caverns below. \n \n Experts have said the safest option could be to supply the 12 boys and their coach where they are and wait for the water levels to drop. \n \n ___ \n \n 8:30 a.m. \n \n A Thai provincial governor says the 13 people who had been missing for more than a week have all had an ""informal"" medical evaluation inside the cave and most are in stable condition and none are in critical condition. \n \n Chiang Rai Gov. Narongsak Osatanakorn said Tuesday morning that they used a field assessment in which red is critical condition, yellow is serious condition and green is stable condition. \n \n He said: ""We found that most of the boys are in green condition.

But no one is in red condition."" \n \n The 12 boys and their soccer coach were found late Monday still in the cave and it is not known when they will be able to leave due to flooding and other factors. \n \n ___ \n \n 11:50 p.m. \n \n A leading American cave rescue expert says many challenges are ahead for rescue divers in Thailand who located the 12 boys and their soccer coach who had been missing in a cave for more than a week. \n \n Anmar Mirza, the U.S. National Cave Rescue Commission coordinator, says the primary decision is now one of whether to try to evacuate them or to supply them in place. \n \n He says ""supplying them on site may face challenges depending on how difficult the dives are. Trying to take non-divers through a cave is one of the most dangerous situations possible, even if the dives are relatively easy."" \n \n He says that ""if the dives are difficult then supply will be difficult, but the risk of trying to dive them out is also exponentially greater."" \n \n Rescuers located the boys, aged 11 to 16, and their 25-year-old coach alive deep inside the partially flooded cave in northern Thailand late Monday.

The group, discovered by two British divers late Monday, are on a dry rock ledge around 2.5 miles from the mouth of the cave, and the Thai military says it could be months before it can get them out, unless the boys learn to dive, the BBC reports. The cave in northern Thailand often remains flooded until the end of the rainy season in September or October, meaning the youth soccer team and their coach may need to have food and other supplies sent in for the next four months. Experts warn that it could be very difficult to get the boys, ages 11 to 16, to safety through miles of dark, narrow, flooded tunnels. ""Trying to take non-divers through a cave is one of the most dangerous situations possible, even if the dives are relatively easy,"" US National Cave Rescue Commission coordinator Anmar Mirza tells the AP. Thai officials say they're committed to ""100% safety"" and will continue to explore their options, including draining water from the cave system and searching for shafts that could provide an alternative escape route. Officials say the boys are hungry and weak but in stable medical condition with only minor injuries. They have been provided with high-protein liquid food and will be given more supplies and visited by doctors in the days to come."

The corresponding bill was read at the council’s session. \n \n “The territory of the republic within the recognized borders is indivisible and inviolable,” the council said. The legislators also passed a decision on holding a referendum on whether or not the region should join the Russian Federation. It will be held no later than May 11. \n \n On this background, residents of the city of Donetsk were holding an action of protest in front of the building of the Regional State Administration.

The relevant decision was unanimously adopted by the upper house of Russian parliament at an extraordinary session. Earlier, Vladimir Putin submitted to the Federation Council an address on using the armed forces of Russia on the territory of Ukraine until the normalization of the socio-political situation in that country. This initiative was proposed with regard to a plea by Ukraine’s legitimate president Viktor Yanukovych. \n \n Later the Ukrainian leader said that the address to Vladimir Putin regarding the use of armed forces was triggered by the bout of armed delinquency in Ukraine. “I’ve done it for a reason, because I became target of the criminals.

In particular, they pursued me on the territory of Ukraine,” he said.', 'MOSCOW — Under the attentive eye of Russian state television, several hundred pro-Russian demonstrators in the city of Donetsk, in eastern Ukraine, declared on Monday that they were forming an independent republic and urged President Vladimir V. Putin to send troops to the region as a peacekeeping force, even though there was no imminent threat to peace. \n \n The actions in Donetsk and two other main cities in eastern Ukraine, which included demands for a referendum on seceding from Ukraine and joining Russia, seemed an effort by the activists to mimic some of the events that preceded Russia’s invasion and annexation of Crimea. However, there were no immediate indications that the Kremlin was receptive to the pleas. \n \n While widely regarded as political theater supported if not directed by the Kremlin, the protests could help promote what analysts say is Russia’s primary goal of destabilizing the shaky government in Kiev, preventing it from drifting further into the West’s orbit and giving Moscow leverage over the country’s future ahead of presidential elections in May. \n \n The turmoil in eastern Ukraine also makes it extremely difficult for the provisional government in Kiev to begin putting in place an array of austerity measures and financial overhauls required by the International Monetary Fund as a condition for an $18 billion loan package that the country desperately needs to avert a financial default.', 'KABUL (Reuters) - Suspected militants stormed the Kabul campus of the American University of Afghanistan on Wednesday with some students jumping from second floor windows to escape the gunfire and explosions, witnesses and officials said. \n \n Foreign staff and dozens of pupils were trapped in the compound hours after the attack began at about 6:30 p.m. (10 a.m. ET). \n \n News of casualties was sketchy, but the head of hospitals in the Afghan capital said at least one person had been killed and 14 students wounded in the assault. \n \n “Many students jumped from the second floor, some broke their legs and some hurt their head trying to escape,” Abdullah Fahimi, a student who escaped, told Reuters.

Pro-Russia protesters last night seized government buildings in the cities of Kharkiv, Luhansk, and Donetsk in Ukraine's largely Russian-speaking east, waving Russian flags and demanding a referendum on joining Russia, reports Reuters.

These self-proclaimed lawmakers have also asked Vladimir Putin to send peacekeeping troops, according to Russia's state-run ITAR-Tass news agency.

122,"[""Video (02:04) : The Twin Cities erupted in memories, grief and song after the passing of Minnesota's brightest star. \n \n The investigation of Prince’s death took a turn Thursday indicating that the megastar’s collapse on April 21 is now the focus of a criminal probe. \n \n In a three-page incident report, the Carver County Sheriff’s Office cited an exception to Minnesota public-records laws that allows it to suppress information relating to a “criminal” probe in deciding to release only scant information about the 911 response to the Paisley Park complex in Chanhassen that morning. \n \n The law says that “investigative data collected or created by a law enforcement agency in order to prepare a case against a person, whether known or unknown, for the commission of a crime or other offense for which the agency has primary investigative responsibility are confidential or protected nonpublic while the investigation is active.” \n \n The exception citation doesn’t mean that criminal charges will be filed at the completion of the Sheriff’s Office inquiry, only that charges are a possibility. \n \n Sources with direct knowledge of the case have told the Star Tribune that they are investigating whether an overdose of opioids led to Prince’s death. Prescription pills were found at Paisley Park, but sources have said it was unclear whether they were prescribed to Prince. As part of the probe, investigators also are trying to determine how Prince got the pills, and who may have provided them. \n \n Authorities have said that Prince was alone when he died and that neither foul play nor suicide is suspected. \n \n Fans braved the rain and 40-degree temperatures Thursday to visit the Prince memorial at Paisley Park in Chanhassen. \n \n Carver County Chief Deputy Jason Kamerud, who released the report, said Thursday that the federal Drug Enforcement Administration is not involved in the investigation at this time. Sheriff Jim Olson and County Attorney Mark Metz didn’t respond for comment. \n \n The incident report, released a week after the musician’s death, provides little detail that wasn’t already made public by law enforcement authorities. It doesn’t identify who made the 911 call or if anybody in the building talked to investigators after Prince’s death. \n \n Timeline of the 911 call \n \n The report did reveal the time frame for the emergency response to Paisley Park that morning. Twenty-four minutes elapsed between the 911 call reporting an “unresponsive adult male” at Paisley Park and Prince being pronounced dead, according to the report. \n \n The 911 call from the music studio was made at 9:43 a.m. Sheriff’s deputies and emergency personnel from the Chanhassen Fire Department arrived at the scene five minutes later and found Prince in the elevator. \n \n Emergency responders administered CPR, but were not able to revive the rock star and he was pronounced dead at 10:07 a.m., the report said. \n \n The cause of death was listed as “unknown.” \n \n Prince was 57. \n \n His body was cremated last week and a private service held at Paisley Park. \n \n Olson has said a cause of death probably won’t become public for weeks, after the Sheriff’s Office receives reports from the medical examiner and toxicology results. \n \n The Sheriff’s Office released the incident report at the request of media organizations. It also released, upon request, a list of 47 service calls to Paisley Park over the past five years. Four were for medical reasons. \n \n Three of those medical calls occurred within the last nine months, including the final call. It is unclear whether medical calls on Aug. 9, 2015, and Sept. 6, 2015, involved Prince. \n \n Search warrant sealed \n \n Earlier Thursday, a Carver County judge sealed the search warrant in the death investigation. \n \n The request was made by Metz, who stated that the premature disclosure of the details contained in the warrant may compromise the law enforcement investigation by causing the search or related searches to be unsuccessful. \n \n He added that the release of the information could also create a substantial risk of injury to an innocent person or persons or severely hamper the ongoing investigation. \n \n Search warrants in the investigation of Prince's death at Paisley Park in Chanhassen have been sealed by a Carver County judge at the request of the county attorney. \n \n “Due to Prince’s status of having been an iconic popular music superstar, there is and will be continued intense media scrutiny upon the manner and circumstances of Prince’s death,” Metz said in his argument to seal the warrant and any related documents. \n \n District Judge Eric Braaten ordered that the document remain sealed until the commencement of any criminal proceedings or 180 days from the date of Thursday’s order. \n \n A search warrant is filed and made public no later than 10 days after its execution. The document typically provides a detailed narrative explaining why a law enforcement agency is seeking the warrant and lists the items or data seized during the search. \n \n Staff writers Dan Browning, Emma Nelson and Jeremy Olson contributed to this report."", 'Covered bodies fill a mass grave reported to be in Dariya, Syria, where hundreds of people have been killed.

What has happened in Dariya is the most appalling of what has happened in the revolution till now, what has happened in Syria till now,"" said an opposition activist who goes by the name Abu Kinan for security reasons. ""The smell of death is everywhere."" \n \n At least 320 people have been killed in Dariya, a working-class town southwest of the capital, since the military launched an assault on the suburb five days ago, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a British-based group opposed to President Bashar Assad. \n \n The killings reported in Dariya contributed to a death toll Saturday that topped 400 throughout Syria, according to the Local Coordination Committees, an opposition umbrella coalition. It appears to be the largest single-day death toll reported to date in the conflict. The group reported more than 200 people killed Sunday. \n \n The numbers could not be independently confirmed. The government has accused the opposition of exaggerating death tolls and inventing massacres in a bid to discredit the armed forces. \n \n According to United Nations figures, at least 17,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed in Syria since antigovernment protests broke out in March 2011. The opposition puts the death toll at more than 20,000. \n \n Verifying casualty counts in Syria has become more difficult with the departure of United Nations monitors, who had visited some previous massacre sites and provided confirmation of the numbers killed and injured. With the U.N. monitoring mission over, there was little prospect Sunday of any independent investigation into the killings in Dariya. The Syrian government places severe restrictions on media coverage. \n \n Opposition advocates blamed government troops and plainclothes militiamen for the killings. The government blamed ""terrorists,"" its usual term for armed rebels. \n \n The opposition says many victims in Dariya, previously a stronghold of rebels seeking to oust Assad, were executed after pro-government forces entered the town Friday. Others were killed in shelling or shot by snipers, the opposition says. \n \n Opposition activists said many victims were taken prisoner by government forces and executed in basements. In one grisly discovery Saturday, more than 120 bodies were found in one basement, activists said. \n \n According to opposition activists, more than 100 additional bodies were discovered Sunday as government forces withdrew to the town\'s outskirts and residents were able to begin searching more thoroughly. \n \n Most victims were men, but many women and children were also among the dead, the opposition said. \n \n Even the pro-government Syrian TV channel Addounia showed images of residents who had apparently been killed in the midst of seemingly routine daily activities. The station aired footage of a girl killed on a street, a man fallen from his motorcycle, and several bodies at a cemetery. \n \n ""As we have become accustomed, every time we enter an area that has terrorists, they have committed crimes and killings in the name of freedom,"" the Addounia reporter said in her report. \n \n As the camera scanned behind her and got closer on a man shot to death in the driver\'s seat of a blue pickup truck, she added, ""This is their doctrine and this is how they think."" \n \n The Addounia footage from Dariya that aired Sunday showed bloodied bodies on streets, in homes and scattered in a cemetery. Many victims appeared to be women and children. The members of one entire family executed in their home were shot because they didn\'t support the ""terrorists,"" a soldier told the station\'s reporter. \n \n On Sunday, the army returned to some Dariya neighborhoods that had been raided the day before, leading to the deaths of additional residents, said Abu Kinan, the opposition activist. \n \n The government onslaught against Dariya began last week when regime forces began shelling from tanks, helicopters and fighter jets, according to opposition activists. It was the latest in what the opposition calls a methodical attempt to retake and punish rebel-held neighborhoods in Damascus and surrounding suburbs. The assault on Dariya and other suburbs followed an uprising last month that saw intense combat in many parts of the city. \n \n The Syrian military eventually crushed the rebellion in the capital districts. The army then moved its focus to outlying areas such as Dariya. \n \n After fighters with the Free Syrian Army, the rebel umbrella group, withdrew from the town Friday night, soldiers accompanied by shabiha militia members stormed in, opposition groups said. They raided homes and arrested many, taking prisoners to the basements of empty buildings where they were shot execution-style, according to opposition accounts. \n \n Before Dariya, the opposition said, dozens were killed in Moadamyeh al-Sham, another Damascus suburb, and on Sunday military forces were reported to be moving toward the nearby town of Ajdaideh, the opposition said. \n \n The pro-government Addounia channel, reporting on the violence in the Damascus suburbs, aired a surreal sequence in which a reporter, standing in the cemetery where fresh corpses were tossed about, announced the discovery of a woman shot but ""clinging to life."" The camera cut to a woman lying on the ground, her head resting on a shattered stone grave marker, her hands bloody from her wound. \n \n ""I was heading to Damascus with my husband and children and suddenly I found myself like this,"" explained the wounded woman, who said that her husband worked for state security and that she didn\'t know what had happened to him or her three children. \n \n ""Who hit you, ma\'am? Tell us,"" the reporter said. \n \n ""I don\'t know,"" she said. ""I don\'t remember anything, I don\'t remember, except that I was shot."" \n \n Once the brief interview was over, army soldiers arrived and took the wounded woman away on a stretcher. \n \n A Times staff writer in Beirut and special correspondent Rima Marrouch in Antakya, Turkey, contributed to this report.']",2,"– Investigators suspect an overdose of prescription drugs caused Prince's death last week and they want to find out exactly where he got them, according to a source close to the investigation. The probe is looking at whether a doctor was on Prince's plane when he made an emergency landing in Illinois the week before his death, and whether he overdosed on the plane, a law enforcement official tells the AP, which notes that the development is worryingly reminiscent of Michael Jackson's death. The source confirmed reports that the opiate painkiller Percocet is believed to have been involved. Documents released on Thursday signal that the investigation is now a criminal probe and charges are a possibility, the Star Tribune reports. The documents released by the Carver County, Minn., sheriff's office Thursday include a request to seal the results of a search conducted at Prince's Paisley Park the day he died, Reuters reports. A judge granted the request, which was made on the grounds that ""intense media scrutiny"" could hamper the investigation or risk injury to innocent people. Carver County Chief Deputy Jason Kamerud declined to comment on reports of drugs found at Prince's home. He tells the AP that contrary to media reports, investigators have not asked the DEA to get involved. ""We might contact them to help us, but that hasn't happened,"" he says.

According to CBS Minnesota, Wendy's employees claim that Eiram Chanel Amir Dixson became argumentative during a drive-thru transaction just after noon Thursday after the woman asked specifically for fresh French fries. Reports don't specify the condition of the fries, or whether she even received them, but do make clear that an argument followed. Employees allege Dixson reached through the drive-thru window and, after an employee threw a soft drink at her, proceeded to spray them with Mace. The restaurant manager was hit directly in the face while two more employees were also in the line of the spray, per the police report. All three employees provided similar accounts of the incident, according to ABC News 5. Dixson is being charged with felony use of tear gas to immobilize. If found guilty, she’ll face a maximum sentence of up to five years in prison and/or a $3,000 to $10,000 fine.

124,"['The overall suicide rate among children between the ages of five and 11 was stable during the 20 years from 1993 to 2012, but that stability obscured racial differences that show an increase in suicide among black children and a decrease among white children. \n \n For a study published by JAMA Pediatrics, researchers led by Jeffrey A. Bridge, Ph.D., of the Research Institute at Nationwide Children’s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, analyzed 20 years of nationwide mortality data. \n \n The researchers found that 657 children between the ages of five and 11 died by suicide between 1993 and 2012 — an average of nearly 33 children each year. They also found that 553 (84 percent) of the children were boys and 104 (16 percent) were girls. \n \n Hanging/suffocation was the predominant method of suicide, accounting for 78.2 percent (514 of 657) of the total suicides, followed by firearms (17.7 percent; 116 of 657) and other methods (4.1 percent; 27 of 657), according to the results. \n \n The analysis showed that the overall suicide rate remained stable during the 20-year period, going from 1.18 per one million to 1.09 per million. \n \n However, the researchers found that that stability resulted from divergent trends in suicide for black and white children during those 20 years. \n \n The suicide rate increased in black children from 1.36 per one million to 2.54 per one million, while the suicide rate decreased in white children from 1.14 per one million to 0.77 per one million. \n \n The statistically significant racial differences were confined to both black and white boys, with an increase in the suicide rate among black boys (1.78 to 3.47 per one million) and a decrease in the suicide rate among white boys (from 1.96 to 1.31 per one million). \n \n Although the changes were not statistically significant among girls, the suicide rate among black girls increased from 0.68 to 1.23 per one million during the 20-year period, while the suicide rate among white girls remained stable from 0.25 to 0.24 per one million, according to the study’s findings. \n \n According to the researchers, the findings prompt questions about what factors might influence increasing suicide rates among young black children, such as disproportionate exposure to violence and traumatic stress, aggressive school discipline, and an early onset of puberty. \n \n However, the researchers said it remains unclear if any of these factors are related to increasing suicide rates. \n \n “The stable overall suicide rate among U.S. children aged five to 11 years during 20 years of study masked a significant increase in the suicide rate among black children and a significant decline in the suicide rate among white children,” the authors write. \n \n “From a public health perspective, future steps should include ongoing surveillance to monitor these emerging trends and research to identify risk, protective and precipitating factors associated with suicide in elementary school-aged children to frame targets for early detection and culturally informed interventions.” \n \n Source: The JAMA Network Journals', ""The United States and China are pledging to move faster to reduce or limit emissions of heat-trapping gases blamed for global warming. China and the U.S. are the world's two largest polluters, and by taking action together, leaders from both countries hope to spur other nations to be equally aggressive as they work to finalize a worldwide climate treaty next year. \n \n What both countries are announcing, according to the White House: \n \n UNITED STATES \n \n —Reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 26 percent to 28 percent by the year 2025, compared to what the U.S. was emitting in 2005. Previously, Obama had committed to cutting emissions by 17 percent by 2020 compared to 2005 levels, and officials say the U.S. is on track to meet that goal. \n \n —Double the rate at which the U.S. is reducing its emissions per year. Between 2005 and 2020, the U.S. on average must cut emissions 1.2 percent per year to meet Obama's overall goal of 17 percent. Over the five years between 2020 and 2025, the U.S. aims to reduce emissions and average of 2.3 percent to 2.8 percent per year. \n \n —Submit the new 2025 emissions reduction target by the end of the first quarter of 2015 as the intended U.S. contribution to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, the treaty that nations hope to finalize later in 2015 in Paris. \n \n CHINA \n \n —Set a target for carbon dioxide emissions to peak by around 2030, with the goal of topping out earlier if possible. \n \n —Expand the share of China's energy consumption derived from zero-emission sources to about 20 percent by 2030. The U.S. says that would require China to develop up to 1,000 gigawatts of new power from sources like nuclear, wind and solar.""]",2,"– It has to rank among the saddest of studies: a new look at suicides among young children. Researchers reviewed two decades of CDC data, from 1993 to 2012. Though they write in JAMA Pediatrics that ""suicide is a leading cause of death among school-aged children younger than 12 years,"" they found that suicides among those ages 5 to 11 are very rare, reports the AP: There were 657 during the period studied, or one roughly every week-and-a-half (per the CDC, the daily average for all ages is 105 suicides). But while the suicide rate remained stable during that time, ""that stability obscured racial differences,"" observes Psych Central. The suicide rate decreased in white children, but increased significantly in black children, from from 1.36 to 2.54 per 1 million between the study's first five years and its last five. (In white children, the shift was from 1.14 to 0.77.) That shot suicide up from No. 14 on the list of causes of death among black kids of this age to No. 9; it's No. 11 for white kids. The researchers noted that 84% of those who committed suicide were boys and just 16% girls, and the rate worsens when viewed through a gender lens as well. For black boys, the rate climbed to 3.47 per million. The findings represent a big shift, per lead author Jeffrey Bridge. ""Historically, the suicide rate among US black individuals has been lower than that of white individuals across age groups,"" reads the study. ""To our knowledge, this is the first national study to observe higher suicide rates among US black individuals compared with white individuals."" Hanging and suffocation were the main methods for young children. Bridge advises parents to look for warning signs like prolonged unhappiness and withdrawing from favorite activities.

Anyone with information regarding this case is asked to call Pittsfield Police Officer Brenna Dorr at 413-448-9700, ext 384. \n \n PITTSFIELD — Two men are facing charges for allegedly participating in a citywide prostitution ring involving multiple women — one of whom may have been as young as 15 — who were allegedly plied with drugs and threats. \n \n \n \n Joseph E. Van Wert, 65, of Becket, and Randy W. Lambach, 45, of Pittsfield, are being held on charges including human trafficking pending dangerousness hearing Nov. 29 to determine if bail should be set and in what amount. \n \n \n \n The investigation began in the spring of 2017 after police began receiving calls and complaints regarding apparent increases in prostitution throughout the city. \n \n \n \n Most of the activity seemed to be centered around the areas of First, Adam, North, Linden and Wahconah streets, police said. Many of the women had been recruited by a white male named ""Randy."" \n \n \n \n Randy would seek out women with a drug addiction, photograph them and post advertisements online, seeking clients for sexual services, police were told. \n \n \n \n While conducting patrols around First and Second streets, police interviewed multiple women, many of whom admitted to being prostitutes, but declined to identify who ""tricked them out."" \n \n \n \n One told police she didn\'t ""street-walk,"" but instead got her ""dates"" through ads on backpage.com. \n \n \n \n Police also began receiving reports of suspected prostitution from a North Street senior living facility, where Randy had driven at least five women to and from Van Wert\'s third-floor apartment. \n \n \n \n Police were provided the plate number of the blue station wagon used to shuttle the women and identified Lambach as its owner. And witnesses identified Lambach via photographs as the man they knew as Randy. \n \n \n \n One woman told police she was prostituted by Lambach for about a year and had sex with him for money or to pay off a debt on multiple occasions. Lambach photographed her and placed advertisements on backpage.com. \n \n \n \n Men would contact Lambach via cellphone and a date, time, location and fee would be agreed upon. Rates were typically $80 for 30 minutes or between $160 and $200 for an hour. \n \n \n \n Lambach would then contact the woman and drive her to the appointment, police said. He would sometimes wait outside or watch from a closet or doorway. \n \n \n \n He would collect the money and keep anywhere from 50 to 90 percent of it. Sometimes he would keep all of the money and pay the woman with a few bags of heroin or some crack cocaine instead. \n \n \n \n One of the women told police Lambach would drive her to appointments outside of Pittsfield, and on at least one occasion, outside of the state. \n \n \n \n He allegedly recruited and transported about 10 other women in a similar manner and provided narcotics to those that used drugs to get them high before having sex. \n \n \n \n Lambach allegedly threatened to turn the women in if they stopped working for him, and warned them the police would not believe them because they were, ""drug addicts and whores."" Police were told some of the women Lambach had recruited used to be his foster children. \n \n \n \n He would host meetings between women and customers at Van Wert\'s apartment. \n \n \n \n Van Wert allegedly paid for sex with the women and was paid by Lambach in cash and drugs for use of his apartment. \n \n \n \n Another witness told police that Lambach approached her in August, telling her he ran a prostitution ring and showed her several photographs of women he said worked for him. \n \n \n \n That witness said it appeared several of the women in those photos were very young and estimated the age of one at about 15. \n \n \n \n Lambach allegedly said he also drives women to Springfield, where they prostitute themselves from a strip club. \n \n \n \n Another witness told police Lambach may have been involved in prostitution and trafficking for about 10 years. \n \n \n \n Other witnesses told police Lambach would threaten the women if he thought they were giving information to the police. \n \n \n \n By mid-November, police felt they had enough probable cause to arrest the men. \n \n \n \n Lambach was picked up without incident about 4 p.m. Nov. 14. Van Wert was arrested at his apartment shortly thereafter. \n \n \n \n Lambach has pleaded not guilty in Central Berkshire District Court to four counts of human trafficking.

126,"[""(Reuters) - U.S. judges in at least five states blocked federal authorities from enforcing President Donald Trump’s executive order restricting immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries. \n \n However, lawyers representing people covered by the order said some authorities were unwilling on Sunday to follow the judges’ rulings. \n \n Judges in California, Massachusetts, Virginia and Washington state, each home to international airports, issued their rulings after a similar order was issued on Saturday night by U.S. District Judge Ann Donnelly in New York’s Brooklyn borough. \n \n Donnelly had ruled in a lawsuit by two men from Iraq being held at John F. Kennedy International Airport. \n \n While none of the rulings struck down Friday’s executive order by the new Republican president, the growing number of them could complicate the administration’s effort to enforce it. \n \n The rulings add to questions about the constitutionality of the order, said Andrew Pincus, a Mayer Brown partner representing two Yemeni men who were denied U.S. entry from an overseas flight despite being legal permanent residents. \n \n “People have gone through processes to obtain legal permanent resident status, or visas,” Pincus said. “There are serious questions about whether those rights, which were created by statute, can be unilaterally taken away without process.” \n \n Trump’s order halted travel by people with passports from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days, and stopped the resettlement of refugees for 120 days. \n \n He said these actions were needed “to protect the American people from terrorist attacks by foreign nationals admitted to the United States.” \n \n The order sparked a global backlash, including from U.S. allies that view the actions as discriminatory and divisive. \n \n Attorneys general from California, New York, 13 other states and Washington, D.C., meanwhile, in a statement condemned and pledged to fight what they called Trump’s “dangerous” and “unconstitutional” order. \n \n The U.S. Department of Homeland Security on Sunday said it “will comply with judicial orders,” while enforcing Trump’s order in a manner that ensures those entering the United States “do not pose a threat to our country or the American people.” \n \n SAFE, NOT SORRY \n \n Striking that balance has caused confusion, according to lawyers who worked overnight and on Sunday to help travelers at JFK Airport, Washington Dulles International Airport in northern Virginia, and elsewhere. \n \n Activists gather at the US Capitol to protest President Donald Trump's executive actions on immigration in Washington January 29, 2017. REUTERS/Aaron P. Bernstein \n \n Immigration lawyer Sharifa Abbasi said some Border Patrol agents at Dulles refused to let lawyers talk with detainees, even after being shown an order from U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema requiring such access. \n \n Abbasi said the agents instead told the lawyers to call their agency’s office, where no one was answering. \n \n “There is really no method to this madness,” Becca Heller, director of the New York-based International Refugee Assistance Project organization, told reporters on a conference call. \n \n Supporters of Trump’s order said authorities acted properly in swiftly taking steps to enforce it. \n \n “It is better (to) be safe than sorry,” said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the conservative Center for Immigration Studies in Washington. \n \n Lawsuits on behalf of more than 100 individual travelers have been filed nationwide, activists and lawyers estimated. \n \n Some have come from large corporate firms including Mayer Brown, Kirkland & Ellis, and Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton. \n \n CURBS ON TRUMP’S ORDER \n \n In Boston, U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs on Sunday temporarily blocked the removal of two Iranians who have taught at the University of Massachusetts, and had been detained at the city’s Logan International Airport. \n \n Burroughs’ ruling appeared to go further than Donnelly’s by barring the detention, as well as the removal, of approved refugees, visa holders and permanent U.S. residents entering from the seven countries. Donnelly’s order forbade only removal. \n \n Matthew Segal, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts, in a statement called Burroughs’ ruling “a huge victory for justice” in the face of what he called Trump’s “unconstitutional ban on Muslims.” \n \n The U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment guarantees the free exercise of religion. Trump’s order sought to prioritize refugees fleeing religious persecution, which the president said was aimed at helping Christians in Syria. \n \n Burroughs’ ruling also prompted some Trump critics to urge holders of green cards, which allow foreign nationals to live and work permanently in the United States, to fly into Boston, to lessen the risk of detainment. \n \n White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus said several times on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that Trump’s order does not affect green card holders “moving forward” or “going forward.” \n \n Slideshow (7 Images) \n \n In a ruling on Sunday, U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee in Los Angeles directed the return to the United States of Ali Khoshbakhti Vayeghan, who authorities had sent back to his native Iran following Trump’s order. \n \n The ruling from Brinkema, in Alexandria, Virginia, barred the Homeland Security agency from removing an estimated 50 to 60 legal permanent residents who had been detained at Dulles. \n \n In Seattle, U.S. District Judge Thomas Zilly barred the government from removing two people, who were not named in court papers. He scheduled a Feb. 3 hearing on whether to lift that stay."", 'Protesters rally against President Trump\'s refugee ban at Miami International Airport on Sunday, Jan. 29, 2017.b President Donald Trump’s immigration order sowed more confusion and outrage across the...

Gonzalez is from Puerto Rico and works in Miami. \n \n Trump\'s order placed a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen and a 120-day suspension of the U.S. refugee program.

Reuters reports that judges in three additional states—Massachusetts, Virginia, and Washington state—have since followed suit. Reuters points out that these legal moves are curbs that do not eradicate President Trump's executive order that severely limits immigration, but observes ""the growing number ... could complicate the administration's effort to enforce it."" The former is exactly what an unnamed senior White House official pointed out, reportedly telling NBC's Kelly O'Donnell such rulings do ""not undercut the President's executive order."" The official continues, ""All stopped visas will remain stopped. All halted admissions will remain halted. All restricted travel will remain prohibited. ... The order remains in place."" But the pressure shows no sign of easing: The AP reports that the attorneys general of 15 states and the District of Columbia will issue a joint statement branding Trump's ban as unconstitutional and at odds with ""a bedrock principle"" of the US: religious liberty. The states: Washington, California, New York, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Hawaii, Virginia, Oregon, Connecticut, Vermont, Illinois, New Mexico, Iowa, Maine, and Maryland. What Trump had to say Sunday morning on Twitter: ""Our country needs strong borders and extreme vetting, NOW. Look what is happening all over Europe and, indeed, the world - a horrible mess!"""

129,"['Barry Brecheisen/Getty Images There is no question that Americans are frustrated with their elected officials, but the latest Gallup poll shows that frustration has reached a fever pitch, plummeting Congress to its lowest approval rating in history. Just 10 percent of Americans approve of the job Congress is doing, fewer than at any previous point in Gallup\'s nearly 40 years of polling. With an approval rating that low, it is hard to find anything that is actually less popular than Congress. In the nearly half a century-long history of Gallup polling, the only people or institutions that have been more unpopular than the current Congress are Fidel Castro, Saddam Hussein, Osama bin Laden and Mark Fuhrman, a detective in the O.J. Simpson murder trial, said Gallup\'s Editor in Chief Frank Newport. Here\'s a look at some of the things Americans like more than Congress: \n \n Derick E. Hingle/Bloomberg /Getty Images BP During the Oil Spill At the height of the BP oil spill in 2010, while thousands of barrels of crude oil were streaming into the Gulf of Mexico daily, the BP oil company, which owned the gushing offshore rig, had a higher approval rating than Congress currently has. A June 2010 Gallup poll shows that 16 percent of respondents approved of how BP was handling the spill, which went uncapped for two months. \n \n Jacques DeMarthon/AFP/Getty Images Socialism It\'s a label than many of Obama\'s critics have attempted to plaster on the president\'s re-election campaign like the scarlet A on Hester Prynne\'s dress. But judging by the latest polls, socialism is actually more popular than Congress. Three times as many people have a positive view of socialism than have a positive view of Congress. According to a CBS/New York Times poll released last month, 33 percent of Americans view socialism positively. \n \n John Moore/Getty Images Waterboarding More people think waterboarding, where interrogators pour water over a prisoner\'s face so they feel like they are drowning, should be used as an interrogation tactic against suspected terrorists than support Congress. According to a November CNN/ORC poll an even 50 percent of respondents said Waterboarding should be allowed. The same poll found that 31 percent of Americans do not think the practice is torture while 68 percent said it is torture. \n \n Getty Images Abortion In a July ABC/Washington Post poll 19 percent of respondents supported abortion being legal ""in all cases,"" nearly double the percentage of people who support the current Congress. A slightly smaller percentage were on the opposite end of the spectrum, with 15 percent of respondents saying abortion should be outlawed in every circumstances. \n \n Pierre Manevy/Express/Getty Images President Nixon In the midst of one of the greatest scandals in presidential history, President Richard Nixon had a higher approval rating that Congress currently has. A 1974 Gallup poll shows that 24 percent of Americans supported the president at the height of the Watergate scandal. \n \n Getty Images Santa Clause Non-Believers More people in the United States have never believed in Santa Clause than currently put their faith in Congress. An AP/Gfk poll in December showed that 16 percent of Americans did not believe in Old Saint Nick as a child. Put another way, roughly the same number of people believe or have believed in Santa as currently disapprove of Congress. Cue Congressional Scrooge/Grinch jokes… \n \n Yiannis Liakos/AFP/Getty Images Prime Minister of Greece More than twice as many people approve of the job Greek leader George Papandreou did in 2011, the year his country plummeted into the worst debt crises in the Western world, than support the U.S. Congress. Even after Papandreou resigned amid Greece\'s debt catastrophe, 21 percent of respondents worldwide still supported him, according to a worldwide Gallup poll conducted throughout 2011. \n \n Seth Wenig/AP Photo Occupy Wall Street The groups representing outraged citizens on both ends of the political spectrum – Occupy Wall Street and the Tea Party – both have more support than the current Congress. An NBC/ Wall Street Journal poll in December showed 24 percent of respondents were supportive of the Occupy Wall Street movement and 27 percent said they considered themselves Tea Party supporters. \n \n Jeff Bottari/Getty Images Paris Hilton Reality TV star and heiress Paris Hilton is the least popular celebrity, but she is still more popular than Congress.

A June 2010 Gallup poll shows that 16 percent of respondents approved of how BP was handling the spill, which went uncapped for two months. \n \n Jacques DeMarthon/AFP/Getty Images Socialism It\'s a label than many of Obama\'s critics have attempted to plaster on the president\'s re-election campaign like the scarlet A on Hester Prynne\'s dress. But judging by the latest polls, socialism is actually more popular than Congress. Three times as many people have a positive view of socialism than have a positive view of Congress. According to a CBS/New York Times poll released last month, 33 percent of Americans view socialism positively. \n \n John Moore/Getty Images Waterboarding More people think waterboarding, where interrogators pour water over a prisoner\'s face so they feel like they are drowning, should be used as an interrogation tactic against suspected terrorists than support Congress. According to a November CNN/ORC poll an even 50 percent of respondents said Waterboarding should be allowed. The same poll found that 31 percent of Americans do not think the practice is torture while 68 percent said it is torture. \n \n Getty Images Abortion In a July ABC/Washington Post poll 19 percent of respondents supported abortion being legal ""in all cases,"" nearly double the percentage of people who support the current Congress. A slightly smaller percentage were on the opposite end of the spectrum, with 15 percent of respondents saying abortion should be outlawed in every circumstances. \n \n Pierre Manevy/Express/Getty Images President Nixon In the midst of one of the greatest scandals in presidential history, President Richard Nixon had a higher approval rating that Congress currently has. A 1974 Gallup poll shows that 24 percent of Americans supported the president at the height of the Watergate scandal. \n \n Getty Images Santa Clause Non-Believers More people in the United States have never believed in Santa Clause than currently put their faith in Congress. An AP/Gfk poll in December showed that 16 percent of Americans did not believe in Old Saint Nick as a child. Put another way, roughly the same number of people believe or have believed in Santa as currently disapprove of Congress. Cue Congressional Scrooge/Grinch jokes… \n \n Yiannis Liakos/AFP/Getty Images Prime Minister of Greece More than twice as many people approve of the job Greek leader George Papandreou did in 2011, the year his country plummeted into the worst debt crises in the Western world, than support the U.S. Congress. Even after Papandreou resigned amid Greece\'s debt catastrophe, 21 percent of respondents worldwide still supported him, according to a worldwide Gallup poll conducted throughout 2011. \n \n Seth Wenig/AP Photo Occupy Wall Street The groups representing outraged citizens on both ends of the political spectrum – Occupy Wall Street and the Tea Party – both have more support than the current Congress. An NBC/ Wall Street Journal poll in December showed 24 percent of respondents were supportive of the Occupy Wall Street movement and 27 percent said they considered themselves Tea Party supporters. \n \n Jeff Bottari/Getty Images Paris Hilton Reality TV star and heiress Paris Hilton is the least popular celebrity, but she is still more popular than Congress. An August Ipsos poll on celebrity popularity found that 60 percent of respondents had an unfavorable view of Hilton, making her comparatively popular compared to the 86 percent of people who said they disapprove of Congress. Hilton and Charlie Sheen were the only two celebrities in the poll that were view more negatively than positively, falling below the likes of Brittany Spears and Kanye West, who both had a 45 percent favorability rate.', 'Rupert and James Murdoch on Tuesday were called to appear before British Parliament next week to anwer questions about the actions of their newspapers in the phone hacking scandal. \n \n A spokesperson for News International, News Corp.’s British newspaper arm, issued a statement saying the company will cooperate, according to a reporter from Murdoch-controlled Sky News. \n \n Text Size - \n \n + \n \n reset POLITICO 44 \n \n “We have been made aware of the request from the CMS Committee to interview senior executives and will cooperate,” the company said. \n \n The summoning from Parliament’s Culture, Media and Sport Committee, which was also extended to Rebekah Brooks, the CEO of News International, is not binding on the Murdochs — because they are not British citizens — the but will increase the growing public pressure on the company.

There aren't many institutions Americans have liked less over the last 50-or-so years, according to Gallup: Only Fidel Castro, Saddam Hussein, Osama bin Laden, and OJ Simpson detective Mark Fuhrman have ever scored lower. ABC News takes a look at some very unpopular things that still manage to rank above Congress: According to an August poll, Paris Hilton is America's least-favorite celeb. But her 60% disapproval rating is still better than Congress's 86% disapproval rating. Socialism is about three times as popular as Congress: About 33% of Americans view the system positively, according to a January poll. About half of Americans polled in November said waterboarding should be permitted as an interrogation technique—meaning more support the technique than support Congress. During the financial crisis, banks were more popular than Congress is now: Some 18% of Americans still had faith in the institutions in 2009. In June 2010, as thousands of barrels of oil were pouring into the Gulf of Mexico every day, 16% of Americans approved of BP's work on the crisis.

Network president Channing Dungey confirmed the plans for the new episodes while on a conference call with reporters ahead of ABC\'s big presentation during 2017 Upfronts week in New York City. \n \n ""We\'re rebooting Roseanne,"" she said. ""It is planned for the midseason. We\'re still at the early stages."" Per the network\'s press release, the eight-episode revival will find the Connors continuing to deal with ""the economic challenges of living pay check to pay check in 2018.""', 'The reboot, which will feature returning stars Roseanne Barr and John Goodman among others, is set to air midseason. \n \n It\'s official: Roseanne is returning to ABC. \n \n The network has handed out an eight-episode straight-to-series order for a revival of the wildly popular family sitcom headlined by comedian Roseanne Barr. The reboot will debut sometime midseason on the network. \n \n ""We\'re rebooting Roseanne,"" ABC Entertainment president Channing Dungey said Tuesday during pre-upfronts call with reporters. The series will return midseason, with a formal date to be announced later. \n \n Original castmembers Roseanne Barr, John Goodman (despite the fact that his character Dan died of a heart attack during the final season), Sara Gilbert (Darlene), Laurie Metcalf (Jackie), Michael Fishman (D.J.) and Lecy Goranson (Becky) are all set to return. Sarah Chalke, who played the role of Becky after Goranson, will also return, but in a different role. \n \n “The Conners’ joys and struggles are as relevant — and hilarious — today as they were then, and there’s really no one better to comment on our modern America than Roseanne,” Dungey said in a statement. \n \n The pickup comes almost 20 years after the Emmy-winning multicam went off the air. The revival will again be a multicamera comedy. \n \n The revival sparked interest from several potential buyers including Netflix, which has revived Full House, Arrested Development and Gilmore Girls. The Roseanne revival was spearheaded by Gilbert, who currently hosts and exec produces the CBS daytime show The Talk. \n \n Gilbert joins original exec producers Barr, Tom Werner and Bruce Helford. Whitney Cummings and Tony Hernandez also exec produce. Like the original series, independent studio Carsey-Werner Television will produce. \n \n Roseanne centered on the working-class Conner family in Illinois and ran on ABC from 1988-97. At its peak, Roseanne ranked as the top series on television during the 1989-90 season and drew nearly 17 million viewers for its final episode. The series has continued to air in reruns on TV Land, CMT and Logo. \n \n The pickup comes as networks, including ABC, have worked hard to better appeal to working-class middle America in the wake of Donald Trump\'s stunning defeat over Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.

ABC\'s cult beloved mystery Twin Peaks is also getting the revival treatment, albeit on Showtime. \n \n Roseanne will be one of two revivals on the Disney-owned broadcaster. The network beat out NBC and Fox to resurrect American Idol only a year after Fox opted to cancel the singing competition. On the unscripted, ABC has also found success with revivals of game shows like Match Game and $100,000 Pyramid. \n \n Roseanne\'s straight-to-series pickup will be ABC\'s lone multicamera comedy on its 2017-18 schedule. ABC recently canceled Last Man Standing and Dr. Ken — its only multicamera shows. The Disney-owned network will start the fall 2017-18 season without a single multicamera comedy on its schedule as pilot Household Name, starring Carol Burnett, is being redeveloped. The format, however, remains popular on CBS, which is home to Big Bang Theory, Mom, Kevin Can Wait, Superior Donuts and Man With a Plan. (Both Big Bang and Mom are executive produced by former Roseanne writer Chuck Lorre.) \n \n In addition to the Will & Grace revival, launching in the fall, NBC has The Carmichael Show and Marlon, both of which are being held for summer. Fox has been out of the multicam business for a few seasons. \n \n Here\'s the full original cast reunited at ABC\'s upfront:']",2,"– Roseanne's return to TV has been confirmed, 20 years to the week after the beloved sitcom's final episode aired.

131,"['Since film magnate Harvey Weinstein was accused of sexual harassment and assault in October, scores of women have come forward as part of the #MeToo movement to say that they, too, have been victims of sexual misconduct. As more and more people come forward with allegations against powerful people and some of those powerful people lose their jobs, some have called the moment in history a tipping point ; others have called it a reckoning . And while many are being taken to task for their alleged misconduct and there is potential for a cultural shift in the way we view sexual harassment and assault, this isn\'t the first time women have publicly spoken out against alleged harassers. In 1991, law professor Anita Hill sat before the Senate Judiciary Committee, led by Senator Joe Biden , and detailed the alleged harassment she experienced from her boss, Clarence Thomas, who was just about to be confirmed as a Supreme Court Justice. Throughout Hill\'s testimony, she weathered attacks on her character and her trustworthiness from those on the Senate panel, and many have blamed Biden for allowing those attacks and failing to do more. Nearly three decades after her testimony, and after Thomas was seated on the court, Biden wants Anita Hill to know that he\'s sorry. \n \n In an interview with Teen Vogue \'s editor in chief, Elaine Welteroth, Biden said there are a few things he would do differently if he could go back and redo those Anita Hill hearings. \n \n ""I believed Anita Hill. I voted against Clarence Thomas. And I insisted the next election — I campaigned for two women Senators on the condition that if they won they would come on the Judiciary Committee, so there would never be again all men making a judgment on this,"" Biden said. ""And my one regret is that I wasn’t able to tone down the attacks on her by some of my Republican friends. I mean, they really went after her. As much as I tried to intervene, I did not have the power to gavel them out of order. I tried to be like a judge and only allow a question that would be relevant to ask."" \n \n But ultimately, Biden said he wasn\'t able to do enough. \n \n ""I wasn’t able to convince three women we’d subpoenaed to cooperate with testimony. At the last minute, they changed their mind and said they wouldn’t do it. I had them sign an affidavit saying, ‘I want you to come, and you’re saying, “No, I will not come.“‘ In retrospect, some, including Anita, think I should have subpoenaed them no matter what,"" he said. ""The reason I didn’t: I was worried they would come and not corroborate what she said and make — I mean, Clarence Thomas won by only two votes. And we still thought we had a chance at beating him."" \n \n ""I wish I had been able to do more for Anita Hill,"" he said. ""I owe her an apology."" \n \n Many, including Hill, have criticized Biden for allowing some of the remarks those on the Committee made, including insinuations that Thomas allegedly talking about women\'s breast sizes was ""not too bad,"" according to The Washington Post. Some even said Biden\'s tone with Hill bordered on disbelief of her accusations. According to Politico , the hearing was ""seen as Biden\'s subjecting an African-American woman to public humiliation and abuse."" In fact, Biden has offered public apologies to Hill before , but she has said it wasn\'t enough. \n \n ""I still don’t think it takes ownership of his role in what happened,"" Hill said in a recent interview with The Washington Post . ""And he also doesn’t understand that it wasn’t just that I felt it was not fair. It was that women were looking to the Senate Judiciary Committee and his leadership to really open the way to have these kinds of hearings. They should have been using best practices to show leadership on this issue on behalf of women’s equality. And they did just the opposite."" \n \n ""You cannot just bring people forward into a process where you know they’re not going to be treated fairly,"" she continued. ""That’s not being heard."" \n \n In the Post interview, Hill said truly being heard is what women are grappling with today during the #MeToo movement. Biden told Teen Vogue something similar. \n \n ""We’re now at a point here where we have a chance to change the culture,"" he said. Biden was clear that harassment is a part of our culture, deeply ingrained and even normalized to a point where we sometimes don\'t even notice it. Through his work on college campuses and involving men in the effort to prevent sexual violence through his It\'s on Us campaign, Biden said he hopes he\'s able to make some headway toward the sea change that\'s clearly coming. \n \n ""I’ve gotten asked by press a lot of the last 23 years, how will I know when I’ve succeeded. We will have succeeded when not a single woman who is abused ever, ever, ever asks herself, What did I do?"" he said. ""We’ve got to change it. We’ve got to change the culture."" \n \n Related: The Surprising Way Experts Are Successfully Combating Sexual Assaults on College Campuses', 'Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n A renegade pastor and his tiny flock set fire to a Koran on a street corner, and made sure to capture it on film. And they were ignored. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n That stunt took place in 2008, involving members of the Westboro Baptist Church from Topeka, Kan., an almost universally condemned group of fundamentalists who also protest at military funerals. \n \n But plans for a similar stunt by another fringe pastor, Terry Jones, have garnered worldwide news media attention this summer, attention that peaked Thursday when he announced he was canceling — and later, that he had only “suspended” — what he had dubbed International Burn a Koran Day. It had been scheduled for Saturday, the ninth anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. \n \n Unlike the Koran-burning by Westboro Baptist, Mr. Jones’s planned event in Gainesville, Fla., coincided with the controversy over the proposed building of a Muslim community center in Lower Manhattan near ground zero and a simmering summerlong debate about the freedoms of speech and religion. \n \n Mr. Jones was able to put himself at the center of those issues by using the news lull of summer and the demands of a 24-hour news cycle to promote his anti-Islam cause. He said he consented to more than 150 interview requests in July and August, each time expressing his extremist views about Islam and Sharia law. \n \n By the middle of this week, the planned Koran burning was the lead story on some network newscasts, and topic No. 1 on cable news — an extraordinary amount of attention for a marginal figure with a very small following. On Thursday, President Obama condemned Mr. Jones’s plan, and his press secretary, Robert Gibbs, said that there were “more people at his press conferences than listen to his sermons,” in a bit of media criticism. \n \n Mr. Jones’s plan, announced in July, slowly gained attention in August, particularly overseas. It became a top story in the United States this week after protests against Mr. Jones in Afghanistan and after the commander of American and NATO forces in Afghanistan, Gen. David H. Petraeus, warned that the Koran burning could endanger troops. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n “Before there were riots and heads of states talking about him, it could have been a couple of paragraphs in a story about Sept. 11 commemorations,” Kathleen Carroll, the executive editor of The Associated Press, said Thursday. “It’s beyond that now.” \n \n In some ways, this week’s events were the culmination of a year’s worth of hateful statements and stunts by Mr. Jones and the few dozen members of his church. \n \n Mr. Jones started to make noise in Gainesville in the summer of 2009, when he posted a sign outside his church that read “Islam is of the devil.” The Gainesville Sun (which is owned by The New York Times Company) wrote about the sign, under the headline “Anti-Islam church sign stirs up community outrage.” \n \n He told The Sun that the sign would not be his last. \n \n The newspaper soon published an investigation into what it called the church’s “financial abuses,” which included a profit-making eBay furniture sales business operating on the church’s property. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n The congregation’s protests continued last fall, when some children from the church wore anti-Islam shirts to school, prompting another article by The Sun, which was picked up by The Associated Press and republished by outlets like USA Today and Al Arabiya, an Arabic language news network. \n \n People with the same anti-Islam shirts sometimes roamed the University of Florida campus in Gainesville, said Fiona Mc Laughlin, a professor at the university, prompting a counterprotest with T-shirts that read, “Ignorance is of the devil.” \n \n The church “never really rested after that first billboard,” said Jacki Levine, the managing editor of The Sun. She said the newspaper’s staff members had repeatedly discussed how to be “responsible” in its coverage — “We walked as carefully as we could walk.” \n \n Islam was not Mr. Jones’s only target. Church members also held protests against Craig Lowe, an openly gay man who was elected mayor of Gainesville in April. \n \n Mr. Jones’s announcement about the Koran burning gained only a little attention at first, with a single short article published by Religion News Service on July 21. That article was subsequently mentioned by Yahoo and other Web sites, and by the end of the July Mr. Jones had been booked on CNN, where the host Rick Sanchez called his plan “crazy” but added, “At least he has got the guts to come on this show and face off.” \n \n Alarmed by negative mentions about Gainesville in overseas news outlets, Mr. Lowe released a statement Aug. 3 labeling Mr. Jones’s church a “tiny fringe group and an embarrassment to our community.” \n \n News executives said the proposed burning took on a greater significance after the protests in Afghanistan and in other Muslim countries. In Kabul last Sunday, up to 500 people attended a protest at which Mr. Jones was burned in effigy, according to The A.P. \n \n That, too, is when Ms. Mc Laughlin took notice. With 11 other professors, she wrote a column for The Sun condemning the plan titled “The world is watching.” \n \n “We just saw everything escalating,” she said Thursday, citing the “sum effect” of all the coverage and the ensuing reactions. (The New York Times wrote a substantial article about Mr. Jones on August 26.) \n \n On Thursday, before Mr. Jones suspended his plans, The A.P. determined that it would not distribute pictures of Korans being burned, restating a policy not to cover events that are “gratuitously manufactured to provoke and offend.” \n \n “There are lots of other similarly offensive images that we choose not to run all the time,” Ms. Carroll said. “Most people don’t know that because, of course, we don’t run them.” \n \n Before the suspension, CNN and Fox News Channel said they would not show any images of a Koran being burned. \n \n Bill Keller, the executive editor of The New York Times, said in an e-mail message that the newspaper had “no policy against publishing things that might offend someone — lots of people are offended by lots of things — but we try to refrain from giving widespread offense unless there is some offsetting journalistic purpose.” \n \n “A picture of a burning book contributes nothing substantial to a story about book-burning, so the offense seems entirely gratuitous,” Mr. Keller continued. “The freedom to publish includes the freedom not to publish.” \n \n The episode has given rise to at least a little soul-searching within news organizations. Chris Cuomo, an ABC News anchor, wrote Thursday afternoon on Twitter, “I am in the media, but think media gave life to this Florida burning ... and that was reckless.”', 'FILE - This Feb. 3, 2012, file photo shows FBI headquarters in Washington.

132,"['It reads like a bad spy thriller. Between November 2016 and October 2017, a strange illness afflicted 24 diplomatic staff members working at the U.S. embassy in Havana, Cuba. Employees reported symptoms such as headaches, confusion, hearing loss. They talked about hearing strange sounds, triggering speculation the Cubans were employing a new acoustic weapon to harass embassy employees. Other scientists dismissed the idea of a sonic weapon as impractical. \n \n On September 1 science reporter William Broad jumped into this morass with a long article in The New York Times. His theory: the Cubans were employing a microwave weapon against U.S. embassy employees, causing sonic delusions and “very real brain damage”. He based his theory on the microwave auditory effect, in which pulses of microwave energy of the sort emitted by radar elicits auditory sensations in exposed individuals. \n \n As the scientist who first proposed the now-accepted explanation of the effect in my 1974 Science article, I find the theory wildly implausible. To elicit auditory sensations, individuals must be exposed to intense but brief (microsecond) pulses of microwave energy. The pulses are sufficient to heat brain tissue by a few microdegrees in a few microseconds, and the resulting thermal expansion launches an acoustic wave in the brain that the subject perceives as sound. The acoustic pressures are many orders of magnitude too weak to cause tissue damage. They elicit audible sensations only because of the exquisite sensitivity of the human auditory system, and represent a near-threshold hearing phenomenon. To actually damage the brain, the microwaves would have to be so intense they would actually burn the subject, which has never happened in any of these incidents. \n \n To induce such an effect, one could cobble together a device from a military radar set or a commercial microwave generator, such as the one I used in my original experiments, and then direct a beam at a distant target. But the difficulty of aiming the beam at a person’s head some distance away would be daunting. You would have to know exactly where the victim’s head is located. You could use a much higher power radar such as that used for airport traffic control and spray the beam over a wide area, but the equipment then would be very large and cumbersome. Microwave antennas could also be embedded within the embassy walls, along with some kind of aiming device, but they would be easy to detect. \n \n But why bother with a device that produces near-threshold hearing sensations? There are simpler ways to harass people if that is the goal. Even now, a year after the incidents were reported, the facts of the matter remain unclear. A follow-up medical examination of 21 of the affected individuals by a neuroscience group led by Doug Smith at the University of Pennsylvania (my colleagues, in fact) found equivocal evidence the individuals had sustained “injury to widespread brain networks”. Neuroskeptic, a neuroscientist who blogs anonymously in Discover magazine, brutally reviewed the Penn study. The blogger and other critical scientists suggested the findings were statistical artifacts due to the many tests the Penn group employed on the subjects. Other scientists have argued psychological factors were involved instead. Taken together, the results seem too scattered to allow firm conclusions to be drawn. \n \n In October 2017 Josh Lederman and Michael Weissenstein from the Associated Press made recordings available of the sounds that the employees reported hearing. If those indeed were the sounds, that would rule out the microwave auditory effect where the microwave-induced vibrations exist only within the head. Chen Yan, Kevin Fu and Wenyuan Xu (of Zhejiang University and the University of Michigan) showed the sounds in the AP recordings are characteristic of those produced by the interaction of two inaudible ultrasound beams via an effect known as intermodulation distortion. Ultrasound is widely used in burglar detectors, room occupancy sensors and other increasingly common appliances, and some individuals report unpleasant audible sensations from such devices. Intermodulation distortion is increasingly being employed to jam microphones used to record concert music illegally or for eavesdropping. Yan and colleagues report ultrasound can be used for eavesdropping purposes as well, by picking up vibrations in objects produced by human speech. \n \n In short, it is reasonable to guess the sounds were inadvertently produced by ultrasound devices, possibly even spy tech, but without malicious intent against the embassy personnel. The incidents occurred about the time of the 2016 U.S. election, and the Cubans undoubtedly were desperate for intelligence about U.S. intentions. \n \n There is even a historical parallel to the recent incidents: In 1972 it became publicly known the Soviets had been irradiating the U.S. embassy in Moscow with low-level microwave energy from the 1950s through the 1970s. Neither side disclosed the reason for this. (A reasonable guess is the Russians were trying to disrupt U.S. listening equipment or to collect data from their own bugs in the building.) The media published hyperbolic stories about supposed attempts to harm the embassy staff, fueling a generation of speculation about microwave “neurowarfare.” \n \n We don’t know all the facts about the earlier incidents or the current ones, and no government is likely to provide them. Much of the information available is distinctly anecdotal. The Times story is not “fake news” but the real facts of the matter may be quite different from those presented by its distinguished journalist.', 'Havana (CNN) A Cuban government investigator looking into reports of mysterious acoustic attacks on US and Canadian diplomats on the communist-run island on Monday dismissed a US government theory that microwave weapons emitting concentrated beams of radiation may have been used in the incidents. \n \n ""If you look at the alleged events, there have been reports that there are several people in a room with thick walls and thick windows and only one person was targeted. This is a kind of weapon that doesn\'t exist,"" said Dr. Mitchell Valdes-Sosa, a well-known neurologist who is part of the Cuban special task force investigating the alleged attacks. ""It\'s science fiction, not science,"" he said. \n \n ""First, it was sonic weapons, now microwave. What\'s next, kryptonite?"" the investigator said in an interview with CNN at his research center in Havana, referring to an earlier theory that sonic weapons emitting high-powered ultrasound waves could have caused the injuries. \n \n Valdes-Sosa said researchers and investigators are working on a paper to rebut the microwave weapons theory. \n \n Previously, the government not only denied involvement in the attacks but cast doubt on whether they actually occurred. In June, Cuba\'s Foreign Ministry said ""political motivations"" drove the United States to withdraw its embassy personnel. \n \n Though a March report based on the examinations of 21 diplomats who served in Cuba didn\'t link the attacks to microwaves, the study\'s lead author, Douglas Smith, director of the University of Pennsylvania\'s Center for Brain Injury and Repair, told The New York Times that US diplomats in Cuba and China likely suffered brain injuries and that microwaves are considered the culprit. \n \n Valdes-Sosa said for a microwave weapon to work it would have to been used at a close distance, and none of the diplomats reported seeing the alleged perpetrators. He said that Cuban authorities had investigated the report that one diplomat who suffered an apparent attack had seen a van speed off and that the vehicle belonged to a church. \n \n While the US has not directly blamed the Cuban government for carrying out the attacks, US officials said Cuba is responsible for safeguarding the diplomats well-being and that Cuban officials would likely know if a third government were responsible. \n \n But Valdes-Sosa said after more than a year of US, Canadian and Cuban investigations there was still no hard proof that any attacks actually took place. \n \n ""For an attack to have occurred you have to have a real victim. First the thing we are not sure is if all these people evacuated from Cuba are really ill or have suffered do something that happened to them,"" Valdes-Sosa said. ""Second, you have to have a perpetrator. Who would be interested? You have to have the opportunity."" \n \n In a Sunday interview with CNN, Smith said microwaves are ""a main suspect"" in causing the diplomats\' injuries, but ultrasound and infrasound were being studied as potential causes as well. \n \n JUST WATCHED State Department pulls employees out of Cuba Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH State Department pulls employees out of Cuba 02:34 \n \n ""It\'s almost like a concussion, but without a concussion -- meaning that they look like individuals who have persistent concussion symptoms but have no history of head impact,"" Smith said, describing the injuries and explaining that learning the cause is vital to determining the best means of preventing it. \n \n ""Just like we have ways to prevent people from having a concussion, you could think of maybe protecting your brain from these energy sources,"" he said. \n \n Most of the attacks came in 2016 and 2017, though there have been a handful of reported incidents this year as well. \n \n A senior administration official told CNN that investigators have torn apart buildings where diplomatic employees encountered the sounds but found no acoustic devices, leading law enforcement to believe that the injuries were the result of microwaves beamed from a nearby location and that the ""sounds"" were merely a means of masking the microwave attacks. \n \n This is only a theory, the official said, and there is no concrete evidence to back it. However, brain scans on the injured personnel showed changes that indicate damage, the official said. \n \n JUST WATCHED Trump: Cuba \'responsible\' for diplomat attacks Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump: Cuba \'responsible\' for diplomat attacks 00:18 \n \n In a statement, the US State Department on Sunday neither confirmed nor denied the possibility that microwaves were behind the diplomatic injuries. \n \n ""The health and well-being of our personnel remains our top priority,"" the statement said. ""The investigation into the origin of these symptoms continues. The inter-agency community is working diligently to determine the cause of the symptoms, as well as to develop mitigation strategies."" \n \n Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said earlier this year he was establishing a Health Incidents Response Task Force , led by Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan and including representatives from the departments of Justice as well as Health and Human Services. \n \n The task force will serve as the ""coordinating body for department and interagency activities, including identification and treatment of affected personnel and family members, investigation and risk mitigation, messaging, and diplomatic outreach,"" Pompeo said in a statement. \n \n The sophistication of the attack has led US officials to suspect a third country is involved, perhaps as retribution against the United States or Canada -- whose diplomats have also been targeted -- or to drive a wedge between those countries and Cuba. \n \n In August 2017, officials included Russia among a list of countries that have an adversarial relationship with the United States and that American investigators suspected might be involved.', 'Burning Man is a lot of things, and every time we try to say what it is or isn’t, we fail. But we do know that there are some things that are undeniably true. One of them is that Burning Man is a family affair. \n \n The latest example we present is Audrey Pickney, one of only two second-generation DPW workers. (Welboy’s son, Corey, is the other, but he’s not able to be here this year.) \n \n Audrey is in her second year of working DPW, after three years working with Gate, Perimeter and Exodus. Her mom, Ridge, is a longtime DPW worker who’s also taking a year off this year, so Audrey is holding down the family presence. \n \n She goes to the School of the Art Institute of the Chicago, where she is studying fashion and fibers, the art of sewing. It’s wildly expensive, but a variety of fellowships and grants have her about a semester and a half from graduation. \n \n You’d think it would be a stretch to come out here after the urban art world in Chicago, but she’s been doing it for so long, it seems perfectly normal. Her first year was 2002, when she was nine years old. That’s right, nine, so she’s kind of a poster child for young Burners, too. \n \n Her mom started coming to Burning Man in 2001, and she loved it, and she thought that Audrey would like it, too. So she brought her, and she’s been coming ever since. She’s missed a Burn here and there for school reasons, but still. That’s a lot of her youth spent in the desert. \n \n “I love it here,” she says down at the Depot as the day winds to a close and the heat is finally letting up. “All my people are here. … I love doing work with my hands, I love the desert … like, why would I not?” \n \n She has an infectious laugh, and her manner is easy and open. She seems so natural at an age, 22, when so many others are still trying to figure out who they are, trying on different personas. But she seems as free of artifice as the desert hills. Did coming out to the Burn help her learn how to deal with stressful conditions with grace and humor? Hard to say, but it seems pretty clear that it didn’t hurt. \n \n Does she think that Burning Man, or coming out to work on the build, is the kind of thing that could last for generations? Could it be handed down, complete with legends and stories and oral histories? \n \n “Well, I don’t know,” she says indulgently. “But my grandpa comes here, too.” \n \n That would be Donovan, whom we met last year at one of the most raucous events of Burning Man, the DPW parade. We made sure to take a picture of all three generations who were attending. And we’d seen that before, the multi-generational experience. But we hadn’t heard of many second-generation DPW workers. \n \n The event has a wild reputation, and deservedly so. You can find a lot of what you’re looking for out here, be it personal growth, sexual exploration, spiritual connection. We can say that Burning Man has earned its reputation, so one could arrive expecting to have a completely wild and racy time. \n \n But it’s not always like that. “It’s like a family and a community of people,” Audrey says. “You know, in the real world, we’re all a bunch of fucking weirdos, and we’re all probably kind of a little bit antisocial. But out here, we’re all like that, like, let it all hang out.” She laughs easily again. “You know?” Yes, we know. \n \n “It’s like the perfect little niche. It’s not for everybody, but if it is for you, you definitely know it.” \n \n In other news: \n \n You may have seen the bug rumors on the internet. We are here to tell you that they are all true. Well maybe not all of the rumors, but the bugs are real. They’re everywhere. They bite. They crawl all over you. They get up and in you. \n \n Twin Peaks, who’s leading the construction of the Center Café, was talking about how bad they are when she jumped a little and pulled her t-shirt away from her body. A good-sized green bug fell to the ground. It had crawled into her bra. \n \n Metal Shop Heather wears a welding mask most of the day. Bugs have crawled up inside her visor and nestled around her eyes. Cammy and Stinger needed some help from the medical team to deal with the infestation; Stinger’s back was covered with nasty red welts from the bites. \n \n What’s going on? We don’t know. We don’t know how the little critters survive in the heat and the sun. All we know is that if you pick up some wood, you’re likely to uncover hundreds or thousands of the things. They’ve blown up inches deep against the sides of the Commissary tent. They’ve covered the carpets at the Depot. They’re all over the Man Base. So it’s not a localized occurrence, it’s everywhere. \n \n We don’t know where they came from, but there are two main theories: One is that all the spring and summer rain has hatched critters that lie dormant, or usually come to life at a different time of year. Or maybe they hitchhiked in on a load of wood from somewhere. Or maybe, as Shade postulated out at Man Base, there’s a Johnny Bugseed making the rounds at night, sprinkling them anywhere and everywhere. \n \n We’ve been blessed by fair skies so far during the build. For the first time in the past several years, there’s been no rain or lightning or hail or high winds to bring things to a crawl. But maybe we are making our way around the various plagues, and this year it’s time for pestilence. \n \n Marcia said that one had flown into her mouth gotten lodged between her teeth. She reports that they are quite bitter to the taste. \n \n We don’t know how long it will last. Cobra Commander said at the morning meeting that high temperatures will be with us again today, and the hope is that the heat and the dryness will knock down the bug population. “Because otherwise we’re gonna have to nuke the city” to get rid of them.']",3,"– Microwave weapons? That's the latest theory being floated to explain the mysterious ailments suffered by staffers at the American embassy in Cuba. But now a pioneering scientist in that field thinks the idea—based on a principle called the microwave auditory effect—is bogus. Kenneth Foster is a professor of bioengineering at Penn who explained the auditory effect in a 1974 study. At Scientific American, he assesses what's known about the Cuban ailments and lays out why it's ""wildly implausible"" that microwaves are to blame. For one thing, any such weapon powerful enough to cause brain damage would almost certainly burn the victims, too, and that didn't happen. Instead, Foster suggests that a much simpler explanation is likely. ""It is reasonable to guess the sounds were inadvertently produced by ultrasound devices, possibly even spytech, but without malicious intent against the embassy personnel,"" he writes. Foster cites this earlier investigation from the AP revealing the sounds that the victims are believed to have heard, and he says the sounds are consistent with ultrasound devices interacting with each other. It makes sense to him that the Cubans might have been trying to listen in on Americans with these relatively common gizmos. ""The incidents occurred about the time of the 2016 US election, and the Cubans undoubtedly were desperate for intelligence about US intentions."" A Cuban scientist, meanwhile, agrees that the microwave theory is far-fetched. ""First, it was sonic weapons, now microwave,"" he told CNN. ""What's next, kryptonite?"""

Parker is in the middle of a $50 million contract with the Spurs.As for whether Chris Brown or Drake will be added as defendants, Parker\'s lawyer,, tells TMZ ... he\'s waiting for the results of the police investigation. He also wants to review the surveillance tape before making his decision.', 'This wasn’t the kind of bottle service NBA star Tony Parker had in mind. \n \n The San Antonio Spurs guard (pictured) — injured in the Chris Brown-Drake melee at a SoHo nightclub — filed a $20 million lawsuit against its owners yesterday, saying they should have known better than to let the Rihanna love rivals in at the same time. \n \n In papers filed in Manhattan Supreme Court, Parker holds W.i.P.’s owners responsible for the “corneal laceration of the left eye and other injuries” he suffered in the bottle-throwing brawl at the now-shuttered Vandam Street club. \n \n His lawyer, David Jaroslawicz, said the extent of Parker’s wounds aren’t yet known, but noted eye injuries “certainly don’t improve your outside shot.” \n \n The suit does not name Brown or Drake, who have both dated Rihanna, as defendants, but blames the club for creating the combustible combination. \n \n “She’s been known, like Helen of Troy, to cause trouble,” Jaroslawicz said. \n \n Sources said Drake, 25, sent Brown, 23, into a rage when his table sent over a note that read, “I am f–king the love of your life.” \n \n Brown had just bought the hip-hop star a pricey bottle of champagne, sources said. Drake’s camp maintains the fight was instigated by a member of Brown’s crew. \n \n Jaroslawicz said it’s the club’s fault. By selling both camps bottle service, “you’re throwing gasoline on the flames,” he said. \n \n The suit says Parker, 30, ex-hubby of actress Eva Longoria, wasn’t sitting with either camp. But he has said he was “with my friend Chris Brown” when the problems started. “They started throwing bottles everywhere,” he said. \n \n Parker, slated to play with the French team at the Summer Olympics, said he’ll be sidelined for a week as he heals with the aid of a “therapeutic” contact lens. \n \n “I’ll be missing the start of the French team because I can’t do anything for a week except keep the lens in and then take drops,” he said. \n \n A representative for the club declined to comment.', 'MINNEAPOLIS -- The 2014 All-Star Game was one big love poem to Derek Jeter, and National League starting pitcher Adam Wainwright did more than any other player on the premises to advance the feel-good storyline. \n \n As Jeter strolled toward home plate in the bottom of the first inning, Wainwright laid his glove on the mound, took a walk toward second base and joined in the wall-to-wall applause at Target Field. When Jeter finally dug his left toe in the box and got down to business, the pitcher-batter staredown turned into a test of wills. \n \n ""He told me, \'Let\'s go,\' and I told him no,"" Wainwright said later. ""It\'s the only time I\'ll ever tell Derek Jeter no."" \n \n So it was almost impossible to comprehend how Wainwright\'s show of respect would quickly be forgotten, a celebration would elicit controversy, and the pitcher\'s well-intentioned mix of candor and good humor would somehow brand him as the villain of the evening. In this age of instant information dissemination and rapid reactions, Wainwright learned the hard way that too much honesty can turn a stand-up guy into a Twitter piñata. \n \n Before throwing a pitch, Adam Wainwright put his glove on the rubber and stepped back to let Derek Jeter have a moment. Rob Carr/Getty Images \n \n Shortly after giving up an opposite-field double to Jeter, a triple to Mike Trout and a home run to Miguel Cabrera that helped propel the American League to a 5-3 victory over the National League, Wainwright inadvertently stepped in it big-time. While reflecting on Jeter\'s at-bat, he provided one detail too many. \n \n ""I was going to give him a couple of pipe shots,"" Wainwright said. ""He deserved it. I didn\'t know he was going to hit a double or I would have changed my mind. I thought he was going to hit something hard to the right side for a single or an out. I probably should have pitched him a little bit better."" \n \n Chances are the negative fallout from the event will blow over relatively quickly. But this much is certain: Wainwright\'s biggest claim to fame in New York will no longer be freezing Mets outfielder Carlos Beltran with a curveball in the ninth inning of Game 7 in the 2006 National League Championship Series. \n \n Wainwright will undoubtedly be subjected to his share of criticism over the coming days. He will be accused of raining on Jeter\'s parade, of cheapening the Captain\'s moment and of undermining the integrity of the All-Star Game. He understands that better than anyone, which is why he spent the better part of 10 minutes after the game flogging himself for his bad judgment. \n \n He referred to himself as a ""knucklehead"" and an ""idiot"" while simultaneously expressing regret that his choice of words might have taken away from Jeter\'s big moment. \n \n ""If I\'m going to get taken to the slaughterhouse for saying a stupid phrase, then I deserve it,"" Wainwright said. ""If you can\'t laugh at yourself when you mess up, then you\'re going to continue to mess up. And you know what? I messed up. But I didn\'t try to let him get a hit. I messed up by speaking afterward."" \n \n For all the mixed messages and confusion that Wainwright elicited Tuesday, he probably did Major League Baseball a favor by exposing the massive problems inherent with what the All-Star Game has become in recent years. If there were any doubt, commissioner Bud Selig\'s ""This One Counts"" initiative has outlived its usefulness and needs to be put to rest before the 2015 All-Star Game in Cincinnati. \n \n It has been 11 years since MLB began awarding home-field advantage in the World Series to the AL or NL team based on the outcome of the All-Star Game, and Selig maintains that the system has achieved its purpose by elevating a quaint midsummer exhibition into must-see summer viewing. If raising the stakes can increase the suspense and prompt more viewers to tune in to the game, that\'s obviously a good thing. And as Selig is fond of saying, the old system of alternating home-field advantage between leagues from one year to the next wasn\'t exactly ""Einstein\'s theory of relativity."" \n \n After putting Derek Jeter on base, it wasn\'t long before Adam Wainwright had reason to regret it. Scott Rovak/USA TODAY Sports \n \n But as the Wainwright-Jeter flap shows, the system has way too many pitfalls and minefields to be viable anymore. \n \n MLB can\'t attach paramount importance to the All-Star Game when fans elect the starters, players have a say in the process, managers round out the rosters, and fans have yet another say in the Internet Final Vote. There are just too many constituencies to satisfy, and the voting becomes one big hash. \n \n If home-field advantage in the World Series is at stake, every team should not have a representative, as is the custom, and the best players need to stick around for the long haul rather than make cameos. A prime example is Trout, who would have played all nine innings Tuesday instead of exiting in the sixth inning with a double, a triple and two RBIs in three at-bats. \n \n And while this might seem sacrilegious, you can debate whether Jeter should have even been playing in the All-Star Game this year if it were strictly about winning. Of the 12 American League shortstops who qualify for the batting title, Jeter ranks 11th with a .647 OPS -- ahead of only Seattle\'s Brad Miller. Jeter deserved to be in Minneapolis for his class, fan appeal and overall body of work, and it would have been a crime for fans to miss a chance to say goodbye to him. But even a die-hard Yankees rooter might have trouble justifying Jeter batting leadoff for the AL squad if this were strictly about ""This One Counts."" \n \n Some Yankees fans will claim that Wainwright\'s ""pipe shot"" phrase was disrespectful to Jeter because it implied that The Captain couldn\'t have gotten a hit without a helping hand. If so, they\'re a lot more sensitive than Jeter, who was content to let things slide when informed of Wainwright\'s comments after the game. \n \n ""If he grooved it, thank you,"" Jeter said. ""You still have to hit it."" \n \n That\'s the perspective and self-assurance of a man who has 3,408 hits and five World Series rings on his résumé and knows that he will be going to the Hall of Fame on the first ballot. \n \n The flap over Wainwright\'s grooved pitch reflects the changing mindset that linking World Series home-field advantage has wrought. When Chan Ho Park allegedly grooved a pitch to Cal Ripken Jr. in the Iron Man\'s final All-Star appearance in 2001, it was perceived as more a sign of generosity than a major breach of etiquette. But then, if Park did feed Ripken a ""pipe shot,"" he at least had the good sense to keep quiet about it. \n \n Sometimes the line between showmanship and winning tends to blur at the All-Star Game. Two years ago, Justin Verlander gave up five runs in the first inning of the AL\'s 8-0 loss in Kansas City and admitted that he wanted to light up the radar gun. \n \n ""I know this game means something,"" Verlander said at the time, ""but we\'re here for the fans, and I know the fans don\'t want to see me throw 90 [mph] and hit the corners. Just let it eat and have fun."" \n \n Wainwright\'s biggest sin, in contrast, was trying to balance competition, respect for a distinguished elder and his natural inclination to avoid conducting media interviews like a garden-variety baseball robot. In exchange for spreading himself too thin, he almost blew up Twitter. \n \n ""People in New York already don\'t like me, so anything else I say will just fuel the fire there,"" Wainwright said before leaving Target Field. ""I should probably hush up."" \n \n It\'s a little late for that. But if Wainwright\'s experience at the 2014 All-Star Game can prompt MLB to take a hard look at the event and what it should be, maybe his long, emotional night in Minnesota will have been worth it.']",3,"– The fallout from Chris Brown's throwdown with Drake's entourage continues: Now Tony Parker is suing the New York City nightclub where it happened for a cool $20 million. The NBA star says the club, WiP, should have known that allowing Brown and Drake—who've both been involved with Rihanna—in at the same time was a terrible idea. Thus, the lawsuit claims, the club owners are responsible for the injuries he suffered in the fight. Those injuries include a ""corneal laceration of the left eye,"" the lawsuit claims, and Parker's lawyer notes that eye injuries ""certainly don't improve your outside shot."" The lawyer also, amusingly, says of Rihanna: ""She’s been known, like Helen of Troy, to cause trouble."" The brawl started after Drake sent the following classy note to Brown's table, sources tell the New York Post: ""I am f***ing the love of your life."" Neither Brown nor Drake are named in the suit. TMZ has photos of Parker at the club moments before the fight."

The president's latest financial disclosure forms, released yesterday, reveal that he and Michelle had total assets worth somewhere between $1.8 million and $7 million in 2013, the AP reports. (That's just like 2012.) Most of that is in US Treasury notes, which are worth between $1 million and $5 million. Other assets include Vanguard retirement funds and college saving funds. Current financial disclosure rules only require politicians to list their assets within a broad range, so it's hard to pin down exactly how much Obama has, the New York Times explains. Besides his presidential salary, Obama makes most of his money off royalties from his books, though the market seems to believe he peaked as a writer in the '90s. His latest, 2010's Of Thee I Sing, A Letter to My Daughters, earned between $5,001 and $15,000, compared to $50,001-$100,000 for 1995's Dreams From My Father.

He said Mr Trump\'s decision was a grave disappointment for places like his Pacific island nation and US coastal cities like New York and Miami that are vulnerable to climate change. \n \n He said he was deeply disappointed by Mr Trump\'s decision and did what he could to try to persuade Mr Trump to stick with the agreement as nations tackle ""the greatest challenge our planet has ever faced"". He said he was convinced the US will eventually rejoin. \n \n Before Mr Trump announced his decision Thursday afternoon, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang told reporters during a visit to Berlin that fighting global warming was a ""global consensus"" and an ""international responsibility."" \n \n Japan, Australia, New Zealand and South Korea also regretted the US move and reiterated their commitment to implement the agreement. \n \n Speaking in Tokyo the Japanese finance minister, Taro Aso, angrily suggested the decision showed America\'s chronic failure to commit. He compared Mr Trump\'s move to America\'s historic role in establishing the abortive League of Nations after the First World War. He described a pattern of the US helping set up initiatives before dropping out of them, adding: ""I think that\'s just how they are.""']",2,"– Queen Elizabeth II is now the longest-tenured monarch in British history, surpassing her great-great-grandmother Victoria's 23,226 days, 16 hours, and 23 minutes as queen sometime around 5:30pm local time, reports the BBC. The time is approximate because no one is actually sure when regular Elizabeth became Queen Elizabeth. There are no gaps between British monarchs, so Elizabeth became queen as soon as her father King George VI died. However, he died in his sleep, and no one is quite sure exactly when he passed, explains Time. Maclean's reports Britain rang church bells and lit bonfires to celebrate Queen Victoria's record-setting reign, but Elizabeth's day is being celebrated in more low-key fashion. ""The event is important and unprecedented; just don't expect a big party,"" Maclean's states. Still, a flotilla of boats on the Thames was marking the occasion, and crowds cheered the queen when she appeared in public."
136,"['Academy cringing over news of Sacha Baron Cohen’s rumored Oscars stunt Rumored to be hitting red carpet in \'The Dictator\' costume \n \n Sacha Baron Cohen has been blacklisted from the red carpet on Hollywood\'s biggest night. \n \n The actor\'s tickets for Sunday\'s 84th Academy Awards ceremony have been rescinded amid fears he would attend in full costume as the character from HIS upcoming flick ""The Dictator,"" Deadline.com reported. \n \n The unusual move was taken by the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts & Sciences after rumors circulated that Cohen would violate the decorum of the awards show with the publicity stunt. \n \n ""Unless they\'re assured that nothing entertaining is going to happen on the Red Carpet, the Academy is not admitting Sacha Baron Cohen to the show,"" an insider told Deadline\'s Nikki Finke. \n \n Astrid Stawiarz/Getty Images \n \n Cohen had been invited to attend the Oscars as a member of the cast of the best picture nominee “Hugo”. \n \n The 40-year-old British comic, however, has built his career on edgier material - famously staying in character as he turns unsuspecting passersby into the butts of his jokes in movies like 2006\'s ""Borat: Cultural Learnings of AMerica for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan"" and 2009\'s ""Bruno."" \n \n His role in the upcoming ""The Dictator"" was described by the Hollywood Reporter as a “sex-crazed Gaddafi-meets-Hussein ruler who fights to stop democracy from coming to his country.” \n \n The movie, which also stars Anna Faris, B.J. Novak and John C. Reilly, is slated to be released May 11.', 'Will Sacha Baron Cohen’s ‘The Dictator’ Walk The Oscar Red Carpet? \n \n UPDATED 5:30 PM WITH MORE DETAILS \n \n EXCLUSIVE… BREAKING 3PM… The Academy Of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences has pulled actor Sacha Baron Cohen‘s tickets from the 84th Academy Awards. This means he is banned from attending the Oscars even though he is an Academy member and one of the stars from Hugo, Paramount’s 11-nominated movie and Best Picture contender. “Unless they’re assured that nothing entertaining is going to happen on the Red Carpet, the Academy is not admitting Sacha Baron Cohen to the show,” Paramount just told me. The reason is that a proposal reached the Academy for Baron Cohen to strut the Red Carpet in full costume as his title character in the upcoming Paramount comedy The Dictator. UPDATE AT 5:30 PM: Later today, faced with all the bad publicity resulting from its action, the Academy tried to parse what it did when questioned by some media outlets. But the fact is that, this morning, the Academy’s Managing Director Of Membership Kimberly Rouch phoned Paramont’s awards staff to say Baron Cohen’s tickets had been pulled unless he gives the Academy assurances ahead of time promising not to show up on the Red Carpet in costume and not to promote the movie on the Red Carpet. The Academy made it clear that, without those assurances, it would not issue him the tickets. So he’s banned.* \n \n Of course, the next best thing to that publicity stunt is all the media coverage which this ban is going to generate for Baron Cohen’s film. So the Academy has decided to act like dictators about the actor playing The Dictator. Ugh. \n \n Sancha Baron Cohen Today Show Video \n \n Loosen up, people. Frankly, the Academy looks like uptight wankers with this treatment of one of the globe’s funniest comedians. The Academy merely had to say no when that proposal was presented to it. Everyone involved in the ceremony was adamantly against it on the grounds that it makes a mockery of what Hollywood considers its most prestigious event. Instead, the Academy clearly wants another overly long, ridiculously reverential show about movies no one bothered to see where the best thing about the telecast will be the comeback of popular host Billy Crystal at age 63. \n \n UPDATE: Is Academy Blinking On Banning Sacha Baron Cohen From Oscars 2012? \n \n The Dictator is a spoof about the “heroic story of a Middle Eastern dictator who risks his life to ensure that democracy never comes to the country he so lovingly oppressed”. Whether the fact that the 84th Academy Awards will be beamed into 200 countries had anything to do with this ban is unclear. But it is highly unusual for the Academy to pull a member’s tickets. An Oscars spokesperson acknowledged to Deadline yesterday: ”We would hope that every studio knows that this is a bad idea. The Red Carpet is not about stunting.” Oh really? Then why did Trey Parker and Matt Stone of South Park crossdress down the Red Carpet as J-Lo and Gwyneth Paltrow in evening gowns in 2000? Or Ben Stiller appear as an Oscar presenter in full blue Avatar makeup and hair in 2010? \n \n Deadline reported yesterday that Baron Cohen’s plan was to come dressed as The Dictator and then change into a tuxedo and attend the Oscars as planned. He wasn’t scheduled to present an award, but he was arriving at Kodak Theatre as part of the Paramount contingent. Now he can’t do even that. Paramount has a Best Picture nominee in the Martin Scorsese-directed Hugo in which Baron Cohen plays the train station inspector of the movie about an orphan in 1930s Paris. \n \n At the 2007 Oscars, Baron Cohen was asked to be a presenter and said he would do it only if he could be in character as Borat. And Oscars’ Powers That Be said, “No way.” He didn’t attend. But this is the first time he has been officially banned from the show. \n \n Purists feel that the Oscars is no place for such in your face promotion. The Academy hasn’t even allowed movies to be advertised during the Oscarcast, until this year. Then again, these Oscars have very little suspense because it’s a forgone conclusion that many of the winners of the marquee categories are already known and The Artist will win Best Picture. The prospect of Baron Cohen’s Red Carpet walk was the closest thing to drama. \n \n This would not have been Baron Cohen’s first time upstaging an awards show. To promote Bruno, he flew through the air at the MTV Movie Awards and landed with his crotch in the face of Eminem, who later admitted the stunt was rehearsed. And a trailer for The Dictator certainly was one of the raciest ever allowed by the MPAA during the Super Bowl, where Baron Cohen’s character was hilariously depicted running a competitive race while and leg-shooting rivals with a starter pistol as they got close to him. \n \n Editor-in-Chief Nikki Finke - tip her here.', 'Contrary to reports, the Academy has not yet pulled Sacha Baron Cohen\'s Oscar tickets over his plan to appear on the red carpet in character for his next movie — but that could still happen \n \n According to an executive with the Academy who did not wish to be identified, AMPAS officials have been in touch with representatives for Baron Cohen since they learned of his plan to attend the Oscars in costume as the title character in ""The Dictator."" \n \n Their message to British comic was clear: ""Our red carpet is not for stunting."" \n \n The Academy is now waiting for a response from Baron Cohen\'s camp; once they receive one, they will decide whether he can use the tickets he received as a cast member of the Best Picture nominee ""Hugo."" \n \n Baron Cohen would have done red carpet interviews in character – and if his past appearances as Borat and Bruno were any indication, would have used the occasion to be disruptive (and probably pretty funny). \n \n Also read: \'The Dictator\' Trailer: Sacha Baron Cohen Laughs in the Face of Tyranny (Video) \n \n Baron Cohen caused problems for the Oscars four years ago, when they asked him to present but he insisted on doing so only in character, as Borat. The Academy refused. \n \n The Oscars have a history of being uncomfortable with the unpredictable. Last year, AMPAS executives were worried that Banksy, director of the nominated documentary ""Exit Through the Gift Shop,"" would try to take the stage in disguise. \n \n Speaking of a conversation he had with representatives for the elusive graffiti artist, Academy president Tom Sherak said, ""We suggested to them that it might be a good idea that if he did win, one of them would accept in his place – that it would not be dignified for the Academy to have somebody come up wearing a monkey\'s head."" \n \n (Angry reps for Banksy disputed that he ever wore a monkey mask in public.) \n \n Also read: Steve Pond\'s Oscar Picks: \'The Artist\' Will Win, but Should It? \n \n The Academy wasn\'t amused in 2000, when Best Song nominees Trey Parker and Matt Stone (""South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut"") showed up in knockoffs of the famous awards-show gowns worn by Jennifer Lopez and Gwyneth Paltrow. \n \n Parker and Stone had not cleared their plan with the Academy before that show – and, they said, they got plenty of dirty looks (plus a thumbs-up from Michael Caine) as they walked the red carpet. \n \n Baron Cohen was reportedly planning to do something similar, wearing his ""Dictator"" outfit for an in-character trip down the red carpet and then changing into a tux for the show. \n \n Using an Oscar appearance to promote an upcoming film is not, of course, completely unknown. This year\'s host, Billy Crystal, did just that in 1991 when he made his entrance on a horse before the release of ""City Slickers,"" and Ben Stiller appeared onstage in his ""Starsky and Hutch"" costume in 2004. \n \n But those were onstage, where it was sanctioned and controlled. The red carpet is something else – out there, the Academy doesn\'t like wild cards.

And you know, I don’t know if anyone explained to her you have to spend 3 nights a week in Columbus. So, how does that work out for you? Umm, I waited until I was 48 til my kids were raised, and at least adults, before we took the opportunity to try.’ \n \n He questioned my intelligence, insinuating I was not aware of the requirements of the State Representative Position. Mr. Patton also specifically implied that I am precluded from running for office until my kids were adults. \n \n The decision to run for State Representative is one that my family and I took very seriously when we made it. We realize the sacrifice that is involved in holding such a position. \n \n However, Tom Patton has crossed a line by trying to turn the fact that I am a mother of two children, into a negative campaign issue. It’s insulting for my opponent to suggest that “motherhood” is a liability. In fact, my experience as a Mom is perhaps my greatest strength. \n \n There are numerous examples of women with children who have admirably served our nation. Sarah Palin was on the Presidential ticket in 2008. At the time she had 5 non adult children, including a newborn. Cathy McMorris Rodgers is the 4th highest ranking member of the Republican Leadership in the in the US House of Representatives, and has had two children while in office. Lieutenant Governor Mary Taylor has two sons she has raised while serving in her current role, as well as during her time in the Ohio House and as State Auditor. Ohio House Representative Christina Hagan just welcomed her daughter last December and is now back serving her constituents. \n \n I would also be remiss if I did not recognize the men who also serve while they have children at home. For example, our own Governor John Kasich has two teenage daughters. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan’s three children have all been born while he has been in Congress. He commutes weekly between Washington D.C. and his home in Janesville, Wisconsin. \n \n So I ask Mr.Patton, by your logic, are you saying that 2 Vice Presidential nominees, the highest ranking woman in The House Leadership Team, our sitting Governor and Lieutenant Governor and a colleague in the Ohio Legislature are all unfit to serve? Further, are your colleagues in the Ohio Legislature, the majority whom have had young children while serving, aware of your views? Do you draw a distinction between whether that representative is a mother or a father who is serving? \n \n I call on The Cuyahoga County Republican Party, The Ohio Republican Party, and any other organizations endorsing a candidate in this race to seriously consider whether Tom Patton’s comments reflect your own values. By choosing to my support my opponent, you are tacitly endorsing his beliefs regarding the inability of parents of children to also serve in the legislature. In a district that is composed of over 50% women, with many parents who successfully balance demanding jobs as well as a family, there is no place for this kind of anti-working parent mentality. \n \n And once last thing, Tom, only one man in my life is allowed to call me “sweetie.” From now on, I respectfully ask you to refer to me as Jen, Jennifer, Ms. Herold, or your opponent.” \n \n Ms. Herold encourages those who denounce Tom Patton’s comments to make their voices heard by signing our petition at http://www.ipetitions.com/petition/ISupportJen. In addition, they may tweet support using the Hashtag #ISupportJen. Follow Jen on Twitter @Herold4Ohio. \n \n For more information, please visit our website at www.HeroldForOhio.com.

Baron Cohen had been invited as one of the stars of Best Picture contender Hugo, ""but our red carpet is not for stunting,"" an Academy official tells Reuters. With most of this year's Oscar winners looking like a foregone conclusion, ""the prospect of Baron Cohen’s red carpet walk was the closest thing to drama"" viewers could expect this year, notes Nikki Finke at Deadline.

138,"['WASHINGTON — Two and a half weeks after Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta announced an inquiry into e-mail exchanges between Gen. John R. Allen of the Marines and a socialite in Tampa, Fla., some 15 investigators working seven days a week in the Pentagon inspector general’s office have narrowed their focus to 60 to 70 e-mails that “bear a fair amount of scrutiny,” a defense official said. \n \n The official did not disclose the content of the e-mails, but senior Pentagon officials have described the voluminous correspondence between General Allen, the top NATO commander in Afghanistan, and the socialite, Jill Kelley, as potentially “inappropriate communication.” Law enforcement officials say the e-mails number in the hundreds and cover a period of two and a half years starting in 2010, when General Allen was the deputy commander of Central Command, based in Tampa. \n \n The investigation, which is delaying and could derail General Allen’s appointment to be the NATO supreme allied commander in Europe, is on a fast track but is unlikely to be completed before the end of the year. Investigations of senior officers in the inspector general’s office usually take about seven months on average, although normally there are only two or three investigators assigned to a case. \n \n The defense official, who asked not to be named because of the nature of the inquiry, said investigators were trying to determine whether the e-mails violated Defense Department policy, government regulations or military law. They were discovered in the course of an F.B.I. investigation into anonymous e-mails to Ms. Kelley warning her to stay away from David H. Petraeus, then the C.I.A. director. The F.B.I. found that the e-mails had been sent by Paula Broadwell, Mr. Petraeus’s biographer; he admitted to having had an affair with Ms. Broadwell and resigned on Nov. 9. \n \n Like General Allen, Mr. Petraeus, a retired four-star general, was a social acquaintance of Ms. Kelley when he was stationed at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, headquarters of the Central Command. \n \n The e-mails between General Allen and Ms. Kelley were sent to the Pentagon by the F.B.I. on Nov. 11. “They just forwarded the evidence,” the official said, referring to the F.B.I. “People have to go through and decide if they fit one of three potential violations.” Those violations include misconduct, which could range from inappropriate language on a government computer to adultery, prohibited under military law; more than an incidental use of government property for personal matters; and security breaches. \n \n The defense official said there was no evidence so far that there had been security violations. General Allen, who is in Kabul planning the drawdown of American forces from Afghanistan, is cooperating with the investigation and has said through associates that he did not commit adultery. The inquiry does not appear to have progressed to interviews with General Allen, 58, who is married and the father of two, or Ms. Kelley, 37, the wife of a cancer surgeon and the mother of three. \n \n Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., who has been nominated to succeed General Allen as part of a regular military rotation, is expected to be confirmed by the Senate before the end of the year and to be in Kabul by February. General Allen is expected to return to the United States at that time, but it is unclear what he will do. \n \n There have been conflicting accounts of the nature of the e-mails between him and Ms. Kelley. A law enforcement official has described some of them as sexually explicit. Pentagon officials briefed on the matter say they have been told that half a dozen are embarrassing. But General Allen’s associates say they are innocuous and contain little beyond language like “you’re a sweetheart.” \n \n Although Ms. Kelley’s e-mail correspondence with General Allen has not been made public, dozens of her e-mails to Mayor Bob Buckhorn of Tampa have been released under Florida’s public record laws and refer to her friendship with both General Allen and Mr. Petraeus. \n \n A year ago, after inviting the mayor to a birthday party for one of her children, she added a casual P.S.: “I’ll be in DC this weekend with Petraeus, but let’s set up a double date when I return!” Last January, she wrote to a mayoral aide, “I’m up in DC having dinner tonight with Gen. Petraeus and Gen. John Allen.”', 'A test to determine if elderly patients will die within 30 days of being admitted to hospital has been developed by doctors to give them the chance to go home or say goodbye to loved ones. \n \n Health experts say the checklist will prevent futile and expensive medical treatments which merely prolong suffering. \n \n The screening test looks at 29 indicators of health, including age, frailty, illness, mental impairment, previous emergency admissions and heart rate and produces a percentage chance of death within one month and 12 weeks. \n \n Researchers say the aim of Critera for Screening and Triaging to Appropriate aLternative care, or CriSTAL for short, is to kick-start frank discussions about end of life care, and minimise the risk of invasive ineffective treatment. \n \n “Delaying unavoidable death contributes to unsustainable and escalating healthcare costs, despite aggressive and expensive interventions,” said lead author Dr Magnolia Cardona-Morrel, a researcher at the University of New South Wales. \n \n “These interventions may not influence patient outcome; often do not improve the patient’s quality of life; may compromise bereavement outcomes for families; and cause frustration for health professionals.” \n \n Earlier this week Professor Sir Mike Richards, the Chief Inspector of Hospitals for the Care Quality Commission, warned that dying patients are receiving wide variations in care because of hospital failure to replace the Liverpool Care Pathway. \n \n The controversial end-of-life plan was scrapped after a review of the regime found that hospital staff wrongly interpreted its guidance for care of the dying, leading to patients being drugged and deprived of fluids in their last weeks of life. \n \n The Health Select Committee is currently examining palliative and end of life care in the wake of the LCP controversy. \n \n However the new test aims to provide a ‘starting point’ for ‘honest communication with patients and families about recognising that dying is part of the life cycle’ \n \n Researchers looked at 112 peer-reviewed studies to find out which tests and questions were the best predictors of death. \n \n They claim the test will help doctors and nurses who are often under great pressure from family members and society to prolong the life of patients at all costs. \n \n “While there are accepted policies for de-escalating treatment in terminally ill patients, there are also inherent and societal pressures on medicine to continue utilising technological advances to prolong life even in plainly futile situations,” said Dr Cardona-Morrel. \n \n “Training for nurses and doctors in the use of the screening tool and in approaching patients and families with concrete information about inevitability of death and lack of benefit of further intensive treatment are paramount.” \n \n Most patients end up dying in hospital, even though that is not their stated preference, when asked. \n \n Caroline Abrahams, Charity Director at Age UK, said:“The best time to begin discussing end of life issues and an older person’s wishes, is well in advance, when they are fit and well, but we acknowledge that this isn’t always possible. \n \n “The ability to accurately identify people entering hospital who are nearing the end of their lives ought to help ensure they receive high quality care, appropriate to their needs, so we welcome this development. However, in practice, access to good end of life care services remains extremely variable and discussions with older people and their families about this most difficult of subjects are not always handled sensitively and well. \n \n “So as well as improved analysis and triage of people’s needs, better training and support for medical staff in speaking compassionately with older people and their families about end of life care is also required. “ \n \n By giving families and patients some options about the preferred place of death, the test could also help terminally ill elderly people choose to go home, the authors said. \n \n The checklist is yet to be tested but the researchers hope it will eventually be used for all hospital admissions. \n \n The research was published in the BMJ Open publication Supportive & Palliative Care.']",2,"– The Pentagon inspector general’s office didn't take the Gen. John Allen-Jill Kelley email exchange lightly, assigning 15 investigators toiling seven days a week to review the thousands of pages of documents. They've now sussed out between 60 and 70 emails that ""bear a fair amount of scrutiny,"" according to a defense official, who didn't elaborate on what those emails might contain. The New York Times reports the purpose of the investigation, which likely won't conclude until 2013, is to determine if one of three violations occurred: misconduct (ie, adultery or inappropriate language), substantial use of government property for personal matters, or a security breach. Those investigators aren't the only ones getting busy. A previously silent Kelley is now defending herself, through her attorney. Abbe Lowell, a big-time Washington lawyer who has represented Bill Clinton and John Edwards, yesterday released emails, phone recordings, and more evidence that, he says, prove Kelley did not try to exploit her relationship with David Petraeus. He also sent out three letters connected to the scandal, the AP reports: He asked the US Attorney's Office in Tampa why Kelley's name was released in the first place, adding that federal privacy laws could apply. He wrote another letter to a businessman Kelley was trying to help make a deal with South Korea, before she lost her honorary consul status. The businessman, Adam Victor, has said in interviews that Kelley was not a skilled negotiator, and Lowell says he defamed her in an attempt to bask in his ""15 minutes of fame."" In a letter to the Attorney Consumer Assistance Program (which fields complaints about lawyers), Lowell accuses attorney Barry Cohen of talking publicly about conversations he had with Kelley in 2009, thus breaking attorney-client privilege."
139,"['Sept. 6, 2017: A recently filed lawsuit in Dallas County District Court blames negligence on behalf of the Boy Scouts of America for the death of Reid Comita, a Fort Worth teen. (Photo: WFAA) \n \n DALLAS-- A recently filed lawsuit in Dallas County District Court blames negligence on behalf of the Boy Scouts of America for the death of a Fort Worth teen three months ago. \n \n Reid Comita,15, died from heat stroke while hiking at Buffalo Trail Scout Ranch in June. \n \n ""The Boy Scouts of America are responsible for my son\'s death. It\'s that simple. They are responsible,"" John Comita told WFAA in a sit-down interview. \n \n The new lawsuit outlines a series of allegations surrounding Reid\'s death, namely that he was ""...sent on an extremely aggressive hike"" in temperatures hovering around 100 degrees with a heat index well over that. \n \n The Comita family had specifically signed Reid up for an introductory backpacking class, under adult supervision, because they felt it was the safest option for their son. \n \n ""He wasn\'t an athlete. He wasn\'t prepared to go on an advanced hike,"" his father said. \n \n Photos from the camp\'s Facebook page show rugged, mountainous terrain meandering through Jeff Davis County in southwest Texas. \n \n The petition further contends that Reid didn\'t receive proper training at the camp before being sent out on the more advanced hike and that he was accompanied by only two other teenagers, not the required two adults. \n \n The circumstances have left Copper Comita, Reid\'s mother, baffled, angry and crushed. \n \n ""It doesn\'t take it away. It doesn\'t make it any better. It\'s just that much more pain,"" said Copper. \n \n The lawsuit also outlines communication issues, claiming the Comita family wasn\'t notified of his death for more than four hours. \n \n ""We were calling, and no one could give us a straight answer as to how he was,"" said Copper. \n \n The backpacking course would have been Reid\'s final task to accomplish Eagle Scout. His troop has since awarded him the honor posthumously. \n \n ""His friends, his troop, have been great,"" says John. ""But we haven\'t heard from the BSA or organization at all."" \n \n The BSA sent WFAA the following statement: \n \n “This remains a difficult time for our Scouting community, and we continue to keep the family in our thoughts and prayers. The health and safety of our youth members is of paramount importance to the BSA, and integral to everything we do. We strive to create a safe environment for youth to experience outdoor adventure."" \n \n For Copper, the loss of a son who excelled in studies and choir when he wasn\'t earning merit badges, is a void that simply can\'t be filled. \n \n ""He was very special,"" she said. \n \n John says he grew up participating in the Boy Scouts, and that he always felt it was something he could proudly share with his son. \n \n ""It was great bonding for us,"" he said. ""On one hand, they pass themselves off as a great, upstanding organization with the 12 points.

As Gillard\'s predecessor, John Howard, once found out. And apparently it was an egg toss at then-PM Billy Hughes back in 1917 that led to the formation of Australia\'s Federal Police force. Gillard, however, took the sandwich assault in stride showing a brave face as she laughed off the incident.

But she couldn\x92t hide it anymore. \n \n Alessandra told a therapist what she saw, sparking a short-lived child welfare investigation and an unfolding drama that culminated Monday when Alessandra\x92s grandfather, Jorge Barahona, was found inside a red pickup truck along Interstate 95 in West Palm Beach, with one dead child, a girl, doused in chemicals in the back of the truck and a boy, in the cab, near death next to him. \n \n On Wednesday, state Department of Children & Families administrators confirmed the worst about Victor and Nubia Doctor, 10-year-old twins adopted by Jorge and Carmen Barahona. \n \n \x93All evidence indicates that Nubia is deceased,\x92\x92 said Mark Riordan, a DCF spokesman. \n \n And Victor was clinging to life at Jackson Memorial Hospital\x92s burn unit, where he was transferred with chemical burns that were spreading across his body. Doctors were confounded by their inability to identify the chemicals. \n \n Late Wednesday, DCF\x92s Riordan said Victor was receiving \x93intensive treatment\x94 from burn unit specialists. Victor remained in bed but was able to interact and move when he was awake, Riordan said. \n \n Earlier in the day, Dr. Walter Lambert, who heads the state\x92s Child Protection Team in Miami, said the chemical burns on Victor\x92s body were \x93progressing,\x92\x92 and that doctors were seeing signs that the boy\x92s kidneys may be failing. Appearing Wednesday afternoon before a child welfare judge, Lambert said the boy was slipping in and out of consciousness. \n \n West Palm Beach Police said doctors discovered additional horrors as they treated Victor: His body showed signs of prior injuries, including a fractured clavicle and arm, scarring to his buttocks and lower abdomen \x96 and telltale ligature marks on both wrists. \n \n Barahona, who also remained hospitalized, told police he was so \x93distraught\x92\x92 over Nubia\x92s death that he intended to kill himself as he sat inside the truck on a grassy shoulder of I-95. It was not clear late Wednesday how, when or where Nubia died. \n \n \x93He gave Victor a handful of sleeping pills and told him to take them so he could sleep,\x92\x92 according to police records. Barahona told investigators he poured gasoline over his head and planned to ignite himself, but had second thoughts because Victor\x92s head was resting on his lap. \n \n Police have formally charged Barahona with aggravated child abuse in Victor\x92s case. Charges are pending in Nubia\x92s death. \n \n In a crowded courtroom Wednesday, Circuit Judge Cindy Lederman ordered two other adoptive children \x96 a 7-year-old girl and an 11-year-old boy \x96 formally removed from the Barahonas\x92 home to a therapeutic foster home. \n \n Carmen Barahona shielded her face with a sheet of white paper when she entered the courtroom.

The Texas teenager died from heat stroke in June while on an ""Intro to Backpacking"" course that would have been his final task to become an Eagle Scout. ""The Boy Scouts of America are responsible for my son's death. It's that simple,"" father John Comita tells WFAA. Reid's parents are suing Boy Scouts of America, accusing them of being negligent by sending the boy on an ""extremely aggressive hike"" through rugged terrain in southwest Texas on a day when temperatures were around 100 degrees. ""He wasn't an athlete. He wasn't prepared to go on an advanced hike,"" the father says. John Comita says the family signed Reid up for the course—which was supposed to include two days of training followed by a three-day hike—because they thought it was the safest option, but he was immediately sent on the hike, reports the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. The lawsuit also faults the Boy Scouts for sending Reid on a hike with two other teenagers, a 14-year-old and an 18-year-old, instead of the two adults that regulations require. Boy Scouts of America, which awarded Reid the rank of Eagle Scout after his death, declined to comment on the lawsuit but said the ""health and safety of our youth members is of paramount importance,"" the Washington Post reports.

140,"['Jihan Nassar, a homemaker in Corona, Calif., is listed as a $500 donor to the campaign of Florida Gov. Charlie Crist. But she insists she never gave a dime. \n \n \'\'I can\'t make any donations, financially,\'\' Nassar said Friday. ""We never made any donations, sir. I have no idea what you are talking about.\'\' \n \n Nassar and her husband, Waleed, are among more than three dozen California donors listed as giving to Crist\'s campaign on June 19, 2006 -- donations bundled by a controversial Delray Beach defense contractor now under scrutiny for contributions to GOP presidential candidate John McCain. \n \n On Thursday, the McCain campaign said it would return $50,000 in donations tied to businessman Harry Sargeant III, finance chairman of the Florida Republican Party and a college buddy of Crist\'s. Sargeant has said the California donors were solicited by a business partner, Mustafa Abu Naba\'a, a Jordanian with an apartment in Miami-Dade, records show. \n \n McCain -- a champion of campaign-finance reform in the U.S. Senate -- said he would return the donations after news articles in the Washington Post and the New York Times raised questions about their legitimacy. \n \n In a letter to the donors, the campaign warned that foreign nationals cannot donate money to U.S. campaigns and contributors cannot be reimbursed by another donor as a way to get around contribution limits. \n \n Some donors whose contributions are being returned by McCain\'s campaign were also listed as contributors to Crist on June 19, 2006. \n \n That day, Crist received more than $25,000 in contributions from California, records show, including $500 checks from two stereo stores and two Wienerschnitzel hot-dog restaurants outside Los Angeles. \n \n Zouhair El Srouji, a 40-year-old accountant in Wildomar, Calif., initially told a reporter on Friday that he had no memory of a $500 donation to the Florida governor. \n \n After reviewing campaign records, however, he said he recalled that a campaign contribution was requested by his employer -- though he couldn\'t recall who asked him to give. \n \n \'\'It took a lot of convincing, but they said he was a good man and needed our help, and I guess I\'m a sucker for helping good people,\'\' El Srouji said. \n \n Reached briefly to talk about his just-announced Dec. 12 wedding date with fiancee Carole Rome, Crist said he wasn\'t familiar with the specifics and referred questions to his former campaign manager, George LeMieux. \'\'It\'s all good,\'\' Crist said. \n \n Earlier in the week, he called Sargeant ""a great patriot.\'\' \n \n LeMieux said he would review the donations highlighted by The Miami Herald. \n \n He said every effort was made during the campaign to verify all donations and make sure they did not exceed campaign finance limits. Crist received more than 18,000 checks in the Republican primary, he said. \n \n \'\'With that volume of checks, we\'re not going to know everyone who gives money,\'\' LeMieux said. ""I remember many a long weekend trying to look up information about donors on the Internet.\'\' \n \n The controversy over the donations comes at an awkward time for Crist, one of several politicians auditioning to be McCain\'s vice-presidential candidate. \n \n Sargeant, a fraternity brother of Crist\'s at Florida State University, was one of the governor\'s biggest supporters in the 2006 campaign, and he has emerged in recent months as a top fundraiser for McCain as well. \n \n Sargeant is among 63 McCain fundraisers nationwide who have bundled more than $500,000 in checks each. Donations to presidential candidates are capped at $2,300, but bundlers get around the limit by collecting checks from friends, business associates and relatives. \n \n Sargeant also donated $30,000 of his own money to a joint McCain-GOP fund in May, records show. Before turning his attention to McCain, Sargeant also raised money for presidential candidates Rudy Giuliani and Hillary Clinton. \n \n On March 5 -- the same day President Bush received McCain at the White House as the GOP\'s presumptive nominee -- Sargeant hosted a fundraiser for McCain at his $8.3 million Delray Beach home. \n \n Sid Dinerstein, chairman of the Palm Beach County Republican Party, attended the affair at the waterfront home. He said McCain is \'\'bending over backwards\'\' by returning contributions. \n \n \'\'By giving the money back he is raising flags that weren\'t even there,\'\' Dinerstein said. ""John McCain puts the ethics bar higher than anyone in national politics.\'\' \n \n Sargeant could not be reached for comment on Friday, and a lawyer for his company did not respond to a list of e-mailed questions. \n \n Tallahassee lobbyist Brian Ballard, a top fundraiser for both Crist and McCain, said the reason Sargeant took the position as the state GOP\'s finance chairman was simple: Crist asked him to do it. \n \n Sargeant was not involved in President Bush\'s campaigns, which took the practice of bundling to new heights by designating its biggest givers as \'\'Rangers\'\' and ""Pioneers.\'\' \n \n \'\'Harry does politics now only because his friend of 30 years asked him to take this role,\'\' Ballard said. ""He\'s very much apolitical. He runs tankers and ports.\'\' \n \n Under Sargeant\'s leadership, the Republican Party of Florida raised $15 million in 2007, a record for a nonelection year. Chairman Jim Greer said he has no reason to review the checks Sargeant has delivered to the party. \n \n \'\'He continues to have my full support and appreciation for his service,\'\' Greer said. ""He\'s very dedicated and exhibited a high degree of integrity.\'\' \n \n For someone at the top of the fundraising heap, Sargeant has kept a low profile. Several activists and fundraisers who have been involved in Republican politics for years said they had never met him. \n \n But Sargeant\'s business has received some unwanted attention. \n \n Sargeant is a partner with Abu Naba\'a in International Oil Trading Co., a Boca Raton firm with Defense Department contracts to ship oil to the military in Iraq. Federal records show the company received $601 million in the 2007 budget year. \n \n In June, U.S. Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., head of a congressional oversight committee, sent a letter to Sargeant seeking records in a probe of alleged overcharging of the military for fuel costs. \n \n Sargeant and Abu Naba\'a have also been accused of fraud by the brother-in-law of the king of Jordan, who filed a lawsuit in West Palm Beach in April saying the pair cut him out of the Pentagon contracts after he helped them secure the deal. \n \n The ex-partner, Mohammad Al-Saleh, said he helped the company win the blessing of the Jordanian government to ship the oil through that country to Iraq -- a requirement of the Pentagon contracts, according to the suit. Al-Saleh said Sargeant and Abu Naba\'a failed to pay him at least $13 million. \n \n In court papers, lawyers for Sargeant and Abu Naba\'a denied any wrongdoing and said the suit should be moved to Jordan. Sargeant and his family also own domestic shipping and asphalt companies, records show.', 'You\'ve probably never heard of Marty Martin. He spent most of his life as an anonymous CIA operative. But he very recently came out of the closet as the man Bush put in charge of finding Osama bin Laden in the aftermath of 9/11, and guess what? It turns out the man Bush put in charge of finding bin Laden is an extremely shady and allegedly corrupt war profiteer. Who would have thought? \n \n Martin, of course, never succeeded in catching bin Laden. He ran the CIA\'s bin Laden unit from 2002 to 2004, a fact that we now know only because he emerged to grab some credit for bin Laden\'s death and celebrate the agency\'s discontinued torture program: ""We got beat up for it, but those efforts led to this great day,"" he told the Associated Press three weeks ago. Prior to that, he was just a nondescript former agency official who went into the security consulting business after retiring. The closest hint to just how key an official he was came from references to a ""Marty M.""—described as a sort of Jack Bauer of the bayou—in former CIA director George Tenet\'s memoir. \n \n Now that we know who Martin really is, we can get a sense of what kind of guy Bush turned to for arguably the most crucial job in the war on terror. \n \n 1. The Kind of Guy Who Bilks Taxpayers for His Own Enrichment \n \n In 2007, after leaving the CIA, Martin joined International Oil Trading Company, a Florida company that delivered fuel to U.S. forces in the Middle East. In 2008, congressional investigators accused it of ripping off the Pentagon to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars. This year, the Pentagon\'s own audit found that the company overcharged the government by as much as $204 million on a series of massive Iraq war fuel contracts. \n \n 2. The Kind of Guy Who Bribes Foreign Officials \n \n According to a Florida lawsuit against International Oil\'s owner Harry Sargeant III, Martin paid a $9 million bribe to the head of the Jordanian intelligence service back in 2007 to secure his company\'s exclusive rights to ship fuel across Jordan to U.S bases in Iraq. (That allegation comes from the Jordanian king\'s brother-in-law, Mohammad al-Saleh, who is suing Sargeant for purportedly screwing him out of a $100 million stake in the company.) \n \n 3. The Kind of Guy Who Helps Launder Illegal Political Contributions \n \n In 2008, the Washington Post reported that Sargeant, a billionaire, raised funds for John McCain\'s presidential campaign with help from an unnamed ""former head of the bin Laden unit"" who worked for him. The men reportedly skirted campaign finance laws by funneling the money through Arab-American ""straw donors."" McCain quickly returned $50,000 of Sargeant\'s lucre. The Post never named the ex-chief of the CIA bin Laden unit involved in the fundraising, but unless two former heads of the bin Laden unit were working for Sargeant at the time, that man was Marty Martin. \n \n 4. The Kind of Guy Who Gets Totally Psyched When People Die In a War He Profits From \n \n In a court filing last week, attorneys for al-Saleh quoted from an e-mail that Martin wrote to Sargeant in 2008 in which he appeared to gloat over the escalation of violence in Iraq: \n \n Fyi, word of a \'re-surge\' is floating around amidst shit hitting the fan in Iraq today. ☺ \n \n The ""shit hitting the fan"" was the Battle of Basra, the Iraqi Army\'s attempt in March 2008 to finally roll up militias loyal to Moqtada al Sadr. It was widely seen as a debacle and victory for al-Sadr, and many feared the conflict threatened to reignite the civil war. That month, 40 Americans died in Iraq. ☺! \n \n In other words, he\'s a former CIA agent. Anyway, that\'s Marty Martin, the guy Bush put in charge of the bin Laden hunt. Glad it worked out for him. \n \n Harry Sargeant\'s lawyers couldn\'t be reached for comment on this story. The CIA declined to comment. And Marty Martin\'s bin Laden-hunting predecessor, Michael Scheuer –- who served for two years as a special adviser to Martin\'s unit –- claims to have never heard of Marty Martin (which we can only presume is a CIA first-rule-of-Fight-Club omerta thing). Reached on his phone, Martin said: ""No no, man. I don\'t want to talk to you, man,"" and hung up before we had a chance to ask a question. \n \n [Image via AP]', 'A member of Jordan’s royal family is accusing an American oilman and former GOP fundraiser of bribing the Jordanian government to facilitate his fuel shipments through the country to U.S. forces in Iraq. \n \n The allegation emerged in a civil lawsuit pitting the billionaire American businessman, Harry Sargeant III, against an ex-business partner, Mohammad al-Saleh, the brother-in-law of Jordan’s King Abdullah II. \n \n Al-Saleh, the plaintiff in the case first reported by NBC News in May 2008, claims that he was cut out of a lucrative one-third share in Sargeant’s firm, the International Oil Trading Co., based in Boca Raton, Fla., and replaced by an ex-CIA official with deep contacts in the Jordanian government. \n \n The crux of the bribery allegation involves a $9 million wire transfer from Sargeant’s firm, directed to a mysterious figure in Jordan’s intelligence agency identified in court documents only as “Pasha.” \n \n Sargeant’s lawyers acknowledge that “Pasha” was “possibly” Gen. Mohammad Dahabi, then head of the General Intelligence Directorate (GID), Jordan’s intelligence agency. A source inside the Jordanian government confirmed that. \n \n Kickback or legitimate payment? \n \n Al-Saleh’s lawyers argue in court documents that the money was a kickback to curry favor with the GID and secure Sargeant’s continued use of Jordanian thoroughfares to ship fuel to U.S. bases in western Iraq. \n \n Sargeant’s lawyers insist the $9 million was payment to a “quasi-government” Jordanian company that was a subcontractor for Sargeant’s firm and deny any wrongdoing by their client. \n \n Sargeant, a retired Marine pilot and former official of the Florida state GOP, was once among the Pentagon’s closest business partners, winning billions of dollars in fuel contracts in the Iraq war. But fallout from the contracts has eroded Sargeant’s reputation. \n \n A congressional probe led by Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., concluded in October 2008 that Sargeant had exploited his close ties with the Jordanian monarchy to win an exclusive license — a so-called letter of authorization that permitted his company to ship the fuel through Jordan to Iraq, as the contracts required. \n \n Sargeant used his “effective monopoly” over the supply routes to grossly overcharge the Pentagon, Waxman wrote in a letter to Defense Secretary Robert Gates. Waxman called it “the worst form of war profiteering.” \n \n Shortly after the probe, Sargeant resigned as the finance chairman of the Florida Republican Party. \n \n Last month, a Pentagon audit requested by Waxman found that Sargeant was overpaid by as much as $204 million for the fuel contracts, which were worth nearly $2.7 billion over six years. The Defense Department accepted Sargeant’s inflated prices because no other competitor could get the letter of authorization from the Jordanian government, the audit said. \n \n Ex-CIA agent hired \n \n Now Al-Saleh’s lawsuit is dredging up new information about Sargeant’s dealings with the Jordanian government. \n \n Among other things, court records indicate that Sargeant hired Marty Martin, a former member of the CIA’s Senior Intelligence Service, to help manage his oil firm in 2007. Martin — identified in court documents as a former Middle East CIA station chief — leveraged his contacts in the Arab world to cement Sargeant’s relationship with the Jordanian government, even as the king’s brother-in-law was being forced out of the oil company and defrauded, al-Saleh’s lawyers contend. \n \n The money transfer at the core of the bribery allegation is revealed in a November 2007 email from Martin to a representative of the Jordanian intelligence service. In it, Martin wrote that $4.5 million had been “transferred to the designated account for the Pasha’s attention.” \n \n Three days later, Martin wrote again to confirm that a “second tranche of $4.5 million should also hit your account today.” He added, “Please advise Pasha.” \n \n A high-placed source inside the Jordanian government confirmed that the “Pasha” alluded to in the emails was Dahabi, then head of the GID. The source, who requested anonymity, said the payments were “being made to the GID,” and added, “A simple trace on the wires will easily reveal who the beneficiaries were and the bank account details.” \n \n The GID is the Jordanian counterpart to the CIA, and the two agencies have reportedly cooperated in the secret rendition of terrorist suspects. In a report this year, Human Rights Watch portrayed the GID as a vast shadow force in Jordan, harassing dissidents and “influenc(ing) decisions in most aspects of Jordanian public life.” \n \n Violation of anti-bribery law alleged \n \n Al-Saleh’s lawyers allege in court documents that Martin’s payments to the GID may have violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. \n \n But Sargeant’s lawyers, Mark Tuohey and Roger Kobert, said the wires were destined for Taurus Trading Co., a Jordanian firm that provided ground services for Sargeant as a subcontractor. The lawyers characterized Taurus Trading Co. as a “quasi-government entity” and said the Jordanian government was a paid third party in Sargeant’s defense work. Taurus Trading Co. did not respond to emails requesting comment, nor did the Jordanian Embassy in Washington. \n \n Asked why the director of the GID would be involved in the wire transfers, Kobert responded, “You’d have to ask him.” \n \n Dahabi, who was the GID’s director in 2007, did not answer calls to his cellphone. \n \n Martin did not reply to emails or phone calls seeking comment. \n \n Sargeant’s lawyers accuse al-Saleh’s side of taking the wire transfers out of context. “They try to make something very mundane and boring sound sexy,” said Kobert. “It’s not sexy.” \n \n Al-Saleh’s lawyers have cited another email that they argue shows Martin plotting to cut al-Saleh out of his one-third stake in the oil firm.', 'WASHINGTON -- When one of Osama bin Laden\'s most trusted aides picked up the phone last year, he unknowingly led U.S. pursuers to the doorstep of his boss, the world\'s most wanted terrorist. \n \n That phone call, recounted Monday by a U.S. official, ended a years-long search for bin Laden\'s personal courier, the key break in a worldwide manhunt. The courier, in turn, led U.S. intelligence to a walled compound in northeast Pakistan, where a team of Navy SEALs shot bin Laden to death. \n \n The violent final minutes were the culmination of years of intelligence work. Inside the CIA team hunting bin Laden, it always was clear that bin Laden\'s vulnerability was his couriers. He was too smart to let al-Qaida foot soldiers, or even his senior commanders, know his hideout. But if he wanted to get his messages out, somebody had to carry them, someone bin Laden trusted with his life. \n \n In a secret CIA prison in Eastern Europe years ago, al-Qaida\'s No. 3 leader, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, gave authorities the nicknames of several of bin Laden\'s couriers, four former U.S. intelligence officials said. Those names were among thousands of leads the CIA was pursuing. \n \n One man became a particular interest for the agency when another detainee, Abu Faraj al-Libi, told interrogators that when he was promoted to succeed Mohammed as al-Qaida\'s operational leader he received the word through a courier. Only bin Laden would have given al-Libi that promotion, CIA officials believed. \n \n If they could find that courier, they\'d find bin Laden. \n \n The revelation that intelligence gleaned from the CIA\'s so-called black sites helped kill bin Laden was seen as vindication for many intelligence officials who have been repeatedly investigated and criticized for their involvement in a program that involved the harshest interrogation methods in U.S. history. \n \n ""We got beat up for it, but those efforts led to this great day,"" said Marty Martin, a retired CIA officer who for years led the hunt for bin Laden. \n \n Mohammed did not reveal the names while being subjected to the simulated drowning technique known as waterboarding, former officials said. He identified them many months later under standard interrogation, they said, leaving it once again up for debate as to whether the harsh technique was a valuable tool or an unnecessarily violent tactic. \n \n It took years of work for intelligence agencies to identify the courier\'s real name, which officials are not disclosing. When they did identify him, he was nowhere to be found. The CIA\'s sources didn\'t know where he was hiding. Bin Laden was famously insistent that no phones or computers be used near him, so the eavesdroppers at the National Security Agency kept coming up cold. \n \n Then in the middle of last year, the courier had a telephone conversation with someone who was being monitored by U.S. intelligence, according to an American official, who like others interviewed for this story spoke only on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive operation. The courier was located somewhere away from bin Laden\'s hideout when he had the discussion, but it was enough to help intelligence officials locate and watch him. \n \n In August 2010, the courier unknowingly led authorities to a compound in the northeast Pakistani town of Abbottabad, where al-Libi had once lived. The walls surrounding the property were as high as 18 feet and topped with barbed wire. Intelligence officials had known about the house for years, but they always suspected that bin Laden would be surrounded by heavily armed security guards. Nobody patrolled the compound in Abbottabad. \n \n In fact, nobody came or went. And no telephone or Internet lines ran from the compound. The CIA soon believed that bin Laden was hiding in plain sight, in a hideout especially built to go unnoticed. But since bin Laden never traveled and nobody could get onto the compound without passing through two security gates, there was no way to be sure. \n \n Despite that uncertainty, intelligence officials realized this could represent the best chance ever to get to bin Laden. They decided not to share the information with anyone, including staunch counterterrorism allies such as Britain, Canada and Australia. \n \n By mid-February, the officials were convinced a ""high-value target"" was hiding in the compound. President Barack Obama wanted to take action. \n \n ""They were confident and their confidence was growing: \'This is different. This intelligence case is different. What we see in this compound is different than anything we\'ve ever seen before,\'"" John Brennan, the president\'s top counterterrorism adviser, said Monday. ""I was confident that we had the basis to take action."" \n \n Options were limited. The compound was in a residential neighborhood in a sovereign country. If Obama ordered an airstrike and bin Laden was not in the compound, it would be a huge diplomatic problem. Even if Obama was right, obliterating the compound might make it nearly impossible to confirm bin Laden\'s death. \n \n Said Brennan: ""The president had to evaluate the strength of that information, and then made what I believe was one of the most gutsiest calls of any president in recent memory."" \n \n Obama tapped two dozen members of the Navy\'s elite SEAL Team Six to carry out a raid with surgical accuracy. \n \n Before dawn Monday morning, a pair of helicopters left Jalalabad in eastern Afghanistan. The choppers entered Pakistani airspace using sophisticated technology intended to evade that country\'s radar systems, a U.S. official said. \n \n Officially, it was a kill-or-capture mission, since the U.S. doesn\'t kill unarmed people trying to surrender. But it was clear from the beginning that whoever was behind those walls had no intention of surrendering, two U.S. officials said. \n \n The helicopters lowered into the compound, dropping the SEALs behind the walls. No shots were fired, but shortly after the team hit the ground, one of the helicopters came crashing down and rolled onto its side for reasons the government has yet to explain. None of the SEALs was injured, however, and the mission continued uninterrupted. \n \n With the CIA and White House monitoring the situation in real time – presumably by live satellite feed or video carried by the SEALs – the team stormed the compound. \n \n Thanks to sophisticated satellite monitoring, U.S. forces knew they\'d likely find bin Laden\'s family on the second and third floors of one of the buildings on the property, officials said. The SEALs secured the rest of the property first, then proceeded to the room where bin Laden was hiding. In the ensuing firefight, Brennan said, bin Laden used a woman as a human shield. \n \n The SEALs killed bin Laden with a bullet to the head. Using the call sign for his visual identification, one of the soldiers communicated that ""Geronimo"" had been killed in action, according to a U.S. official. \n \n Bin Laden\'s body was immediately identifiable, but the U.S. also conducted DNA testing that identified him with near 100 percent certainty, senior administration officials said. Photo analysis by the CIA, confirmation on site by a woman believed to be bin Laden\'s wife, and matching physical features such as bin Laden\'s height all helped confirm the identification. At the White House, there was no doubt. \n \n ""I think the accomplishment that very brave personnel from the United States government were able to realize yesterday is a defining moment in the war against al-Qaida, the war on terrorism, by decapitating the head of the snake known as al-Qaida,"" Brennan said. \n \n U.S. forces searched the compound and flew away with documents, hard drives and DVDs that could provide valuable intelligence about al-Qaida, a U.S. official said. The entire operation took about 40 minutes, officials said. \n \n Bin Laden\'s body was flown to the USS Carl Vinson in the North Arabian sea, a senior defense official said. There, aboard a U.S. warship, officials conducted a traditional Islamic burial ritual. Bin Laden\'s body was washed and placed in a white sheet. He was placed in a weighted bag that, after religious remarks by a military officer, was slipped into the sea about 2 a.m. EDT Monday. \n \n Said the president: ""I think we can all agree this is a good day for America."" \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writers Kimberly Dozier, Eileen Sullivan and Ben Feller in Washington and Kathy Gannon in Islamabad, Pakistan contributed to this report.', 'Shane Bauer (2nd L), Sarah Shourd (3rd L) and Josh Fattal (2nd R) sit with their mothers during a news conference in Tehran May 20, 2010. \n \n TEHRAN | \n \n TEHRAN (Reuters) - Iranian authorities have delayed the trial of two Americans arrested near the Iraqi border in July 2009, a judiciary spokesman said on Monday, less than a week before they were due their first day in court. \n \n Shane Bauer and Josh Fattal, who say they were hiking in northern Iraq and were not aware they had crossed into Iran, are at the center of a much bigger dispute between the United States and Tehran, which have been bitter foes since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. \n \n Iran\'s judiciary spokesman said the trial could not go ahead as scheduled because of the absence of a third suspect, Sarah Shourd, who was arrested with the men but released on $500,000 bail in September this year and returned to the United States. \n \n ""Due to the absence of the third person, the court has delayed the trial time so that in between this time the third person can return to Iran or, in the event of her refusal to appear, her case be dealt with differently,"" Qolamhossein Mohseni-Ejei was quoted as saying by the semi-official Fars news agency. \n \n Their lawyer said he was not aware the trial had been postponed. \n \n ""It is illogical.

He said a 23-year-old ranger new to the service is in stable condition at Tufts Medical Center with less serious wounds. \n \n Evans said Bodio Hutchinson attacked the unarmed rangers in what the commissioner said was an unprovoked confrontation at about 4:30 p.m. Evans said witnesses followed the suspect and provided cellphone video to police. He said a knife police believe was used in the attack was recovered from Frog Pond. \n \n Evans said Hutchison faces attempted murder charges."", 'Investigators checked a trash can at Boston Common following the stabbing of two park rangers. \n \n A homeless man with a “violent criminal past” allegedly stabbed two Boston park rangers who approached him on Boston Common Tuesday, lunging at them in an unprovoked and wild attack that left one ranger in critical condition at Massachusetts General Hospital, police officials said. \n \n Boston police chased Bodio Hutchinson, 34, into the Public Garden, where they arrested him and fished a knife out of a nearby pond, officials said. Before officers tackled him to the pavement, witnesses said, Hutchinson told the officers to shoot him. \n \n Advertisement \n \n “Our prayers are with both of the rangers,” said Boston Police Commissioner William Evans at a press conference Tuesday night. “We have good witnesses and good video, and we’re confident in the suspect we have that’s responsible for this.” \n \n Authorities did not name the two men wounded but said the ranger who was critically hurt and taken to Mass. General is a 46-year-old sergeant who has been on the job for 20 years. He was stabbed in the abdomen and was in surgery on Tuesday night. The other ranger, authorities said, is 23 and had just joined the force. He suffered several wounds and was taken to Tufts Medical Center. \n \n Hutchinson was sitting on the Soldiers and Sailors Monument statue in the Common when the rangers, who were not armed, approached him, said Evans. \n \n Hutchinson “has a very violent, assaultive past history,” Evans said. “The officers confronted him up by the monument and without provocation he lunged at both officers,” \n \n Witnesses who rushed to the Common after hearing a commotion described a horrifying scene: two wounded rangers, one lying on a bench with his hands over his stomach to stanch the bleeding, the other walking nearby and holding his arm. \n \n Bill Mitchell for The Boston Globe Boston Police chased Bodio Hutchinson, 34, into the Public Garden, where they arrested him and fished a knife out of a nearby pond, officials said. \n \n Advertisement \n \n “We run up here, we see cops, just like, bleeding,” said Jackson Marchant, who was walking nearby when the stabbing occurred. “A lot of people were helping the cops. But he was stabbed right in the central stomach, and it was bloody, it was bleeding, his whole torso was covered in red. He was holding himself, praying.” \n \n The wounded ranger continued praying as he was loaded into an emergency vehicle, Marchant said. \n \n Officials said that as Hutchinson allegedly fled, some bystanders followed him, and videotaped him on their cellphones. \n \n Witnesses described a brief chase, with officers running after Hutchinson out of the Common and into the Public Garden, telling him to stop. Hutchinson was not moving very fast, witnesses said. \n \n “He stopped, and he told them to shoot him,” said Nicholas Rusk, 19. “They just tackled him to the ground.” \n \n One witness snapped a series of pictures of the arrest: In one, a heavyset man dressed in a Red Sox jacket and a pompom hat with “Boston” written on it is lying prone on the ground under two officers, his mouth slightly open. In another, the man stands in bright red shorts over black pants, surrounded by officers whom he appears to be addressing. Police declined to confirm that the pictures showed Hutchinson. \n \n Witnesses pointed police to the pond in the Public Garden, and officers waded in. Evans said they retrieved a knife. \n \n “I can’t say enough about the public,” said Evans. “Great work on the part of the public and on the part of the officers.” \n \n According to police, Hutchinson has an open warrant for his arrest on a charge of assault and battery on a police officer. He was arrested in February of last year and charged with assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, and assault and battery, according to officials. \n \n Evans said it was not clear whether the rangers who approached Hutchinson knew of the outstanding warrant. \n \n Mayor Martin J. Walsh said that at any given time, two to four officers are patroling Boston Common and the Public Garden. \n \n “Certainly we’ve, on the Boston Common, had issues in the past with homelessness, but our officers work very hard in there,” said Walsh. “Generally they work without incident and are able to defuse any situation. In this incident clearly they were not able to defuse it when the gentleman attacked them.” \n \n Walsh said the parks commissioner will talk with rangers and police to see if they need more equipment or more manpower to keep the parks safe. \n \n On Tuesday evening, the monument was roped off with crime scene tape. The heavy police presence had drawn onlookers, many of whom expressed shock that rangers could be so brazenly attacked. Helicopters whirred overhead, and investigators canvassed the scene by flashlight, marking several spots as evidence. \n \n Evans said Hutchinson will probably face at least two counts of attempted murder, in addition to the outstanding charges of assaulting a police officer, and drug charges. \n \n “He’s not a newcomer to the criminal justice system,” said Evans.', 'In any given year, more than 1 in 4 Americans who are old enough to drive have some kind of encounter with a police officer, usually as a result of a traffic stop.

The poll has a 3.5 percentage point margin of error. \n \n --Sarah Ferris contributed to this report, which was updated at 11:41 a.m."", '(CNN) In the first national telephone poll since Donald Trump earned rebukes from Republican leaders over his comments about Senator John McCain\'s military service, the real estate mogul has increased his support among GOP voters and now stands atop the race for the party\'s nomination. \n \n The new CNN/ORC Poll finds Trump at 18% support among Republicans, with former Florida governor Jeb Bush just behind at 15%, within the poll\'s margin of error. \n \n They are joined at the top of the pack by Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, with 10% support among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents who are registered to vote. Trump\'s backing has climbed 6 points since a late-June poll, while support for Bush and Walker has not changed significantly. \n \n None of the other 14 candidates tested in the new CNN/ORC survey earned double-digit support. \n \n Though Trump currently tops the race for the nomination, his advantage is by no means firm. A majority of Republican voters, 51%, say they see the field as wide open, and that it\'s too soon to say which candidate they will ultimately get behind. Among that group that see the contest as wide open, Bush has 14% support, while Trump has the backing of 13% and Walker stands at 9%. \n \n Trump does much better among those Republicans who say they\'ve narrowed it down to one or two candidates, 24% of that group backs him, 16% Bush and 12% Walker. \n \n Trump\'s popularity among Republican voters does not translate to the broader pool of registered voters. When tested in hypothetical general election matchups against top Democrats, he trails both frontrunner Hillary Clinton and upstart Senator Bernie Sanders by wide margins. Bush and Walker run just behind Clinton and about even with Sanders. \n \n Trump\'s unfavorability rating is sky high. Overall, 59% of all registered voters have an unfavorable opinion of Trump, though that dips to 42% among GOP voters. \n \n None of the other Republicans landing near the top of the field have such a negative image nationwide, though many remain little known. \n \n Clinton is the only candidate who is about as well-known as Trump, and while she is more well-liked than the developer, her favorability rating is net negative among registered voters nationally: 49% have an unfavorable view while 44% have a positive impression. \n \n Still, the poll suggests Republican voters haven\'t yet had their fill of Trump. A majority (52%) say they\'d like to see Trump continue his run for the GOP nomination, including nearly six in 10 conservatives, tea party supporters and white evangelicals. Even among those Republican voters who support someone other than Trump, 42% say they\'d like him to remain in the field. \n \n The Republican electorate is more enthusiastic about next year\'s vote than the Democrats are. The poll finds 46% of Democratic voters say they are extremely or very enthusiastic about voting for president next year, compared with 55% of Republican voters. But enthusiasm is down in both parties compared with June of 2011, when 61% of Republican registered voters and 55% of Democratic registered voters were that enthusiastic. \n \n In another positive sign for Trump\'s candidacy, among those Republicans who are enthusiastic about voting next year, Trump holds a larger edge over his competition: 22% say they would back him for their party\'s nomination, compared with 14% who back Bush and 12% behind Walker. \n \n Overall, about three-quarters of Republicans are satisfied with their choices, more so than in 2011 at this time (about two-thirds were satisfied then), but still, just 23% say they are ""very satisfied"" with the field. \n \n Meanwhile, an NBC News/Marist poll on Sunday showed Trump leading among New Hampshire GOP primary voters and narrowly trailing Walker in Iowa. \n \n Trump took 21% of the New Hampshire GOP primary vote, with Bush running second at 14%, while in Iowa Trump was at 17% and Walker at 19%, according to the NBC/Marist survey \n \n On the Democratic side, the CNN poll found Clinton remains the clear frontrunner, though Sanders has increased his support slightly since last month\'s poll. Clinton is backed by 56% of registered Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters, while Sanders has inched up to 19% from 15% in June. The rest of the field is about even with where they were before. \n \n The CNN/ORC International Poll was conducted July 22-25 among a random national sample of 1,017 adults, including 898 registered voters. Results for all registered voters have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. The registered voter sample included 419 Republicans and Republican-leaning independents as well as 392 Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents.']",2,"– Some media outlets might want to evict Donald Trump from their politics sections, but he appears to be doing pretty well among Americans surveying the political arena. As CNN reports in a new CNN/ORC national poll, Trump is polling at the top of the considerable heap of Republican presidential contenders, at 18%. Jeb Bush comes in second at 15%, Scott Walker at 10%, and no other GOP candidate cracked double digits. Of note: The poll was conducted after Trump started swinging at John McCain's war record, indicating he's emerged unscathed; the new poll puts Trump up 6 points over a similar poll at the end of June. ""There's a movement going on,"" Trump told CNN this morning in response, per the Hill. ""People are tired of these incompetent politicians in Washington ... I'm just not that surprised."" Trump is racking up similar numbers in Iowa, per an NBC/Marist poll out today: He's at 17%, though he's trailing Walker's 19% in that state, reports Politico. Bush has 12% there.

143,"['Madrid (CNN) -- Flanked by his family and before Spain\'s Parliament, Felipe VI was formally proclaimed the new King of Spain Thursday, following the abdication of his father, Juan Carlos. \n \n The new King, clad in military uniform, promised to head a changed monarchy ""for new times,"" in an address before the packed parliamentary chamber. \n \n ""We have a great country, we are a great nation -- let us trust in it,"" he told the packed parliamentary chamber and the millions watching nationwide. \n \n After swearing an oath promising to uphold the constitution, the new monarch expressed his respect for the Parliament and the nation -- as well as his own emotion at becoming monarch. \n \n Felipe paid tribute to his father\'s ""extraordinary"" legacy over nearly four decades, including his leadership as the country returned to democracy following the death of dictator Francisco Franco in 1975. \n \n He also thanked his mother, Queen Sofia, for a lifetime of hard work and devotion to the Spanish people. \n \n Felipe spoke of the need for a monarch to unify his country and to work with its political leaders, a message with added significance at a time when many in the country\'s Catalonia region want a referendum on independence. \n \n He also vowed to carry out his duties, remain loyal to his nation and work for the interests of Spain. ""I will honor the pledge and the oath I have just taken,"" he said. \n \n The head of state must set an example of honest and transparent behavior, he said, perhaps a reflection of the scandals that have beset the monarchy in recent times. \n \n Felipe reflected on the country\'s recent economic woes, which have fueled high unemployment rates. But he also spoke of the need for its people, at a time of adversity, to ""look ahead to the Spain we are building together as I begin this reign."" \n \n This, he said, will mean modernizing to meet the challenges of a globalized world. \n \n The proclamation ceremony is a more subdued affair than a coronation, without the pomp of foreign dignitaries and elaborate ceremonies. \n \n But crowds cheered loudly as Felipe, his wife, now Queen Letizia, and their two daughters emerged onto the balcony of the royal palace, joined by Juan Carlos and Sofia, to salute the Spanish people. \n \n Chants of ""Long live the king"" rang out in Spanish. \n \n Felipe\'s elder daughter, Leonor, 8, becomes Princess of Asturias, first in line to the throne. \n \n Retirements of monarchs \n \n Stroke of pen \n \n His father\'s 39-year reign had come to an end with the stroke of a pen and the stroke of midnight Wednesday. \n \n Less than three weeks after he announced his surprise abdication, longtime leader Juan Carlos signed the step into law at the royal palace in Madrid, making his son the new king. \n \n In another ceremony held Thursday morning to mark the transfer of power, Juan Carlos took off the red sash signifying his role as head of Spain\'s military, fastening it around his son\'s waist. \n \n Crowds lined up waving the red and yellow Spanish flags as military bands marched in the streets of Madrid. \n \n Juan Carlos has said Felipe, a former Olympic yachtsman, has ""the maturity, the preparation and the sense of responsibility necessary"" to serve as king and ""to lead to a new stage of hope using his experience and the drive of a new generation."" \n \n The new King is regarded as being untouched by the accusations of corruption and excess that have plagued the royal family as many Spaniards continue to struggle to find jobs and pull themselves out of financial ruin. \n \n At his side will be the new Queen Letizia, who before she married into the royal family worked as a TV presenter. \n \n Princess Cristina, the new King\'s older sister, is embroiled in a tax fraud and money-laundering investigation. She and her husband, Inaki Urdangarin, have denied allegations that they diverted public funds from Urdangarin\'s foundation for private use. \n \n Spaniards have long held Juan Carlos, 76, in high regard for shepherding the country into democracy. \n \n But his popularity took a hit in 2012 over a controversial elephant-hunting trip to Africa while the nation was mired in a deep economic crisis. \n \n Some Spaniards have called for the monarchy to be abandoned, favoring the establishment of a republic instead. \n \n The anti-monarchy movement has been fueled by the scandals that have hit the royal family in recent years. \n \n The biggest task for Felipe, 46, will be to make the dealings of the royal palace more transparent. His family has a relatively austere reputation compared with other European monarchies, but there has been increasing resentment in Spain over the cost of the royal family to the public. \n \n READ: The sailor who will take the helm in Spain \n \n CNN\'s Al Goodman reported from Madrid, while Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London and Steve Almasy in Atlanta.', 'MADRID (AP) — Crown Prince Felipe ascended to the Spanish throne at midnight Wednesday, but there weren\'t any ritzy official celebrations. \n \n Spain’s King Juan Carlos, 2nd left is kissed by Queen Sofia, left in the presence of Spain\'s Crown Prince Felipe, 3rd left and Princess Letizia after he signed an abdication law during a ceremony at the...

(Associated Press) \n \n The economic crisis that has left a quarter of Spaniards out of work prompted Europe\'s newest king to be relatively frugal at his proclamation. \n \n The crown prince\'s father, 76-year-old Juan Carlos, misjudged public anger at financial hardship when he went on an elephant-hunting safari in Africa. Felipe, 46, appears keen to show he\'s more in tune with his countrymen — and avoid the mistakes of his abdicating predecessor. \n \n The landmark occasion was perhaps most notable for what it didn\'t include: no state banquet, no foreign royals or heads of state, no ostentatious ceremonies or parades. \n \n By royal standards, it was humble: reception guests were being served hot and cold tapas-style nibbles, to be eaten while standing. There was no champagne, just sparkling cava wine from Spain\'s Catalonia region. \n \n ""More than anything this is a message. What they want to say is: \'We\'re in a moment when sobriety in spending shows a certain sense of solidarity in a time of economic difficulty,\'"" Navarra University history professor Pablo Perez Lopez said. \n \n Juan Carlos on Wednesday signed legislation, approved by Parliament earlier this month, setting out the legal framework for the handover. The retiring monarch, who underwent a hip replacement operation last November, used a walking cane and moved with difficulty during the televised signing ceremony. \n \n Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy immediately ratified the law, which went into force at midnight in Spain (2200 GMT). \n \n Felipe is to be formally proclaimed monarch and swear an oath at a ceremony with lawmakers in Parliament on Thursday. It will be a no-frills event, though the 18th-century Spanish crown and 17th-century scepter will be on display. \n \n After a brief military parade, King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia will take a drive through expected crowds along some of Madrid\'s most emblematic streets and monuments — such as the Prado Museum and the Cibeles fountain. \n \n The palace acknowledged that the customary pomp had been eliminated ""in keeping with the criteria of austerity that the times recommend."" \n \n The reasoning behind that choice is easy to understand, says Emilio de Diego Garcia, history professor at Madrid\'s Complutense University. \n \n ""In a time when every expense is examined with a magnifying glass, particularly public money, any ostentation would have been criticized,"" he said. \n \n Juan Carlos announced his surprise decision to abdicate on June 2, saying he was stepping aside after a four-decade reign to allow for younger royal blood to rally the country that is still trying to shrug off a double-dip recession and a 26 percent jobless rate. \n \n During most of his reign, the monarch was held in high esteem for his role in helping steer the country from military dictatorship to democracy. He took over the throne in 1975, two days after the death of longtime dictator Gen. Francisco Franco, and then endeared himself to many by making army rebels stand down during an attempted military coup in 1981. \n \n More recently, however, the royal family\'s image was tarnished by Juan Carlos\' 2012 Botswana hunting trip. Another scandal saw Juan Carlos\' youngest daughter, Princess Cristina, testify this year in the fraud and money-laundering case engulfing her husband, the Olympic handball medalist turned businessman Inaki Urdangarin. \n \n Juan Carlos won broad support for his handling of Spain\'s 20th-century challenges. Felipe VI must now address Spain\'s 21st-century difficulties. \n \n Keeping the bill down for taxpayers is just one of the challenges facing the new king. \n \n Much more pressing will be whether he can keep the country united as separatist movements, such as those in Catalonia and the Basque region, try to pull the country apart. Such an unraveling could place the monarchy itself in danger. \n \n The abdication announcement initially triggered widespread demonstrations calling for a referendum on reinstating a republic. But a recent poll found that while 62 percent of respondents said they wanted a referendum on the monarchy ""at some point,"" 49 percent said they favored a monarchy with Felipe as king, while only 36 percent wanted a republic. Others did not answer or expressed no opinion. \n \n Felipe holds a law degree from Madrid\'s Autonomous University and obtained a master\'s in international relations from Georgetown University in Washington. His wife is a former television journalist and a divorced commoner. Many people feel that record will help make Felipe more attuned to the public mood. \n \n Diego Garcia, the Complutense professor, believes Spain is going to see ""a more austere monarchy, one closer to the people and the reality of the country."" \n \n The 2,000 guests invited to the royal reception were from a wide range of Spanish society, including Madrid ambassadors as well as representatives from the business, cultural, media and sports sectors. \n \n Authorities have prohibited a planned demonstration in Madrid on Thursday by people demanding an end to the monarchy. \n \n The palace said it had no information on the overall cost of the events, which will be overseen by some 7,000 police. \n \n ____ \n \n Hatton contributed from Lisbon, Portugal.']",2,"– Spain's Prince Felipe became King Felipe VI at midnight as the abdication of his father, King Juan Carlos, became official. The occasion was fairly low-key, with no foreign heads of state present and no huge state banquet, which the palace says was ""in keeping with the criteria of austerity that the times recommend,"" the AP reports. The 46-year-old king was later proclaimed head of state in a parliamentary ceremony where he promised to be a monarch ""who is ready listen and understand, warn and advise as well as to defend the public interest at all times,"" the BBC reports. The new king spoke of the need to ""look ahead to the Spain we are building together as I begin this reign,"" reports CNN, which notes that while the monarchy remains popular in Spain, the royal family has been accused of corruption and excess during the country's economic crisis—and Juan Carlos' image suffered after he went on a luxurious elephant-hunting trip in the middle of the recession. Felipe and his wife, who is now Queen Letizia, will be driven through the streets of Madrid before appearing at the palace but they may find that many Spaniards aren't in the mood for cheering: The country's soccer team, which won the World Cup in 2010, crashed out of the tournament last night with a 2-0 loss to Chile."

The Mormon church is taking another step in its push to be more transparent, and is releasing... (Associated Press) \n \n The new photos peel back another layer of secrecy for a relatively young world religion that has come under scrutiny for some of its beliefs as its numbers swelled in the Internet age. \n \n The pictures of the smooth, egg-sized rock are part of a new book that also contains photos of the first printer\'s manuscript of the Book of Mormon. Officials with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints unveiled the photos at a news conference in Salt Lake City. \n \n The religion\'s drive in recent years to open its vaults and clarify sensitive tenets is aimed at filling a void on the Internet for accurate information as curiosity increased while church membership tripled to 15 million over the past three decades, Mormon scholars said. \n \n Church historian Steven E. Snow acknowledged that dynamic, saying: ""The Internet brings both challenge and opportunities. We\'re grateful for the opportunity to share much of collection through the use of the Internet."" \n \n The church\'s campaign seems aimed at preventing current members from leaving and showing non-Mormons the faith has nothing to hide, said Terryl Givens, professor of literature and religion and the James Bostwick chair of English at the University of Richmond. \n \n As an American-born religion much younger than most world religions, the origins of Mormonism have come under greater scrutiny and put pressure on the church to prove its stories, Givens said. \n \n ""The other churches\' origins are concealed by the mist of history,"" Givens said. ""Mormonism is the first world religion in which the origins were exposed to public view, to documentation, to journalists and newspaper reporting."" \n \n The pictures in the new book show different angles of a stone that is dark brown with lighter brown swirls. The photos also show a weathered leather pouch where the stone was stored that is believed to be made by one of Joseph Smith\'s wives, Emma Smith. \n \n The church has always possessed the stone, which was transported across the country during Mormon pioneers\' trek from Illinois to Utah in the mid-1800s. But it decided to publish the photos to allow people who prefer visuals to words to better understand the religion\'s roots, said Richard Turley, assistant church historian. The stone will remain in the vault. \n \n ""The picture brings a kind of tangibility to something that has been previously been talked about just in words,"" Turley said. ""That helps people connect with the past."" \n \n Mormons believe that 185 years ago, Smith found gold plates engraved with writing in ancient Egyptian in upstate New York. They say God helped him translate the text using the stone and other tools, and it became known as the Book of Mormon. \n \n The manuscript in the new book belongs to the Community of Christ, a faith that was created by early Mormons who stayed behind when most members of the religion moved west to Utah. A Community of Christ leader joined LDS officials at the press event Tuesday in what both said demonstrated the two faiths have moved on from past squabbles. \n \n The church has been releasing books containing historical documents that shed light on how Smith formed the faith. It also has issued a series of in-depth articles that explain or clarify some of the more sensitive parts of the religion\'s history that it once sidestepped, such as its past ban on black men in the lay clergy and its early history of polygamy. \n \n The church paid a price for its past decisions to stay silent on topics or keep key artifacts in the vault, said Richard Bushman, a Mormon historian and emeritus professor at Columbia University. \n \n ""Their faithful members would stumble on information on the Internet. Not having heard about them, they were shocked and disillusioned,"" Bushman said. \n \n Today the church is taking a new approach by saying, ""We can face up to the facts. We don\'t have to make the picture prettier than it is,"" he said.', 'He dictated the narrative to various scribes, including schoolteacher Oliver Cowdery, who took down the LDS leader\'s words in longhand. Cowdery then painstakingly copied the original manuscript for the printer to set in type. More than 70 percent of that original document suffered water damage. The LDS Church History Library in Salt Lake City has most of what\'s left. \n \n The ""printer\'s copy,"" however, remained with Smith\'s followers who stayed in the Midwest rather than trekking to Utah, and, in 1903, it was purchased by the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, now the Community of Christ. \n \n Through the years, tensions simmered between those two wings of Mormonism. But, during the past couple of decades, historians have built scholarly bridges between the Community of Christ and the much-larger, Utah-based Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. \n \n Community of Christ officials have been ""careful stewards of the manuscript,"" Snow said Tuesday. ""Both faiths are trying to move forward in sharing their collections."" \n \n Community of Christ minister and Seventy Robin Linkhart, who was at the news conference, praised her Utah colleagues for their part in the joint project. \n \n The two-volume work, Linkhart said, ""truly is an exceptional contribution to the study of LDS history and culture, representing decades of research."" \n \n Begun by Mormon scholar Royal Skousen in 1988, she said, ""it\'s been a long, long journey to the finish line."" \n \n The Community of Christ long ago accepted the notion that ""revelation includes a human component,"" said Lachlan Mackay, coordinator of the denomination\'s historic sites. \n \n The Independence, Mo.-based faith published articles about the seer stone as early as the 1960s, he said, but ""it might still be news to some people."" \n \n ""I\'m incredibly excited,"" Mackay said Tuesday. ""These efforts have served to unite us."" \n \n Both he and Richard E. Turley Jr., assistant LDS historian, said physical objects ""help us connect to the past, make it more realistic, more tangible."" \n \n In a recent essay, the LDS Church explained how Smith, according to some accounts, used the seer stone. He peered into a hat, to block out exterior light, and ""read aloud the English words that appeared on the instrument."" \n \n ""As a young man during the 1820s, Joseph Smith, like others in his day, used a seer stone to look for lost objects and buried treasure,"" the essay said. ""As Joseph grew to understand his prophetic calling, he learned that he could use this stone for the higher purpose of translating scripture."" \n \n Smith also used two bound stones — known as the Urim and Thummim — as ""interpreters."" \n \n ""Some accounts indicate that Joseph studied the characters on the plates,"" the essay added. ""Most of the accounts speak of Joseph\'s use of the Urim and Thummim (either the interpreters or the seer stone).""', ""Joseph Smith said that the Book of Mormon was “the most correct of any Book on earth & the keystone of our religion & a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts than by any other Book.” 1 The Book of Mormon came into the world through a series of miraculous events. Much can be known about the coming forth of the English text of the Book of Mormon through a careful study of statements made by Joseph Smith, his scribes, and others closely associated with the translation of the Book of Mormon. \n \n “By the Gift and Power of God” \n \n Joseph Smith reported that on the evening of September 21, 1823, while he prayed in the upper room of his parents’ small log home in Palmyra, New York, an angel who called himself Moroni appeared and told Joseph that “God had a work for [you] to do.”2 He informed Joseph that “there was a book deposited, written upon gold plates, giving an account of the former inhabitants of this continent, and the source from whence they sprang.” The book could be found in a hill not far from the Smith family farm. This was no ordinary history, for it contained “the fullness of the everlasting Gospel as delivered by the Savior.”3 \n \n The angel charged Joseph Smith to translate the book from the ancient language in which it was written. The young man, however, had very little formal education and was incapable of writing a book on his own, let alone translating an ancient book written from an unknown language, known in the Book of Mormon as “reformed Egyptian.”4 Joseph’s wife Emma insisted that, at the time of translation, Joseph “could neither write nor dictate a coherent and well-worded letter, let alone dictat[e] a book like the Book of Mormon.”5 \n \n Joseph received the plates in September 1827 and the following spring, in Harmony, Pennsylvania, began translating them in earnest, with Emma and his friend Martin Harris serving as his main scribes. The resulting English transcription, known as the Book of Lehi and referred to by Joseph Smith as written on 116 pages, was subsequently lost or stolen. As a result, Joseph Smith was rebuked by the Lord and lost the ability to translate for a short time.6 \n \n Joseph began translating again in 1829, and almost all of the present Book of Mormon text was translated during a three-month period between April and June of that year. His chief scribe during these months was Oliver Cowdery, a schoolteacher from Vermont who learned about the Book of Mormon while boarding with Joseph’s parents in Palmyra. Called by God in a vision, Cowdery traveled to Harmony to meet Joseph Smith and investigate further. Of his experience as scribe, Cowdery wrote, “These were days never to be forgotten—to sit under the sound of a voice dictated by the inspiration of heaven.”7 \n \n The manuscript that Joseph Smith dictated to Oliver Cowdery and others is known today as the original manuscript, about 28 percent of which still survives.8 This manuscript corroborates Joseph Smith’s statements that the manuscript was written within a short time frame and that it was dictated from another language. For example, it includes errors that suggest the scribe heard words incorrectly rather than misread words copied from another manuscript.9 In addition, some grammatical constructions that are more characteristic of Near Eastern languages than English appear in the original manuscript, suggesting that the base language of the translation was not English.10 \n \n Unlike most dictated drafts, the original manuscript was considered by Joseph Smith to be, in substance, a final product. To assist in the publication of the book, Oliver Cowdery made a handwritten copy of the original manuscript. This copy is known today as the printer’s manuscript. Because Joseph Smith did not call for punctuation, such as periods, commas, or question marks as he dictated, such marks are not in the original manuscript. The typesetter later inserted punctuation marks when he prepared the text for the printer.11 With the exceptions of punctuation, formatting, other elements of typesetting, and minor adjustments required to correct copying and scribal errors, the dictation copy became the text of the first printed edition of the book.12 \n \n Translation Instruments \n \n Many accounts in the Bible show that God transmitted revelations to His prophets in a variety of ways. Elijah learned that God spoke not to him through the wind or fire or earthquake but through a “still small voice.”13 Paul and other early apostles sometimes communicated with angels and, on occasion, with the Lord Jesus Christ.14 At other times, revelation came in the form of dreams or visions, such as the revelation to Peter to preach the gospel to the Gentiles, or through sacred objects like the Urim and Thummim.15 \n \n Joseph Smith stands out among God’s prophets, because he was called to render into his own language an entire volume of scripture amounting to more than 500 printed pages, containing doctrine that would deepen and expand the theological understanding of millions of people. For this monumental task, God prepared additional, practical help in the form of physical instruments. \n \n Joseph Smith and his scribes wrote of two instruments used in translating the Book of Mormon. According to witnesses of the translation, when Joseph looked into the instruments, the words of scripture appeared in English. One instrument, called in the Book of Mormon the “interpreters,” is better known to Latter-day Saints today as the “Urim and Thummim.” Joseph found the interpreters buried in the hill with the plates.16 Those who saw the interpreters described them as a clear pair of stones bound together with a metal rim. The Book of Mormon referred to this instrument, together with its breastplate, as a device “kept and preserved by the hand of the Lord” and “handed down from generation to generation, for the purpose of interpreting languages.”17 \n \n The other instrument, which Joseph Smith discovered in the ground years before he retrieved the gold plates, was a small oval stone, or “seer stone.”18 As a young man during the 1820s, Joseph Smith, like others in his day, used a seer stone to look for lost objects and buried treasure.19 As Joseph grew to understand his prophetic calling, he learned that he could use this stone for the higher purpose of translating scripture.20 \n \n Apparently for convenience, Joseph often translated with the single seer stone rather than the two stones bound together to form the interpreters. These two instruments—the interpreters and the seer stone—were apparently interchangeable and worked in much the same way such that, in the course of time, Joseph Smith and his associates often used the term “Urim and Thummim” to refer to the single stone as well as the interpreters.21 In ancient times, Israelite priests used the Urim and Thummim to assist in receiving divine communications. Although commentators differ on the nature of the instrument, several ancient sources state that the instrument involved stones that lit up or were divinely illumined.22 Latter-day Saints later understood the term “Urim and Thummim” to refer exclusively to the interpreters. Joseph Smith and others, however, seem to have understood the term more as a descriptive category of instruments for obtaining divine revelations and less as the name of a specific instrument. \n \n Some people have balked at this claim of physical instruments used in the divine translation process, but such aids to facilitate the communication of God’s power and inspiration are consistent with accounts in scripture. In addition to the Urim and Thummim, the Bible mentions other physical instruments used to access God’s power: the rod of Aaron, a brass serpent, holy anointing oils, the Ark of the Covenant, and even dirt from the ground mixed with saliva to heal the eyes of a blind man.23 \n \n The Mechanics of Translation \n \n In the preface to the 1830 edition of the Book of Mormon, Joseph Smith wrote: “I would inform you that I translated [the book], by the gift and power of God.” When pressed for specifics about the process of translation, Joseph repeated on several occasions that it had been done “by the gift and power of God”24 and once added, “It was not intended to tell the world all the particulars of the coming forth of the book of Mormon.”25 \n \n Nevertheless, the scribes and others who observed the translation left numerous accounts that give insight into the process. Some accounts indicate that Joseph studied the characters on the plates. Most of the accounts speak of Joseph’s use of the Urim and Thummim (either the interpreters or the seer stone), and many accounts refer to his use of a single stone. According to these accounts, Joseph placed either the interpreters or the seer stone in a hat, pressed his face into the hat to block out extraneous light, and read aloud the English words that appeared on the instrument.26 The process as described brings to mind a passage from the Book of Mormon that speaks of God preparing “a stone, which shall shine forth in darkness unto light.”27 \n \n The scribes who assisted with the translation unquestionably believed that Joseph translated by divine power. Joseph’s wife Emma explained that she “frequently wrote day after day” at a small table in their house in Harmony, Pennsylvania. She described Joseph “sitting with his face buried in his hat, with the stone in it, and dictating hour after hour with nothing between us.”28 According to Emma, the plates “often lay on the table without any attempt at concealment, wrapped in a small linen table cloth.” When asked if Joseph had dictated from the Bible or from a manuscript he had prepared earlier, Emma flatly denied those possibilities: “He had neither manuscript nor book to read from.” Emma told her son Joseph Smith III, “The Book of Mormon is of divine authenticity—I have not the slightest doubt of it. I am satisfied that no man could have dictated the writing of the manuscripts unless he was inspired; for, when acting as his scribe, your father would dictate to me for hour after hour; and when returning after meals, or after interruptions, he would at once begin where he had left off, without either seeing the manuscript or having any portion of it read to him.”29 \n \n Another scribe, Martin Harris sat across the table from Joseph Smith and wrote down the words Joseph dictated. Harris later related that as Joseph used the seer stone to translate, sentences appeared. Joseph read those sentences aloud, and after penning the words, Harris would say, “Written.” An associate who interviewed Harris recorded him saying that Joseph “possessed a seer stone, by which he was enabled to translate as well as from the Urim and Thummim, and for convenience he then used the seer stone.”30 \n \n The principal scribe, Oliver Cowdery, testified under oath in 1831 that Joseph Smith “found with the plates, from which he translated his book, two transparent stones, resembling glass, set in silver bows. That by looking through these, he was able to read in English, the reformed Egyptian characters, which were engraved on the plates.”31 In the fall of 1830, Cowdery visited Union Village, Ohio, and spoke about the translation of the Book of Mormon. Soon thereafter, a village resident reported that the translation was accomplished by means of “two transparent stones in the form of spectacles thro which the translator looked on the engraving.”32 \n \n Conclusion \n \n Joseph Smith consistently testified that he translated the Book of Mormon by the “gift and power of God.” His scribes shared that testimony. The angel who brought news of an ancient record on metal plates buried in a hillside and the divine instruments prepared especially for Joseph Smith to translate were all part of what Joseph and his scribes viewed as the miracle of translation. When he sat down in 1832 to write his own history for the first time, he began by promising to include “an account of his marvelous experience.”33 The translation of the Book of Mormon was truly marvelous. \n \n The truth of the Book of Mormon and its divine source can be known today. God invites each of us to read the book, remember the mercies of the Lord and ponder them in our hearts, “and ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true.” God promises that “if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.”34 \n \n Resources \n \n Wilford Woodruff journal, Nov. 28, 1841, Church History Library, Salt Lake City.

A complete copy of this original, known as the printer’s manuscript, was made by Oliver Cowdery and two other scribes between August 1829 and early 1830. It was used to set the type for most of the printing in Palmyra.

For example, when Joseph translated the text that is now in 1 Nephi 13:29, the scribe wrote “&” in one place where he should have written “an.” At 1 Nephi 17:48, the scribe wrote “weed” where he should have written “reed.” (See Royal Skousen, “Translating the Book of Mormon: Evidence from the Original Manuscript,” in Noel B.

Some grammatical constructions that sound odd to English speakers were edited out of later editions of the Book of Mormon by Joseph Smith or others in order to render the translation into more standard current English. See Richard E. Turley Jr. and William W. Slaughter, How We Got the Book of Mormon (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 2011), 44–45. Approximately five-sixth of the 1830 first edition of the Book of Mormon was typeset from the printer’s manuscript. The other one-sixth was typeset from the original manuscript.

Joseph Smith seems to have used the terms “interpreters” and “spectacles” interchangeably during the early years of the Church. Nancy Towle, an itinerant Methodist preacher, recounted Joseph Smith telling her about “a pair of ‘interpreters,’ (as he called them,) that resembled spectacles, by looking into which, he could read a writing engraven upon the plates, though to himself, in a tongue unknown” (Nancy Towle, Vicissitudes Illustrated in the Experience of Nancy Towle, in Europe and America [Charleston: James L. Burges, 1832], 138–39.) Joseph’s 1832 history referred to “spectacles.” (Joseph Smith History, ca. summer 1832, in Joseph Smith Histories, 16.) In January 1833, the Latter-day Saint newspaper The Evening and the Morning Star, edited by William W. Phelps, equated “spectacles” and “interpreters” with the term “Urim and Thummim”: the Book of Mormon “was translated by the gift and power of God, by an unlearned man, through the aid of a pair of Interpreters, or spectacles— (known, perhaps, in ancient days as Teraphim, or Urim and Thummim).” (“The Book of Mormon,” The Evening and the Morning Star, January 1833, [2].) By 1835 Joseph Smith most often used the term “Urim and Thummim” when speaking of translation and rarely, if ever, used the terms “interpreters” or “spectacles.” (Joseph Smith, Journal, Nov. 9–11, 1835, in Journals: Volume 1: 1832–1839, 89; Joseph Smith, History, 1834–1836, in Davidson et al., Histories, Volume 1, 116; John W. Welch, “The Miraculous Translation of the Book of Mormon,” in John W. Welch, ed., with Erick B. Carlson, Opening the Heavens: Accounts of Divine Manifestations, 1820–1844 [Provo, UT, and Salt Lake City: Brigham Young University Press and Deseret Book, 2005], 123–28.) Joseph Smith probably possessed more than one seer stone; he appears to have found one of the stones while digging for a well around 1822. (Richard L. Bushman, Joseph Smith and the Beginnings of Mormonism [Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1984], 69–70.) According to Martin Harris, an angel commanded Joseph Smith to stop these activities, which he did by 1826. (See Bushman, Joseph Smith and the Beginnings of Mormonism, 64–76; and Richard Lloyd Anderson, “The Mature Joseph Smith and Treasure Searching,” BYU Studies 24, no. 4 [Fall 1984]: 489–560.) Joseph did not hide his well-known early involvement in treasure seeking. In 1838, he published responses to questions frequently asked of him. “Was not Jo Smith a money digger,” one question read. “Yes,” Joseph answered, “but it was never a very profitable job to him, as he only got fourteen dollars a month for it.” (Selections from Elders’ Journal, July 1838, 43, available at josephsmithpapers.org.) For the broader cultural context, see Alan Taylor, “The Early Republic’s Supernatural Economy: Treasure Seeking in the American Northeast, 1780–1830,” American Quarterly 38, no. 1 (Spring 1986): 6–33. Mark Ashurst-McGee, “A Pathway to Prophethood: Joseph Smith Junior as Rodsman, Village Seer, and Judeo-Christian Prophet” (Master's Thesis, Utah State University, 2000). For example, when Joseph Smith showed a seer stone to Wilford Woodruff in late 1841, Woodruff recorded in his journal: “I had the privilege of seeing for the first time in my day the URIM & THUMMIM.” (Wilford Woodruff journal, Dec. 27, 1841, Church History Library, Salt Lake City.)

Virtually all of the accounts of the translation process are reproduced in Welch, “Miraculous Translation.” Two accounts of the translation process, including the use of a seer stone, have been written by members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and published in Church magazines. Historians have also written about the seer stone in Church publications, both in the Ensign and in The Joseph Smith Papers. (See Neal A. Maxwell, “‘By the Gift and Power of God,’” Ensign, Jan. 1997, 36–41; Russell M. Nelson, “A Treasured Testament,” Ensign, July 1993, 61–63; Richard Lloyd Anderson, “‘By the Gift and Power of God,’” Ensign, Sept. 1977, 78–85; and Documents, Volume 1: July 1828–June 1831, xxix–xxxii.)

A Palmyra newspaper published the earliest known account of the translation in August 1829: Jonathan Hadley, a Palmyra printer who may have spoken with Joseph Smith about translation, claimed that the plates were found with a “huge pair of Spectacles,” and that “by placing the Spectacles in a hat, and looking into it, Smith could (he said so, at least,) interpret these characters.” (“Golden Bible,” Palmyra Freeman, Aug. 11, 1829, [2].) In the winter of 1831, a Shaker in Union Village, Ohio, spoke of “two transparent stones in the form of spectacles” through which the translator “looked on the engraving & afterwards put his face into a hat & the interpretation then flowed into his mind.” (Christian Goodwillie, “Shaker Richard McNemar: The Earliest Book of Mormon Reviewer,” Journal of Mormon History 37, no. 2 [Spring 2011]: 143.) “Last Testimony of Sister Emma,” 289–90. “One of the Three Witnesses,” Deseret Evening News, Dec. 13, 1881, 4.

Maxwell of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles pointed out in a 1997 Ensign article (“By the Gift and Power of God”) that this might have been intentional. \n \n “Perhaps the Lord wanted to leave the Book of Mormon in the realm of faith, though it is drenched with intrinsic evidence,” he wrote. \n \n Elder Maxwell indicated, however, that there is value in learning more about the Prophet Joseph, the translation process and those who assisted. \n \n “Our primary focus in studying the Book of Mormon should be on the principles of the gospel anyway, not on the process by which the book came forth,” Elder Maxwell wrote. “Yet because its coming so amply fulfilled Isaiah’s prophecy of a ‘marvellous work and a wonder,’ we may find strengthened faith in considering how marvelous and wondrous the translation really was.” \n \n \'By the gift and power of God\' \n \n Among those who have wondered about the specific details of the Book of Mormon\'s translation was Hyrum Smith, an older brother of the Prophet Joseph. \n \n According to “History of the Church,” Joseph responded to his brother\'s curiosity by saying that “it was not intended to tell the world all the particulars of the coming forth of the Book of Mormon” and “it was not expedient for him to relate these things.” \n \n “Thus what we do know about the actual coming forth of the Book of Mormon is adequate, but it is not comprehensive,” Elder Maxwell wrote. \n \n Robin Jensen, associate managing historian and project archivist for the Joseph Smith Papers, said in an interview with the Deseret News that because the Prophet Joseph didn’t leave a detailed account of the translation process, historians and members of the church must rely on the reminiscences of scribes and those who witnessed the translation in order to understand the mechanics. \n \n Jensen said that in his studying of the process, he has come to see the translation as a “development” with multiple “different phases” in which Joseph “grew and developed and better understood his role.” \n \n It was a “monumental task” as Joseph was asked to “render into his own language an entire volume of scripture amounting to more than 500 printed pages,” the lds.org topic page states. So “God prepared additional, practical help in the form of physical instruments” to aid in the different phases of the translation process. \n \n “The Book of Mormon tells us the way is prepared for this record to be translated, and that’s a very physical, very mechanical process, much more so than we perhaps might envision that,” Jensen said. \n \n The topic page refers specifically to two types of instruments. The first, known as the Urim and Thummim, was “a clear pair of stones bound together with a metal rim” that was found in the Hill Cumorah with the gold plates. \n \n “The Book of Mormon referred to this instrument, together with its breastplate, as a device ‘kept and preserved by the hand of the Lord’ and ‘handed down from generation to generation, for the purpose of interpreting languages,’” the topic page states. \n \n The second, known as a seer stone, was a “small oval stone” that Joseph “discovered in the ground years before he retrieved the gold plates,” according to the lds.org topic page, that he later learned could be used in the translation process. Jensen said the idea of seer stones was common during Joseph’s time. They were seen as “a way to confront the spiritual, supernatural world.” \n \n Witnesses of the translation process recorded that “when Joseph looked into the instruments, the words of scripture appeared in English,” according to the topic page. \n \n Joseph was in his early 20s at the time and had “very little formal education and was incapable of writing a book on his own, let alone translating an ancient book written from an unknown language,” according to the topic page. \n \n Joseph repeatedly testified that it was “by the gift and power of God” that he was able to complete the translation, a fact his wife, Emma, affirmed. \n \n “The Book of Mormon is of divine authenticity — I have not the slightest doubt of it,” Emma told their son Joseph III on one occasion. “I am satisfied that no man could have dictated the writing of the manuscripts unless he was inspired; for, when acting as his scribe, your father would dictate to me for hour after hour; and when returning after meals, or after interruptions, he would at once begin where he had left off, without either seeing the manuscript or having any portion of it read to him.” \n \n The topic page also asserts the idea that the original Book of Mormon manuscript, 28 percent of which has survived through the years, also supports statements that Joseph dictated the text from another language in a short period of time. \n \n “For example, it includes errors that suggest the scribe heard words incorrectly rather than misread words copied from another manuscript,” the topic page states. “In addition, some grammatical constructions that are more characteristic of Near Eastern languages than English appear in the original manuscript, suggesting that the base language of the translation was not English.” \n \n ‘Days never to be forgotten’ \n \n Joseph may have been the one called to translate the Book of Mormon, but Jensen emphasized that he was not completely alone in the process. \n \n “We have a lot of faithful individuals who believed in the Book of Mormon, believed in the power of the Book of Mormon and who were willing to put up with a lot of drudgery, and then of course later in church history, a lot of trial, a lot of hardship,” Jensen said. \n \n Jensen highlighted Joseph\'s scribes as examples of others who performed “time-intensive” work during the process. \n \n Oliver Cowdery is known as the primary scribe for the original manuscript of the Book of Mormon, but many others took up a quill to assist Joseph during the translation, according to Jensen. They include Martin Harris, a friend of Joseph’s who later was one of the Three Witnesses to the Book of Mormon and who financed the printing; Emma Smith; Samuel Smith, one of Joseph’s younger brothers; Reuben Hale, Joseph’s brother-in-law; and Christian Whitmer, one of the sons of the Whitmer family who allowed Joseph to finish translating in their home in Fayette, New York. Christian’s brother John Whitmer also may have served as scribe for a time, and there is handwriting of an additional unidentified scribe found in the original manuscript. \n \n After completing the first manuscript, Joseph also asked Cowdery to take charge on creating a second copy of the text to provide to E.B. Grandin’s printing office in Palmyra, New York. Although Hyrum Smith and another unidentified scribe assisted, Cowdery wrote the bulk of the scripture by hand twice, according to Jensen. \n \n “Think of the hand cramps that Oliver Cowdery had to endure,” Jensen said. \n \n But for Cowdery, the opportunity to assist with the translation and publication of the Book of Mormon was a treasured one. \n \n “These were days never to be forgotten — to sit under the sound of a voice dictated by the inspiration of heaven,” Cowdery said, according to the translation topic page. \n \n The “drudgery” that set the stage for the coming forth of the Book of Mormon extended into the realm of housework and farm chores. One person known for providing assistance with the everyday matters was Mary Whitmer, the mother of the Whitmer family. \n \n Jensen said Mary Whitmer’s grandson John C. Whitmer told of her being “bogged down” with the additional cooking, cleaning and other house chores that came as a result of Joseph and other visitors staying in her home during the translation process. One day while she was milking the cows, Mary Whitmer saw an angel who acknowledged her hard work and proceeded to show her the gold plates. \n \n “From that moment, my grandmother was enabled to perform her household duties with comparative ease, and she felt no more inclination to murmur because her lot was hard,” said John C. Whitmer, as cited in an article Jensen wrote titled “A Bit of Old String” on history.lds.org. \n \n Jensen also pointed out that contributions were even made by some who didn’t believe in the Book of Mormon as a book of divine origin, including John H. Gilbert, who was the principal typesetter at Grandin’s printing office. As Joseph dictated the translation to the scribes, he “did not call for punctuation.” Therefore, both the original manuscript and the printer’s manuscript were devoid of it, according to the topic page. The task of punctuating the Book of Mormon and setting the type, letter by letter, was left to Gilbert, a job he “took pride” in later in life, Jensen said. \n \n The Book of Mormon today \n \n The Book of Mormon has gone a long way since it first hit the shelves of Grandin’s bookshop in the small town of Palmyra, New York. More than 168 million copies have been distributed since March 1830, according to LDS Church Public Affairs, and an average of 4.5 million physical copies are distributed each year. With 110 different language translations of the book and digital translations available in 40 different languages on scriptures.lds.org and the Gospel Library app, the Book of Mormon continues to expand the church’s reach. \n \n “You could very much make the case that the LDS Church was founded on the publication of a book,” Jensen said. “Word of mouth only has a limited radius. It really was the publication of this book, and therefore this dissemination of this information through missionaries and others, that people began to hear about and then believe in Joseph Smith, his prophetic calling and the Restoration.” \n \n Email: wbutters@deseretnews.com, Twitter: WhitneyButters', 'Heavily armed police stand guard as a motorcade carrying Vice President-elect Mike Pence, center, leaves the Richard Rodgers Theatre after a performance of ""Hamilton,"" in New York, Friday, Nov. 18, 2016....

Repurposed to fire tear-gas canisters, the weapon was used several years ago for training exercises, according to Richard Beary, the university’s chief of police. It hasn’t left storage since. \n \n At Central Florida, which has an enrollment of nearly 60,000 and a Division I football team, the device was acquired, a police spokeswoman said, for “security and crowd control.” But the university’s police force isn’t the only one to have come upon a grenade launcher. Hinds Community College—located in western Mississippi, with a student population of 11,000—had one too. (Campus police officers at Hinds declined to comment. A woman who worked for the department but declined to identify herself said that the launcher had been repurposed to shoot flares but that the college no longer possessed it.) \n \n Both institutions received their launchers from the same source: the Department of Defense. At least 117 colleges have acquired equipment from the department through a federal program, known as the 1033 program, that transfers military surplus to law-enforcement agencies across the country, according to records The Chronicle received after filing Freedom of Information requests with state governments (see table of equipment). \n \n Campus police departments have used the program to obtain military equipment as mundane as men’s trousers (Yale University) and as serious as a mine-resistant, ambush-protected vehicle (Ohio State University). Along with the grenade launcher, Central Florida acquired 23 M-16 assault rifles from the Department of Defense. \n \n Ask participants in the program, and they’ll say it provides departments, particularly those with limited budgets like campus police forces, with necessary gear at very little cost (colleges pay only for shipping). Responsible departments, advocates say, develop plans for specific instances in which the equipment will be used—crowd-control situations, say, or active-shooter incidents like the Virginia Tech massacre. Outside of those cases, community members are unlikely to know that the gear even exists. \n \n But on campus and off, there are detractors. Some argue that the procurement of tactical gear doesn’t help with the types of crimes that occur more frequently on college campuses, like alcohol-related incidents and sexual assault. Others worry that military equipment is an especially poor fit for college campuses, fearing that it may have a chilling effect on free expression. \n \n The 1033 program has received heightened scrutiny in the wake of protests in Ferguson, Mo. After the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, reporters and phone-wielding protesters captured images of police officers armed with military-grade guns, camouflage, and armored vehicles. Observers characterized the police response as heavy-handed and criticized officers for improperly using their weaponry. \n \n In Washington renewed attention to the transfer of military weapons has led some lawmakers to call for a review of the 1033 program. Sen. Claire McCaskill, a Democrat from Missouri who heads the oversight subcommittee for the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, led a hearing on Tuesday to consider revisions in the program. She suggested that local police departments that enjoy cost savings from free military equipment be required to receive 200 hours of training. \n \n “If we’re gonna give you money, we’re going to make you jump through a few hoops first,” she said. \n \n Hilary O. Shelton, director of the NAACP’s Washington bureau, told the committee that if the 1033 program is to be continued, it should be restructured to focus on “protecting and serving citizens.” \n \n Advertisement \n \n Sen. Carl Levin, a Democrat from Michigan and chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, has said he plans to review the 1033 program before the Senate considers reauthorizing the annual military-spending bill. President Obama has also called for a review. \n \n Ms. McCaskill, Mr. Levin, and Mr. Obama joined Sen. Rand Paul, a Republican from Kentucky, and Rep. Hank Johnson, a Democrat from Georgia, in questioning the program. In an announcement that he would formally draft a bill in September imposing limits on the transfer of certain equipment—including armored vehicles and large-caliber weapons—Mr. Johnson mocked Ohio State’s procurement of its heavy-duty vehicle, known as an MRAP, through the 1033 program. \n \n ""Apparently, college kids are getting too rowdy,"" Mr. Johnson said. \n \n Significant Savings \n \n The scrutiny may be increasing now, but the 1033 program has been available to colleges for quite some time. In 1990, Congress passed a version of the National Defense Authorization Act that allowed for the transfer of excess Department of Defense equipment to federal and state agencies if gear was deemed “suitable for use by such agencies in counter-drug activities.” In 1996 the law was reauthorized, with Section 1033 allowing for the transfer of equipment for terrorism-related purposes as well. \n \n Now more than 8,000 federal and state law-enforcement agencies—many campus police departments among them—are eligible to participate. Participating agencies don’t buy equipment; they are given it. They are prohibited from reselling or leasing the gear, and required to provide updates on the location of “tactical” gear, like armored vehicles and weaponry. When a police department decides a piece of equipment has outlived its usefulness, it is returned to the government. \n \n After the buildup and winding down of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, the amount of surplus equipment available to law-enforcement agencies increased drastically. At colleges, where terrorist attacks and shootouts with drug cartels are virtually unheard of, the active-shooter scenario became the primary justification for colleges to acquire tactical gear. \n \n Central Florida got eight of its M-16 assault rifles in 2011, and 15 more were transferred to the department in February of the following year. At campus police departments, much like their counterparts at the local, state, and federal level, the most popular weapon procured through the 1033 program is the M-16 assault rifle. \n \n At least 60 institutions have acquired M-16s through the program. Arizona State University holds the most, with 70 in its arsenal, followed by Florida International University and the University of Maryland with 50 M-16s each. Central Florida received its grenade launcher in 2008; Hinds acquired its in 2006. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Gear through the 1033 program is free to participating departments, with receiving agencies having to pay only delivery and maintenance costs. The University of Louisiana at Monroe paid $507.43 for 12 M-16 rifles; the University of Alabama at Huntsville paid $220.40 for the transfer and shipping of five M-16s. \n \n “For me, this is a cost savings for taxpayers,” said Jen Day Shaw, associate vice president and dean of students at the University of Florida and chair of the Campus Safety Knowledge Community, a forum for members of Naspa: Student Affairs Administrators in Higher Education. When police departments “have the ability to get equipment that will help them do their jobs at a greatly reduced price,” Ms. Shaw said, “it is a benefit for the whole campus.” \n \n “It is a force multiplier for us,” said David Perry, chief of police at Florida State University and president of the International Association of Campus Law Enforcement Administrators. “Typically, we are not staffed at optimum levels. We are not given budgets comparable to some large cities and municipalities, so we need to find ways to make it reach.” \n \n Indeed, many police departments use the 1033 program to acquire basic supplies along with tactical equipment. “Aside from body armor and weapons,” Mr. Perry said, “there is furniture, hand sanitizers, bandages. There are all types of equipment, materials, and supplies we need to support our overall mission.” \n \n \'Better to Be Prepared\' \n \n At Central Florida, Chief Beary said, M-16 rifles are stored in vehicles for emergencies, like the one his officers responded to at midnight on March 18, 2013. Answering a call for a pulled fire alarm, officers eventually raided the dormitory room of James Seevakumaran, 30, and found a handgun, an assault rifle, more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition, and four homemade bombs. Mr. Seevakumaran was also in the room, dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The police said the would-be gunman had intended to force students into the hall with the fire alarm, where he would be waiting with his weapons. \n \n “What was once the unthinkable has become the inevitable,” Mr. Beary said. “These bad guys have plans and are heavily armed, and law enforcement needs to be able to keep up with them. In order to do that, police officers need to be highly trained, well equipped, and ready to respond to any scenario.” \n \n Michael Qualls, an associate professor of criminal justice at Fort Valley State University, in Georgia, agrees. A retired Army officer, Mr. Qualls worked for several campus police departments before he began teaching. “If we continue on with the 1033 program, as those items become obsolete at the military level and if they become available, why not get ’em?” Mr. Qualls said. “It’s better to be prepared than not prepared.” \n \n But seeing that much firepower on college campuses is worrisome to some observers like Peter Kraska, a professor at Eastern Kentucky University’s School of Justice Studies. Mr. Kraska has studied police militarization since the late 1980s. \n \n “The typical college-campus chief of police might say, ‘Look, we’ve had serious incidents occur around the country on college campuses,’” said Mr. Kraska. “The flaw in that thinking is that they are not going to be able to respond, even if they have all of that stuff. Those incidents are usually over very, very quickly”—25 minutes, tops. Longer than that, Mr. Kraska said, and the campus police will be joined by local and state law-enforcement officials, who will have greater capability and firepower. \n \n For Mary Anne Franks, an associate professor of law at the University of Miami, the possibility that an extraordinary event could occur doesn’t justify the procurement of assault rifles and armored vehicles. The real danger Ferguson residents faced came not from a terrorist attack, she said, but from police officers armed with this sort of equipment. \n \n Advertisement \n \n “Mostly, I’m wondering why,” she said. “As much as one might wonder about why major cities are getting this type of equipment—which I think we should wonder about and ask questions about—it seems even stranger to talk about it happening in voluntary communities that don’t experience much violent crime.” \n \n Ms. Franks raised another concern: As students become aware of the military gear some police departments possess, she said, that may curtail their willingness to express themselves and protest. \n \n “It’s not just the question of what happens in any one particular incident, but the tone it sets about what an environment needs to be,” Ms. Franks said. “This presumption of danger—this presumption of hostility—is really toxic in many ways and avoids the problems that the community might actually be suffering from.” \n \n \'A Profound Cultural Impact\' \n \n To alleviate some of the apprehension surrounding the use of military weapons on a college campus, said Linda J. Stump, the University of Florida’s police chief, transparency is key. The University of Florida police department acquired an armored truck in 2007 under the 1033 program. Ms. Stump said the vehicle would be deployed only during an active-shooter situation and never for a civil disturbance. \n \n Campus police officers are professionals, with processes in place to maintain their training levels, she said, and communities will be better served if departments explain that. \n \n Administrative oversight and communication are also necessary, said Mr. Perry of Florida State. Administrators outside the police department should be briefed not only on what type of equipment is being acquired but also on the circumstances under which such gear would be used. \n \n When the Florida State police department acquired a Humvee through the 1033 program, Mr. Perry said, he briefed administrators on the instances in which the vehicle would be used—in active-shooter scenarios, for example, but also during a hurricane or at events for community outreach. \n \n When Ms. Stump talks about the value of transparency, she’s also tackling the issue of training: Are college police officers experienced enough to handle assault rifles and other military gear? \n \n Yes, as long as they’ve had the training required for departmental accreditation, said Mr. Perry. \n \n To earn accreditation from the International Association of Campus Law Enforcement Administrators, for example, an organization must show proof that officers have attended training to use any new weapon, vehicle, or tool they acquire, Mr. Perry said. Training must be proctored by third-party instructors who know how to use the gear proficiently. Neither the Department of Defense nor the association administers the training. The Department of Defense does not require any training to obtain or keep the gear. \n \n “At a nonaccredited school, there is not an expectation for formalized policies and procedures,” Mr. Perry said. The association’s website lists 40 accredited college departments. Another group, the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies, has accredited 70 college police departments, according to its website. \n \n The University of Virginia’s police department purchased 12 M-16 rifles through the 1033 program, and the university converted them to patrol rifles—guns that cannot be fired automatically. Officers who are issued patrol rifles receive three levels of training, said Mike Coleman, a captain in the department. Training sessions cover marksmanship, safety, decision making, and threat identification. The police department at the University of Virginia is accredited by the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies, as is the University of Florida. \n \n “The public is not aware of much of the training that university police officers receive,” Mr. Coleman said. “Our department not only attends the same police academy that municipal officers attend; they teach at that academy.” \n \n Professors like Mr. Kraska remain concerned about how the 1033 program could affect campuses. \n \n “It can have a profound cultural impact on a small police department when you start adding weaponry, battle-dress uniforms, all the advanced military technologies,” he said. “That small agency can go rapidly from one of protecting and serving to one of viewing the community as the enemy, and a potential threat.” \n \n Lance Lambert and Max Lewontin contributed to this article.']",6,"– To most people, it just looks like a smooth, egg-sized rock, but it was part of the founding of the Mormon church and photos of it have now been published for the first time. The images of the ""seer stone"" that Mormons believe founder Joseph Smith used to translate buried gold plates he said he found in upstate New York 185 years ago were released as part of what the church says is an effort to be more transparent about its past, the AP reports. The photos have been published in a book that also includes pictures of the ""printer's manuscript"" of the Book of Mormon—a handwritten copy of the original manuscript that was produced by one of Smith's scribes. The book, which Smith said he translated from ""reformed Egyptian"" with the stone, recounts a visit from Jesus Christ to North America, reports the Salt Lake Tribune. As for the translation, the church has this to say: ""Joseph placed ... the seer stone in a hat, pressed his face into the hat to block out extraneous light, and read aloud the English words that appeared on the instrument."" It says the translation occurred over three months in 1829 as part of a ""a series of miraculous events."" Indeed: In March, the Deseret News reported that the church says it takes roughly five years to translate and then produce the Book of Mormon in another language. The church says it is trying to make its history more ""tangible"" with the release, but Terryl Givens, professor of literature and religion at the University of Richmond, tells the AP that the church is also trying to show skeptics it has nothing to hide. ""Other churches' origins are concealed by the mist of history. Mormonism is the first world religion in which the origins were exposed to public view, to documentation, to journalists, and newspaper reporting."" (Last year, the church admitted that Smith had up to 40 wives.)"

147,"['Abu Dhabi: The record drop in oil prices from more than $110 per barrel in 2014 to less than $40 per barrel this year has forced the Saudi government to reform its economy and look beyond oil, analysts said on Monday. \n \n “There is no doubt that low oil prices is the main reason why Saudi Arabia is undertaking reforms to diversify its economy. In the long run, the new measures announced by the government will benefit the economy,” said Edward Bell, commodity analyst from Emirates NBD. \n \n As part of the new reforms announced on Monday, tourism will be encouraged and new industries will be set up. \n \n “We have developed a case of oil addiction in Saudi Arabia,” Saudi Deputy Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman said in an interview to Al Arabiya Television. “I think by 2020, if oil stops we can survive,” he added. \n \n The government is undertaking reforms as oil prices slump due to over production and weak demand. \n \n In a landmark decision in December, the Saudi government cut subsidies and raised fuel prices by 50 per cent. \n \n “Being dependent of just one source of income makes an economy incredible vulnerable to price shocks and makes forward planning very difficult,” said Ole Hansen, an analyst from Saxo Bank. \n \n He said using the oil wealth to diversify is the only way forward for the economy to survive in the long term. \n \n “A fast growing population and no history of paying tax and jobs making little or no meaning, requires changes in order to compete in the global market place.” \n \n According to a report issued by the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in December it may take many years for oil prices to recover and reach the level of more than $110 per barrel witnessed in June 2014, \n \n The oil producers group expects the price of its basket of crudes to rise to $70 a barrel in 2020 and $95 a barrel in 2040. \n \n Analysts predicted an average price of $40 in 2016 and $45 in 2017. Brent, the global benchmark was trading at less than $45 per barrel on Monday. \n \n “The price of oil will bounce further as we move towards the end of 2016 and into 2017. Billions of dollars of capex cut will eventually change the focus in the market from oversupply to the potential lack of supply,” Hansen added. \n \n In 2015, Saudi Arabia registered a budget deficit of 16 per cent of GDP and with government reforms announced December 2015, Saudi Arabia is expected to register a budget deficit of 13 per cent of GDP.', ""RIYADH (Reuters) - The powerful young prince overseeing Saudi Arabia’s economy unveiled ambitious plans on Monday aimed at ending the kingdom’s “addiction” to oil and transforming it into a global investment power. \n \n (L-R) Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, Saudi King Salman, and Saudi Arabia's Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman stand together after Saudi Arabia's cabinet agrees to implement a broad reform plan known as Vision 2030 in Riyadh, April 25, 2016. REUTERS/Saudi Press Agency/Handout via Reuters \n \n Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said the world’s top oil exporter expects state oil company Saudi Aramco [SDABO.UL] to be valued at more than $2 trillion ahead of the sale of less than 5 percent of it through an initial public offering (IPO). \n \n He added that the kingdom would raise the capital of its public investment fund to 7 trillion riyals ($2 trillion) from 600 billion riyals ($160 billion). \n \n The plans also included changes that would alter the social structure of the ultra-conservative Muslim kingdom by pushing for women to have a bigger economic role and by offering improved status to resident expatriates. \n \n “We will not allow our country ever to be at the mercy of commodity price volatility or external markets,” Prince Mohammed said at his first news conference with international journalists, who were invited to a Riyadh palace for the event. \n \n “We have developed a case of oil addiction in Saudi Arabia,” he had earlier told al-Arabiya television news channel. \n \n His “Vision 2030” envisaged raising non-oil revenue to 600 billion riyals ($160 billion) by 2020 and 1 trillion riyals ($267 billion) by 2030 from 163.5 billion riyals ($43.6 billion) last year. But the plan gave few details on how this would be implemented, something that has bedevilled previous reforms. \n \n The 31-year-old prince gave assured answers to questions on the plan, and appeared to pitch his comments to appeal across the Saudi social spectrum, and in particular to young people, who face unemployment and an economic downturn despite their country’s oil wealth. \n \n Even before oil prices started to plunge in 2014, economists had regarded Riyadh’s fiscal policy and economic structure as being unsustainable, but reduced income from energy sales has made reform more urgent. \n \n The plan appeared to lift sentiment on the Saudi stock market .TASI, where shares jumped by 2.5 percent in the heaviest trading for eight months, but it fell short of convincing skeptics that the kingdom can prosper in an era of cheap oil. \n \n At the center of the plan is the restructuring of its Public Investment Fund (PIF), which Prince Mohammed said would become a hub for Saudi investment abroad, partly by raising money through selling shares in Aramco. \n \n Asked where Riyadh would find the funds for a $2 trillion dollar fund after recent borrowing, he said it would come from transferring the ownership of Aramco to the PIF. \n \n “We are speaking about more than $2 trillion. We expect the valuation to be more than $2 trillion. In addition to that there are other assets that will be added to the fund, and part of it is already added. \n \n He said it could “turn into a global investment fund with a size of up to $3 trillion dollars”. \n \n OPENING ARAMCO ACCOUNTS \n \n The partial privatization of Aramco was also central to the plans, and Prince Mohammed said it would be transformed into an energy company that he expected to be valued at $2 trillion to $3 trillion, and that less than 5 percent of it would be listed on the stock market. \n \n So big is the state oil company because of its rights to the kingdom’s crude reserves, that selling even 1 percent of its value would create the biggest initial public offering (IPO) on earth, he said. \n \n He said other Aramco subsidiary companies would also be listed along with other publicly held companies, and added that one major benefit of privatization was that it would increase transparency and help limit corruption. \n \n “People used to be unhappy that files and data of Aramco are undeclared, unclear and not transparent. Today they will be transparent. If Aramco gets IPO-ed that means it has to announce its statements of accounts,” he said. \n \n Since the prince was appointed to oversee Saudi long-term planning through the Council of Economic and Development Affairs, Riyadh’s focus on reform has grown far more urgent and far more acute. \n \n Prince Mohammed has enjoyed a dizzyingly rapid rise since his father became king 15 months ago, from being little known outside the ruling Al Saud family to become the driving force of Saudi plans to prepare for a future after oil. \n \n In his rare press conference, he presented himself as a modernizing leader who seeks to shake Saudi Arabia out of its economic slumber and its reputation for opacity and rigid bureaucracy, showing an interest in topics including education, the public role of women, and football. \n \n Saudi Arabia would prepare a new education curriculum, Prince Mohammed said. Despite previous reform attempts, the kingdom’s schools have long been seen as focused on religious teachings rather than preparing students for a role in a modern economy. \n \n Under the plans, Saudi Arabia would produce or assemble half of its defense equipment internally in order to create job opportunities, he said, and Riyadh would make foreign investment easier. \n \n The government ran a deficit of 367 billion riyals ($98 billion) or 15 per cent of gross domestic product in 2015, officials said, and this year’s budget plan aimed to cut that to 326 billion riyals ($87 billion). \n \n His economic team has already announced efforts to curb wasteful government spending, to diversify revenue streams by introducing sales tax and privatizing state assets, and to make reforms in the education sector. \n \n Such was the speculation among Saudis over the details of the plan that hashtags associated with it were the top two trending on Twitter on Monday in the country with the highest rate of social media use in the Middle East. \n \n But ambitious targets, such as raising the private sector share in the economy to 60 percent from 40 percent, reducing unemployment to 7.6 percent from 11 percent and growing non-oil income to 1 trillion riyals ($267 billion) from 163 billion riyals ($44 billion) were not explained further. \n \n PLANS \n \n Some Saudis said they had hoped for more detail on crucial issues such as education reform. There were no further details of plans to increase revenue from tax or of any changes to the political structure of the absolute monarchy. \n \n “For me as a Saudi, I am concerned by the education transformation plan,” said a Saudi entrepreneur. “If it is not at the top of the list, why not?” \n \n However, the plan also envisaged increasing women’s participation in the workforce, something that has already grown quickly over the past five years, to 30 percent from 22 percent. \n \n But he also said he did not believe Saudi society was ready to end its ban on women driving. \n \n A green card system would also be launched within five years to enable expatriate Arabs and Muslims to live and work long-term in the country, Prince Mohammed said, in a major shift for the insular kingdom. \n \n But the focus was on economic restructuring to help reduce oil dependence. \n \n “I think by 2020, if oil stops we can survive,” Prince Mohammed said. “We need it, we need it, but I think in 2020 we can live without oil.” \n \n Slideshow (6 Images) \n \n Appealing to Saudi youth, he ended his news conference by promising them a new Saudi Arabia. \n \n “The vision is not a dream, it’s a reality that will come true,” he said. \n \n ($1 = 3.7489 riyals)"", 'Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Most of Saudi Arabia\'s profits come from oil \n \n The Saudi cabinet has approved sweeping economic reforms aimed at moving the country away from its dependence on oil profits. \n \n Just over 70% of revenues came from oil last year but it has been hit by falling prices. \n \n One part of the plan will see shares sold in state-owned oil giant Aramco to create a sovereign wealth fund. \n \n Announcing the reforms, Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman described his country as being addicted to oil. \n \n Saudis react on social media \n \n The Vision 2030 plan, he told the Saudi-owned Al-Arabiya news channel, would ensure ""we can live without oil by 2020"". \n \n Among the reforms he announced in his interview were: \n \n Shares worth less than 5% of Aramco, a company he valued at up to $2.5tn (£1.7tn), will be sold \n \n Some of the proceeds will go towards a sovereign wealth fund worth $2tn \n \n A new visa system will allow expatriate Muslims and Arabs to work long term in Saudi Arabia \n \n Steps will be taken to diversify the economy, including investment in mineral mining and expanding military production \n \n Participation of women in the workforce to increase \n \n Even just selling 1% of Aramco would create the biggest initial public offering in history, the prince said, outstripping blockbuster sales like Facebook and Alibaba. \n \n The IMF called the Saudi plan an ""ambitious, far-reaching effort"" but warned implementation would be a challenge. \n \n The cost of oil: analysis by Andrew Walker, BBC economics correspondent \n \n Image copyright AP Image caption Saudi Arabia is the world\'s biggest crude exporter \n \n Oil has made Saudi Arabia a major economic force.

Saudi Arabia has deep pockets. \n \n It will not go running to the International Monetary Fund for financial help, something another oil exporter, Angola, has done. But the Saudi reserves are eroding and with almost three quarters of government revenue coming from oil, the price fall is making itself felt. \n \n For the long term, international efforts to combat climate change create huge uncertainty about demand for oil in the future. Oil will not lose its dominance of the market for transport fuel in the next few years, but further ahead the outlook is unknown. \n \n So Saudi Arabia needs to become less dependent on oil for government revenue and for the jobs and incomes of Saudi nationals. \n \n Oil prices are still less than half the peak of $115 a barrel seen in June 2014.

""We will not allow our country ever to be at the mercy of commodity price volatility or external markets,"" Prince Mohammed bin Salman told reporters gathered at a Riyadh palace Monday. Per Gulf News, he had earlier appeared in a televised al-Arabiya interview, noting, ""We have developed a case of oil addiction in Saudi Arabia. … I think by 2020, if oil stops we can survive."" Also part of his new blueprint: including women more in the economy and appealing to young people who face the prospect of not finding jobs. The BBC notes that more than 70% of the kingdom's revenue came from oil in 2015, but oil prices continue to plummet and Saudi Arabia's economy is suffering, per Al Jazeera. In broad terms, the prince would like to bring up its Public Investment Fund (PIF) capital to $2 trillion from $160 billion. Prince Mohammed says 5% of shares in the Aramco oil company would be sold to fund this $2 trillion nest (which he thinks could even rise to $3 trillion). Also part of the prince's game plan: setting up a ""green card"" system in five years' time to expedite Muslim and Arab expatriates' long-term residency, as well as boosting affordable housing and getting more women into the workforce. The founder of the DC-based Saudi American Public Relations Affairs Committee tells Al Jazeera this a ""visionary move,"" but another Saudi expert says he's seen similar changes proposed before.

VPC \n \n The electric car maker has sent through a software change to make its cars ride higher \n \n In this Wednesday, Nov. 6, 2013 photo provided by the Tennessee Highway Patrol, emergency workers respond to a fire on a Tesla Model S electric car in Smyrna, Tenn. (Photo: AP) Story Highlights The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has opened a probe into Tesla\'s Model S \n \n The probe of the electric car results from reports of battery fires \n \n Tesla CEO Elon Musk says he stands behind the car, but has ordered changes \n \n The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said today it has opened a formal investigation into the safety of the Tesla Model S electric car following two reports of battery fires after striking roadway debris. \n \n The agency said its safety investigation was prompted by recent ""undercarriage strikes"" in Washington state and Tennessee. In both cases, fires resulted after the cars both ran over debris on the road that pierced the battery compartment. After news of the probe broke, Tesla shares fell to $116 in pre-market trading but climbed back once the market opened. They closed 3.7%, or $4.51, up for the day at $126.09 a share. \n \n TESLA STOCK: Shares rise despite federal probe into fires \n \n Early Tuesday before NHTSA\'s announcement, Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that he taking three steps as a result of the fires, but added that he stands behind their safety. The steps were: \n \n •Higher ground clearance to make them less likely to strike road debris that can potentially penetrate the battery pack and ignite a blaze. \n \n •Asking federal safety regulators to ""conduct a full investigation as soon as possible into the fires."" Musk gave no hint that NHTSA was about to open an investigation. \n \n •Amending the cars\' warranty to cover damage due to fire. \n \n A NHTSA probe can lead to recall, but earlier this month Musk says he has no plans to order one because he doesn\'t think it is warranted. \n \n Musk announced the steps in a lengthy post on Tesla\'s blog. In it, he offers yet another strong defense of the car\'s safety, especially as it relates to protection from fire. ""We believe the evidence is clear that there is no safer car on the road than the Model S,"" he writes. His company expects to produce more than 20,000 of the electric cars this year, which sell for about $70,000 and up. \n \n He calls media reaction to the three fires a gross overreaction, especially given how thousands of conventional cars have been consumed by gasoline fires from ruptured tanks over the years. \n \n He says his battery-powered car is actually safer than just about any gas-powered car on the road. \n \n Elon Musk CEO of Tesla with a new Model S car outside the Tesla customer deliver area at the Tesla Fremont, Calif., factory (Photo: Jessica Brandi Lifland for USA TODAY) \n \n ""Since the Model S went into production mid last year, there have been over 400 deaths and 1,200 serious injuries in the United States alone due to gasoline car fires, compared to zero deaths and zero injuries due to Tesla fires anywhere in the world."" \n \n In the posting of its investigation, NHTSA noted that passengers in the Teslas that caught on fire were able to escape. ""In each incident, the vehicle\'s battery monitoring system provided escalating visible and audible warnings, allowing the driver to execute a controlled stop and exit the vehicle before the battery emitted smoke and fire,"" NHTSA writes. \n \n CLOSE Tesla stock fell after reports of the electric cars catching fire after striking road debris VPC \n \n Two of the Tesla fires were caused when the vehicle struck road debris that pierced the battery compartment. The third happened in Mexico when a Model S crashed. In each case, the occupants escaped unharmed. Musk says it\'s proof of the car\'s safety. \n \n But given the media outcry, Musk indicates he decided to act even though he already stands by the car. He says the plan to create more ground clearance under the cars has already been implemented. \n \n Tesla has already sent a signal to the computers in all Model S cars to tell them to increase the vehicle\'s ground clearance at highway speeds. he says the goal is to reduce the chance of hitting objects on the road. Another software update in January is aimed at letting drivers set their preferred road height for themselves and passengers. \n \n As for the NHTSA involvement in probing the three accidents that led to fires, Musk says that if regulators offers suggestions on how to improve fire safety in the Model S, he will immediately implement them. he has previously said he does not expect that the Model S will need to be recalled over the fires. \n \n When it comes to extending the warranty on the sedan, Musk says his decision will apply to Tesla models and be applicable even if the driver is held to be a fault for the fire. \n \n Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/I0PQdJ', 'Federal safety regulators opened a probe into a series of fires in Tesla Motors Inc. electric cars following crashes. \n \n The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Tuesday that it would investigate why two of the expensive Tesla Model S sporty hatchbacks have caught fire this year following accidents in which the battery casing that serves as the undercarriage of the car cracked open. \n \n LATEST: From the L.A Auto Show \n \n A third fire, which took place in Mexico, won’t be part of the investigation because it is outside the agency’s jurisdiction. \n \n NHTSA noted that in the two U.S. fires, one in Seattle and the other in Nashville, the battery monitoring system in the cars warned the drivers, allowing them to pull over and safely exit the vehicles before the battery emitted smoke and fire. \n \n The fires have become an issue for Tesla, contributing to 37% drop in the value of its stock since reaching a high of $193.37 on Sept. 30. The shares were down an additional 2% in overnight trading Tuesday. \n \n Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk said the automaker requested the investigation to refute fears that electric cars are more prone to fires than other vehicles. \n \n [Updated 8:55 a.m. PST, Nov. 19: Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk claimed that the automaker requested the investigation to refute fears that electric cars were more prone to fires than other vehicles. \n \n But the NHTSA disputed that, saying its decision was an independent process. \n \n “In regards to Tesla, the agency notified the automaker of its plans to open a formal investigation and requested their cooperation,"" the agency said, ""which is standard agency practice for all investigations.” \n \n Tesla is already taking action, changing its warranty to cover damage due to a fire, even if due to driver error. \n \n “Either our belief in the safety of our car is correct and this is a minor cost,"" Musk said, ""or we are wrong, in which case the right thing is for Tesla to bear the cost rather than the car buyer.” \n \n The automaker believes the warranty change, which doesn’t apply if an owner purposefully sets the car on fire, will reassure buyers.] \n \n “If a false perception about the safety of electric cars is allowed to linger, it will delay the advent of sustainable transport and increase the risk of global climate change,” Musk wrote in a post to his blog on the Tesla website Monday night. \n \n PHOTOS: Tesla Model S \n \n The automaker is taking advantage of the car’s electronic capabilities to execute a wireless update to the air suspension that will result in greater ground clearance at highway speeds, Musk said. \n \n “This is about reducing the chances of underbody impact damage, not improving safety,” Musk said. “The theoretical probability of a fire injury is already vanishingly small and the actual number to date is zero.” \n \n Another software update expected in January will give the driver direct control of the air suspension ride height transitions. \n \n Musk also defended the automaker’s vehicles, writing that they have a lower fire risk than gasoline vehicles. \n \n “Since the Model S went into production mid last year, there have been over 400 deaths and 1,200 serious injuries in the United States alone due to gasoline car fires, compared to zero deaths and zero injuries due to Tesla fires anywhere in the world,” Musk wrote.', 'Our goal when we created Tesla a decade ago was the same as it is today: to accelerate the advent of sustainable transport by bringing compelling mass market electric cars to market as soon as possible. If we could have done that with our first product, we would have, but that was simply impossible to achieve for a startup company that had never built a car and that had one technology iteration and no economies of scale. Our first product was going to be expensive no matter what it looked like, so we decided to build a sports car, as that seemed like it had the best chance of being competitive with its gasoline alternatives. \n \n I suspected that this could be misinterpreted as Tesla believing that there was a shortage of sports cars for rich people, so I described the three step “master plan” for getting to compelling and affordable electric vehicles in my first blog piece about our company. This was unfortunately almost entirely ignored. \n \n In order to get to that end goal, big leaps in technology are required, which naturally invites a high level of scrutiny. That is fair, as new technology should be held to a higher standard than what has come before. However, there should also be some reasonable limit to how high such a standard should be, and we believe that this has been vastly exceeded in recent media coverage. \n \n How Does the Tesla Model S Fire Risk Compare to Gasoline Cars? \n \n Since the Model S went into production last year, there have been more than a quarter million gasoline car fires in the United States alone, resulting in over 400 deaths and approximately 1,200 serious injuries (extrapolating 2012 NFPA data). However, the three Model S fires, which only occurred after very high-speed collisions and caused no serious injuries or deaths, received more national headlines than all 250,000+ gasoline fires combined. The media coverage of Model S fires vs. gasoline car fires is disproportionate by several orders of magnitude, despite the latter actually being far more deadly. \n \n Reading the headlines, it is therefore easy to assume that the Tesla Model S and perhaps electric cars in general have a greater propensity to catch fire than gasoline cars when nothing could be further from the truth. \n \n Journalists with a deep knowledge of the car industry, such as the news editor of Automotive News, understand and attempt to rebut this notion, but they have been drowned out by an onslaught of popular and financial media seeking to make a sensation out of something that a simple Google search would reveal to be false. I would also like to express appreciation for the investigative journalists who took the time to research and write an accurate article. \n \n The degree to which this is outrageous is described well in the above-mentioned Automotive News article. There are now substantially more than the 19,000 Model S vehicles on the road that were reported in our Q3 shareholder letter for an average of one fire per at least 6,333 cars, compared to the rate for gasoline vehicles of one fire per 1,350 cars. By this metric, you are more than four and a half times more likely to experience a fire in a gasoline car than a Model S! Considering the odds in the absolute, you are more likely to be struck by lightning in your lifetime than experience even a non-injurious fire in a Tesla. \n \n Those metrics tell only part of the story. The far more deadly nature of a gasoline car fire deserves to be re-emphasized. Since the Model S went into production mid last year, there have been over 400 deaths and 1,200 serious injuries in the United States alone due to gasoline car fires, compared to zero deaths and zero injuries due to Tesla fires anywhere in the world. \n \n There is a real, physical reason for this: a gasoline tank has 10 times more combustion energy than our battery pack. Moreover, the Model S battery pack also has internal firewalls between the 16 modules and a firewall between the battery pack and passenger compartment. This effectively limits the fire energy to a few percent that of a gasoline car and is the reason why Dr. Shibayama was able to retrieve his pens and papers from the glove compartment completely untouched after the recent fire (caused by a high speed impact with a tow hitch). It is also why arsonists tend to favor gasoline. Trying to set the side of a building on fire with a battery pack is far less effective. \n \n What About Safety Overall? \n \n Our primary concern is not for the safety of the vehicle, which can easily be replaced, but for the safety of our customers and the families they entrust to our cars. Based on the Model S track record so far, you have a zero percent chance of being hurt in an accident resulting in a battery fire, but what about other types of accidents? Despite multiple high-speed accidents, there have been no deaths or serious injuries in a Model S of any kind ever. Of course, at some point, the law of large numbers dictates that this, too, will change, but the record is long enough already for us to be extremely proud of this achievement. This is why the Model S achieved the lowest probability of injury of any car ever tested by the US government. The probability of injury is the most accurate statistical figure of merit, showing clearly that the Model S is safer in an accident than any other vehicle without exception. It is literally impossible for another car to have a better safety track record, as it would have to possess mystical powers of healing. \n \n Further Actions \n \n While we believe the evidence is clear that there is no safer car on the road than the Model S, we are taking three specific actions. \n \n First, we have rolled out an over-the-air update to the air suspension that will result in greater ground clearance at highway speeds. To be clear, this is about reducing the chances of underbody impact damage, not improving safety. The theoretical probability of a fire injury is already vanishingly small and the actual number to date is zero. Another software update expected in January will give the driver direct control of the air suspension ride height transitions. \n \n Second, we have requested that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration conduct a full investigation as soon as possible into the fire incidents. While we think it is highly unlikely, if something is discovered that would result in a material improvement in occupant fire safety, we will immediately apply that change to new cars and offer it as a free retrofit to all existing cars. Given that the incidence of fires in the Model S is far lower than combustion cars and that there have been no resulting injuries, this did not at first seem like a good use of NHTSA’s time compared to the hundreds of gasoline fire deaths per year that warrant their attention. However, there is a larger issue at stake: if a false perception about the safety of electric cars is allowed to linger, it will delay the advent of sustainable transport and increase the risk of global climate change, with potentially disastrous consequences worldwide. That cannot be allowed to happen. \n \n Third, to reinforce how strongly we feel about the low risk of fire in our cars, we will be amending our warranty policy to cover damage due to a fire, even if due to driver error. Unless a Model S owner actively tries to destroy the car, they are covered. Our goal here is to eliminate any concern about the cost of such an event and ensure that over time the Model S has the lowest insurance cost of any car at our price point. Either our belief in the safety of our car is correct and this is a minor cost or we are wrong, in which case the right thing is for Tesla to bear the cost rather than the car buyer. \n \n All of these actions are taken in order to make clear the confidence we have in our product and to eliminate any misperceptions regarding the integrity of our technology and the safety of our cars.']",3,"– Tesla is facing more scrutiny following three car fires in six weeks. First, investors launched a lawsuit; now, the government is getting involved, USA Today reports. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is now investigating two of the fires, both of which occurred after Model S undercarriages hit debris on the road (the other happened during a crash). In a blog post, CEO Elon Musk says his company asked for the investigation and writes that ""if something is discovered that would result in a material improvement in occupant fire safety, we will immediately apply that change to new cars and offer it as a free retrofit to all existing cars."" But the NHTSA tells the LAT a different story: ""The agency notified the automaker of its plans to open a formal investigation and requested their cooperation, which is standard agency practice for all investigations."" Musk also says the company will increase the cars' ground clearance to help prevent them from hitting debris, and warranties will start covering fire damage, even in the event of driver error, ""to reinforce how strongly we feel about the low risk of fire in our cars."" To that end: ""We believe the evidence is clear that there is no safer car on the road than the Model S,"" Musk notes.

150,"['Is sexual addiction the real deal? \n \n Nicole Prause \n \n Controversy exists over what some mental health experts call ""hypersexuality,"" or sexual ""addiction."" Namely, is it a mental disorder at all, or something else? It failed to make the cut in the recently updated Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or DSM-5, considered the bible for diagnosing mental disorders. Yet sex addiction has been blamed for ruining relationships, lives and careers. \n \n Now, for the first time, UCLA researchers have measured how the brain behaves in so-called hypersexual people who have problems regulating their viewing of sexual images. The study found that the brain response of these individuals to sexual images was not related in any way to the severity of their hypersexuality but was instead tied only to their level of sexual desire. \n \n In other words, hypersexuality did not appear to explain brain differences in sexual response any more than simply having a high libido, said senior author Nicole Prause, a researcher in the department of psychiatry at the Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior at UCLA. \n \n ""Potentially, this is an important finding,"" Prause said. ""It is the first time scientists have studied the brain responses specifically of people who identify as having hypersexual problems."" \n \n The study appears in the current online edition of the journal Socioaffective Neuroscience and Psychology. \n \n A diagnosis of hypersexuality or sexual addiction is typically associated with people who have sexual urges that feel out of control, who engage frequently in sexual behavior, who have suffered consequences such as divorce or economic ruin as a result of their behaviors, and who have a poor ability to reduce those behaviors. \n \n But, said Prause and her colleagues, such symptoms are not necessarily representative of an addiction — in fact, non-pathological, high sexual desire could also explain this cluster of problems. \n \n One way to tease out the difference is to measure the brain\'s response to sexual-image stimuli in individuals who acknowledge having sexual problems. If they indeed suffer from hypersexuality, or sexual addiction, their brain response to visual sexual stimuli could be expected be higher, in much the same way that the brains of cocaine addicts have been shown to react to images of the drug in other studies. \n \n The study involved 52 volunteers: 39 men and 13 women, ranging in age from 18 to 39, who reported having problems controlling their viewing of sexual images. They first filled out four questionnaires covering various topics, including sexual behaviors, sexual desire, sexual compulsions, and the possible negative cognitive and behavioral outcomes of sexual behavior. Participants had scores comparable to individuals seeking help for hypersexual problems. \n \n While viewing the images, the volunteers were monitored using electroencephalography (EEG), a non-invasive technique that measures brain waves, the electrical activity generated by neurons when they communicate with each other. Specifically, the researchers measured event-related potentials, brain responses that are the direct result of a specific cognitive event. \n \n ""The volunteers were shown a set of photographs that were carefully chosen to evoke pleasant or unpleasant feelings,"" Prause said. ""The pictures included images of dismembered bodies, people preparing food, people skiing — and, of course, sex. Some of the sexual images were romantic images, while others showed explicit intercourse between one man and one woman."" \n \n The researchers were most interested in the response of the brain about 300 milliseconds after each picture appeared, commonly called the ""P300"" response. This basic measure has been used in hundreds of neuroscience studies internationally, including studies of addiction and impulsivity, Prause said. The P300 response is higher when a person notices something new or especially interesting to them. \n \n The researchers expected that P300 responses to the sexual images would correspond to a person\'s sexual desire level, as shown in previous studies. But they further predicted that P300 responses would relate to measures of hypersexuality. That is, in those whose problem regulating their viewing of sexual images could be characterized as an ""addiction,"" the P300 reaction to sexual images could be expected to spike. \n \n Instead, the researchers found that the P300 response was not related to hypersexual measurements at all; there were no spikes or decreases tied to the severity of participants\' hypersexuality. So while there has been much speculation about the effect of sexual addiction or hypersexuality in the brain, the study provided no evidence to support any difference, Prause said. \n \n ""The brain\'s response to sexual pictures was not predicted by any of the three questionnaire measures of hypersexuality,"" she said. ""Brain response was only related to the measure of sexual desire. In other words, hypersexuality does not appear to explain brain responses to sexual images any more than just having a high libido."" \n \n But debate continues over whether sex addiction is indeed an addiction. A study published in 2012 by Prause\'s colleague Rory Reid, a UCLA assistant professor of psychiatry, supported the reliability of the proposed DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for hypersexual disorder. However, Prause notes, that study was not focused on the validity of sex addiction or impulsivity, and did not use any biophysiological data in the analysis. \n \n ""If our study can be replicated,"" she said, ""these findings would represent a major challenge to existing theories of a sex \'addiction.\' "" \n \n Other authors on the study included Dr. Timothy Fong, associate professor of psychiatry at the Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior at UCLA and director of the UCLA Impulse Control Disorders Clinic; Vaughn R. Steele of the University of New Mexico; and Cameron Staley of Idaho State University.

A new study published in last week’s journal of Socioaffective Neuroscience and Psychology suggests that maybe it doesn’t—bad news for celebrities like Tiger Woods and Russell Brand who have made it trendy in recent years to claim a clinical addiction to sex as an explanation for sexual misbehavior. \n \n The study (which, amazingly, is the first of its kind) measured how the brains of people who struggle with sexually compulsive behavior respond to sexual images. If sex can be addictive in the clinical sense, scientists theorized, then the neural response of sex addicts to pornography should mimic the neural responses of drug or alcohol addicts to their drugs of choice. Instead, researchers found that hypersexual brains don’t react in the same way as other addicts’ brains—in fact, the neural responses to pornography only varied based on levels of sexual libido, rather than on measures of sexual compulsivity. People with higher libidos had more active brain reactions to the sexual images than people with lower libidos, but that was the only correlation. Degrees of sexual compulsivity did not predict brain response at all. If the results of this first study can be replicated, it would represent a major challenge to the notion that sex and pornography can be literally addictive. \n \n “This is controversial territory because it represents a substantial shift in the way we view mental illness,” Dr. Nicole Prause, an assistant research scientist in the department of psychiatry at UCLA and one of the investigators involved with the study, told me. “Most people describe high-frequency sexual problems as an ‘addiction’—that’s how the public and even many clinicians talk about it. But this data challenges the addiction model and forces us to reconsider how we think and talk about these problems.” \n \n Advertisement \n \n \n \n For the study, researchers recruited 52 people (39 men and 13 women) who reported having difficulties controlling their use of pornography and used electroencephalography (EEG) to measure their brain responses to various images. Some images were sexual in nature, such as kissing, nudity, and penetrative sex, while others were designed to be neutral or even unpleasant, such as pictures of skiers and dismembered bodies. Researchers analyzed brain response to the pictures in the first 300 milliseconds after the images appeared, commonly called a “P300.” Hundreds of neuroscience studies have relied on P300 measurements to analyze the brain’s response to various stimuli; for example, Prause said, several studies of substance addicts found increased P300 responses to images of their drugs of choice as compared to neutral images. \n \n “We expected the brain response to sexual stimuli to be consistent with other drugs of addiction, or even other behavioral addiction studies,” said Prause. “But we just don’t see that at all. We weren’t able to find evidence for any relationship between the measures of high-frequency sexual problems and the brain response to sexual images.” \n \n In a 2010 Psychology Today blog post, Dr. Michael Bader provocatively argued that “the addiction made me do it” is merely an excuse for people who want to avoid the difficult psychological thought and introspection required to address the real issues behind sexually compulsive behavior. Now this study has reignited the ongoing debate about whether sex and other so-called behavioral addictions—also known as process addictions, such as shopping and tanning—should be considered pathological alongside substance addictions such as nicotine, alcohol, and drugs. The third edition of the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, released in 1987, included the term “sex addiction” under the category “Sexual Disorder—Not Otherwise Specified,” but that term was removed in subsequent editions. Hypersexual disorder was considered for inclusion in the recently released DSM-5 but was removed by the final draft. \n \n So here’s where we stand: Despite the familiarity of sex addiction in pop culture, hypersexual disorder is not an officially categorized diagnosis—and studies like this suggest that won’t change anytime soon. Nevertheless, mental health professionals around the world have reported patients who come to them seeking help with sexually compulsive behavior. So a problem does exist, and people who want treatment and support deserve access to it. But the debate about sex addiction underlines important questions about how psychiatrists should categorize the difference between a clinical mental illness that can be demonstrated in a lab, such as substance addiction, and other forms of mental distress, which deserve equal care and compassion but don’t necessarily indicate a medical mental illness. If we turn every single quirk of human sexuality into a “disease,” after all, then we’re all screwed. \n \n Advertisement \n \n \n \n “We don't have a lot of information about what constitutes normative sexual behavior, so how can we conclusively determine what is deviant?” said Dr. Rory Reid, a neuropsychologist at UCLA and the principal investigator for the DSM-5 field trial on hypersexual disorder. “I don’t think there is enough evidence to conclude that patterns of hypersexual behavior constitute a bona fide disorder in the scientific realm, but we also don’t have enough evidence to dismiss that possibility. It certainly warrants further research and discussion.” \n \n Dr. Eli Coleman, who directs the program in human sexuality at the University of Minnesota Medical School, argues that any study that looks at compulsive sexual behavior from a traditional addiction model may be missing the mark. \n \n “One of the big problems with the term ‘sex addiction’ is that it immediately assumes that you can apply the same kinds of research methodologies and treatments that you would use for substance addiction,” said Coleman. “There are no sex receptors in the brain to develop tolerance and dependence, as there are with alcohol and drug addiction.” Hypersexuals don’t experience seizures or other physical symptoms of withdrawal when they abstain, for example, like alcohol and drug addicts do. Coleman suggests that for many people, hypersexual behavior seems to be a problem of impulse control or compulsive drive rather than a neural addiction. But, he added, even that explanation is probably too simplistic: Some people use sexual behavior to modulate mood states, and in others hypersexuality looks almost like attention deficit disorder. “It’s really very complex,” said Coleman. “And there has not been enough research to fully examine all of the underlying mechanisms.” \n \n Previous investigations into sex addiction have only measured the brains of sexual compulsives at rest (that is, without exposure to sexual imagery) or relied entirely on self-reported questionnaires, which are likely to be influenced by social ideas about what constitutes “normal” degrees of sexual behavior or desire. This new study is the first time that scientists have measured the active responses of hypersexual brains to sexual stimuli, which seems closer to the mark if scientists want to prove or dispel the clinical case for sex addiction. \n \n “The field is very strange, because experimental work is very rare in this area. Many people report feeling out of control sexually, but when we actually look for evidence of that in a lab, we can’t find it,” said Prause. “That’s why I’m aghast that we’re not doing more research in this area. Questionnaires are valuable, but we need to do more work to determine if what people are reporting is actually true.” \n \n Prause points out why there haven’t been funds directed toward scientific research that might challenge the existence of sex addiction: If something is a disease, there is money to be made from treating it. (One Christian organization, for example, charges $1,275 for a three-day seminar called “Every Man’s Battle” that claims to treat men who “find themselves pulled into the use of pornography” or who “seek out sexual gratification through compulsive masturbation.”)""]",2,"– The term ""sex addiction"" might get tossed around a lot these days as a way to explain some not-so-classy behavior of the Anthony Weiner-Tiger Woods variety, but is it really an addiction on par with drugs or alcohol? The first study to explore brain responses in people who describe themselves as hypersexual suggests otherwise, reports UCLA. Researchers there showed the subjects—39 men and 13 women—sexual images, and discovered that their brains didn't respond in the same way that, say, a cocaine addict would respond to images of cocaine. “Most people describe high-frequency sexual problems as an ‘addiction’—that’s how the public and even many clinicians talk about it,"" one of the researchers tells Slate. ""But this data challenges the addiction model and forces us to reconsider how we think and talk about these problems.” The subjects have higher libidos, or sexual desire, but not necessarily a clinical medical problem. They still need help, but if further studies verify this first one, then the type of help they'll get will be affected. All of which might be OK, writes Jillian Keenan at Slate. ""If we turn every single quirk of human sexuality into a 'disease,' after all, then we’re all screwed."" The study is in the journal Socioaffective Neuroscience & Psychology."

153,"['Mayor Rahm Emanuel on Monday won praise from some representatives of Chicago\'s immigrant community for going to court to block President Donald Trump\'s Department of Justice from withholding some police grant funding from so-called sanctuary cities. \n \n Some of those same activists, though, contend Emanuel should do even more to prevent police from helping federal officials deport Chicago immigrants who entered the country without the required legal documentation. The mayor also caught more flak from U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who in stepping up his rhetoric said ""no amount of federal taxpayer dollars will help a city that refuses to help its own residents."" \n \n The wide array of views coming from Emanuel\'s City Hall, the White House and immigrant protection groups is a sign of the complex debate the mayor has entered by filing the lawsuit. It\'s all further complicated by differing views on whether sanctuary city status fosters or hinders crime — as reflected in Sessions\' harsh words and the city\'s contention that the Trump ""administration\'s rhetoric is divorced from reality."" \n \n Emanuel\'s lawsuit, filed Monday in federal court, asks a judge to block the Trump administration from enforcing three new conditions it included last week in applications for Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant money. The city uses the grant to help buy police cars, purchase other equipment and fund an anti-violence program. Those applications are due Sept. 5, and the city wants a court order before the deadline, said Corporation Counsel Ed Siskel, the city\'s top attorney. \n \n The new conditions outlined by Sessions\' Justice Department: sharing immigration status information with federal officials enforcing deportation laws, providing unlimited police station access to those officials and giving them 48-hours notice of an arrested person\'s release in cases of potential immigration violations. \n \n City officials contend in the lawsuit that they do share immigration status information when they have it, but that\'s rare because the city doesn\'t keep it in the normal course of business. \n \n Providing unfettered station access would interfere with police department practices, delay release of people being held and violate the 10th Amendment by ""commandeering"" local government functions, the lawsuit states. And holding people for 48 hours without a warrant or probable cause that they have committed a crime would violate 4th Amendment search and seizure limitations, it adds. \n \n The suit also contends that the Justice Department has no authority to set conditions on the Byrne grant funding and is attempting to usurp the Congressional power of the purse. In short, the suit deems the conditions ""unlawful and unconstitutional."" \n \n This year, the city was counting on receiving $3.2 million from the grants in question, a relatively miniscule portion of the city\'s overall $9.8 billion budget. \n \n ""We are at a time when every bit counts and every resource matters in this fight,"" Siskel said. ""In addition, we are bringing this legal challenge because the rhetoric and the threats from this administration, embodied in these new restrictions placed on public safety grant funds, are breeding a culture and a climate of fear within the communities in our city."" \n \n City corporation counsel Ed Siskel talks at Dirksen Federal Building about the Emanuel administration lawsuit against the Donald Trump Justice Department about sanctuary city rules.

Aug. 7, 2017 (John Byrne / Chicago Tribune) SEE MORE VIDEOS \n \n Plus, the fate of Chicago\'s grant application also would affect other local Illinois governments that include their funding requests in Chicago\'s application, according to the lawsuit. They are Cook County, Bellwood, Calumet City, Chicago Heights, Cicero, Dolton, Evanston, Harvey, Maywood, Riverdale and Skokie. \n \n And the outcome of the suit could have ramifications for far-flung local and state governments with sanctuary laws on the books. They include New York, Philadelphia, Miami and the state of California. \n \n So it was no surprise that groups like Illinois Coalition for Immigration and Refugee Rights backed the mayor\'s move. ""We are all for defending Chicago\'s policy with respect to immigration,"" said Fred Tsao, the group\'s senior policy counsel. He also said ""the law is on the side of the city."" \n \n Yet Tsao\'s group is part of a broader coalition that for months has been pushing Emanuel to remove four exemptions from the city\'s Welcoming City Ordinance, which sets its status as a sanctuary city. \n \n That ordinance bars police from providing federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials access to people in local custody. It also prohibits allowing ICE agents to use police facilities for interviews or investigations, and bars on-duty officers from responding to ICE questions or talking to ICE officials prior to a person\'s release from custody. \n \n But it does allow police to provide ICE officials access to immigrants suspected of entering the country illegally who are wanted on a criminal warrant, face criminal charges, have serious criminal convictions or are listed on Chicago gang databases. \n \n The American Civil Liberties Union maintains those exemptions, which could result in holding in custody someone not guilty of a recent crime, ""expose the city to liability for violations of the 4th Amendment,"" according to a letter the ACLU sent to the mayor and aldermen last month. \n \n Ald. Carlos Ramirez-Rosa, 35th, has been pushing to get Chicago to join other cities that have eliminated similar exemptions, but the Emanuel administration so far has rebuffed his efforts, as recently as Friday by canceling a meeting on the issue. \n \n ""It\'s quite funny and hypocritical that at the same time as (Emanuel is) putting forward this lawsuit saying that we want to defend the Constitution, here the ACLU has said that our own sanctuary city policy is in violation of the supreme law of the land,"" said Ramirez-Rosa, who also stressed that he supports the lawsuit. \n \n Ramirez-Rosa\'s view runs counter to the image Emanuel has tried to portray on the issue in mostly Democratic Chicago, which has a significant Latino population that\'s become increasingly politically active.', 'Attorney General Jeff Sessions\' combative statement, which accused Chicago officials of adopting ""an official policy of protecting criminal aliens,"" is likely to be well received by President Donald Trump. | Andrew Harnik/AP Sessions blasts Rahm Emanuel over sanctuary suit \n \n Attorney General Jeff Sessions lashed out at Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel on Monday, delivering an unusually caustic reaction to a new lawsuit challenging the Trump administration\'s plans to crack down on so-called sanctuary cities. \n \n Emanuel announced the filing of the suit earlier in the day, complaining about a new Justice Department policy attempting to cut off grants to police departments that decline to cooperate with federal immigration officials. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n Sessions\' barbed reply argued that record numbers of murders in Chicago in recent years were attributable at least in part to Emanuel\'s decision to stick with a sanctuary policy that encourages police to ignore the immigration status of those they encounter. \n \n ""No amount of federal taxpayer dollars will help a city that refuses to help its own residents,"" Sessions said. ""To a degree perhaps unsurpassed by any other jurisdiction, the political leadership of Chicago has chosen deliberately and intentionally to adopt a policy that obstructs this country’s lawful immigration system."" \n \n The attorney general\'s combative statement, which accused Chicago officials of adopting ""an official policy of protecting criminal aliens,"" is likely to be well received by President Donald Trump. He has regularly blasted Chicago over crime, accusing it of being too lax in its response to the surge in violence there. \n \n Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson pushed back against the attorney general\'s portrayal. \n \n ""Undocumented immigrants are not driving violence in Chicago, and that\'s why I want our officers focused on community policing and not trying to be the immigration police,"" he said. \n \n He also said that ""the federal government\'s plans will hamper community policing and public safety."" \n \n Sessions\' statement comes amid what appears to be his concerted effort to curry favor with Trump after the president made a series of comments last month expressing dissatisfaction with Sessions and said he regretted picking him as attorney general. \n \n The most reliable politics newsletter.

""The city’s leaders cannot follow some laws and ignore others and reasonably expect this horrific situation to improve."" \n \n “This administration will not simply give away grant dollars to city governments that proudly violate the rule of law and protect criminal aliens at the expense of public safety,"" Sessions added. ""So it’s this simple: Comply with the law or forgo taxpayer dollars."" \n \n However, the new lawsuit argues it\'s the Justice Department that isn\'t complying with the law. No law obliges local governments to actively assist immigration officers or to notify them when illegal immigrants are released from jail. \n \n The Trump administration is trying to add such requirements to certain law-enforcement grants issued in the future, but Chicago\'s suit contends that Justice Department officials lack the authority to add anti-sanctuary-city requirements beyond a single provision barring grant recipients from policies that punish officers for contacting federal officials about a suspected undocumented immigrant. \n \n Other cities are considering similar lawsuits. Indeed, localities in California and Massachusetts have filed legal challenges to an early Trump executive order that many saw as threatening a broad crackdown on sanctuary cities. Emanuel and many law enforcement leaders argue that the policies benefit public safety by encouraging undocumented immigrants to cooperate and communicate with police. \n \n “Chicago is a welcoming city and always will be, and we will not be blackmailed by President Trump\'s Justice Department,"" Emanuel said as he announced the suit. ""Forcing us to choose between our values and our police department’s philosophy of community policing is a false choice, and it is a choice that would ultimately undermine our public safety agenda.""', ""After Rahm sues feds, A.G.

Danny Davis (right) announces a federal lawsuit challenging the Justice Department's threats to withhold federal funding from sanctuary cities and states. | Nader Issa/Sun-Times \n \n Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Monday blasted the “political leadership of Chicago” and “the culture of lawlessness that has beset the city” just hours after Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s administration sued Sessions to bar him from cutting federal crimefighting funds to sanctuary cities. \n \n Rather than take a hands-off approach to the now-pending litigation, Sessions stepped up attacks on Chicago, the city that has been repeatedly bashed by President Donald Trump because of its ongoing problems with controlling crime. \n \n “To a degree perhaps unsurpassed by any other jurisdiction, the political leadership of Chicago has chosen deliberately and intentionally to adopt a policy that obstructs this country’s lawful immigration system,” Sessions said in a prepared statement. “They have demonstrated an open hostility to enforcing laws designed to protect law enforcement — federal, state, and local — and reduce crime, and instead have adopted an official policy of protecting criminal aliens who prey on their own residents. \n \n “This is astounding given the unprecedented violent crime surge in Chicago, with the number of murders in 2016 surpassing both New York and Los Angeles combined. The city’s leaders cannot follow some laws and ignore others and reasonably expect this horrific situation to improve. \n \n “The mayor complains that the federal government’s focus on enforcing the law would require a ‘reordering of law enforcement practice in Chicago.’ But that’s just what Chicago needs: a recommitment to the rule of law and to policies that roll back the culture of lawlessness that has beset the city.” \n \n Though the Trump administration has attempted to link sanctuary-city status to the city’s crime problem, the Chicago Sun-Times has reported that illegal immigrants have played no role in the overwhelming majority of the murders that have put the city in the national spotlight. \n \n “I have been a police officer for more than 30 years, and the federal government’s plans will hamper community policing and public safety,” Chicago Police Supt. Eddie Johnson said in response to Sessions. “Undocumented immigrants are not driving violence in Chicago, and that’s why I want our officers focused on community policing and not trying to be the immigration police.” \n \n With the filing of the lawsuit against Sessions, Chicago becomes the fourth city to wage a legal battle against the Trump administration bid to cut the crimefighting grants to sanctuary local governments. \n \n Other lawsuits to block the Justice Department from punishing cities shielding illegal immigrants from federal immigration agents have been filed in federal courts in Seattle, and in California: Santa Clara and San Francisco. \n \n And while each has its own unique facts and circumstances, Chicago’s legal team is tapped in to the loose network of lawyers that has formed for many of these sanctuary cities. \n \n “We are in regular contact with lawyers in cities and counties around the country related to these issues,” city Corporation Counsel Ed Siskel said – including from New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, New Orleans and Philadelphia. \n \n Chicago’s 46-page complaint asks U.S. District Judge Harry Leinenweber — assigned to the case Monday — to stop the Justice Department from enforcing new conditions it has attached to the grant funds. \n \n The city appears to be making a solid legal case, according to two experts from the University of Chicago Law School: Professor Aziz Huq and Assistant Professor Daniel Hemel. Both pointed out that, according to the city’s lawsuit, Congress did not give the Justice Department the power to create new conditions when it created the grant program. \n \n The Justice Department in recent days detailed the new rule and conditions sanctuary jurisdictions must follow. The first condition would require the city to give the feds, when they ask for it, a 48-hour heads up of the scheduled release date and time “of an alien in the jurisdiction’s custody.” \n \n The second would require the city to give the feds access to “any correctional or detention facility in order to meet with an alien . . . and inquire as to his or her right to be or remain in the United States.” However, the city points out in its lawsuit that Chicago does not have a jail — only 18 temporary police “lockup” facilities. \n \n The city claims the Justice Department is also asking it to again certify its compliance with a federal law barring local governments from not sharing immigration status information with the feds. It is asking to the city to do so “under the cloud of confusion” created by the new grant conditions, the city is alleging.""]",3,"– The war of words between Chicago and the federal government over ""sanctuary cities"" policy is heating up. Attorney General Jeff Sessions slammed the city's leaders Monday over their lawsuit against the Trump administration, saying they ""have demonstrated an open hostility to enforcing laws designed to protect law enforcement"" and ""instead have adopted an official policy of protecting criminal aliens who prey on their own residents,"" despite a surge in violent crime, Politico reports. Sessions said Mayor Rahm Emanuel has complained that the federal government is demanding a ""reordering of law enforcement practice""—but that is what is needed to combat ""the culture of lawlessness that has beset the city."" ""It's this simple: Comply with the law or forgo taxpayer dollars,"" Sessions said. Chicago is suing over plans to withhold police grant funding from cities that fail to meet federal conditions, including granting immigration officials unlimited access to police stations, the Chicago Tribune reports. Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said Monday that the federal government's plans will damage public safety and community policing. ""Undocumented immigrants are not driving violence in Chicago, and that’s why I want our officers focused on community policing and not trying to be the immigration police,"" he said, per the Chicago Sun-Times."
154,"[""“Everyone is affected,” said Iqbal Jamil, a heat-flustered resident of Landhi, a neighborhood in Karachi. \n \n The crisis is the product of multiple factors, from decrepit power plants to crumbling transmission lines to decades-old policy mistakes. One reason, however, stands above the others: most Pakistanis will not pay their bills. \n \n The system is paralyzed by $5 billion in “circular debt” — basically, a long chain of unpaid bills that cuts across society, from government departments to wealthy politicians to slum dwellers. At its worst, this leaves power providers with no funds to pay for fuel, so their plants slow or shut down entirely. \n \n As a political issue, electricity has galvanized the Pakistani public — more so, even, than Islamist militancy. Mr. Sharif swept to victory in the May 11 election in part on the appeal of slogans promising to deliver a “shining Pakistan” and to “end the darkness.” \n \n Analysts say the question is whether Mr. Sharif has the political backbone to make the tough decisions needed to change the system, particularly as some of his own supporters, along with other rich and powerful Pakistanis, are among the bill defaulters who need to start paying their fair share. \n \n “This is not like finding a cure for cancer — people know what needs to be done,” said Robert M. Hathaway, director of the Asia program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center in Washington, D.C., who has written a book on Pakistan’s electricity crisis. “The problem is implementation, and finding the political will.” \n \n Photo \n \n The crisis has hit hardest in Mr. Sharif’s home province, Punjab. In Kharian, a Punjabi town along the historic Grand Trunk Road, Malik Mazhar Iqbal Awan, a businessman, fanned himself with a newspaper as beads of sweat rolled down his forehead. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Mr. Awan owns a small marble factory. In the yard outside, a handful of workers sat quietly beside a cutting machine, waiting for the power to return. Just four years ago, Mr. Awan said, he employed 25 people. Now he has just six. \n \n “I can’t pay their salaries,” he said, wiping away dust that had blown in through an open window. “How can I if we can only work a few hours every day?” \n \n Mr. Awan said he had voted for Mr. Sharif, a former steel baron, because he was “110 percent sure” the candidate could turn the electricity situation around. “He’s an industrialist,” he said. “He thinks differently than the others.” \n \n Although easing the $5 billion “circular debt” is the principal problem, experts say money is only part of the solution. Deep-rooted structural issues, exacerbated by political interference and systemic graft, lie at the heart of Pakistan’s power crisis. \n \n Electricity theft, by rich and poor, is common. Slum dwellers steal power through illegal connections; powerful politicians and government departments simply refuse to pay their bills. Electricity officials and the police, fearing retribution, dare not cut them off. \n \n Corruption is notorious in the private power sector, where political supporters win lucrative contracts, often at inflated costs or without even producing a megawatt of power. In 2011 the auditor general noted that the government had committed to $1.7 billion in such contracts, yet added just 62 megawatts to the national power grid. \n \n Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

After he lost his parliamentary seat in a crushing defeat, officials with the national anticorruption body stepped in, summoning Mr. Ashraf last week to answer accusations that he had taken kickbacks worth tens of millions of dollars from foreign companies on power projects. \n \n Even those supposed to be enforcing the law are breaking it. At one police station in Sindh Province, officers erected an illegal power connection for their air-conditioners. In other areas, electricity company officials are afraid to disconnect defaulters for fear of attack. \n \n About 20 percent of the electricity supply disappears across the country, and up to 33 percent in the worst-affected district, as a result of dilapidated transmission lines or outright theft, said Fariel Salahuddin, a power sector consultant. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n “The fastest way to improve things is to start collecting bills and come down hard on theft,” she said. “That’s easier said than done, though.” \n \n Photo \n \n The crisis is exacting an economic toll equivalent to at least 4 percent of the country’s gross domestic product, according to economists — greater than the estimated economic cost of the Taliban insurgency. \n \n At the same time, government policy is a shambles. Decision-making is centered in the notoriously corrupt Energy Ministry; no major new power plant has been built for decades, and the existing ones are falling into disrepair. As a result, Pakistan relies heavily on expensive furnace oil imports. \n \n “There is complete disarray between all entities involved,” said a report on the power crisis that was commissioned by the National Planning Commission last March. \n \n In the short term, Mr. Sharif will seek to salve his power woes by trying to find foreign cash or fuel to get dormant power stations back on line. His officials have suggested that Saudi Arabia, a country that Mr. Sharif enjoys close relations with, could offer up to $15 billion worth of emergency oil supplies on favorable terms. \n \n But oil and money can provide only temporary relief, and Mr. Sharif may also seek other foreign assistance to tackle the structural problems — some in the face of opposition from the United States. \n \n Last week he asked the visiting Chinese premier, Li Keqiang, to provide Pakistan with help in building a civilian nuclear power plant. That was widely seen as an indirect rebuff to the United States, which offered similar help to Pakistan’s rival, India, in 2006 — a source of enduring resentment in Pakistan. \n \n Similarly, President Asif Ali Zardari signed a deal with Iran last year to run a gas pipeline across the border to Pakistan. But the project would run afoul of United Nations sanctions on Iran — penalties that were championed by Washington. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n The United States, for its part, has spent $225 million since 2009 in refurbishing Pakistan’s decrepit hydroelectric power plants, adding 900 megawatts to the national grid. American officials are also working with the government to improve revenue collection. \n \n But large-scale infrastructure projects, like new hydroelectric dams, take years to come to fruition. And international donors are reluctant to commit further funds without signs of strong reform from Pakistan’s political leadership. \n \n Pakistan’s leaders know they are running out of time. Other countries also face crippling electricity shortages, of course, in parts of the Middle East or sub-Saharan Africa. But none of those nations possess nuclear weapons, or such a rapidly growing population as Pakistan, estimated at 180 million people. \n \n Population growth alone is adding 1,000 megawatts per year to the country’s electricity needs, said Mr. Hathaway of the Wilson Center. \n \n “We Americans also like to defer tough decisions,” he said, referring to contentious and expensive reforms in education and social welfare. “But Pakistanis are approaching a point where they no longer have that luxury.”"", 'Collection of photos that made the news or caught our eye this week. \n \n A technician is silhouetted as he works on power lines supplying electricity in the outskirts of Lahore January 31, 2012. \n \n ISLAMABAD | \n \n ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan has told civil servants not to wear socks as the country turns off air-conditioners amid a chronic power crisis and soaring temperatures. \n \n The government has turned off all air-conditioning in its offices as the country endures blackouts of up to 20 hours a day in some places. \n \n ""There shall be no more use of air-conditioners in public offices till such time that substantial improvement in the energy situation takes place,"" a cabinet directive said. \n \n As part of a new dress code, moccasins or sandals must be worn without socks. \n \n The power shortages have sparked violent protests and crippled key industries, costing hundreds of thousands of jobs in a country already beset by high unemployment, a failing economy, widespread poverty and a Taliban insurgency. \n \n The ""load-shedding"" means many families cannot pump water, let alone run air-conditioners, with a disastrous knock-on effect on health and domestic life. \n \n Frustration over the power cuts contributed to the former ruling party\'s poor showing in a May 11 general election. \n \n Two ministers in charge of water and power explained what can be done to end power cuts in parts of the country enduring temperatures of 40 degrees Celsius and above - absolutely nothing, it seems, except raise prices. \n \n Ministers Musadiq Malik and Sohail Wajahat Siddiqui ""expressed their inability to overcome the crisis"", the Daily Times quoted them as telling a news conference in Lahore, where the temperature was 40 C on Monday. \n \n ""They have termed financial constraints as a major, and incompetence as a minor, hurdle in resolving the issue,"" the newspaper said. \n \n ""Presenting the realistic picture, the ministers announced that they were going to increase the price of electricity and gas for all sectors."" \n \n They gave no details but said the problem would get worse before it gets better. \n \n About two-thirds of Pakistan\'s energy is generated by oil and gas and there are widespread gas shortages, with cars run by CNG, compressed natural gas, queuing up for hours overnight to fill their tanks. \n \n (Reporting by Nick Macfie; Editing by Robert Birsel)', 'Study Puts Puerto Rico Death Toll From Hurricane Maria Near 5,000 \n \n Enlarge this image toggle caption Mario Tama/Getty Images Mario Tama/Getty Images \n \n Updated 12:43 p.m. ET \n \n Perhaps 5,000 people died in Puerto Rico in 2017 for reasons related to September\'s Hurricane Maria, according to a study that dismisses the official death toll of 64 as ""a substantial underestimate."" \n \n A research team led by scientists at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health didn\'t simply attempt to count dead bodies in the wake of the powerful storm. Instead, they surveyed randomly chosen households and asked the occupants about their experiences. \n \n From that approach, they concluded that between Sept. 20 and Dec. 31, 2017, there were 4,645 ""excess deaths"" — that is, deaths that would not have occurred if the island hadn\'t been plunged into a prolonged disaster following the devastating storm. \n \n But the estimate isn\'t as precise as the figure implies.The researchers calculate a statistical term called a 95 percent confidence interval, which encompasses a broad range – from 800 to 8,500 deaths. Their figure of 4,645 lies near the middle of that range, and they round up to something over 5,000 to account for some assumptions they made. \n \n The findings were published Tuesday by The New England Journal of Medicine. \n \n The research team randomly selected 3,299 households in Puerto Rico. Local scientists surveyed them over the course of three weeks in January. People in those homes reported a total of 38 deaths. The scientists then extrapolated that finding to the island\'s total population of 3.4 million people to estimate the number of deaths. The researchers then subtracted deaths recorded during that same period in 2016 and concluded that the mortality rate in Puerto Rico had jumped 62 percent in the three months following the storm. \n \n The death rate is a contentious subject, in part because federal and island governments haven\'t responded as rapidly to the disaster as they have in other hurricane emergencies. The study notes that 83 percent of the households in Puerto Rico were without electrical power for the time period looked at, more than 100 days, from the date of the hurricane until the end of 2017. \n \n Puerto Rico residents and outside observers have long argued that the official death toll is hopelessly inadequate. It captures the number of deaths the medical examiner attributed directly to the storm — the high water and howling winds in the worst natural disaster on record for the U.S. territory. Maria came ashore as a Category 4 hurricane, with winds gusting at over 110 mph and drenching rainfall. \n \n CNN surveyed funeral homes after the storm and tallied 499 hurricane-related deaths. The New York Times compared official death records from September and October 2017 and identified more than 1,000 excess deaths, compared with the average for 2015 and 2016. Alexis Santos, a researcher at Penn State University, and a colleague, used death certificates to come up with a similar estimate. \n \n The government of Puerto Rico commissioned researchers from George Washington University\'s Milken Institute School of Public Health to estimate excess deaths. Results of that study have been delayed and are due out this summer. ""We have always expected the number to be higher than what was previously reported,"" said Carlos Mercader, executive director of the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration. He says that\'s why it commissioned the study from GW. ""Both studies will help us better prepare for future natural disasters and prevent lives from being lost."" \n \n Caroline Buckee, a lead author of the news and epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, says, ""Our approach is complementary to that and it provides a different kind of estimate and a different kind of insight into the impact of the hurricane."" The researchers suggested that the government in Puerto Rico could use its methods in an even larger survey to reduce the large uncertainties in their findings. \n \n The Harvard study covers a greater time period than The New York Times\' calculation, a difference that could partly account for the much higher figure. \n \n The household survey is a widely accepted technique for estimating casualties following a disaster. But it can be misleading if the sample isn\'t truly random or if some households have been wiped out altogether and are therefore missing from the survey. In the latter, the result would underestimate the true toll. In fact, the Harvard team says its results are ""likely to be an underestimate"" because of this bias. \n \n National Communication Issues In Puerto Rico Make It Hard To Register Deaths Communication Issues In Puerto Rico Make It Hard To Register Deaths Listen · 4:04 4:04 \n \n The survey looked at deaths through the end of 2017, but the scientists suspect that the excess deaths continued into this year. ""We saw consistent, high rates, in September, October, November, December,"" says Rafael Irizarry, a biostatistician on the research team. ""There\'s no reason to think that on Jan. 1 this trend stops."" \n \n ""Hurricane Maria caused massive infrastructural damage to Puerto Rico,"" the Harvard team writes in its study. \n \n ""In our survey, interruption of medical care was the primary cause of sustained high mortality rates in the months following the hurricane,"" the wrote. Hospitals and doctors struggled to provide care, and many people simply had trouble getting to the doctor or the hospital to seek medical care. The survey finds that one-third of the total deaths in the months following the storm were caused by delayed or interrupted health care. \n \n Understanding the true number is important for many reasons. ""There are ramifications not only for families, not only for closure, but also financial ramifications"" such as for aid and preparedness, says Dr. Satchit Balsari, one of the lead investigators, who is a physician at the Harvard FXB Center for Health and Human Rights.']",3,"– Just how bad are Pakistan's power grid problems? This bad: The government has ordered civil servants to stop wearing socks, reports Reuters. The weird order goes hand in hand with another edict that forbids government offices from turning on their air-conditioners. That makes things so unbearably hot that the workers are barred from wearing shoes and socks lest they be tempted to reach for the AC. Instead, bare feet in sandals or moccasins are required. If it sounds like desperation, that's because it is. Even in major cities, electricity goes down for 10 hours a day, reports the New York Times, and it's not hard to imagine all the disastrous ways that ripples through society—at hospitals, morgues, factories that can't run their equipment, etc. All kinds of factors are at play, but the Times zeroes in on a surprisingly simple one: ""Most Pakistanis will not pay their bills."" That includes everyone from rich politicians to police departments to slum dwellers. Incoming Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif promised during his campaign to reform the system, but whether he has the political ability to do so remains an open question."
155,"[""North Korean soldiers keep a watch toward the south as it rains during a ceremony marking the 63rd anniversary of the signing of the Korean War cease-fire armistice agreement at the truce village of Panmunjom,... (Associated Press) \n \n SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korean police found about 200 lapel pins bearing the image of late North Korean dictator Kim Jong Il strewn near the country's main international airport on Thursday, police officers said. \n \n Police were analyzing security cameras to find how the 196 lapel pins ended up in a flowerbed of a hotel close to Incheon International Airport, just west of Seoul, according to a local police officer who requested anonymity because he wasn't authorized to speak to the media on the matter. \n \n He gave no further details, but South Korean media said police were looking at a possibility that the lapel pins may have been carried by propaganda balloons that North Korea floated across the border. \n \n The possession of such lapel pins would be illegal in South Korea, where praising North Korea is punishable by up to seven years in prison. North Korea, for its part, enforces strict, state-organized public reverence of the Kim family, which has ruled the impoverished yet authoritarian country since its foundation in 1948. \n \n All North Koreans must wear lapel pins carrying the images of both Kim Jong Il and his father Kim Il Sung or the images of either of them. Portraits of the two Kims hang in public buildings and homes, and their birthdays are the two most important holidays in North Korea. \n \n South Korean officials said they haven't received any reports that North Korea has produced a lapel pin for current leader Kim Jong Un, who took power after his father Kim Jong Il's death in late 2011. \n \n A lapel pin with images of both Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il is considered more valuable than other pins because it's the one given to government and military officials and diplomats. Some ordinary citizens buy that pin at unauthorized street markets, according to defectors and activists in Seoul. A Kim Il Sung pin is more used by citizens than a Kim Jong Il pin, they said. \n \n The rival Koreas restarted Cold War-era psychological warfare after the North's fourth nuclear test in January. Seoul began blaring anti-Pyongyang broadcasts and K-Pop songs via border loudspeakers, and Pyongyang responded by its own border broadcasts and launches of balloons carrying anti-South leaflets. \n \n The rivals are divided along the world's most heavily fortified border since their war in the early 1950s ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty."", 'SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea is stepping up its propaganda campaign ahead of annual U.S.-South Korea war games next month, saying the peninsula is “on the verge of war.” \n \n Such rhetoric is common from Pyongyang at times of crisis; the current standoff began with the North’s fourth nuclear test in January and shows no signs of easing. Pyongyang has carried out a series of missile tests in recent months and made repeated threats that it is ready to attack South Korea and U.S. bases in the Pacific while pursuing the capability to hit the American mainland with a nuclear-tipped missile. \n \n South Korea accused Pyongyang of floating propaganda leaflets down the Han River earlier this week. The military discovered dozens of plastic bags, each carrying about 20 leaflets, near the river’s estuary, close to the tense Korean border last Friday, the South’s Defense Ministry said. \n \n Police also have launched an investigation after nearly 200 lapel pins bearing the image of late North Korean leader Kim Jong Il turned up in a flowerbed near Incheon International Airport. Police recovered the coin-sized pins Thursday morning after a hotel employee reported there were North Korean propaganda leaflets in the flowerbed, said an officer who asked to remain anonymous. \n \n Mere possession of the pins, which are mandatory accessories for all adults in North Korea, wouldn’t be considered a crime in the South; however, distribution of propaganda items would violate South Korea’s National Security Law, the officer said. \n \n Kim Jong Il, who ruled North Korea from 1994 until his death in 2011, was the son of the country’s founder, Kim Il Sung, and the father of current leader Kim Jong Un. \n \n The lapel-pin find comes a day after the 63rd anniversary of the signing of an armistice that ended fighting during the Korean War. Gen. Vincent Brooks, commander of U.S. Forces Korea, said during a Wednesday ceremony at the Demilitarized Zone that, without the armistice, many incidents that have happened over the years — such as the August maiming of two South Korean soldiers by a mine reportedly planted by the North just before the annual Ulchi Freedom Guardian exercises — could have reignited war on the peninsula. \n \n “Without the agreement and its buffers, we would almost have certainly seen several of the provocations, the provocative border skirmishes of the past six decades, spread like wildfire into larger battles,” he said. \n \n On Thursday, North Korea’s top diplomat for U.S. affairs, Han Song Ryol, told The Associated Press that Washington “crossed the red line” and effectively declared war by adding Kim to a sanctions list. \n \n Ryol said recent U.S. actions — likely including a decision to station a Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system, known as THAAD, in the southeastern region of Seongju — have put the peninsula on the verge of war, and that a vicious showdown could erupt if the U.S. and South Korea go ahead with annual war games planned for next month. \n \n The leaflets contained threats to launch missile attacks and a repeat of the North’s long-running propaganda, such as claims that it won the 1950-53 Korean War, according to a ministry official quoted by the AP. \n \n The propaganda incidents may be retaliation for South Korean propaganda broadcasts from loudspeakers at the border that resumed after North Korea’s fourth underground nuclear test in January. The North has been broadcasting its own propaganda across the DMZ and launching anti-South leaflets over the border via balloons, the AP reported. \n \n chang.kyong@stripes.com', 'Trey Gowdy had urged Devin Nunes (above) to share a classified memo that alleges misconduct by senior officials at the FBI with both Chris Wray and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. | Mark Wilson/Getty Images House panel votes to release secret memo Earlier, Trey Gowdy lobbied Devin Nunes to share the controversial memo with the FBI director. \n \n Republicans on the House intelligence committee voted Monday in favor of releasing a classified memo that alleges misconduct by senior FBI officials involved in the Russia probe, despite objections from the Department of Justice. \n \n The GOP-led panel voted along party lines to release the secret document — which was written by Republicans — and against making public a competing memo Democrats had crafted, said Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the committee. The group also rejected a proposal to give the Justice Department and FBI more time to vet the Republican document, he said. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n The memo has been a source of escalating partisan tension in Congress. Republicans argue it shows wrongdoing by FBI officials involved in surveillance of a Trump campaign aide, while Democrats say it mischaracterizes intelligence and is an attempt to distract from special counsel Robert Mueller\'s probe into Russia\'s interference in the 2016 election. \n \n In a sign of the House GOP\'s growing suspicions toward the FBI — as well as the influence of Donald Trump\'s allies who wanted the memo made public — the panel voted to publish the document only a day after sharing it with the FBI director, who was appointed by the president. \n \n ""We have crossed a deeply regrettable line on this committee,"" Schiff said. ""We had votes today to politicize the intelligence process, to prohibit the FBI and the Department of Justice from expressing their concerns to our committee and to the House, and to selectively release to the public the majority’s distorted memo."" \n \n House intelligence committee Chairman Devin Nunes showed FBI Director Christopher Wray the memo on Sunday after Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) pressured him to share its contents with the bureau, two people familiar with the meeting said Monday. Gowdy also wanted Nunes to let Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein see the memo too, but he did not join them Sunday. \n \n In their meeting, Nunes told Wray he could flag any factual errors, national security concerns or material that could put FBI sources at risk, according to the people familiar with the meeting. Schiff said Wray told him his concerns with the memo were not alleviated just because he reviewed it. \n \n ""The review did not satisfy, I think, either the bureau or [DOJ\'s] concerns,"" Schiff said. ""The director of the FBI asked for the opportunity to come before the committee and express those concerns."" He said Republicans also formally confirmed on Monday that they are probing conduct by senior officials at the Department of Justice and FBI. \n \n Committee Republicans did agree to share Democrats\' competing memo with the rest of the House, which they called a precursor to potentially releasing it publicly. Rep. Tom Rooney (R-Fla.) told reporters the Democratic memo ""should be"" released after House members have time to review it. \n \n Trump now has five days to either object to the committee\'s request or clear the way for the memo\'s release.

The President strongly favors transparency for the American people and has urged the Executive Branch to cooperate with Congress to the fullest extent appropriate,"" said White House lawyer Ty Cobb in a statement Monday. \n \n Three people who have seen the memo told POLITICO recently that it accuses senior FBI officials of abusing a classified surveillance program, known as FISA, to spy on a Trump campaign foreign policy adviser. Obtaining a warrant under FISA requires the FBI to present an application to a court with evidence that indicates the target is acting on behalf of a foreign power. \n \n The GOP has complained that the FBI included in its evidence material culled from a dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele that described illicit connections between Trump and Russia. Steele compiled the dossier in 2016 on behalf of research firm Fusion GPS, which was being paid by Hillary Clinton\'s presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee. \n \n The New York Times reported Monday that the memo also reveals that deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein approved an application to extend the surveillance of former Trump campaign aide Carter Page in early 2017. \n \n Though Gowdy, a former federal prosecutor, helped craft the memo and has championed its public release, he said on ""Fox News Sunday"" that he believed the FBI should see the memo before it comes out. He also said it shouldn\'t be used to interfere with Mueller\'s probe. \n \n ""I told my Republican colleagues, ‘Leave him the hell alone,’ and that’s still my advice,” Gowdy said. \n \n Rep. Will Hurd (R-Texas), a member of the House intelligence committee and a former CIA officer, said he was not concerned about a Justice Department warning that releasing the memo without DOJ review could jeopardize national security.

Egyptian officials, who in the past have served as mediators between Israel and Gaza, were unavailable for comment. \n \n A Reuters correspondent heard two explosions in northern Gaza on Monday morning which sounded like rocket impacts. An Israeli military spokeswoman said there had been no launches across the border. Israeli media said the blasts appeared to have resulted from Palestinian militants testing their weapons. \n \n At times of heightened tension Israel steps up aerial patrols of Gaza with combat helicopters and drones designed to spot Palestinian rocket crews and hit them with guided missiles before they can carry out launches. \n \n Security sources said Israel had deployed an Iron Dome rocket interceptor near Sycamore Farm, which has been hit by Gaza-launched rockets in the past. \n \n The rockets are often inaccurate and carry small warheads, causing relatively little damage. When fired in salvoes they spread panic and paralyse routine life in south Israel. \n \n How to handle Gaza is among the sticking points in Israel\'s US-sponsored peace negotiations with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, Hamas\'s rival based in the occupied West Bank. \n \n During his brief visit to Israel, Biden will discuss the so far fruitless diplomatic efforts with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Shimon Peres, U.S. officials said. \n \n The vice president will also seek to ease Netanyahu\'s concerns about world powers\' interim nuclear deal with Israel\'s arch-foe Iran, which takes effect on 20 January. \n \n Biden is seen by Israel and its US supporters as one of its best friends in Washington in a career dating back to his decades on Capitol Hill, where he chaired the Senate Foreign Relations Committee before assuming the vice presidency. \n \n Israel\'s Army Radio said there had been no intelligence indications that Palestinians were planning to shell Sharon\'s funeral. Yet authorities braced for any surprise. \n \n ""We are taking the full range of possible scenarios into account,"" southern police commander Yoram Halevy told the station. ""The IDF (Israel Defence Forces) is prepared, informed and ready to respond if so required."" \n \n Since a 2012 eight-day war with Israel, which killed some 170 Palestinians and six Israelis, Hamas has largely held fire but smaller militant groups have occasionally challenged its authority with their own rocket attacks into the Jewish state.']",4,"– North Korea has apparently kicked off a new propaganda war ahead of planned war games between the US and South Korea next month. South Korea says its military found hundreds of propaganda leaflets floating down a river near the border last week, boasting that the North won the Korean War and threatening missile attacks, reports the AP. Some 200 flag-shaped lapel pins featuring a photo of Kim Jong Il were also discovered in a hotel flowerbed near Incheon International Airport on Thursday, reports Stars and Stripes. These are no ordinary pins: As Atlas Obscura explains, they're a patriotic symbol distributed by North Korea's Workers' Party to be worn by all adults on the left side of the chest. Some say Kim Jong Un's wife disappeared after failing to wear one in public. Other versions feature Kim Il Sung, and a rare few show both former leaders. These are only given to high-ranking government officials and military leaders, though ordinary citizens can get a knock-off version from China on the black market. North Koreans were even using the pins in place of cash before the Workers' Party made it illegal. Police are investigating how the pins got into the flowerbed as possession of such items is illegal in South Korea, but say they may have arrived via a propaganda balloon. Meanwhile, Pyongyang accuses the South of releasing snakes across the border ""as part of a 'cunning scheme' to challenge our unity,"" reports the Guardian. A diplomat also promises action if the war games go ahead as planned, noting the US ""crossed the red line"" when putting Kim on a sanctions list."

Bob Corker, R-Tenn., to reach a solution. However, Dodd said that time was running out to pass a bill in 2010. \n \n ""There isn\'t a lot of time left to complete bank reform this year,"" Dodd said to reporters at a news conference. ""The real problem I\'m facing is that clock."" \n \n At a separate news conference, a visibly disappointed Corker said that he and Dodd, along with other members of the committee, were extremely close to completing a bipartisan bill, coming to agreements on dozens of controversial areas such as how much power to award a new regulator for consumer protection of mortgage and credit card products. \n \n Corker said the lawmakers had been ""on the five-yard line"" when it came to completing the reform, but that Dodd told him he was under pressure by the White House to wrap up efforts to complete bank reform quickly in the committee so that Congress can take steps it needs to pass health care legislation, also languishing on Capitol Hill. \n \n ""There is no question that White House politics and health care have kept us from getting to the goal line,"" Corker said to reporters. ""The fact of the matter is, he is a victim of health care policy. We\'re still almost there but it looks like we\'re not going to get there."" \n \n Dodd plans to have the 22 senators on the committee vote on the bill during the week of March 22, after which it could be quickly considered on the Senate floor some time in the Spring. \n \n Not enough time? \n \n In his news conference, Corker also criticized Dodd\'s plan to have the banking committee begin and complete its review of the bank bill in one week. \n \n ""This is a very important bill and I cannot imagine a committee member, Republican or Democrat, passing a bill with this kind of substance in it in a week,"" Corker said. ""I think that would be a travesty. If senators can pass a bill of this substance in a week, which has so much in it, then the states that elect them might as well send robots to Washington."" \n \n In response, Dodd said that he needs to set time-posts, otherwise nothing would get done. He acknowledged, however that his timeline of having members of the committee vote on the bill in a week, could slip. ""It is more important to get this right than getting it done but I emphasize again, I don\'t have a lot of time left in this Congress."" \n \n However, Corker said Dodd, Republicans and Democrats had agreed to a number of areas, including a new structure for a consumer protection division, new heightened liability for credit raters and additional oversight for payday lenders and other lenders. \n \n Dodd and other Democrats have sought to create a powerful consumer financial protection agency that could write rules for mortgages and credit cards. However, Republicans have sought to have a bank regulator have veto power over any rules the new consumer advocate would write. \n \n Corker said Dodd and he had come to an agreement to allow a group of five agencies, the Treasury, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., Fed, Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission, have veto power over consumer rules the division would write if a majority of the agencies agreed it was a problematic rule. \n \n Both sides also agreed to let bank regulators enforce the rules put in place by the consumer unit. \n \n ""We have come to a very good balance,"" Corker said. \n \n However, Dodd declined to comment about whether it was that structure he would ultimately agree to. Dodd also denied reports assertions that he might try to split the bill into two pieces and first move forward on portions he could find broad consensus on. \n \n ""To do this in pieces would be impossible in the Senate,"" Dodd said. \n \n Disagreements still abound \n \n Republicans and Democrats on the committee disagree on a number of other areas. \n \n Case in point: Dodd and other Democrats have installed a series of shareholder empowering provisions in the bank reform bill that Corker and others are opposed to. \n \n ""That\'s a line in the sand,"" Corker said. \n \n The bill is expected to include provisions that would make it easier for investors to nominate a minority slate of directors onto corporate boards using corporate proxy cards, which are papers filed to investors. Another provision gives investors a non-binding vote on pay packages given to executives, while they are heading the corporations, and the golden parachutes they receive when they leave firms. \n \n Republicans are trying to remove all of these measures, arguing they empower labor unions and environmentalist investor groups in behind-the-scenes conversations at the expense of shareholder value. \n \n ""Proxy access was going to be an issue,"" Corker said. ""We agreed to look at some governance issues however this shareholder provision concerns us greatly because it involves giving activist investor groups too much power."" \n \n Corker also said Sens. Jack Reed, D-R.I., and Judd Gregg, R-N.H., had been still working on crafting bipartisan derivatives legislation before Dodd decided to bring the bill to a vote. The two sides were working on how much of an exemption to give end users of derivatives, such as manufacturers, from transparency and trading requirements. The bill requires that most derivatives transactions go through transparent clearinghouses, which are intermediaries between buyers and sellers.', 'A Democratic wave would be especially awkward for President Donald Trump, who boasts that his record in office is unmatched by any of his modern predecessors. | Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images White House Trump distances himself from a potential GOP thumping In public the president says the 2018 election is about him. In private, he talks about pointing the finger after likely Democratic gains. \n \n At his rallies, President Donald Trump argues that the midterm elections are about one person — Donald Trump. “Get out in 2018,” Trump told a crowd in Missouri last month, “because you’re voting for me!” \n \n Privately, the president says the exact opposite. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n According to two people familiar with the conversations, Trump is distancing himself from a potential Republican thumping on Election Day. He’s telling confidants that he doesn’t see the midterms as a referendum on himself, describing his 2020 reelection bid as “the real election.” And he says that he holds House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell responsible for protecting their majorities in Congress. \n \n According to one person with knowledge of these talks, Trump has said of Ryan and McConnell: “These are their elections … and if they screw it up, it’s not my fault.” \n \n Other sources said Trump is sure to lash out at perhaps his favorite bogeyman of all — the media — for allegedly opposing him. \n \n Morning Score newsletter Your guide to the permanent campaign — weekday mornings, in your inbox.

You can unsubscribe at any time. \n \n It’s not all pre-emptive finger-pointing: Trump expresses greater confidence than most pundits about his party’s chances of maintaining its House majority and expanding its control of the Senate. And he credits McConnell for motivating GOP voters by holding the line on Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court confirmation. \n \n But in the event of an electoral blowout, Trump is poised to shift the blame a mile down Pennsylvania Avenue. \n \n “Look for the White House to say something like, ‘Paul Ryan chose to be a lame-duck speaker instead of leaving, which cost Congress the chance to do several things before November,’” said an aide to one GOP member who speaks with the president often. \n \n A Democratic wave would be especially awkward for a president whose brand is success, and who boasts that his record in office is unmatched by any of his modern predecessors. \n \n Already, hints of a distancing strategy have started to creep into Trump’s public comments, even as he continues to crow at rallies that the midterms are a “referendum” on his first two years in office. Trump told The Associated Press recently that some of his supporters have said to him, “I will never ever go and vote in the midterms because you’re not running.” \n \n Inside the White House, aides are resigned to the fact that Trump — as he has often done — will follow his gut on how to message any Democratic takeover of the House on Nov. 6. Those around Trump are anticipating lots of unfiltered, early-morning tweets casting blame on everyone but the president. \n \n “It would be a lot of shooting from the hip in early morning Twitter,” said a well-placed Republican source, who added that the White House seems to lack clear plans for post-election messaging. \n \n The themes are already predictable. \n \n “The arc is gonna be he wasn’t on the ballot, and people didn’t fully appreciate his policies and [candidates] didn’t tie themselves enough to him,” said a person close to the president, who was among several sources to say Trump will likely blame the media as well. \n \n While lashing out would be a Trumpian response, it would also be a break from recent presidential precedent. After losing the Congress to Democrats midway through his second term in 2006, a humbled George W. Bush conceded that he’d taken a “thumpin’,” pushed out an unpopular Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and vowed to find “common ground” with Democrats. \n \n Four years later, after a tea party wave swamped congressional Democrats two years into his first term, with Republicans picking up 63 House seats for the biggest midterm gain by either party since 1938, Barack Obama took “direct responsibility” in remarks afterward. Calling the moment “humbling,” Obama vowed to “do a better job.” \n \n Although White House officials are aware of those precedents, Trump may not care about them. And he alone will decide how to spin the midterm results, with his aides following his lead. The White House declined to comment on the record for this story. \n \n “Despite whatever [way] they may want to spin it … he’s going to drive the train on this and the White House is gonna fall and say the president did everything he could, but unfortunately he’s not on the ballot and so people weren’t as excited,” said the person close to Trump. \n \n Before he was president, Trump had a philosophy on whether leaders should accept blame: “Whatever happens, you’re responsible. If it doesn’t happen you’re responsible.” \n \n But once in office, Trump, backed up by his communications team, has shifted blame for setbacks to others — especially Congress. \n \n After efforts to repeal Obama’s health care law stalled in Congress last July, the president blamed “a few Republicans” for holding up the process, despite creating considerable confusion on Capitol Hill with his own mixed signals on health care reform. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders echoed Trump’s line, saying it would be “absolutely ridiculous for Congress to try to place the blame on the president for the inability to get their job done.” \n \n And when Trump’s endorsement of Roy Moore failed to carry the Alabama Senate candidate to victory last December, the president claimed he was pressured into backing the wrong candidate. Those around him reinforced his claim. \n \n “There does need to be a recognition of the lousy political advice @POTUS has been getting and it needs to change,” Tony Fabrizio, a top Republican pollster involved in Trump’s 2016 campaign, wrote on Twitter at the time. \n \n “We’re in a completely different dynamic now where we know President Trump will be perfectly comfortable in a finger-pointing exercise,” said a former senior George W. Bush aide, who claimed his boss, by comparison, “was perfectly fine with owning and taking some of the heat off the Hill leadership” after the 2006 midterms two years before Bush left office. \n \n A former senior Obama administration official, who recalled cringing when the ex-president used the term “shellacking” to describe the results of the 2010 midterms, said the White House “took stock” of the situation afterward and determined Obama could continue chipping away at his agenda through “either executive authority or working at the state and local level.” \n \n “I only cringed because it was so true … We were shellacked,” this person said, adding that Obama nevertheless displayed “a willingness to accept responsibility and not wallow in defeat.” \n \n Should Trump buck that trend by refusing to bear any blame, some Republicans said they would be disappointed — albeit not surprised. \n \n “The president’s rhetoric is what’s actually energized the left, so it would be hard to put it on Congress if we lost the House,” a senior GOP aide told POLITICO. “But it’s just classic behavior on the part of this president to not shoulder the blame if things go bad, and to definitely take responsibility if things go right.” \n \n Still, some of Trump’s most steadfast allies say he would be justified to turn his ire toward congressional Republicans if November becomes a bloodbath for the party in power. They claim he has done “everything possible,” like holding back-to-back-to-back campaign rallies last week, to assist GOP candidates battling for their seats or seeking to upset Democratic incumbents. \n \n “I think [Trump] has done everything that has been asked of him from the Republican Party to … help campaign and raise money wherever they have needed it,” said ex-Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. “President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence has answered that call every time.”']",4,"– Today, being the seventh day, presumably Kim Jong Un is resting. But yesterday, the North Korean despot was busily scaling the snowswept 9,000-foot tallest peak in his kingdom, and state media is reporting everything but that he did it in a single bound, reports the BBC.

(Associated Press) \n \n QUEBEC CITY (AP) — A French Canadian suspect known for his far-right, nationalist views was charged Monday with six counts of first-degree murder and five counts of attempted murder in the shooting rampage at a Quebec City mosque that Canada\'s prime minister called an act of terrorism again Muslims. \n \n Alexandre Bissonnette made a brief court appearance and did not enter a plea in the attack that left six people dead during evening prayers Sunday. Wearing a white prisoner jump suit, his hands and feet shackled, he stared down at the floor and fidgeted, but did not speak. \n \n The 27-year-old suspect, who has espoused support for the French far-right party of Marine Le Pen and had liked U.S. President Donald Trump on his Facebook page, was known to those who monitor extremist groups in Quebec, said François Deschamps, an official with a refugee advocacy group. ""It\'s with pain and anger that we learn the identity of terrorist Alexandre Bissonnette, unfortunately known to many activists in Quebec for taking nationalist, pro-Le Pen and anti-feminist positions at Laval University and on social media,"" Deschamps wrote on the Facebook page of the group, Bienvenues aux Refugiés, or Welcome to Refugees. \n \n An anthropology and political science major at Laval University in Quebec City, Bissonnette had also expressed support on his Facebook profile for ""Génération Nationale,"" a group whose manifesto includes the rejection of ""multiculturalism."" \n \n More than 50 people were at the Quebec Islamic Cultural Centre when the shooting erupted. In addition to the six dead, 19 people were wounded — all men. Of the five victims who remained hospitalized, two were in critical condition, authorities said. The dead ranged in age from 39 to 60. \n \n Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard both characterized the attack as a terrorist act, which came amid heightened tensions worldwide over Trump\'s travel ban on seven Muslim countries. Le Pen, leader of the National Front in France, is known for her anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant positions and has won the endorsement and admiration of white supremacists. \n \n Canada is generally welcoming toward immigrants and all religions, but the French-speaking province of Quebec has had a long-simmering debate about race and religious accommodation. The previous separatist government of the province called for a ban on ostentatious religious symbols, such as the hijab, in public institutions. \n \n Trudeau said in Parliament the victims were targeted simply because of their religion and spoke directly to the more than 1 million Muslims who live in Canada, saying, ""We are with you."" \n \n ""Thirty-six million hearts are breaking with yours,"" Trudeau said. ""Know that we value you."" \n \n The prime minister later attended a vigil outside the mosque. \n \n The suspect was arrested in his car on a bridge near d\'Orleans, where he called 911 to say he wanted to cooperate with police. Authorities, who initially named two suspects, said the other man taken into custody was a witness to the attack and was released earlier Monday. They said they did not believe there were other suspects but were investigating. \n \n Police did not give a motive for the attack. \n \n Trump called Trudeau to express condolences to the Canadian people and to offer any assistance that might be needed. \n \n The White House pointed to the attack as an example of why Trump\'s policies were needed. ""We condemn this attack in the strongest possible terms. It\'s a terrible reminder of why we must remain vigilant and why the president is taking steps to be pro-active, rather than reactive when it comes to our nation\'s safety and security,"" White House spokesman Sean Spicer said. \n \n The victims were businessmen, a university professor and others who had gathered for evening prayers, said Mohamed Labidi, the vice president of the mosque. \n \n ""\'It\'s a very, very big tragedy for us,"" Labidi said tearfully. ""We have a sadness we cannot express."" \n \n He said the victims were shot in the back. ""Security at our mosque was our major, major concern,"" he said. ""But we were caught off guard."" \n \n The shooting took place just before 8 p.m. Sunday. Witnesses described chaos as worshippers scrambled to find friends and loved ones, as police responding to the scene called for backup. \n \n Couillard said he would ""not go there"" when asked if he blamed recent rhetoric in in the U.S. for the attack. \n \n ""Quebec is a good, generally loving society, but we have these devils as other societies have. We have to recognize that and fight them,"" Couillard said at a news conference in Quebec City at which he and Muslim leaders held hands in a display of solidarity. \n \n ""The Muslim community was the target of this murderous attack,"" Couillard said, adding that solidarity rallies would be held across Quebec later Monday. \n \n The mosque has been a target of hate crimes in the past, including last summer when pig\'s head was left on its doorstep during Ramadan, when Muslims fast from dawn to sunset. Practicing Muslims do not eat pork. \n \n Quebec City Mayor Regis Labeaume, appearing shaken, said: ""No person should have to pay with their life, for their race, their color, their sexual orientation or their religious beliefs."" \n \n Worshipper Ali Hamadi said he left the mosque a few minutes before the shooting and a friend, Abdelkrim Hassen, was killed. He said Hassen, who worked in information technology for the government, had three daughters and a wife, whom he had to notify of the death. \n \n Majdi Dridi of the Muslim Association of Canada said he knew two of the victims. One was a work colleague who was a father of three little girls, he said. \n \n ""I don\'t know what to say, I just hope that his family and his children can have the patience to accept what happened,"" Dridi said \n \n Trudeau had earlier reacted to Trump\'s visa ban for people from some Muslim-majority countries by tweeting Saturday: ""To those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength #WelcomeToCanada."" \n \n Trudeau also posted a picture of himself greeting a Syrian child at Toronto\'s airport in late 2015. Trudeau oversaw the arrival of more than 39,000 Syrian refugees soon after he was elected. \n \n The mayor of Gatineau, Quebec, near Canada\'s capital of Ottawa, said there would be an increased police presence at mosques around his city following the attack. The New York Police Department also said it was stepping up patrols at mosques and other houses of worship. \n \n ___ \n \n Gillies reported from Toronto. Associated Press writer Sean Farrell in Montreal contributed to this report.', 'Alexandre Bissonnette, the 27-year-old accused of opening fire on a Quebec City mosque, has been charged with six counts of first-degree murder and five counts of attempted murder while using a restricted firearm. \n \n During a brief court appearance Monday evening, Bissonnette, wearing handcuffs, frequently cast his eyes toward the ground and avoided turning toward the packed gallery. \n \n He will remain in custody until his next court appearance on Feb. 21. \n \n Provincial police are treating the attack as a terrorist act. RCMP spokeswoman Camille Habel said Bissonnette could later face terrorism-related charges, depending on the outcome of the ongoing investigation. \n \n Six men were killed and five people remain in hospital with injuries. \n \n Two of the surviving victims will need more surgery, while the other three are stable and may be discharged soon. Another 13 people with minor injuries have been released, according to a hospital spokeswoman. \n \n \'Introverted young man\' \n \n On Monday afternoon, Laval University confirmed that he is a student, and is now barred from all activities effective immediately until all judicial proceedings are over. \n \n His employer, Héma-Québec, issued a statement saying the organization is ""shocked"" to learn that he was among their employees. Bissonnette was a member of their call centre team. \n \n This screengrab from the suspect\'s Facebook page, taken before it went offline, shows Alexandre Bissonnette as a child wearing his cadet uniform.

He was also a cadet as a child. \n \n Neighbours of Bissonnette\'s parents said he was renting an apartment with his twin brother near the Centre Culturel Islamique de Québec, where the shooting took place Sunday evening. \n \n Neighbour Réjean Bussière said Bissonnette was very introverted. \n \n ""He\'s a very closed-off young man,"" Bussière told CBC\'s French-language network, Radio-Canada. \n \n Only 1 suspected shooter \n \n Another man, Mohamed Belkhadir, was arrested outside the mosque within minutes of the shooting. He was released after police confirmed he was a witness and not involved in the shooting. \n \n He said he had been shovelling snow when he heard gunshots — when they stopped he entered the mosque to call 911. \n \n ""I saw the image of someone with a firearm, I didn\'t know it was police. I thought it was a shooter who\'d returned,"" Belkhadir told Radio-Canada. \n \n The man fled and police arrested him. He was released Monday. \n \n Shortly after noon Monday, provincial police said that man was no longer a suspect, but rather a witness to the attack. \n \n A half-hour after the shooting, Quebec City police Insp. Denis Turcotte said a second man called 911 indicating that he wanted to co-operate in the investigation. \n \n La SQ confirme qu’un seul des individus arrêté hier soir en lien avec l’<a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/attentat?src=hash"">#attentat</a> de <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/Qu%C3%A9bec?src=hash"">#Québec</a> est considéré comme suspect. —@sureteduquebec \n \n Turcotte said the man parked about five kilometres from the scene of the shooting, near the bridge to Île d\'Orléans, and waited for officers to arrest him. \n \n ""He was armed and spoke to us about his acts,\'\' said Turcotte. \n \n \'Pain and anger\' \n \n As Bissonnette\'s name began to circulate online, one Facebook group dedicated to welcoming refugees in the Quebec City area expressed ""pain and anger"" over the news. \n \n The suspect was ""unfortunately known to several activists in Quebec City for his pro-Le Pen and anti-feminist positions at Laval University and on social networks,"" wrote the Bienvenue aux réfugié.es - Ville de Québec Facebook group. \n \n Bissonnette\'s Facebook page seemed to confirm those political leanings. The suspect followed several profiles that espouse right-wing ideologies, including that of Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader of France\'s National Front. \n \n A search was conducted at the home of Bissonnette\'s parents on du Tracel Street in Cap-Rouge, as well as at a residence on des Quatre-Bourgeois Road, closer to the mosque. \n \n A woman who identified herself as a neighbour of Bissonnette\'s parents said the suspect had recently moved into an apartment that he was renting with his twin brother, not far from the mosque where the shooting occurred. \n \n ""He is a child,"" she said. ""You couldn\'t find one more calm than that. He never did anything, he always kept to himself. We never heard of anything."" \n \n ""I saw him last Wednesday; he was arriving at his parents\' home. I think he often went there,"" the neighbour, who wished to remain anonymous, told Radio-Canada. \n \n Another neighbour, Réjean Bussiè\u200bre, described Bissonnette as ""a young man who is extremely withdrawn."" \n \n Bissonnette and his brother were not the kind to bother others, Bussiè\u200bre said, ""but they were not social people."" \n \n On social media, many took issue with the categorization of Bissonnette as an introvert and a lone wolf, arguing that the suspect was spared of the term terrorist because he is white. Bestselling author J.K. Rowling was one of those voices. \n \n Earlier Monday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called the attack a ""despicable act of terror.""', 'QUEBEC CITY/TORONTO (Reuters) - A French-Canadian university student was the sole suspect in a shooting at a Quebec City mosque and was charged with the premeditated murder of six people, Canadian authorities said on Monday, in what Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called “a terrorist attack.” \n \n Court documents identified the gunman in the attack on Sunday evening prayers as Alexandre Bissonnette, 27, and charged him with six murder counts and five counts of attempted murder with a restricted weapon. The slightly-built Bissonnette made a brief appearance in court under tight security wearing a white prison garment and looking downcast. \n \n Prosecutors said all of the evidence was not yet ready and Bissonnette, a student at Université Laval, was set to appear again on Feb. 21. No charge was read in court and Bissonnette did not enter a plea. \n \n “The charges laid correspond to the evidence available,” said Thomas Jacques, a representative of the prosecutor’s office, when asked why Bissonnette was not charged with terrorism-related offences. \n \n Among the six men killed were a butcher, a university professor, a pharmacist and an accountant, according to police and Canadian media. \n \n The government of Guinea said in a statement that two of its citizens were among those killed in the mosque attack. \n \n Police declined to discuss possible motives for the shooting at the Centre Culturel Islamique de Québec. \n \n “They consider this a lone wolf situation,” a Canadian source familiar with the situation said. \n \n In Washington, U.S. government security experts were leaning to the view that the gunman most likely was motivated by hatred for Muslims, a U.S. government source familiar with official reporting said. \n \n Trudeau, who has made a point of welcoming refugees and immigrants from Muslim-majority countries, told parliament in Ottawa: “Make no mistake, this was a terrorist attack.” \n \n “Last night this community experienced something that no community should ever have to know: Unspeakable cruelty and violence perpetrated on those who came together in friendship and in faith,” Trudeau said later at a vigil attended by hundreds who braved frigid temperatures in Quebec City. \n \n He added a personal message to Canada’s 1 million Muslims: \n \n “We stand with you. We love you and we support you and we will always defend and protect your right to gather together and pray today and every day,” Trudeau added. \n \n Alexandre Bissonnette, a suspect in a shooting at a Quebec City mosque, is seen in a Facebook posting. Facebook/Handout via REUTERS \n \n The attack was out of character for Quebec City, a city of just over 500,000 which reported just two murders in all of 2015. Mass shootings are rare in Canada, where gun control laws are stricter than in the United States. \n \n Incidents of Islamophobia have increased in Quebec in recent years. The face-covering, or niqab, became an issue in the 2015 Canadian federal election, especially in Quebec, where the majority of the population supported a ban on it at citizenship ceremonies. \n \n In addition to the six killed, five people were critically injured and 12 were treated for minor injuries, a spokeswoman for the Quebec City University Hospital said. \n \n Federal Safety Minister Ralph Goodale told reporters in Ottawa there was no change to “the national terrorism threat level” from medium because “there is no information known to the government of Canada that would lead to a change at this time.” \n \n U.S. President Donald Trump called Trudeau to express his condolences “and offered to provide any assistance as needed,” said Trudeau spokesman Cameron Ahmad. \n \n Over the weekend, Trudeau said Canada would welcome refugees, his response to an executive order by Trump on Friday to halt the U.S. refugee program and to temporarily bar citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States. \n \n Trump’s action, which the president said was “not about religion - this is about terror and keeping our country safe,” was widely condemned in the United States and abroad as targeting Muslims. \n \n On Monday, White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters that the Quebec shooting was “a terrible reminder of why we must remain vigilant, and why the president is taking steps to be proactive, rather than reactive, when it comes to our nation’s safety and security.” \n \n FATHER OF FOUR KILLED \n \n A father of four, the owner of a halal butcher near the mosque, was among those killed, said Pamela Sakinah El-hayet, a friend of one of the people at the mosque. \n \n The mosque concierge was killed, as was Ahmed Youness, a 21-year-old student, El-hayet told Reuters. One of El-hayet’s friends, Youness’ roommate, was in the mosque at the time of the shooting. He was unharmed, she said, but in total shock. \n \n A man of Moroccan descent who had also been arrested was now considered a witness, although his nationality was not immediately known, a Canadian source familiar with the situation said. \n \n Ali Assafiri, a student at Université Laval, said he had been running late for the evening prayers at the mosque, near the university in the Quebec City area. When he arrived, the mosque had been transformed by police into a crime scene. \n \n Slideshow (16 Images) \n \n “Everyone was in shock,” Assafiri said by phone. “It was chaos.” \n \n Vigils were planned for Montreal and Quebec City, the provincial capital, as well as in Edmonton. There was an outpouring of support for the mosque on social media.']",3,"– Authorities in Canada think Sunday night's mosque shooting that left six people dead is a ""lone wolf situation,"" reports Reuters, and they think they've got their shooter: Alexandre Bissonnette, 27, appeared in court Monday and was charged with six counts of first-degree murder and five counts of attempted murder, reports CBC News. So far, he does not face any terrorism-related charges. Bissonnette attended Laval University, near the Quebec City mosque, and studied political science and anthropology. The AP reports that he was known to espouse ""far-right nationalist views"" online, and the Toronto Globe and Mail reports that this didn't begin until March when nationalist leader Marine Le Pen visited Quebec City. ""I wrote him off as a xenophobe,"" says a fellow Laval student. ""He was enthralled by a borderline racist nationalist movement."" A member of a refugee advocacy group says Bissonnette had become a familiar name to those who monitor extremist groups. He was ""unfortunately known to many activists in Quebec for taking nationalist, pro-Le Pen and anti-feminist positions at Laval University and on social media,"" François Deschamps wrote on the Facebook page of the group Welcome to Refugees, per the Montreal Gazette. Five victims of the shooting remained hospitalized as of Monday evening."

For cold temperatures, it\'s the nation\'s midsection, from Montana east to Wisconsin all the way south to northern Texas. \n \n What\'s the forecast? \n \n It\'s going to be awfully cold in the Plains and High Plains -- as much as 40 degrees below average in some places, according to the National Weather Service. In Helena, Montana, for instance, Wednesday\'s high is forecast to be 3 degrees below zero. That compares with 2 degrees on Tuesday and the average high of 36. \n \n Snowy, icy conditions are expected from eastern Missouri into the Mid-Atlantic states and New England. Up to 2 inches of snow per hour may fall around Boston, with as much as a foot of snow predicted in parts of Massachusetts. \n \n Who\'s being affected? \n \n In New York, where heavy snows are taxing salt reserves, Gov. Andrew Cuomo declared an emergency for the entire state and shut down Interstate 84. \n \n ""New Yorkers in affected regions should stay off the roads, check on their neighbors and loved ones, and stay inside their homes until the worst of the storm has passed,"" he said in a statement. \n \n Transportation regulators waived rest rules for salt-truck drivers to get remaining salt stockpiles moved to where they are needed: New York City and Long Island. \n \n In Pennsylvania, Villanova University announced that it would be closed Thursday and Friday after the school\'s power provider projected an extended outage in the area. \n \n And in Kansas, authorities announced a third weather-related death from the storm: a 58-year-old man died overnight after a traffic accident Tuesday, the Kansas Highway Patrol said. \n \n In Boston, the weather seemed little nuisance. \n \n CNN iReporter Jenifer Schwartz, visiting from California, marveled at how the city handled the storm. \n \n ""My flight home today is one of the many that was canceled, but getting a cab this morning to get to meetings around the city did not prove to be too much of a problem,"" she said. \n \n Relative Boston newcomer and native Southerner Josh Parsons was just trying to process it all. \n \n ""Since this is my first winter in the North, the snow still feels like a novelty to me,"" he told CNN on Wednesday. ""I enjoy seeing it falling and enjoy walking around in it right after the fresh snow. Having said that, I do not like some of the things that come along with the snow."" \n \n Such as? Salt, slush and the simple fact all the snow just won\'t go away. \n \n ""The roads get cleared, the sidewalks get cleared, but then there are just mounds or brown, dirty ice piled up everywhere,"" he said. \n \n Meanwhile, in Michigan, two Delta Air Lines aircraft got stuck in the snow in unrelated incidents at Detroit Metro Airport. \n \n This comes a day after a Southwest Airlines plane hit a snowbank as it was taxiing to a gate in Kansas City, Missouri, according to airline spokeswoman Whitney Eichinger. \n \n Nationwide, airlines had canceled nearly 2,800 flights, according to flight tracking website Flightaware.com. \n \n Most-affected among major airports include New Jersey\'s Newark Liberty International, New York\'s LaGuardia and Boston Logan International. \n \n The Federal Aviation Administration also reported significant delays at airports in Chicago, Philadelphia and Charlotte, North Carolina. \n \n Why all the severe weather this winter? \n \n Boston is about 8 inches ahead of its normal snowfall pace for the year, the National Weather Service said. In New York, the number is 23 inches. \n \n It\'s not unusual or unprecedented, Radley Horton, a climate scientist with Columbia University, told CNN\'s New Day. \n \n ""If we look at winters in the past, we can get this kind of setup with a very wavy jet stream. Colder air spills into one side (while) the other side of the country has extremely warm weather,"" he said. \n \n But climate change -- particularly the way melting Arctic sea ice may be affecting jet stream patterns -- could be increasing the frequency and severity of such wild weather rides, he said. \n \n ""There\'s always going to be variability,"" Horton said. ""There\'s always going to be these waves in the jet stream. But it does seem, according to some research, as we lose that sea ice in the Arctic, one possible surprise could be more cold air spilling south, more warm air going north.""', 'East Coast Weekend Snow May Come in Two Waves \n \n By By Alex Sosnowski, senior meteorologist. February 06, 2014, 5:49:29 AM EST \n \n As the latest winter storm delivers a swath of snow reaching more than 1,500 miles at midweek, another snowstorm is being monitored for this weekend. \n \n The timing of the storm as it travels from the Rockies and Southwest is Saturday to Sunday over the Central states and Sunday to Monday in the East. \n \n The upcoming storm could be the most intense, and correspondingly the most disruptive, of the recent barrage especially as the storm nears and moves along the Atlantic coast. \n \n @erikmwalker tweeted: ""More news is snow news? Some computer models say flurries Sunday night; Others predict doom-filled epic storm"" Additional Relevant Tweets and Social Media Reaction \n \n This is provided the storm does not have competition with another storm nearby. \n \n The snow this weekend could affect major hubs in the East, such as New York City, Philadelphia, Washington and Boston into Monday\'s morning commute. \n \n Many airlines may still be trying to catch up and get back on schedule in the wake of the recent storms. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The Single-Storm Scenario \n \n One scenario suggests the storm may develop into a blizzard as it nears the Atlantic Ocean. As a result, people from Virginia to Maine will need to watch this one carefully. \n \n If the storm develops to its full potential along the mid-Atlantic coast, it may deliver not only snowfall rates of several inches per hour to inland areas of the Northeast, but also strong winds. \n \n RELATED: \n \n AccuWeather.com Winter Weather Center \n \n Latest Watches, Warnings, Advisories \n \n Sneaky Snow Possible in the East Saturday \n \n These winds would cause extensive blowing and drifting snow over the central Appalachians to New England with local whiteout conditions. A period of strong onshore winds would bring coastal flooding and beach erosion over the upper mid-Atlantic to eastern New England. A return flow from the west would bring cold air back in quickly to the coast. \n \n New England and the Maritimes have the best chance of a period of windswept snow Sunday into Monday. \n \n The Two-Storm Scenario \n \n Another scenario would be for the storm to behave more like other storms have done recently with a period of light to moderate snow streaking across part of the Midwest to part of the Northeast. Winds would be significantly less and probably not a factor. Overall, a more manageable snowfall would occur. \n \n Supporting this less intense storm idea on Sunday to Monday is a front-running and weaker storm that will roll across the South on Friday night with rain showers and then could brush the Northeast on Saturday with a swath of snow. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Recall that a similar sneaky storm brought over 6 inches of snow to parts of the Northeast this past Monday. \n \n According to Senior Meteorologist Mark Mancuso, ""With so many storms on the playing field, the atmosphere may not have the energy available to allow the Sunday to Monday storm to become a major event until it has bypassed the United States."" \n \n With this latter scenario, there would be two weaker storms, rather than one very strong system. \n \n Either way, it appears another episode of travel disruptions and concern for daily activities will sweep from the Central states to the East Coast. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n In both scenarios, rain would fall across the Deep South and some snow would sweep across part of the southern Plains during Saturday night and the Tennessee Valley and southern Appalachians on Sunday. A period of snow would also streak eastward across the Midwest cities of St. Louis, Chicago, Detroit, Cincinnati and Cleveland. \n \n However, a stronger storm would imply more thunderstorm activity and a greater risk for severe weather in part of the Southeastern states. \n \n The details on the nature of storm for this weekend will unfold in the coming days. \n \n More Storms Beyond This Weekend \n \n According to Senior Meteorologist Henry Margusity, ""The Sunday to Monday weather event will not mark an end to the stormy pattern. Additional storms are on deck through at least the middle of February."" \n \n Another storm may affect part of the eastern third of the nation with snow and rain around Valentine\'s Day. \n \n Report a Typo', 'More than 500,000 Philadelphia-area homes and businesses are without power this morning, as freezing rain and flooding caused tree limbs to crack, snap or topple over utility poles - also helping to make the morning commute treacherous. By mid-morning, PECO figures already showed that the storm was among the utility\'s worst outage incidents ever. Gov. Tom Corbett said at a noon press conference that utility crews from out of state would be called in to help with the wide-spread outages. He said as Pennsylvania energy companies had received some 750,000 calls so far, but his office had yet to declare a state of emergency. ""We\'re going to continue to monitor the situation,"" Corbett said. ""Our major concern is that it is supposed to go below freezing tonight. It\'s going to refreeze tonight and we want everyone to be careful on the roads."" \n \n Emergency crews in Philadelphia, Montgomery, Bucks, Chester and Delaware counties were busy responding to calls most of the morning, with some hampered by slick roads, downed trees and live lines that had fallen to the ground. Utility crews restored power to some areas as others were going dark. \n \n Bucks County dispatchers said they were too swamped with calls to verify police radio reports of a tree that had fallen into a home in Warminster with possible injuries. \n \n Conditions varied widely with temperatures hovering near freezing -- a few degrees on either side. That appears to have made a difference. Suburbs north and west of Philadelphia faced slick conditions and widespread power outages, while South Jersey, although covered in plenty of ice, was warm enough that roads were mostly wet. \n \n ""Far north, far west, that\'s where you\'re having the biggest problems from the icing,"" Jeffrey Knueppel, a SEPTA deputy general manager, said at a news briefing. \n \n Postman John Woodring wasn\'t deterred by the conditions. Wearing a white pith helmet to keep the melting ice off his wool watch cap, Woodring trudged through what remained of the nearly 11 inches of snow that fell earlier in the week in Cheltenham, Montgomery County. \n \n He carefully avoided paved surfaces, favoring paths where he could hear the comforting crunch of snow underfoot. He was taking precautions to avoid slips, or worse, breaking a leg, he said. \n \n ""I\'ll be taking baby steps, dodging falling branches,"" Woodring said. ""I couldn\'t go fast if I wanted to!"" \n \n Power \n \n PECO\'s online outage map was showing that about 595,000 customers were without power in the Philadelphia area as of around noon.

That was followed by more than 180,000 customers impacted in Montgomery County, 138,000 in Bucks County, 67,000 in Delaware County and 27,000 in Philadelphia. \n \n Outages were fewer in South Jersey. PSE&G was reporting that Burlington County was the hardest hit, with about 8,000 customers there lacking power. \n \n Transportation \n \n Several SEPTA Regional Rail lines halted service this morning: The West Trenton Line is suspended due to a CSX train derailment, the Paoli-Thorndale and Cynwyd lines are suspended due to Amtrak power issues and the Warminster Line is suspended due to signal problems. Passengers should expect delays of up to 40 minutes on Regional Rail trains system-wide. \n \n Some SEPTA bus routes are being detoured. \n \n New Jersey Transit said rail, bus and light rail tickets would be cross-honored system-wide. \n \n Amtrak suspended Keystone Service between Philadelphia and Harrisburg due to numerous weather-related issues. \n \n Reduced speed limits are in place on the New Jersey Turnpike: 35 mph between exit 8 and the George Washington Bridge and 50 mph between exits 3 and 8. \n \n PennDOT imposed speed restrictions on major highways for much of the morning rush, but normal speed limits were restored around 9 a.m. \n \n Downed trees were causing traffic disruptions and lane closures on major roads throughout the morning. \n \n Several dozen flights were canceled or delayed at Philadelphia International Airport, according to FlightAware.com. \n \n As the lingering mounds of snow melt into already saturated ground, flooding was also a possibility in many areas. \n \n Schools \n \n School closures did not appear to be widespread. In those areas hardest hit by the ice some districts did close, such as Cheltenham. Philadelphia schools were already scheduled to be closed for classes with only staff expected to report. \n \n However, the Archdiocese of Philadelphia and many suburban school districts were opening later than usual. For example, Lower Merion Township. and Cherry Hill schools were opening two hours late. The archdiocese schools are operating on a one-hour delay. \n \n Some universities are also closing or operating on delayed schedules. Temple University, for instance, was opening at 10 a.m., and Rutgers campuses will open at noon. Villanova and West Chester universities, as well as the Montgomery County Community College are closed. \n \n Government \n \n Government offices in Bucks, Chester and Montgomery counties are closed today. \n \n Delaware County government facilities are opening two hours late. \n \n Philadelphia city offices are operating normally, though traffic courts are opening two hours late. \n \n Gov.

Regional airline Cape Air alone cancelled more than 200 flights, including nearly every flight planned from airports in Massachusetts. \n \n Along with travel disruptions, the storm also cut electricity to hundreds of thousands of customers in the region. Nearly 750,000 customers in Pennsylvania were left in the dark by the storm\'s wrath, with a major utility company telling residents power could remain out until the weekend. \n \n In Connecticut, the start of the state\'s General Assembly annual session was delayed until Thursday due to the snow. Nearly a foot of snow buried Massachusetts, schools were largely cancelled across Rhode Island, and rail service out of Washington, D.C. on Wednesday afternoon was limited. \n \n Across the nation, residents struggled to carry on despite the storm. \n \n ""I wish that groundhog would have stayed in its hole,"" said Geoff Dunn, who took the bus to his downtown Columbus, Ohio, office, avoiding the messy roads but still having to navigate snowy sidewalks. ""Finding us six more weeks of winter was not the smart move."" \n \n In Chicago, a runner was credited with helping save a man who fell into icy Lake Michigan with his dog. \n \n Adam Dominik says he found twine and anchored it around himself while throwing the other end in the water, pulling the man onto nearby rocks. Meanwhile, a skier called 911. He was taken to a hospital to be treated for severe hypothermia. He and his dog are expected to recover. \n \n In Michigan, authorities reported several multi-vehicle crashes Wednesday after several inches of snow along Interstate 94 in the Jackson area, including some with injuries, and crashes closed portions of I-69 in the Flint area. \n \n And for those looking for a respite, more bad news is on the way, as authorities predict another walloping winter storm is poised to slam into the region Saturday night into Sunday. \n \n The Associated Press contributed to this report.', ""The cables, a huge sampling of the daily traffic between the State Department and some 270 embassies and consulates, amount to a secret chronicle of the United States’ relations with the world in an age of war and terrorism. Among their revelations, to be detailed in The Times in coming days: \n \n ¶ A dangerous standoff with Pakistan over nuclear fuel: Since 2007, the United States has mounted a highly secret effort, so far unsuccessful, to remove from a Pakistani research reactor highly enriched uranium that American officials fear could be diverted for use in an illicit nuclear device. In May 2009, Ambassador Anne W. Patterson reported that Pakistan was refusing to schedule a visit by American technical experts because, as a Pakistani official said, “if the local media got word of the fuel removal, ‘they certainly would portray it as the United States taking Pakistan’s nuclear weapons,’ he argued.” \n \n ¶ Thinking about an eventual collapse of North Korea: American and South Korean officials have discussed the prospects for a unified Korea, should the North’s economic troubles and political transition lead the state to implode. The South Koreans even considered commercial inducements to China, according to the American ambassador to Seoul. She told Washington in February that South Korean officials believe that the right business deals would “help salve” China’s “concerns about living with a reunified Korea” that is in a “benign alliance” with the United States. \n \n ¶ Bargaining to empty the Guantánamo Bay prison: When American diplomats pressed other countries to resettle detainees, they became reluctant players in a State Department version of “Let’s Make a Deal.” Slovenia was told to take a prisoner if it wanted to meet with President Obama, while the island nation of Kiribati was offered incentives worth millions of dollars to take in Chinese Muslim detainees, cables from diplomats recounted. The Americans, meanwhile, suggested that accepting more prisoners would be “a low-cost way for Belgium to attain prominence in Europe.” \n \n ¶ Suspicions of corruption in the Afghan government: When one of Afghanistan’s two vice presidents visited the United Arab Emirates last year, local authorities working with the Drug Enforcement Administration discovered that he was carrying $52 million in cash. With wry understatement, a cable from the American Embassy in Kabul called the money “a significant amount” that the official, Ahmed Zia Massoud, “was ultimately allowed to keep without revealing the money’s origin or destination.” (Mr. Massoud denies taking any money out of Afghanistan.) \n \n ¶ A global computer hacking effort: China’s Politburo directed the intrusion into Google’s computer systems in that country, a Chinese contact told the American Embassy in Beijing in January, one cable reported. The Google hacking was part of a coordinated campaign of computer sabotage carried out by government operatives, private security experts and Internet outlaws recruited by the Chinese government. They have broken into American government computers and those of Western allies, the Dalai Lama and American businesses since 2002, cables said. \n \n ¶ Mixed records against terrorism: Saudi donors remain the chief financiers of Sunni militant groups like Al Qaeda, and the tiny Persian Gulf state of Qatar, a generous host to the American military for years, was the “worst in the region” in counterterrorism efforts, according to a State Department cable last December. Qatar’s security service was “hesitant to act against known terrorists out of concern for appearing to be aligned with the U.S. and provoking reprisals,” the cable said. \n \n ¶ An intriguing alliance: American diplomats in Rome reported in 2009 on what their Italian contacts described as an extraordinarily close relationship between Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian prime minister, and Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian prime minister and business magnate, including “lavish gifts,” lucrative energy contracts and a “shadowy” Russian-speaking Italian go-between. They wrote that Mr. Berlusconi “appears increasingly to be the mouthpiece of Putin” in Europe. The diplomats also noted that while Mr. Putin enjoyed supremacy over all other public figures in Russia, he was undermined by an unmanageable bureaucracy that often ignored his edicts. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n ¶ Arms deliveries to militants: Cables describe the United States’ failing struggle to prevent Syria from supplying arms to Hezbollah in Lebanon, which has amassed a huge stockpile since its 2006 war with Israel. One week after President Bashar al-Assad promised a top State Department official that he would not send “new” arms to Hezbollah, the United States complained that it had information that Syria was providing increasingly sophisticated weapons to the group. \n \n ¶ Clashes with Europe over human rights: American officials sharply warned Germany in 2007 not to enforce arrest warrants for Central Intelligence Agency officers involved in a bungled operation in which an innocent German citizen with the same name as a suspected militant was mistakenly kidnapped and held for months in Afghanistan. A senior American diplomat told a German official “that our intention was not to threaten Germany, but rather to urge that the German government weigh carefully at every step of the way the implications for relations with the U.S.” \n \n The 251,287 cables, first acquired by WikiLeaks, were provided to The Times by an intermediary on the condition of anonymity. Many are unclassified, and none are marked “top secret,” the government’s most secure communications status. But some 11,000 are classified “secret,” 9,000 are labeled “noforn,” shorthand for material considered too delicate to be shared with any foreign government, and 4,000 are designated both secret and noforn. \n \n Many more cables name diplomats’ confidential sources, from foreign legislators and military officers to human rights activists and journalists, often with a warning to Washington: “Please protect” or “Strictly protect.” \n \n The Times, after consultations with the State Department, has withheld from articles and removed from documents it is posting online the names of some people who spoke privately to diplomats and might be at risk if they were publicly identified. The Times is also withholding some passages or entire cables whose disclosure could compromise American intelligence efforts. While the White House said it anticipated WikiLeaks would make public “several hundred thousand” cables Sunday night, the organization posted only 220 released and redacted by The Times and several European publications. \n \n The cables show that nearly a decade after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the dark shadow of terrorism still dominates the United States’ relations with the world. They depict the Obama administration struggling to sort out which Pakistanis are trustworthy partners against Al Qaeda, adding Australians who have disappeared in the Middle East to terrorist watch lists, and assessing whether a lurking rickshaw driver in Lahore, Pakistan, was awaiting fares or conducting surveillance of the road to the American Consulate. \n \n They show officials managing relations with a China on the rise and a Russia retreating from democracy. They document years of effort to prevent Iran from building a nuclear weapon — and of worry about a possible Israeli strike on Iran with the same goal. \n \n Even when they recount events that are already known, the cables offer remarkable details. \n \n For instance, it has been previously reported that the Yemeni government has sought to cover up the American role in missile strikes against the local branch of Al Qaeda. But a cable’s fly-on-the-wall account of a January meeting between the Yemeni president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, and Gen. David H. Petraeus, then the American commander in the Middle East, is breathtaking. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n “We’ll continue saying the bombs are ours, not yours,” Mr. Saleh said, according to the cable sent by the American ambassador, prompting one of Yemen’s deputy prime ministers to “joke that he had just ‘lied’ by telling Parliament” that Yemen had carried out the strikes. \n \n Mr. Saleh, who at other times resisted American counterterrorism requests, was in a lighthearted mood. The authoritarian ruler of a conservative Muslim country, Mr. Saleh complains of smuggling from nearby Djibouti, but tells General Petraeus that his concerns are drugs and weapons, not whiskey, “provided it’s good whiskey.” \n \n Likewise, press reports detailed the unhappiness of the Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, when he was not permitted to set up his tent in Manhattan or to visit ground zero during a United Nations session last year. \n \n But the cables add a touch of scandal and alarm to the tale. They describe the volatile Libyan leader as rarely without the companionship of “his senior Ukrainian nurse,” described as “a voluptuous blonde.” They reveal that Colonel Qaddafi was so upset by his reception in New York that he balked at carrying out a promise to return dangerous enriched uranium to Russia. The American ambassador to Libya told Colonel Qaddafi’s son “that the Libyan government had chosen a very dangerous venue to express its pique,” a cable reported to Washington. \n \n The cables also disclose frank comments behind closed doors. Dispatches from early this year, for instance, quote the aging monarch of Saudi Arabia, King Abdullah, as speaking scathingly about the leaders of Iraq and Pakistan. \n \n Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The cable then mused about which seemed more likely. \n \n As he left Zimbabwe in 2007 after three years as ambassador, Christopher W. Dell wrote a sardonic account of Robert Mugabe, that country’s aging and erratic leader. The cable called him “a brilliant tactician” but mocked “his deep ignorance on economic issues (coupled with the belief that his 18 doctorates give him the authority to suspend the laws of economics).” \n \n The possibility that a large number of diplomatic cables might become public has been discussed in government and media circles since May. That was when, in an online chat, an Army intelligence analyst, Pfc. Bradley Manning, described having downloaded from a military computer system many classified documents, including “260,000 State Department cables from embassies and consulates all over the world.” In an online discussion with Adrian Lamo, a computer hacker, Private Manning said he had delivered the cables and other documents to WikiLeaks. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Mr. Lamo reported Private Manning’s disclosures to federal authorities, and Private Manning was arrested. He has been charged with illegally leaking classified information and faces a possible court-martial and, if convicted, a lengthy prison term. \n \n In July and October, The Times, the British newspaper The Guardian and the German magazine Der Spiegel published articles based on documents about Afghanistan and Iraq. Those collections were placed online by WikiLeaks, with selective redactions of the Afghan documents and much heavier redactions of the Iraq reports. \n \n Fodder for Historians \n \n Traditionally, most diplomatic cables remain secret for decades, providing fodder for historians only when the participants are long retired or dead. The State Department’s unclassified history series, titled “Foreign Relations of the United States,” has reached only 1976. \n \n While an overwhelming majority of the quarter-million cables provided to The Times are from the post-9/11 era, several hundred date from 1966 to the 1990s. Some show diplomats struggling to make sense of major events whose future course they could not guess. \n \n In a 1979 cable to Washington, Bruce Laingen, an American diplomat in Tehran, mused with a knowing tone about the Iranian revolution that had just occurred: “Perhaps the single dominant aspect of the Persian psyche is an overriding egoism,” Mr. Laingen wrote, offering tips on exploiting this psyche in negotiations with the new government. Less than three months later, Mr. Laingen and his colleagues would be taken hostage by radical Iranian students, hurling the Carter administration into crisis and, perhaps, demonstrating the hazards of diplomatic hubris. \n \n In 1989, an American diplomat in Panama City mulled over the options open to Gen. Manuel Noriega, the Panamanian leader, who was facing narcotics charges in the United States and intense domestic and international political pressure to step down. The cable called General Noriega “a master of survival”; its author appeared to have no inkling that one week later, the United States would invade Panama to unseat General Noriega and arrest him. \n \n In 1990, an American diplomat sent an excited dispatch from Cape Town: he had just learned from a lawyer for Nelson Mandela that Mr. Mandela’s 27-year imprisonment was to end. The cable conveys the momentous changes about to begin for South Africa, even as it discusses preparations for an impending visit from the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson. \n \n The voluminous traffic of more recent years — well over half of the quarter-million cables date from 2007 or later — show American officials struggling with events whose outcomes are far from sure. To read through them is to become a global voyeur, immersed in the jawboning, inducements and penalties the United States wields in trying to have its way with a recalcitrant world. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n In an era of satellites and fiber-optic links, the cable retains the archaic name of an earlier technological era. It has long been the tool for the secretary of state to send orders to the field and for ambassadors and political officers to send their analyses to Washington. \n \n The cables have their own lexicon: “codel,” for a Congressional delegation; “visas viper,” for a report on a person considered dangerous; “démarche,” an official message to a foreign government, often a protest or warning. \n \n But the drama in the cables often comes from diplomats’ narratives of meetings with foreign figures, games of diplomatic poker in which each side is sizing up the other and neither is showing all its cards. \n \n Among the most fascinating examples recount American officials’ meetings in September 2009 and February 2010 with Ahmed Wali Karzai, the half brother of the Afghan president and a power broker in the Taliban’s home turf of Kandahar. \n \n They describe Mr. Karzai, “dressed in a crisp white shalwar kameez,” the traditional dress of loose tunic and trousers, appearing “nervous, though eager to express his views on the international presence in Kandahar,” and trying to win over the Americans with nostalgic tales about his years running a Chicago restaurant near Wrigley Field. \n \n But in midnarrative there is a stark alert for anyone reading the cable in Washington: “Note: While we must deal with AWK as the head of the Provincial Council, he is widely understood to be corrupt and a narcotics trafficker.” (Mr. Karzai has denied such charges.) And the cables note statements by Mr. Karzai that the Americans, informed by a steady flow of eavesdropping and agents’ reports, believe to be false. \n \n A cable written after the February meeting coolly took note of the deceit on both sides. \n \n Mr. Karzai “demonstrated that he will dissemble when it suits his needs,” the cable said. “He appears not to understand the level of our knowledge of his activities. We will need to monitor his activity closely, and deliver a recurring, transparent message to him” about the limits of American tolerance. \n \n Not All Business \n \n Even in places far from war zones and international crises, where the stakes for the United States are not as high, curious diplomats can turn out to be accomplished reporters, sending vivid dispatches to deepen the government’s understanding of exotic places. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n In a 2006 account, a wide-eyed American diplomat describes the lavish wedding of a well-connected couple in Dagestan, in Russia’s Caucasus, where one guest is the strongman who runs the war-ravaged Russian republic of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov. \n \n The diplomat tells of drunken guests throwing $100 bills at child dancers, and nighttime water-scooter jaunts on the Caspian Sea. \n \n “The dancers probably picked upwards of USD 5000 off the cobblestones,” the diplomat wrote. The host later tells him that Ramzan Kadyrov “had brought the happy couple ‘a five-kilo lump of gold’ as his wedding present.” \n \n “After the dancing and a quick tour of the premises, Ramzan and his army drove off back to Chechnya,” the diplomat reported to Washington. “We asked why Ramzan did not spend the night in Makhachkala, and were told, ‘Ramzan never spends the night anywhere.’ ”""]",5,"– Little relief for the Northeast after a snowstorm Monday: Today, it's facing another winter storm, one that's already canceled some 2,400 flights, Fox News reports. Snowfall will range between a few inches in some areas, including New York City and Pittsburgh, to more than a foot in the Catskills and parts of New England. The ""norm,"" per CNN, will be eight to 12 inches, with snowfall slowing in the afternoon. Ice is also expected in many areas, with New York City facing half an inch. In the Philadelphia area, more than 500,000 are without power, Philly.com reports. Areas across New England are closing schools. More snow could also hit Illinois and Iowa, with ice and freezing rain in Mississippi. Some 120 million people may be affected, CNN notes. ""A little bit of everything for everybody, it seems like,"" says a Pennsylvania meteorologist. ""About the only thing we probably won't have is locusts."" And today's not the end of it: Another winter storm is due this weekend, and it could be the worst of a bad week, AccuWeather reports."
160,"['We begin with the three words everyone writing about the election must say: Nobody knows anything. Everyone’s guessing. I spent Sunday morning in Washington with journalists and political hands, one of whom said she feels it’s Obama, the rest of whom said they don’t know. I think it’s Romney. I think he’s stealing in “like a thief with good tools,” in Walker Percy’s old words. While everyone is looking at the polls and the storm, Romney’s slipping into the presidency. He’s quietly rising, and he’s been rising for a while. \n \n Obama and the storm, it was like a wave that lifted him and then moved on, leaving him where he’d been. Parts of Jersey and New York are a cold Katrina. The exact dimensions of the disaster will become clearer when the election is over. One word: infrastructure. Officials knew the storm was coming and everyone knew it would be bad, but the people of the tristate area were not aware, until now, just how vulnerable to deep damage their physical system was. The people in charge of that system are the politicians. Mayor Bloomberg wanted to have the Marathon, to show New York’s spirit. In Staten Island last week they were bitterly calling it “the race through the ruins.” There is a disconnect. \n \n But to the election. Who knows what to make of the weighting of the polls and the assumptions as to who will vote? Who knows the depth and breadth of each party’s turnout efforts? Among the wisest words spoken this cycle were by John Dickerson of CBS News and Slate, who said, in a conversation the night before the last presidential debate, that he thought maybe the American people were quietly cooking something up, something we don’t know about. \n \n I think they are and I think it’s this: a Romney win. \n \n Romney’s crowds are building—28,000 in Morrisville, Pa., last night; 30,000 in West Chester, Ohio, Friday It isn’t only a triumph of advance planning: People came, they got through security and waited for hours in the cold. His rallies look like rallies now, not enactments. In some new way he’s caught his stride. He looks happy and grateful. His closing speech has been positive, future-looking, sweetly patriotic. His closing ads are sharp—the one about what’s going on at the rallies is moving. \n \n All the vibrations are right. A person who is helping him who is not a longtime Romneyite told me, yesterday: “I joined because I was anti Obama—I’m a patriot, I’ll join up But now I am pro-Romney.” Why? “I’ve spent time with him and I care about him and admire him. He’s a genuinely good man.” Looking at the crowds on TV, hearing them chant “Three more days” and “Two more days”—it feels like a lot of Republicans have gone from anti-Obama to pro-Romney. \n \n Something old is roaring back. One of the Romney campaign’s surrogates, who appeared at a rally with him the other night, spoke of the intensity and joy of the crowd “I worked the rope line, people wouldn’t let go of my hand.” It startled him. A former political figure who’s been in Ohio told me this morning something is moving with evangelicals, other church-going Protestants and religious Catholics. He said what’s happening with them is quiet, unreported and spreading: They really want Romney now, they’ll go out and vote, the election has taken on a new importance to them. \n \n There is no denying the Republicans have the passion now, the enthusiasm. The Democrats do not. Independents are breaking for Romney. And there’s the thing about the yard signs. In Florida a few weeks ago I saw Romney signs, not Obama ones. From Ohio I hear the same. From tony Northwest Washington, D.C., I hear the same. \n \n Is it possible this whole thing is playing out before our eyes and we’re not really noticing because we’re too busy looking at data on paper instead of what’s in front of us? Maybe that’s the real distortion of the polls this year: They left us discounting the world around us. \n \n And there is Obama, out there seeming tired and wan, showing up through sheer self discipline. A few weeks ago I saw the president and the governor at the Al Smith dinner, and both were beautiful specimens in their white ties and tails, and both worked the dais. But sitting there listening to the jokes and speeches, the archbishop of New York sitting between them, Obama looked like a young challenger—flinty, not so comfortable. He was distracted, and his smiles seemed forced. He looked like a man who’d just seen some bad internal polling. Romney? Expansive, hilarious, self-spoofing, with a few jokes of finely calibrated meanness that were just perfect for the crowd. He looked like a president. He looked like someone who’d just seen good internals. \n \n Of all people, Obama would know…', ""The U.S. and South Korea are to blame for North Korea’s latest missile launch over Japan, and further sanctions on the regime will not ameliorate the situation, Russia said Tuesday. \n \n In defiance of U.N. resolutions banning its missile testing and fresh international sanctions drafted by the U.S., North Korea carried out another missile test on Tuesday morning, the fourth in as many days, this time directly over Japan for the first time. The regime has already traded barbs with President Donald Trump due to its repeated missile testing and expanding range, including a direct threat made at U.S. pacific territory Guam. \n \n That threat prompted the U.S. to rally its allies and, with China and Russia on side, impose new sanctions on the rogue state. \n \n Anticipating more of the same to follow, Russia’s Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told journalists on Tuesday that U.S. actions were pushing the regime toward more tests, not halting it, state news agency Itar-Tass reported. \n \n “If we go by how colleagues from the U.S. and other western countries have acted in the past, then of course we can expect new steps towards tightening the sanctions, but this will not solve the problem,” Ryabkov said. “It is now obvious to everyone that the resources for influencing North Korea with sanctions have run out.” \n \n Ryabkov referred to the joint military exercises the U.S. is currently holding with ally South Korea. The latest Ulchi Freedom Guardian activity involved computer-simulated warfare and took place over the weekend. The drill aims to strengthen the ability to respond to an potential attack from the North and continues until the end of August. The Russian minister called it “a trend of escalation,” a reiteration of China and Russia's previous arguments in favor of limiting U.S. military presence in the Asia Pacific neighborhood. \n \n The North regularly protests U.S. drills in the region, and in his statement Ryabkov appeared to refer to Ulchi Freedom Guardian directly, taking a more sympathetic approach to the North’s tests. \n \n Read More: After U.S. travel ban, North Korea is courting Russian tourists with new agency \n \n “We consider the joint drills that went ahead anyway, albeit in a lighter mode compared to the initial agenda, made an impact in terms of provoking Pyongyang to make the new launch. We are highly concerned by the general developments,” he said. \n \n In principle both Russia and China oppose widespread nuclear proliferation. Russian President Vladimir Putin will visit Chinese President Xi Jinping for a trade summit next month, where the pair will discuss North Korea. Public statements of concern aside, though, the two countries maintain a similar approach of suggesting that more U.S. disarmament in the region will help curb the North’s nuclear proliferation goals.""]",2,"– The official results from Florida aren't in yet but it looks like Nate Silver—whose blog accounted for a fifth of the New York Times' web traffic Monday—correctly called 50 out of 50 states after getting 49 right in 2008. ""You know who won the election tonight? Nate Silver,"" said Rachel Maddow on MSNBC, a sentiment echoed even by Bret Baier at Fox News, the Huffington Post reports. But while Silver triumphed, there were plenty who got it wrong, notes Politico, which lists more than a dozen pundits who predicted a Romney win with varying degrees of confidence. Among them are assorted Fox pundits, Sarah Palin, and Peggy Noonan at the Wall Street Journal, who wrote ""I think it’s Romney ... While everyone is looking at the polls and the storm, Romney’s slipping into the presidency."" Rush Limbaugh was also way off. ""All of my thinking says Romney big,"" he said Monday. ""My thoughts, my intellectual analysis of this—factoring everything I see plus the polling data—it’s not even close. Three hundred-plus electoral votes for Romney."""
161,"['For those of you who were offended by a very genuine attempt at fostering a civil discussion, I apologize. \n \n About 10 or 15 minutes after the U.S. Supreme Court handed down its 5-4 decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, which made gay marriage legal across the country, including the 13 states that up until now had banned it, a colleague of mine walked into the PennLive newsroom. \n \n A smile lit up her face and there were tears in her eyes. Up until about 10 a.m. on Friday, my gay colleague sat on pins and needles, waiting to see if nine lawyers were about to throw the life and her and her partner into absolute upheaval. \n \n We embraced and I offered my congratulations. And then I sat down and thought about what had just happened and what it meant to my other gay and lesbian colleagues who were rightfully celebrating Friday\'s ruling as a victory for both love and equal protection under the law. \n \n And as the comments on our main story about the ruling -- many of them openly hostile -- began to pile up, I decided I wanted to send the strongest possible message that the Opinion pages of PennLive and The Patriot-News would be space for civil discussion of one of the most important civil rights rulings of our lifetime. \n \n I came up with three sentences, which currently read like this: \n \n ""As a result of Friday\'s ruling, PennLive/The Patriot-News will very strictly limit op-Eds and letters to the editor in opposition to same-sex marriage. \n \n ""These unions are now the law of the land. And we will not publish such letters and op-Eds any more than we would publish those that are racist, sexist or anti-Semitic. \n \n ""We will, however, for a limited time, accept letters and op-Eds on the high court\'s decision and its legal merits."" \n \n What almost immediately followed was an object lesson in the law of unintended consequences. And, sadly, the strongly worded message included in our editorial was lost. \n \n By day\'s end, I\'d received dozens of emails and several phone calls -- not to mention the hundreds of comments appended to the editorial -- accusing me (and this news organization) of being ""fascists"" opposed to both the First Amendment and the right to freedom of expression. \n \n And those were just the polite ones. \n \n And as I rolled it over in my head yesterday, after hearing from professional colleagues and good friends on the right and left who questioned our policy, I reached a number of conclusions: \n \n First: No one at PennLive and The Patriot-News is an opponent of the First Amendment. It\'s a right that\'s foundational to us as a people. And it\'s a right for which many brave and noble men and women have given their lives. And I would never trample on that legacy or dishonor their sacrifice by limiting our readers\' right to express themselves in a civil way. \n \n Second: And I cannot stress this one enough -- that\'s in a civil way. More than once yesterday I was referred to as ""f****t-lover,"" among other slurs. And that\'s the point that I was trying to make with our statement: We will not publish such slurs any more than we would publish racist, sexist or anti-Semitic speech. There are ways to intelligently discuss an issue. The use of playground insults is not among them. And they are not welcome at PennLive/The Patriot-News. \n \n Third: I fully recognize that there are people of good conscience and of goodwill who will disagree with Friday\'s high court ruling. They include philosophers and men and women of the cloth whose objections come from deeply held religious and moral convictions that are protected by the very same First Amendment that allowed me to stick my foot in my mouth on Friday. They are, and always will be, welcome in these pages, along with all others of goodwill, who seek to have an intelligent and reasoned debate on the issues of the day. \n \n These pages, I remind myself finally, belong to the people of Central Pennsylvania. I\'m a conduit, I recognize, for them to share their views and to have the arguments that make us better as a people. And all views are -- and always will be -- welcome. \n \n My mom -- and probably yours too -- once told me what the road to hell was paved with. Yesterday, I was reminded of the truth of that lesson. \n \n I stand with my gay and lesbian friends who, on Friday, were extended the same protections under the law that the rest of us take for granted. \n \n But for those of you who were offended by what was intended as a very genuine attempt at fostering a civil discussion, I apologize.', 'TOKYO — For the first time since a crisis erupted over deadly defects in airbags made by his family’s company, the reclusive chief executive of the Japanese supplier Takata publicly addressed the issue on Thursday. He offered an apology but defended Takata’s products as fundamentally safe. \n \n “I apologize from my heart to those who have died or been injured,” the chief executive, Shigehisa Takada, said after bowing deeply in a show of remorse. “I feel a heavy responsibility.” \n \n Yet Mr. Takada, the 49-year-old grandson of the company’s founder, did not explain why he had remained all but absent during the crisis that has been at full boil for more than a year. \n \n Even after Toyota and Nissan said on Thursday that they would recall 2.86 million more vehicles equipped with Takata airbags than first announced, Mr. Takada dismissed suggestions that he should resign over what has become the largest automobile safety recall in history. So far, about 35 million vehicles worldwide have been affected. \n \n Takata admitted last month that faults in its airbags could cause their inflaters to explode with too much force when they deploy, endangering the drivers and passengers that the safety devices are intended to protect. At least eight deaths and 130 injuries have been linked to the defect. \n \n Mr. Takada made his remarks at a news conference after Takata’s annual shareholder meeting. He had briefly addressed the airbag issue at the last meeting a year ago, where he apologized to the company’s investors. But until Thursday, he had not spoken directly to the public or taken questions from the news media. \n \n Mr. Takada shed little new light on the nature of the defects, and he acknowledged that Takata was making slow progress with its investigation. The company said it had identified manufacturing failures, which it says have since been resolved, as being responsible for faults in about 10 million airbag inflaters. \n \n Defects traced to the manufacturing problems, mainly careless handling of inflater components at two North American factories, were called “alpha cases” inside the company, Takata executives said on Thursday. \n \n Questions still surround what the company calls “beta cases,” involving inflaters that were not subject to any known mishandling during production but that ruptured anyway. Prolonged exposure to heat and humidity is suspected to be a contributing factor to the failures, but Takata said it was still trying to pinpoint the exact cause or causes. \n \n Mr. Takada and other executives rejected the theory, put forward by some experts, that the basic design of Takata’s inflaters was dangerous because the company uses an explosive propellant, ammonium nitrate, that other airbag manufacturers have avoided because it is deemed potentially unstable. \n \n Continue reading the main story Danger in the Steering Wheel Airbags made by the Takata Corporation have a potential defect when they deploy. Some have ruptured, sending metal fragments into the car. At least eight deaths and more than 100 injuries have been linked to the problem. INFLATER/CANISTER PROPELLANT Cutaway view INFLATER/CANISTER STEERING WHEEL AIRBAG HOW IT WORKS: Inside the canister, pellets of a propellant based on ammonium nitrate, a common compound used in fertilizer, are ignited and generate the nitrogen gas that inflates the airbag in a fraction of a second. THE PROBLEM: Takata has said manufacturing problems, together with exposure to moisture in cars in humid regions, can cause the propellant to degrade. This can make the propellant burn too strongly when the airbag is deployed, rupturing the inflater and sending metal fragments into the car’s interior and injuring the driver or passengers. \n \n “We have been working with ammonium nitrate for more than 10 years, and have tested it in a variety of ways,” Mr. Takada said. “As far as I’m concerned, it is safe and reliable.” \n \n Some of Takata’s replacement inflaters also use ammonium nitrate, meaning that if the chemical turns out to be part of the problem, devices in cars that have been recalled and repaired may ultimately fail as well. Takata met with harsh criticism from American lawmakers at a congressional hearing this week, as well as with questions about the replacement airbags. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n One automaker, Fiat Chrysler, told the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation that it would no longer use Takata inflaters in replacement of driver’s side airbags in its cars, citing Takata’s use of ammonium nitrate. \n \n In a technical presentation on Thursday, Hiroshi Shimizu, a senior vice president at Takata, said it was likely that a combination of factors was behind the “beta cases.” \n \n “There is no evidence that the gas destabilizes on its own,” he said. \n \n The Takada family took the airbag manufacturer public nearly a decade ago, but it still controls a majority of shares, mostly through a family-owned holding company. And the family has tightened its grip over the course of the airbag crisis. \n \n Photo \n \n In December, the Takata board voted to replace Stefan Stocker, the Swiss citizen who became president in 2013, and handed responsibility for day-to-day operations to Mr. Takada, who was then in a more symbolic role as chairman. Mr. Takada is now both chairman and president. \n \n The move has had little obvious effect on Takata’s response to the crisis, which has been criticized as slow and poorly communicated. \n \n Takata had planned to allow journalists to observe the shareholder meeting on Thursday, but it denied access at the last moment. \n \n Takata’s share price has fallen about 40 percent since the shareholder meeting a year ago. The company suspended dividend payments after it reported a net loss of 29.5 billion yen, or $238 million, for the fiscal year that ended in March. \n \n The company’s official forecast is for a return to profit this year, but with lawsuits in North America and no clear end to the recalls in sight, analysts say the outlook is most likely too optimistic. \n \n Asked on Thursday if he would resign to take responsibility for the crisis, Mr. Takada said he would not. \n \n “My first responsibility is to ensure customers’ safety by making sure the company responds firmly to the problem,” he said.', ""Oh, I’m not going to kill you. I’m just going to...sue you? Wait, that’s not how the line goes. Well, that is, unless you’re Reddit user BlackPanther2016. Disgruntled by Suicide Squad's so-called false advertising, the moviegoer is sharing his plans to sue Warner Bros. & DC Entertainment for wrongly showing some of The Joker’s scenes in its preview trailers. \n \n Posting to r/movies, the user had lots to say about how fed up he is with Suicide Squad and Hollywood’s tendency to delete scenes shown in trailers. He writes, “Suicide Squad trailers showcased several SPECIFIC Joker scenes that I had to pay for the whole movie just so that I can go watch those SPECIFIC SCENES that WB/DC had advertised in their trailers and TV spots...Non [sic] of these scenes were in the movie. I drove 300 miles to London to go watch these specific scenes they had explicitly advertised in their TV ads...and they didn't show them to me.” \n \n Of course, many fans are aware of the decision Warner Bros. made to cut many of The Joker’s scenes. Actor Jared Leto even told Telestar, “There are a lot of scenes that didn’t make it to the final film. Hopefully they will see the light of day. Who knows.” But, for one Reddit user, the studio’s choice is totally unacceptable. “I wasted alot of money paying and travelling to go watch this movie because of these specific scenes they had advertised to me and all of us saying, “hey, check out our preview! this will all be in our movie, come watch it on the 5th!!”.

God help others facing a similar fate. I\'m so upset and angry."" \n \n She added: ""Where are the \'very real safeguards\' that the Government consistently hid behind when forcing this appalling Act through Parliament. \n \n ""The only people who won\'t get extradited are terrorists facing the death sentence, the very people the Act was meant to be about. \n \n ""What bitter irony."" \n \n Mrs Sharp said her legal team would now apply for a judicial review, but if that was not granted then her son could be extradited before Christmas. \n \n ""What a heartless and cowardly decision this is,"" she said. \n \n Mrs Sharp wept as she told how she broke the news to Mr McKinnon. \n \n She said: “He was very, very bad. He was very quiet – and I am more worried when he is quiet. I have got concerns for Gary. Alan Johnson has made the wrong decision. It is just awful.” \n \n Mr McKinnon\'s lawyer, Karen Todner, said: ""It\'s a devastating blow but we are not going to give up. \n \n ""We are certainly coming to the end of the road. \n \n ""We\'re just hoping at some point someone sees sense and steps in. \n \n ""All the legal team do know is we cannot give up because in some ways it\'s like dealing with a Death Row case, and we genuinely believe that Gary\'s life is at stake here."" \n \n Another of his legal team said: “It is a miserable decision that we fundamentally disagree with – he could be gone by Christmas. We are considering all our legal avenues. What does it take for someone not to be extradited?” \n \n She added that she planned to issue judicial review proceedings next week, but added: ""We are normally allowed three months to issue but the Home Secretary has only allowed us seven days."" \n \n Keith Vaz MP, the chairman of the home affairs select committee which has pressed Mr Johnson directly not to extradite Mr McKinnon, said: “I am very disappointed at this decision. This is the wrong decision for the wrong reasons."" \n \n Last month Mr Johnson threw a lifeline to Mr McKinnon, who suffers from a form of autism, with a promise to examine new medical evidence “very carefully” before deciding on his extradition last month. \n \n However in an emailed letter to Mrs Sharp, Mr Johnson is understood to have said that a decision to block the extradition of Mr McKinnon was not in his control. \n \n During an earlier legal battle in the summer, judges warned Mr McKinnon, who is accused of hacking into networks at the Pentagon and Nasa from his flat in north London, might kill himself if he was extradited. \n \n The legal process, which had been paused while Mr Johnson considered the medical evidence, will now start again, with legal sources suggesting Mr McKinnon could be extradited by Christmas. \n \n Mr McKinnon’s lawyers can either seek a fresh emergency judicial review of Mr Johnson’s decision at the High Court within the next seven days or appeal to the European Court of Human Rights within the next 14 days. \n \n David Burrowes, the Conservatives’ shadow justice minister and Mr McKinnon’s local MP, said: “It is extremely disappointing that the repeated calls for compassion and justice for Gary have been ignored by the Home Secretary. \n \n ""Despite substantial medical grounds giving Alan Johnson the opportunity to stop the extradition, he has washed his hands of Gary. \n \n ""The decision flies in the face of the medical evidence, which showed the serious risks to his health and life if extradition was to be granted.” \n \n Mr Vaz added: ""The unanimous view of the Home Affairs Select Committee was that the Home Secretary has the power to intervene. \n \n ""His [Alan Johnson\'s] decision has important constitutional implications if he is not prepared to use his discretion even though he is allowed to so no matter how narrow the scope.” \n \n Mark Lever, chief executive of the National Autistic Society which has been campaigning on behalf of Mr McKinnon, said: ""We are bitterly disappointed by the Home Secretary’s decision and feel hugely sympathetic towards Gary and his family who have now been living under extreme stress for a prolonged period of time. \n \n ""People with Asperger syndrome are often much more vulnerable than appearances would suggest and can be highly susceptible to additional mental health problems. \n \n ""On the strength of recently submitted medical evidence and the support of the Home Affairs committee, we had hoped that Mr Johnson would listen to these concerns. \n \n ""The National Autistic Society will continue to support Gary and his family during this incredibly difficult time and as the case continues.” \n \n Mr McKinnon, 43, from Wood Green, North London, has insisted that his hacking of Pentagon computers was nothing more than him searching for reports of UFO sightings. \n \n He is being extradited under a treaty which has been criticised because, while British prosecutors must provide details of the evidence against an American citizen, US prosecutors need only explain the charges to take a Briton to America. \n \n Mr Johnson said: ""I have carefully considered the representations in the case of Gary McKinnon. \n \n ""I am clear that the information is not materially different from that placed before the High Court earlier this year and does not demonstrate that sending Mr McKinnon to the United States would breach his human rights. \n \n ""As the courts have affirmed, I have no general discretion. If Mr McKinnon\'s human rights would be breached, I must stop the extradition. If they would not be breached, the extradition must go ahead."" \n \n He added: ""Earlier this year the High Court upheld the extradition request for Mr McKinnon. This was after all proceedings under the Extradition Act 2003 had been completed. \n \n ""The High Court dismissed a further challenge by Mr McKinnon that extradition to the USA would be in breach of his human rights. \n \n ""Throughout this process there have been a number of assurances. Firstly due to legitimate concerns over Mr McKinnon\'s health, we have sought and received assurances from the United States authorities that his needs will be met. These were before the High Court in July. \n \n ""It is also clear from the proceedings to date that Mr McKinnon will not, if convicted, serve any of his sentence in a supermax prison. Finally, should Mr McKinnon be extradited, charged and convicted in the US and seek repatriation to the UK to serve a custodial sentence, the Government will of course progress his application at the very earliest opportunity. \n \n ""I know there is a concern on all sides to see a conclusion to these proceedings. It is now open to Mr McKinnon\'s lawyer to consider their legal options. As a consequence I do not propose to comment any further.""', 'Gary McKinnon and his family were told yesterday that Alan Johnson is to allow the extradition to go ahead after refusing to block it on medical grounds. \n \n Mr McKinnon, who has Asperger\'s syndrome, is accused by the US authorities of breaking into military and Nasa computers. He has admitted hacking but maintains he was looking only for evidence of UFOs. \n \n He was told in a letter from the Home Secretary that the extradition would now ""proceed forthwith"" after finding that there was ""nothing incompatible"" between extradition and Mr McKinnon\'s human rights. \n \n The family said last night that Mr McKinnon, who could be sentenced to up to 60 years in prison in the US, was ""at risk of suicide"" after being told there will be no 11th hour reprieve. His mother, Janis Sharp, was ""extremely worried"" about her son\'s mental state and said the Government and Mr Johnson should ""hang their heads in shame"" for caving in to American pressure. \n \n She said: ""This is a cruel and miserable decision. To force a peaceful, vulnerable, misguided UFO fanatic like Gary thousands of miles away from his much-needed support network is barbaric. If the severity of Gary\'s medical condition isn\'t sufficient to prevent his extradition, I can\'t imagine what is."" \n \n She added: ""This government is terrified of speaking up to America, and now they are allowing vulnerable people to be pursued for non-violent crime when they should be going after terrorists. Why are they doing this?"" \n \n Karen Todner, the hacker\'s solicitor, said there was still hope. ""It\'s a devastating blow but we are not going to give up. We are going to issue judicial review proceedings. We normally have three months to do this but have now been given seven days to issue."" \n \n In July Mr McKinnon went to the High Court in an attempt to get the extradition order overturned but was told being sent for trial in the US was ""a lawful and proportionate response"" to his actions. A month ago he was refused permission to take his case to the Supreme Court when judges decided he had ""no real prospect"" of success. \n \n The case has highlighted concerns about the Extradition Act 2003 which critics maintain erodes the rights of individuals in Britain without a similar concession being given in the US. They argue that Britons can be extradited without any assessment of the evidence against them and on cases so weak that they would never reach court at home. \n \n The US authorities only have to produce an arrest warrant to show that the person is wanted. In contrast, if British prosecutors want to extradite someone from the US they have to demonstrate likely guilt. \n \n The Home Secretary has been given assurances by the US authorities that Mr McKinnon\'s medical needs will be met. Mr Johnson said he had considered carefully the case but rejected it. ""I am clear that the information is not materially different from that placed before the High Court earlier this year and does not demonstrate that sending Mr McKinnon to the United States would breach his human rights,"" he said. \n \n ""It is also clear from the proceedings to date that Mr McKinnon will not, if convicted, serve any of his sentence in a supermax prison.

""The problem I have with it, they allowed him to bowl prior [to disqualification]."" \n \n Todd Powell says his son was disqualified due to a scheme by a bowling official to help his hometown teams. (Eddy Kennedy/CBC) \n \n Grayson took part in a 15-minute warm-up. Nothing was said. He then bowled three games — the best three of his young life — and nothing was said. \n \n It wasn\'t until he was lined up next to his teammates, ready to accept a gold medal for winning the just-for-fun tournament, that Youth Bowl Canada provincial director Gordon Davis pulled Grayson\'s mother into an office. \n \n Her son, who was wearing faded black jeans, was disqualified. \n \n His pants were just not black enough to meet the tournament\'s dress code. \n \n ""Parents ruin it for kids,"" Powell said. ""If this is what sport is about when it comes to kids...shame on them."" \n \n A pair of faded black jeans are at the centre of controversy on the Newfoundland and Labrador youth bowling scene. (Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images) \n \n While semantics can be argued — how black were his jeans, really? — Grayson\'s father has a deeper theory than the colour of his son\'s pants. \n \n Davis also coaches teams out of a bowling alley in Corner Brook.

But sometimes it’s about the jeans. \n \n Seven-year-old Grayson Powell bowled the game of his life to win his team of three a youth bowling tournament in the Newfoundland city of St John’s on Saturday. But shortly after his 171-point game propelled Riverdale to the title, Grayson was disqualified, and was unable to collect his prize. \n \n The reason? He wore the wrong trousers. \n \n “The rule is you have to wear black pants,” Todd Powell, Grayson’s father, explained to CBC. Grayson was wearing faded black jeans – which were evidently not black enough. \n \n So as Grayson waited in line to collect his gold medal, Gord Davis, the provincial director at Youth Bowl Canada, informed Grayson’s parents that their son was to be disqualified for his sartorial breach. \n \n Powell Sr said he was distinctly unimpressed with Davis’s ruling. “If this is what sport is about when it comes to kids … shame on them.” \n \n But Davis’s organisation insists it did nothing wrong, and said the dress code for Provincial A tournaments had been in place “for decades”. In an impassioned defence on Facebook that ran to 2,600 words and seemed to have been written by Davis, Newfoundland & Labrador YBC rejected accusations of wrongdoing and said simply: rules were rules. \n \n “Mr Todd Powell knew full aware of the dress code, and sent his child to Provincials knowing that it was against the rules,” the post read. “Why is NL YBC in the wrong here, when parents knowingly broke the rules, and we are the bad guys? \n \n “We did nothing wrong. Stop blaming NL YBC and [president] Gord Davis for something that should never have had happened. Ignorance of a rule … is not the fault of the governing body.” \n \n Powell Sr pointed out to CBC that his son Grayson had been allowed to bowl throughout. Why wait until he had finished to disqualify him? “The problem I have with it … they allowed him to bowl prior. He owes these three kids a written apology.” \n \n YL NBC said additional opinions had been needed with other executive members before a ruling could be made. “I was not going to embarrass those kids by stopping play and making a scene,” Davis wrote. \n \n Later, on the same Facebook page, Gord Davis said that even though the decision could not be reversed, Grayson and his team would be presented with gold medals in a special ceremony because the situation had been “blown out of proportion for simple communication problems”. \n \n “I informed Todd that the kids had bowled magnificently and yes they deserve to be recognized for their accomplishments,” Davis wrote. \n \n “We will make sure these kids are taken care of first because that is what we are all about. We apologized for what decision we had to make and the fact that they were not relayed any information during the first or third game.” \n \n The governing body said it wished to move on from the controversy and simply concentrate on bowling. “Any kid can play this sport,” the post read. “Lots of kids won’t play sports because they feel they don’t belong and they are bullied, or just not good enough. Well, bowling is not like that: we treat all kids equally.” \n \n Providing, of course, they’re wearing the right pants.', 'Justin Bieber is facing several charges after authorities said he raced through a Miami Beach neighborhood in a rented Lamborghini, cursed at cops as he resisted arrest and admitted to consuming drugs and alcohol.

165,"['BOSTON—Twenty-five years after the notorious burglary of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston, law enforcement officials are seeking the public’s assistance in identifying an unauthorized visitor to the museum the night before the theft. That person entered the museum through the same door as the thieves in the middle of the night, 24 hours before the theft. \n \n “Over many months we have engaged in an exhaustive re-examination of the original evidence in this case. Our aim has been to ensure that all avenues have been explored in the continuing quest to recover these artworks,” said United States Attorney Carmen Ortiz. “Today we are releasing video images from the night before the theft—images which have not previously been seen by the public—with the hope of identifying an unauthorized visitor to the museum. With the public’s help, we may be able to develop new information that could lead to the recovery of these invaluable works of art.” \n \n The video footage released today, captured by Museum security cameras 24 hours before the Gardner heist, shows an automobile pull up next to a rear entrance of the Museum. The car matches the general description of a vehicle that was reported to have been parked outside the Museum moments prior to the theft on March 18, 1990. \n \n The video also shows an unidentified man exiting the automobile and then being allowed inside the Museum, against Museum policy, by a security guard. That event occurred at 12:49 p.m. on March 17, 1990, almost exactly 24 hours before the thieves entered the museum through the same door. \n \n While the images of both the vehicle and the unidentified man are low resolution, law enforcement officials hope that releasing the footage will assist with identifying the man or the vehicle in the video. \n \n Anyone with information regarding the video should call the FBI at 617-742-5533 or the Isabella Gardner Museum at 617-278-5114. \n \n Vincent Lisi, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI in Boston said, “This latest request for the public’s assistance illustrates the FBI’s continued commitment to the Gardner investigation. By releasing this video, we hope to generate meaningful leads and ultimately recover the stolen artwork.” \n \n A $5 million reward has been offered by the Museum for information that leads directly to the recovery of all of the stolen items in good condition. The recovery of an individual object will result in a portion of the reward, based upon the object’s market value relative to the other stolen objects. \n \n “We remain committed to one goal: the return of all 13 works to their rightful place, which is here at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum. To that end, we support the efforts that the United States Attorney and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are making to uncover any and all information related to the theft of our artwork. We believe that no stone should be left unturned,” said Anthony Amore, Director of Security at the Gardner Museum. \n \n In the early morning hours of March 18, 1990, two white males dressed in Boston Police uniforms gained entrance to the Gardner Museum by advising the security guard at the watch desk that they were responding to a report of a disturbance within the compound. Against Museum policy, the guard allowed the thieves into the facility. Upon entry the two thieves subdued the on-duty security personnel, handcuffed them, and secured both guards in separate remote areas of the Museum’s basement. The suspects did not brandish weapons, nor were any weapons seen during the heist. No panic button was activated and no Boston Police notification was made during the robbery. The video surveillance film from the evening of the robbery was seized by the thieves prior to departure. They did not take the video footage from the night before. \n \n The combined value of the 13 works of art stolen during the Gardner theft is at least $500 million, though they are considered priceless within the art community. The following objects were stolen during the burglary and have been missing for the past 25 years: \n \n 1) Vermeer’s ""The Concert"" \n \n 2) Rembrandt’s ""A Lady and Gentleman in Black"" \n \n 3) Rembrandt’s ""The Storm on the Sea of Galilee"" \n \n 4) Rembrandt’s ""Self Portrait"" \n \n 5) Govaert Flinck’s ""Landscape with an Obelisk"" \n \n 6) A Shang Dynasty Chinese Bronze Beaker from 1200-1100 BC \n \n 7) Degas\' ""La Sortie du Pelage"" \n \n 8) Degas\' ""Cortege Aux Environs de Florence"" \n \n 9) Degas\' ""Three Mounted Jockeys"" \n \n 10) Degas\' ""Program for an Artistic Soiree"" (charcoal on white paper) \n \n 11) Degas\' ""Program for an Artistic Soiree"" (less finished charcoal on buff paper) \n \n 12) Manet’s ""Chez Tortoni"" \n \n 13) Napoleonic Eagle Finial \n \n - More information on Gardner Museum theft', 'BOSTON (AP) — Twenty-five years after the famed art heist at Boston\'s Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, law enforcement officials released new surveillance video Thursday showing an unauthorized visitor entering the museum the night before the robbery. \n \n FILE - In this March 11, 2010 file photo, the empty frame, center, from which thieves cut Rembrandt\'s ""Storm on the Sea of Galilee"" remains on display at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston....

The thieves handcuffed the museum\'s two guards on duty and put them in separate areas of the museum\'s basement. \n \n No weapons were seen during the robbery and no panic button was activated.

Authorities did not say Abath was the guard in the video, but three officials familiar with the investigation confirmed to the Globe that it is he. \n \n Officials released the video to solicit the public’s help in identifying the second man, hoping to make some movement in the largest unsolved art theft in the world. \n \n It was not immediately clear why the surveillance footage of the night before the robbery had not been made public before, and whether it was viewed by the FBI in the initial investigation. The robbers had seized surveillance footage from the night of the heist, though they did not take footage from the previous night. \n \n Several law enforcement officials said the video appears to have been overlooked and mixed in with other evidence at the onset of the case. US Attorney Carmen M. Ortiz said that a team of investigators began reviewing the original evidence, and that one of them, Assistant US Attorney Robert Fisher, requested the video, which was in the custody of the FBI. Officials then decided to release it to the public in hopes it could lead to new information. \n \n Advertisement \n \n “We have this big question mark as to who this individual is,” Ortiz said. “The hope is that someone will recognize the unauthorized visitor . . . and provide some fruitful leads that will help us figure out where the paintings are, lead to some information, to some people we haven’t thought of before.” \n \n Abath, who is now in his late 40s and lives in Vermont, has denied any ties to the robbery plot, though he admitted to violating museum protocol at the time of the robbery by opening the door to the two men dressed as police officers claiming to be responding to a disturbance. Protocol required him to seek a supervisor’s approval before letting anyone into the museum after hours. \n \n A Globe reporter who went to Abath’s house Thursday morning in Brattleboro was turned away by a woman who said he did not live there. Abath has admitted to bringing friends to the museum at least once several months before the robbery, but he never disclosed that he let someone in the night before the heist. He has said he opened the door only for security checks. \n \n “What you see in the video does not comport with what we have been told in the past,” said Anthony Amore, the museum’s director of security, who has worked with the FBI and the US attorney’s office in a renewed push in recent years to solve the heist. \n \n He said the video “is compelling in that perhaps the identity of this person . . . will shed new light on exactly what happened March 18 [1990], who else may be involved, and hopefully lead us to our paintings.” \n \n Globe reporters discuss new video in Gardner museum heist \n \n No one can be charged with the theft of the paintings because the statute of limitations has expired, but authorities could still seek charges against someone in possession of the stolen works. Ortiz has said she would consider granting immunity to anyone who may possess the paintings in exchange for their return. The museum has offered a $5 million reward for the return of the works. \n \n Abath, who has recently worked as a teacher’s aide in Vermont, has long been under suspicion, in part because of his admission to violating museum protocol and because of the way the robbery was carried out. \n \n Once Abath buzzed the men into the museum’s side entrance on Palace Road at 1:24 a.m. on March 18, 1990, the men subdued him, then waited for the second guard on duty and tied him up as well. They then spent 81 minutes in the museum, making off with 13 works of art, including three Rembrandts, a Vermeer, and a Manet. \n \n Investigators have questioned why Abath’s footsteps were the only ones picked up by motion detectors in the first-floor gallery, where one of the stolen paintings was taken, just before the two robbers scoured the rest of the museum. \n \n One of Abath’s most questionable disclosures was that he opened and closed the Palace Road door 20 minutes before the robbery, which prompted investigators to ask whether he was signaling the robbers. The action was also in violation of security protocol, though Abath maintained he routinely opened the door during his rounds. \n \n He did open the door on March 17. The footage starts just before 1 a.m., and it shows a car moving in reverse on Palace Road, a one-way street, after the second guard on duty went on his rounds. An unidentified man approaches the museum from the direction of the car, and Abath seems to grant him access through the first door by hitting an intercom button. \n \n The man does not enter the museum’s second door, but returns to the car and turns on its parking lights. \n \n The footage then shows the man returning to the museum. Abath again buzzes the man in, but this time the man remains in the museum reception area for more than three minutes before returning to the car and leaving. \n \n The footage also shows that the unidentified man parked the car at roughly the same spot where several young people who had emerged from a St. Patrick’s Day party the morning of the robbery reported seeing a red hatchback. One of the partygoers reported seeing two men dressed as police officers inside, roughly an hour before the robbery occurred. \n \n The color, make, and model of the car in the new surveillance video could not be determined, though authorities said Thursday that it matches the general description of the vehicle seen the night of the robbery. \n \n Lyle Grindle, who headed security for the museum at the time of the theft, said in an interview Thursday that he had been shown the security tape by federal investigators about a month ago, but that he was unable to identify the visitor who had been allowed into the museum. He said he told investigators that allowing such a visit was a violation of the museum’s strict security procedures, which prohibited any late-night entries, even by police or firefighters. \n \n Grindle said it appeared to him that the tape had been recently unearthed by the federal officials, but he did not ask why it had not been viewed before by investigators. \n \n “I believe all the prior tapes from the previous nights were taken by the FBI, and I never saw them again,” said Grindle, who stayed on as security director for years after the heist and oversaw an upgrade of the museum’s security system. \n \n Grindle said he did not know if Abath had been questioned by the federal officials who interviewed him. \n \n “Someone has to explain why the security protocol was broken two nights in a row now, and I think only Rick can answer that question now,” Grindle said. \n \n It was not immediately clear if Abath has recently discussed his actions that night with authorities. \n \n No one has ever been charged in connection with the theft of the paintings, and none of the works have been recovered, making it Boston’s last great mystery following the capture and conviction of notorious gangster and longtime fugitive James “Whitey” Bulger. The artworks are considered priceless on the black market. \n \n In 2013 the FBI publicly disclosed for the first time that agents believe they know who took the art, and that the works had made their way through underground organized crime channels from Boston through Connecticut to Philadelphia, where they were last believed to be seen. \n \n Amore called the new video troubling, but added, “It doesn’t knock us off course on the stuff we’ve been talking about.” He said the video “raises more questions than answers.”']",3,"– The FBI hopes new surveillance footage released today will aid in the recovery of 13 priceless artworks stolen 25 years ago and help put to rest one of Boston's greatest mysteries. In the early hours of March 18, 1990, two men dressed as cops were let into the Gardner Museum, where they tied up two security guards and absconded with the artwork and the museum's security footage, the Boston Globe reports. But the thieves, who have never been identified, may have missed one key thing. According to the FBI, surveillance footage from the day before the robbery shows a security guard letting a man into the museum—against protocol—through the same door later used in the robbery. The Globe reports it's unclear why this footage wasn't viewed by law enforcement earlier, but it could show a ""dry run"" of the heist. The newspaper identifies Richard Abath as the security guard in the footage, and the FBI is hoping the public can help identify the mystery man he lets in. Abath, a rock musician at the time who now lives in Vermont, has claimed he had no part in the robbery, but this new footage appears to contradict a number of his statements. No one has ever been charged with stealing the art—for which there is a $5 million reward—and no one ever will, as the statute of limitations has expired. Someone in possession of the paintings, however, could face charges. Their total value exceeds $500 million, reports AP."
166,"['The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act bans companies from paying foreign officials to get more business. The law has recently been targeted by lobbyists — including an arm of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce with ties to Wal-Mart — who criticize it as too broad and bad for business. \n \n The Times investigation found that Wal-Mart de Mexico paid more than $24 million in bribes to win construction permits. When a whistleblower alerted top Wal-Mart executives in 2005, they launched an investigation that found evidence of the bribery but then shut down the inquiry. The company failed to report any of the information to law enforcement at the time, the Times story said. \n \n The revelations threaten to blemish the cleaned-up image Wal-Mart has carefully put together in recent years after facing criticism that it paid workers too little and put mom-and-pop stores out of business. \n \n As officials in recent years have stepped up their enforcement of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the Chamber has been pushing for the law to be scaled back. \n \n The U.S. Chamber Institute for Legal Reform, an arm of the Chamber that has been a leader in criticizing the law, listed two Wal-Mart executives as board members in its 2010 tax form: Jeff Gearhart, Wal-Mart’s general counsel, and Thomas Hyde, a former Wal-Mart corporate secretary who stepped down in August 2010. \n \n Hyde was among the company executives who received initial reports of the alleged bribery in 2005, according to the Times story. \n \n “We take compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) very seriously and are committed to having a strong and effective global anti-corruption program in every country in which we operate,” David Tovar, Wal-Mart’s vice president of corporate communications, said in a statement Saturday. “Many of the alleged activities in The New York Times article are more than six years old. If these allegations are true, it is not a reflection of who we are or what we stand for.” \n \n A spokesman for Justice Department declined to comment. The people who confirmed the department’s investigation spoke on the condition of anonymity because the probe is ongoing. \n \n Wal-Mart’s shares slid nearly 5 percent Monday, and the company faced more questions about how much it knew about the corruption and why it did not tell authorities. Reps. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) and Henry A. Waxman (D-Calif.) sent a letter to Wal-Mart chief executive Michael Duke requesting an in-person meeting about the bribery allegations. \n \n Labor critics again raised alarms about the company’s practices. \n \n “The reported cover-up by Walmart executives at the highest levels exposes a core truth: Walmart cannot be taken at its word,” Joe Hansen, international president of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, said in statement. \n \n One in five Wal-Mart stores is in Mexico. Wal-Mart de Mexico is the company’s largest foreign subsidiary. \n \n Staff writer Tom Hamburger contributed to this report.', 'Stock Chart for Wal-Mart de Mexico SAB de CV (WALMEXV) \n \n Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) is the subject of a U.S. Justice Department criminal investigation into allegations of bribery in its Mexican subsidiary, according to a person familiar with the probe. \n \n The Justice Department is investigating potential criminal charges under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, according to the person familiar with the probe who wasn’t authorized to speak publicly about it. Wal-Mart is conducting its own review of allegations that its representatives paid local officials in Mexico to get stores opened faster in the early 2000s. \n \n The investigations by the government and the company may prompt executive departures and U.S. penalties if it reveals senior managers didn’t take strong enough action, governance specialists said. The probes also may slow Wal-Mart’s expansion in Mexico and other markets. \n \n “The penalties paid by companies in settling these types of FCPA investigations have grown significantly larger in recent years,” said Jeffrey Lehtman, a Washington-based partner with the law firm of Richards Kibbe & Orbe LLP. “Depending on the facts uncovered, companies like Wal-Mart can expect the penalties to be incredibly high.” \n \n The bribery allegations were described in an April 21 New York Times story. In a December 2011 U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Wal-Mart said it was examining whether it was in compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, without saying what region or time period was in question. \n \n “It is an open question as to whether Wal-Mart’s prior disclosure would have allowed investors to understand the magnitude of potential exposure,” said Lehtman, whose firm handles Foreign Corrupt Practices Act cases. \n \n ‘Anti-Corruption Program’ \n \n Alisa Finelli, a Justice Department spokeswoman, declined to comment. John Nester, an SEC spokesman, declined to comment earlier yesterday on whether the agency plans to investigate the Wal-Mart allegations. \n \n The company said in an April 21 statement that it has met voluntarily with the Justice Department and the SEC to discuss the case. The company is also enhancing its audit procedures and internal controls to escalate to management possible violations of the bribery law. \n \n Jeff Gearhart, the company’s general counsel and corporate secretary, told employees in an April 21 memo that the alleged violations “occurred more than six years ago” and are “not a reflection of who we are or what we stand for.” \n \n In a separate note sent to employees yesterday, Chief Executive Officer Mike Duke said Wal-Mart is conducting an “aggressive investigation” and “will not tolerate violations anywhere or at any level of the company.” David Tovar, a company spokesman, confirmed the authenticity of both documents. \n \n Mexican Expansion \n \n The expansion of Wal-Mart de Mexico, mainly in the last decade, left the world’s largest retailer with about 20 percent of its stores in Mexico, out of more than 10,000 worldwide. Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart’s sales rose about 6 percent last year to $447 billion. Wal-Mart has more than doubled the number of stores in Mexico to 2,088 since 2008. \n \n The investigation may slow Wal-Mart’s growth in the country if authorities there feel pressure to show more scrutiny of its permits, Robert Carroll, an analyst at UBS AG in New York, said yesterday in a report. \n \n Wal-Mart de Mexico, which is 69 percent owned by Wal-Mart Stores Inc., fell 12 percent yesterday to 37.89 pesos in Mexico City, the biggest decline since May 4, 1998. The parent company’s shares slid 4.7 percent to $59.54 at the close in New York, the biggest drop since Aug. 10. \n \n Conference Call \n \n Walmex’s first-quarter net income rose 4.5 percent to 4.71 billion pesos ($357 million) from 4.5 billion a year earlier, the company said in a statement. Sales climbed 14 percent to 96.9 billion pesos, missing the average estimate of 99.7 billion pesos of five analysts polled by Bloomberg. \n \n Walmex CEO Scot Rank and Chief Financial Officer Rafael Matute didn’t mention the corruption investigation yesterday on a seven-minute conference call to discuss first-quarter results. As usual, the company didn’t take questions from analysts or investors on the quarterly call. \n \n Settlements involving the corrupt practices act are typically 1 percent to 2 percent of sales, and that would be about $4.5 billion per 1 percentage point of sales for Wal-Mart, Carroll said. FCPA investigations take 2 years to 6 years to settle, he said. The largest such settlement ever was $1.6 billion paid by Siemens AG (SIE) in 2008, he said. \n \n Wal-Mart executives, including then-Chief Executive Officer and current board member Lee Scott, were made aware of the bribery allegations in 2005, the New York Times reported. So was Duke, the current CEO, who at the end of that year was just taking over international operations, the article said. \n \n Scott didn’t return a phone call to his home. \n \n Congressional Scrutiny \n \n Two top Democrats on congressional panels yesterday moved to start a probe and request a meeting with Wal-Mart executives. \n \n The Times report “raises serious questions about potential violations of United States law” and “about the actions of top company officials in the United States who reportedly tried to disregard substantial evidence of abuse,” Representatives Elijah Cummings of Maryland and Henry Waxman of California, wrote in a letter to Duke. \n \n Cummings is the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, and Waxman is the top Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. \n \n Wal-Mart will face pressure from shareholders to take action against any executives who didn’t act fully on the bribery allegations sooner, said Charles Elson, director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. \n \n ‘It’s Problematic’ \n \n “If this is all true, it’s problematic,” Elson said in a telephone interview. “If any officer was significantly involved, their position has to be reviewed. You have to do the investigating and determine what did the CEO know and when.” \n \n The Times article said the bribes may have amounted to more than $24 million in payments. \n \n The Times identified executive Eduardo Castro-Wright as a central figure in the expansion of the alleged payments. Castro- Wright ran Wal-Mart de Mexico as CEO from 2003 to 2005 and was president and chief operating officer of the unit from 2001 to 2003. Some of the alleged bribery took place during that time, the newspaper reported. \n \n In a telephone interview, Tovar declined to discuss the future of Castro-Wright, who is now a Wal-Mart vice chairman scheduled to retire July 1. \n \n To contact the reporters on this story: David Welch in Detroit at dwelch12@bloomberg.net; Thom Weidlich in New York at tweidlich@bloomberg.net; Seth Stern in Washington at sstern14@bloomberg.net \n \n To contact the editors responsible for this story: Robin Ajello at rajello@bloomberg.net; Steven Komarow at skomarow1@bloomberg.net', 'Chinese tech billionaire Jack Ma\'s promise to create 1 million new US jobs is the latest casualty of the trade war. \n \n The Alibaba (BABA) chief grabbed attention at the start of last year when he made the highly ambitious pledge following a meeting with Donald Trump, who was president elect at the time. \n \n But in an interview published late Wednesday by China\'s official news agency, Xinhua, Ma said the waves of new tariffs imposed by Washington and Beijing in recent months have undermined the plan. \n \n ""This promise was on the basis of friendly China-US cooperation and reasonable bilateral trade relations, but the current situation has already destroyed that basis,"" Ma said. ""This promise can\'t be completed."" \n \n A spokeswoman for Alibaba, China\'s biggest e-commerce company, confirmed Ma\'s comments to CNN. \n \n Analysts had already expressed serious doubts about the pledge, which Alibaba announced after Trump and Ma met at Trump Tower in New York in January 2017. \n \n ""Jack and I are going to do some great things,"" Trump said at the time. \n \n Ma\'s vague promise wasn\'t based on Alibaba investing in the United States to build factories or fulfillment centers.

The US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act prohibits companies from paying foreign officials in an effort to increase business, and if Walmart is found to be in violation of FCPA, the company could face executive departures, slowed expansion in Mexico and other markets, and penalties that could be ""incredibly high,"" says one lawyer. In a note to employees yesterday, Walmart CEO Mike Duke said the company is conducting its own ""aggressive investigation"" into the allegations; in an earlier statement, a VP had noted that ""many of the alleged activities ... are more than six years old. If these allegations are true, it is not a reflection of who we are or what we stand for."" The top Democrats on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and the House Energy and Commerce Committee also moved yesterday to open a probe into the incident. Walmart shares dove after the allegations came to light."

But a State Department official said that the fact the money wasn\'t transferred on Jan. 1 doesn\'t mean it was frozen. ""There are still deliberations taking place, and we have until mid January to decide what we are going to do,” the official said. \n \n The Trump administration has frozen $125 million in funding for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, which provides aid to Palestinian refugees, according to three Western diplomats who were informed of the move. They said the funding, one third of the annual U.S. donations to the agency, was supposed to be transferred by Jan. 1 but was withheld. \n \n The details: The diplomats, who asked to speak on conditions of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter, said the funding was frozen until the Trump administration finishes its review of U.S. aid to the Palestinian Authority. \n \n The move comes after the Palestinian Authority suspended their contacts with the Trump administration in response to its decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. A senior White House official said no decision have been made yet, but confirmed that a review of the U.S. assistance to the Palestinians is underway ""in light of the Palestinians\' recent conduct."" \n \n The diplomats added that U.S. officials told U.N. officials in the last two days that President Trump is considering totally cutting the part of the funding which was frozen, and is even considering cutting up to $180 million, which amounts to half of the U.S. funding to UNRWA. \n \n The impact: The Western diplomats said freezing or cutting of such a big part of the U.S. funding would be catastrophic for the organization, would hamper its work and might lead to negative consequences for the Palestinian refugee camps in Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan and Lebanon. \n \n U.N. secretary general António Guterres has spoken with senior U.S. official about the UNRWA funding and also consulted with foreign ministers from other donor countries, according to the diplomats. \n \n The Israeli security establishment and the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories — the Israeli organization that oversees government activities in the West Bank and Gaza — are concerned about possible freezing or cutting of U.S. funding to UNRWA, fearing the escalation of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. \n \n “The humanitarian situation in Gaza is complicated enough and harming UNRWA funding will only make it more complicated,"" a senior Israeli security official told me. \n \n What we\'re hearing: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is not enthusiastic about the cutting of U.S. funding to UNRWA, but is politically pressed by conservative ministers in his cabinet and by the fact he can\'t be more dovish on the Palestinian issue than President Trump. \n \n Officials in the prime minister\'s office told diplomats from several western countries that Israel does not object to the cutting of U.S. funding to the Palestinian Authority, but prefers that the U.S. doesn\'t cut funding to UNRWA due to the fact it also serves Israeli security interests. \n \n A senior Israeli official told me Netanyahu is in touch with the White House on the UNRWA funding issue, and conveyed the message that Israel prefers “gradual disengagement"" with UNRWA by the U.S. and not a big funding cut. \n \n The prime minister\'s office said in a statement: ""Netanyahu supports President Trump\'s critical attitude towards UNRWA and believes practical steps need to be taken in order to change the fact that UNRWA is being used to entrench the Palestinian refugee problem instead of solving it.""', 'This is the full text of the Articles of Impeachment adopted by the House Judiciary Committee on July 27, 1974. \n \n Note: The articles of impeachment were passed only by the Committee on the Judiciary.

NIXON, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, IN MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT OF ITS IMPEACHMENT AGAINST HIM FOR HIGH CRIMES AND MISDEMEANOURS. ARTICLE 1 In his conduct of the office of President of the United States, Richard M. Nixon, in violation of his constitutional oath faithfully to execute the office of President of the United States and, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States, and in violation of his consitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, has prevented, obstructed, and impeded the administration of justice, in that: On June 17, 1972, and prior thereto, agents of the Committee for the Re-election of the President committed unlawful entry of the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee in Washington, District of Columbia, for the purpose of securing political intelligence. Subsequent thereto, Richard M. Nixon, using the powers of his high office, engaged personally and through his close subordinates and agents, in a course of conduct or plan designed to delay, impede, and obstruct the investigation of such illegal entry; to cover up, conceal and protect those responsible; and to conceal the existence and scope of other unlawful covert activities. The means used to implement this course of conduct or plan included one or more of the following: making false or misleading statements to lawfully authorized investigative officers and employees of the United States; withholding relevant and material evidence or information from lawfully authorized investigative officers and employees of the United States; approving, condoning, acquiescing in, and counselling witnesses with respect to the giving of false or misleading statements to lawfully authorized investigative officers and employees of the United States and false or misleading testimony in duly instituted judicial and congressional proceedings; interfering or endeavouring to interfere with the conduct of investigations by the Department of Justice of the United States, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the office of Watergate Special Prosecution Force, and Congressional Committees; approving, condoning, and acquiescing in, the surreptitious payment of substantial sums of money for the purpose of obtaining the silence or influencing the testimony of witnesses, potential witnesses or individuals who participated in such unlawful entry and other illegal activities; endeavouring to misuse the Central Intelligence Agency, an agency of the United States; disseminating information received from officers of the Department of Justice of the United States to subjects of investigations conducted by lawfully authorized investigative officers and employees of the United States, for the purpose of aiding and assisting such subjects in their attempts to avoid criminal liability; making or causing to be made false or misleading public statements for the purpose of deceiving the people of the United States into believing that a thorough and complete investigation had been conducted with respect to allegations of misconduct on the part of personnel of the executive branch of the United States and personnel of the Committee for the Re-election of the President, and that there was no involvement of such personnel in such misconduct: or endeavouring to cause prospective defendants, and individuals duly tried and convicted, to expect favoured treatment and consideration in return for their silence or false testimony, or rewarding individuals for their silence or false testimony.

Nixon, in violation of his constitutional oath faithfully to execute the office of President of the United States and, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States, and in disregard of his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, has repeatedly engaged in conduct violating the constitutional rights of citizens, impairing the due and proper administration of justice and the conduct of lawful inquiries, or contravening the laws governing agencies of the executive branch and the purposed of these agencies. This conduct has included one or more of the following: He has, acting personally and through his subordinates and agents, endeavoured to obtain from the Internal Revenue Service, in violation of the constitutional rights of citizens, confidential information contained in income tax returns for purposed not authorized by law, and to cause, in violation of the constitutional rights of citizens, income tax audits or other income tax investigations to be intitiated or conducted in a discriminatory manner. He misused the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Secret Service, and other executive personnel, in violation or disregard of the constitutional rights of citizens, by directing or authorizing such agencies or personnel to conduct or continue electronic surveillance or other investigations for purposes unrelated to national security, the enforcement of laws, or any other lawful function of his office; he did direct, authorize, or permit the use of information obtained thereby for purposes unrelated to national security, the enforcement of laws, or any other lawful function of his office; and he did direct the concealment of certain records made by the Federal Bureau of Investigation of electronic surveillance. He has, acting personally and through his subordinates and agents, in violation or disregard of the constitutional rights of citizens, authorized and permitted to be maintained a secret investigative unit within the office of the President, financed in part with money derived from campaign contributions, which unlawfully utilized the resources of the Central Intelligence Agency, engaged in covert and unlawful activities, and attempted to prejudice the constitutional right of an accused to a fair trial.

Adopted 28-10 by the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives.', 'President Donald Trump, or any other commander in chief, can\'t be found guilty of obstructing justice because the Constitution says so, according to one of Trump’s top lawyers. \n \n John Dowd, among several attorneys representing the president, told Axios that the Constitution makes Trump the nation\'s top cop, so by definition the president ""cannot obstruct justice, because he is the chief law enforcement officer,"" Dowd said. He added that Trump ""has every right to express his view of any case."" \n \n The latter comment refers to Trump\'s tweets dismissing special counsel Robert Mueller\'s probe into the Trump campaign\'s alleged collusion with Russia during the 2016 election. Most recently, Michael Flynn, the president\'s former national security adviser and campaign aide, pleaded guilty on Friday to lying to the FBI, and one day later, Trump\'s Twitter account posted a comment that could help bolster a case of obstruction: \n \n “I had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI. He has pled guilty to those lies. It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful. There was nothing to hide!” Trump posted, the first time he suggested he knew Flynn lied to investigators. \n \n The tweet could be seen as evidence of obstruction of justice because Trump later reportedly asked then-FBI Director James Comey to “let” the Flynn thing “go."" \n \n Dowd said that he wrote the tweet. Not that it matters, because the president can\'t be found guilty of obstruction, the lawyer claims. \n \n It’s not clear which section of the Constitution\'s Article II Dowd was referencing, though Section Two does read: “ The president] may require the Opinion, in writing, of the principal Officer in each of the executive Departments, upon any Subject relating to the Duties of their respective Offices.” \n \n Keep up with this story and more by subscribing now \n \n But according to Dowd, the tweet was the furthest thing from an admission of guilt or obstruction. \n \n ""The tweet did not admit obstruction. That is an ignorant and arrogant assertion,” Dowd told Axios. \n \n Dowd’s comments hark back to former President Richard Nixon’s defense of his actions in office. Nixon, who resigned in August 1974 before he could be impeached, famously said during his interviews with British journalist David Frost in 1977 that “when the president does it, that means it is not illegal.” \n \n REUTERS/James Lawler Duggan \n \n In Nixon’s case, he was talking about the cover-up in the Watergate scandal, while Trump’s case involves the president’s powers over the Justice Department. Trump lamented in November that the “saddest thing” about being president is that he is “not supposed to be involved with the Justice Department” and the “FBI.” \n \n Trump then asked why the Justice Department was not going after his former presidential opponent, Hillary Clinton, and her private email server scandal. He also wondered why the department was not investigating Clinton’s campaign for hiring the company that created the infamous Trump-Russia dossier that has dogged Trump’s first year in office.', 'Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption David Cameron: ""There\'s not going to be a G8 summit this year in Russia"" \n \n The G8 summit will not take place in Russia this year, UK Prime Minister David Cameron has said. \n \n Speaking in the Netherlands, Mr Cameron said it was ""absolutely clear"" the planned June meeting of world leaders in the Russian resort of Sochi would not happen owing to events in Ukraine. \n \n The EU and US have imposed sanctions on Russian officials after Russia\'s annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. \n \n Moscow has also been warned of further action if it does not change course. \n \n The announcement that the Sochi meeting had been effectively cancelled came after Russian troops seized control of the last major military base in Crimea. \n \n Mr Cameron, US President Barack Obama and other G8 leaders are attending a nuclear co-operation summit in The Hague, to which Russian President Vladimir Putin was not invited. \n \n \'Illegal annexation\' \n \n ""We should be clear there\'s not going to be a G8 summit in Russia,"" Mr Cameron said, urging Russia to ""change course"". \n \n The G7 leaders plus EU representatives issued a declaration after their meeting in The Hague noting that ""international law prohibits the acquisition of part or all of another state\'s territory through coercion or force"". \n \n Image copyright AFP \n \n ""To do so violates the principles upon which the international system is built,"" they said. \n \n ""We condemn the illegal referendum held in Crimea in violation of Ukraine\'s constitution. We also strongly condemn Russia\'s illegal attempt to annex Crimea in contravention of international law and specific international obligations. We do not recognise either."" \n \n Russia\'s actions would have ""significant consequences"", they continued. \n \n ""We remain ready to intensify actions including coordinated sectoral sanctions that will have an increasingly significant impact on the Russian economy, if Russia continues to escalate this situation. \n \n ""Russia has a clear choice to make. Diplomatic avenues to de-escalate the situation remain open, and we encourage the Russian government to take them."" \n \n UK Foreign Secretary William Hague said there was an increasing recognition that European leaders wanted to stop relying so heavily on Russian oil and gas. \n \n The G7 had to be prepared to take more far-reaching measures in response to the developments, he said. \n \n The UK and other G8 nations suspended their preparations for the Sochi summit last month as the crisis in Ukraine intensified and hinted that they could meet without Russia. \n \n Several G8 members have also called for Russia\'s membership of the powerful body to be suspended. \n \n The BBC\'s Europe correspondent Matthew Price said the end of the Sochi summit was a recognition of Russia\'s isolation on the global stage as a result of what it had done in Ukraine. \n \n The US, UK and other countries, he added, were making clear they did not want Russia ""in their club"" unless it reconsidered its actions in Crimea.']",5,"– The Trump attorney who says he penned the ""sloppy"" tweet that some say indicates a possible obstruction of justice isn't done making headlines. John Dowd spoke to Axios' Mike Allen, scoffing at criticism of the tweet regarding Mike Flynn, which suggested Trump knew the former national security adviser had lied to the FBI before Trump canned James Comey. ""The tweet did not admit obstruction,"" Dowd says. ""That is an ignorant and arrogant assertion."" Plus, the Constitution has Trump's back, per Dowd. ""[The] president cannot obstruct justice because he is the chief law enforcement officer under [the Constitution's Article II] and has every right to express his view of any case,"" he claims. Newsweek notes it's not clear which section of Article II Dowd refers to, though it speculates on one part involving the president seeking the opinion ""of the principal Officer in each of the executive Departments, upon any Subject relating to the Duties of their respective Offices."" Allen notes that with this pronouncement, Trump's legal team is ""setting the stage"" to keep Trump insulated from obstruction of justice or collusion charges in the Russia probe—meaning, Allen speculates, that his lawyers may be nervous charges are coming down the pike. But one of Barack Obama's former counsels notes ""it is certainly possible"" for Trump to have obstructed justice, and Allen points out Richard Nixon's Articles of Impeachment were jump-started with the assertion that Nixon ""has prevented, obstructed, and impeded the administration of justice."" But whether Trump can or can't be held responsible for such a transgression may be moot, Allen adds. ""The one thing everyone agrees on is that the House of Representatives, with its impeachment power, alone decides what is cause for removal from office,"" he writes. ""For now, at least, the House is run by Republicans."""

Vorobyeva said... (Associated Press) \n \n The crash site itself, in farmland held by the pro-Russian separatists who the West accuses of shooting down the plane, remained unsecured five days after the disaster — another source of frustration for officials around the world eager to establish the facts of the case. \n \n After an overnight journey, a refrigerated train carrying the bodies pulled into a station in Kharkiv, a government-controlled city where Ukrainian authorities have set up their crash investigation center. Government spokesman Oleksander Kharchenko said Ukraine ""will do our best"" to send the bodies to the Netherlands on Tuesday. Of the 298 people who died aboard the Amsterdam-to-Kuala Lumpur flight, 193 were Dutch citizens. \n \n In Brussels, European Union foreign ministers were discussing whether to impose more sanctions in response to the disaster. Europe and the United States have imposed targeted economic sanctions against Russia for supporting Ukraine\'s five-month insurgency that began after pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych was ousted by protesters in February. \n \n The rebels control a swathe of territory in two eastern provinces, and have battled Ukrainian troops with heavy weapons including tanks and missile launchers that the West says came from Russia. Russia denies supporting the insurgency. \n \n The sanctions so far have focused on individuals instead of entire sectors of the economy, though the EU was moving already to broaden them before the downing of the plane. British Prime Minister David Cameron said Monday that the jet\'s destruction on Thursday has drastically changed the situation, and that the Russians cannot expect continued access to European markets and capital if they continued to fuel a war against another European country. \n \n Lithuanian Foreign Minister Linas Linkevicius blamed ""terrorists supplied by Moscow"" for shooting down the airliner, killing all aboard. He said he hoped the EU will impose beefed-up sanctions on Russia. His call for an arms embargo was a direct challenge to France, which is building two warships for the Russian navy. \n \n At the crash site near the village of Hrabove, a few rebel fighters accompanied observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. The farmland where the wreckage is scattered was otherwise unguarded and unsecured. Even the red-and-white tape that had sealed off the fields had been torn away. \n \n In some places, the smell of decay and flies suggested the presence of remains under the wreckage, and observers said Monday that not all bodies had been recovered. \n \n About 70 villagers, most of them older women wearing headscarves, gathered across the road from the site to sing Ukrainian Orthodox hymns at a memorial service led by several black-robed priests. \n \n ___ \n \n Dahlburg contributed from Brussels.

Is it suggesting the Ukrainian SU-25 (despite its technical limitations) shot down the passenger jet in mid-air? \n \n And why? The plane would seem to have been travelling in the wrong direction for Ukrainian forces to have perceived it as a hostile aircraft coming from Russia, and the rebels don\'t have an air force. \n \n So are they seriously suggesting the Ukrainians deliberately moved their missiles on to rebel-held territory and shot the airliner down as part of some sort of nefarious plan to frame the rebels and turn world opinion against them? \n \n But then Russia doesn\'t need to prove its case - all it needs is to create one, to insist that there are different versions of events, that there is credible claim and counter-claim. \n \n In much the same manner as a criminal defence barrister, Russia doesn\'t have to demonstrate that its alleged client is innocent - just to establish enough doubt in the minds of the jury - in this case the international community - that they can\'t be completely sure.', 'View Slideshow Ukrainian emergency workers carry a victim\'s body in a plastic bag at the crash site of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 near the village of Hrabove in eastern Ukraine on Monday.

Photo: Getty Images. \n \n The elaborate, televised Defense Ministry presentation—at odds with Western and Ukrainian accusations that Kremlin-backed insurgents shot down the plane—came as the U.S. and Russia clashed at the U.N. Security Council on Monday. There, both countries voted in favor of a unanimous resolution that condemned the downing of the jet and called for an independent international investigation into the incident. (Follow the latest updates on the Malaysia Airlines crash in Ukraine.) \n \n Russia sought to use both forums to push back against growing international criticism and U.S. and Ukrainian assertions that Moscow could have provided the missile system that brought down the plane. American officials charged that the Russian version of events was a propaganda effort aimed at slowing the international community\'s response to the geopolitical crisis—or weakening proposed new sanctions to punish Moscow for its role in the conflict. \n \n At the news conference broadcast from Moscow, Russian air force chief Lt. Gen. Igor Makushev didn\'t say outright who the ministry thought had fired the missile that apparently brought down the airliner Thursday. Nor did he provide any photographic, radar or satellite evidencethat would show a missile track. \n \n But he said that Russian radar had spotted a second aircraft in the ill-fated airliner\'s vicinity just before the crash and that it was likely a Ukrainian fighter jet. A graphic that Gen. Makushev said was based on radar data depicted four commercial planes in the area shortly before the crash, as well as the alleged Ukrainian fighter jet. (View an interactive seating chart of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17.) \n \n His presentation also suggested an alternative theory, that satellite imagery showed Ukraine also had moved missile systems into the area before the incident. The air force chief presented several slides of satellite images he said showed the Ukrainian missile-system movements. \n \n The suggested version of events echoed much of what has been reported on Russian state television in recent days, which has suggested that Ukraine could have shot down the plane, possibly via one of its fighter planes. \n \n U.S. officials dismissed the Russian government\'s claim that a second plane was present when Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down last week as ""desperate"" propaganda. \n \n U.S. officials didn\'t provide their own evidence to back their arguments. But they pointed to Ukraine\'s statements Monday that the country\'s fighter jets were on the ground at the time of the crash. \n \n U.S. officials also said that Ukrainian fighters can\'t operate at 30,000 feet, where Flight 17 was cruising. ""The Russian government has a propaganda machine second to none, as these latest conspiracy theories demonstrate,"" one U.S. official said. \n \n The Obama administration reiterated its findings that Russia was the likely supplier of advanced SA-11 antiaircraft missiles to separatists, who fired it at the Malaysia Airlines jetliner. The White House said that an international case was building that indicated Russian complicity in the tragedy. \n \n ""What\'s clear is that there is a picture that\'s coming into focus,"" said Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary. ""And Russian claims to the contrary are getting both more desperate and much harder to believe."" \n \n The war of words spilled over into the U.N. Security Council, where after the resolution vote, U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power and Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin gave sharply different versions of who was likely responsible for shooting down the Boeing 777 on Thursday, killing all 298 people on board. \n \n ""Russia has begun to blame Ukraine itself for the attack though the missile came from separatist territory that Russia knows full well Ukraine has not yet reclaimed,"" Ms. Power said. \n \n ""Russia must recognize that no move on the geopolitical chessboard with the West can offset the pain being felt by the passengers\' families,"" she said. \n \n But Mr. Churkin chastised Ms. Power in the council chamber, saying, ""There can be no jumping to conclusions or political statements here."" \n \n Mr. Churkin said Ukraine would have to answer to international investigators regarding the activities of its air-traffic controllers, why a Ukrainian antiaircraft missile battery in the area of the crash was ""hastily removed,"" and why Ukrainian radar was operating ""at an all-time high"" on the day of the incident. He also accused Ukraine of ""touching up"" intercepted phone calls of rebel commanders with audio from before the date of the crash. \n \n Kiev has dismissed Russian claims that it could have been involved, and Ukraine\'s security service has posted intercepted phone calls that it says are of pro-Russia rebel commanders discussing having shot down a plane they discovered afterward was a civilian aircraft. Moscow and the rebels have denied this. \n \n International forensic experts on Monday inspect the crash site of the Malaysia Airlines jet that was shot down in eastern Ukraine last week. Associated Press \n \n The U.S., which has largely backed Kiev\'s version of events, has said its intelligence analysts have evaluated a number of the audio recordings and said they were authentic. \n \n Earlier on Monday, Gen. Makushev said that the two Russian radar stations near Russia\'s border with Ukraine observed the presence of the second aircraft over a period of four minutes on the day of Flight 17\'s crash. These stations couldn\'t identify the aircraft because it mostly likely wasn\'t equipped with the system of secondary identification of aircrafts, ""which is characteristic of fighter jets,"" he said. \n \n Gen. Makushev said that Russian radars could only spot the aircraft at the point of its ascension because the on-duty radars only detected objects at above 5,000 meters. Russian radars spotted the unidentified plane patrolling in the vicinity of Flight 17, ""controlling the development of the situation,"" he said. \n \n The defense ministry also said it registered the Su-25 fighter jet ascending within close range of several civil aircrafts, including the Malaysia Airlines jet. \n \n Another top military official, Lt. Gen. Andrei Kartapolov, said at the same news conference that the jet came as close as 1.8 miles to Flight 17, which is well within the range of the air-to-air missiles it is usually equipped with. \n \n Interactives \n \n Gen. Makushev also showed satellite photos allegedly showing several Buk-M1 ground-to-air missile systems in the area close to where the plane crashed. The systems, he argued, could only belong to the Ukrainian military. The Buks were spotted in Luhansk and Donetsk by Russians, Gen. Kartapolov said, in the days leading up to the crash. \n \n Ukrainian officials have said its own Buk systems were well out of range, and have accused Russia of giving the rebels a Buk system, which then shot down the airliner. Russia denies this. \n \n Public tracking website Flightradar24 followed Flight 17 from its departure from Amsterdam through to its final moments over Ukraine. The aircraft was observed to be roughly 10 miles north of the L980 jetway that was a part of its filed flight plan. Such a deviation isn\'t unusual, though, and can be affected by weather. \n \n Similarly, Gen. Makushev said the Malaysia Airlines plane deviated from its course by close to 9 miles near Donetsk but then attempted to return to its course, crashing shortly after. Russian radars spotted the Flight 17 rapidly descending 32 miles away from the Russian border, Russian officials said. \n \n He said Russia is prepared to hand all of the information it has to the European authorities, which included satellite imagery and data from its own radar. \n \n Russian defense ministry officials also claimed that a U.S. satellite was spotted at the time of the Flight 17 crash and asked that the U.S. release the satellite images from that time. The U.S. didn\'t immediately comment on the claim. \n \n —Joe Lauria \n \n and Julian E.

But Moscow, in the meantime, sought to cast doubt on the generally accepted theory that pro-Russian separatists were to blame, reports the Wall Street Journal. At an official briefing last night, the defense ministry said that its radar spotted a second aircraft in the vicinity and that it was probably a Ukraine fighter jet, which could have shot down the plane. The air force chief also suggested that a Ukraine missile system could have hit the plane from the ground, and he said satellite imagery suggested that Ukraine had been moving such systems into the area. He offered no proof, but as Katie Stallard at Sky News writes, ""Russia doesn't need to prove its case—all it needs is to create one, to insist that there are different versions of events, that there is credible claim and counter-claim."" Meanwhile, the refrigerated train carrying passengers arrived in the Ukraine town of Kharkiv, reports the AP.

Snoop noted that the site will be enlisting celebrities that are “down with the team” including Seth Rogen and Miley Cyrus. \n \n But beyond that, Merry Jane will also take a hard editorial look at the business and politics of the cannabis industry, breaking news about legalization, policy, and industry growth. \n \n And that’s just the start of it. \n \n Merry Jane also connects to its own database around various strains of cannabis, created by a Merry Jane editorial team, letting users learn more about the strain that might be right for them, and then connecting that reader/user with a local dispensary where they can procure said herbal supplement. \n \n But unlike other platforms that help inform the reader about different types of greenery, Merry Jane makes it super easy to search for what you’re looking for, whether it’s a wax, edible, or flower. Users can search by type of cannabis, flavors, symptoms, and more, with high-res rotating imagery for every product listed. \n \n Pre-launch, Snoop and Chung curated dispensaries to put on the platform, but eventually dispensaries will be able to log in to the back end and upload their own menus, update them, and maintain control over their own digital storefront via Merry Jane. \n \n When asked about the business plan for the site, MJ cofounder Ted Chung said that “advertising is definitely part of the plan,” but noted that the most important thing is providing the marijuana business with a definitive destination for brands and retail locations to create a strong presence.

""Then we found the bodies hanging off the hotel."" \n \n The man made the broadcast Monday evening, and the video was made inaccessible by Facebook late Tuesday afternoon. \n \n ""The mother of the child was crying and was very sad,"" Jirasak said. ""I am also very sad. It is a personal dispute and they were still very young."" \n \n The incident came less than two weeks after a man in Cleveland, Ohio, in the United States broadcast himself on Facebook Live shooting a man to death. A series of other offensive broadcasts, including sexual assaults, has caused Facebook to seek ways to block such videos as quickly as possible. \n \n Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said last week that his company has ""a lot of work"" to do on the problem. \n \n The chief investigator in the Phuket case, Lt. Jula-at Suwannin, said police have yet to question Wuttisan\'s 20-year-old widow because they are giving her time to grieve. \n \n In Thailand, the potential for problems with Facebook Live became an issue last May when local media used the platform to broadcast live video of a university lecturer who was locked in a six-hour standoff with police who were seeking him in the shooting deaths of two colleagues.

Facebook has yet to confirm the times to the BBC. \n \n Thailand\'s ministry of digital economy said it had contacted Facebook on Tuesday afternoon about removing the videos. \n \n Ministry spokesman Somsak Khaosuwan told Reuters: ""We will not be able to press charges against Facebook, because Facebook is the service provider and they acted according to their protocol when we sent our request. They co-operated very well."" \n \n YouTube said it had taken down the video within 15 minutes of being told of its presence by the BBC. \n \n Its statement read: ""YouTube has clear policies that outline what\'s acceptable to post and we quickly remove videos that break our rules when they\'re flagged."" \n \n Shortly before the BBC alerted YouTube, the video was showing 2,351 views. \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption US \'Facebook killer\' manhunt - what happened? \n \n Thai social media users reacted with anger to the footage, while offering condolences to the family of the girl, BBC Thai editor Nopporn Wong-Anan says. \n \n Devastated relatives of the child, including the mother, picked up the body of the girl and her father from hospital on Tuesday. \n \n Following the US killing, Facebook said it was ""constantly exploring ways that new technologies can help us make sure Facebook is a safe environment"". \n \n ""We prioritise reports with serious safety implications for our community, and are working on making that review process go even faster,"" blogged one of its executives last week. \n \n Separately on Tuesday, a court in Sweden jailed three men over the gang-rape of a woman in the city of Uppsala, 80km (50 miles) north of Stockholm, earlier this year and its live-streaming on Facebook. \n \n One man was jailed for two years and four months, and another for one year, both for rape. The third was jailed for six months for posting the rape on Facebook and failing to report it. \n \n Analysis: Leo Kelion, BBC technology desk editor \n \n This latest atrocity comes less than a fortnight after a US man bragged on Facebook Live about his murder of a 74-year-old man in Cleveland, having also posted a video of the killing to the social network. \n \n The platform\'s chief, Mark Zuckerberg, subsequently acknowledged he had ""a lot of work"" to do after it emerged the murder clip had remained online for more than two hours despite Facebook having received complaints in the meantime. \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Mark Zuckerberg commented on the Cleveland killing at a conference last week \n \n Prior to that, Facebook Live broadcast the death of a Chicago man who was shot in the neck and head last June, and then in July a woman streamed the death of her boyfriend after he was shot by police in Minneapolis. \n \n There have also been reports of sexual assaults, animal abuse and teenage suicide having been shown. \n \n For its part, Facebook is trying to find ways for its review team - which employs thousands of people - to react to such content more quickly. \n \n In addition, the firm has developed software to prevent such footage being reshared in full on its service at a later point. \n \n And it is also exploring the use of artificial intelligence to automatically flag videos and photos that need to be reviewed rather than waiting for other users to report them. \n \n What it hasn\'t discussed is the idea of scrapping Facebook Live altogether. \n \n With Twitter and YouTube, among others, offering rival live-streaming products, doing so could put it at a disadvantage. \n \n But as a result, there will inevitably be further outrages and criticism because Facebook Live\'s popularity makes it all but impossible for the firm to keep a human eye over each broadcast.', 'In Thailand, there was broad anger over the crime, which the police said appeared to have been driven by jealousy. Mr. Wongtalay had fought with his wife the night before the killing after searching her phone and accusing her of having another relationship. \n \n The video showed Mr. Wongtalay fixing a noose around his daughter’s neck and then dropping her off the side of a building. After a burst of crying, he climbed over the side to retrieve her body. His subsequent suicide was not shown online. \n \n A second video of the police taking both of the bodies down that night remained on Facebook. \n \n Facebook has been under scrutiny for what role it should play in overseeing the billions of posts and videos that are uploaded on its site each day. Facebook’s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, addressed the issue at a company conference this month in response to a case in which a man in Cleveland posted a video of himself shooting and killing a 74-year-old stranger. \n \n The deaths in Thailand highlight the global scope of the problem. As Facebook has pushed to further ensconce itself in the lives of its users, it has urged them to share their most intimate experiences on its site. That has resulted in a flood of posts and videos in different languages, cultural contexts and time zones across the world. Accidents and crimes have also occasionally shown up, and patrolling that has proved difficult. \n \n Last summer, an Italian wing-suit base jumper streamed his own death in an accident, while in January, three men in Sweden were arrested and accused of raping a woman and broadcasting it to a private Facebook group. In February, two journalists were fatally shot during a Facebook Live broadcast in the Dominican Republic.']",3,"– A 20-year-old man streamed himself hanging his 11-month-old daughter on Facebook Live before killing himself Monday evening in a vacant hotel in Thailand, the AP reports. According to the New York Times, a four-minute video shows a crying Wuttisan Wongtalay tying a noose around his daughter's neck and dropping her over the side of the hotel in Phuket. Family members—including the baby's mother—saw the video and called police, the BBC reports. Officers arrived to find Wongtalay having hanged himself as well. Police say Wongtalay was jealous and upset with his wife, who he had accused of being with another man. The video of Wongtalay killing his daughter was on Facebook for about 20 hours before the company removed it. Facebook sent condolences to the family, calling the incident ""appalling."" ""Our hearts go out to the family of the victim,"" Facebook said in a statement. The company had already promised to review its Facebook Live procedures this month after a man in Cleveland streamed himself killing an elderly man. Facebook Live has also seen live-streamed sex abuse, rape, suicide, and child abuse this year."

More than 1,000 people turned out on Sunday night for a walk in support of law enforcement, and donations of cash for the family have topped $150,000 at the gas station and online.', 'Suspect in deputy slaying spent time in mental hospital \n \n HOUSTON - Shannon Jaruay Miles, who is accused of gunning down a sheriff\'s deputy on Friday, spent four months in a mental hospital in 2012 after being declared incompetent to stand trial in an aggravated assault case, court records show. \n \n The revelation offered a possible insight in a case that has so far defied explanation. \n \n Miles, 30, was arrested Saturday on charges of capital murder, accused of shooting Harris County sheriff\'s deputy Darren Goforth outside a northwest Harris County gas station. \n \n As the deputy walked out of the Chevron store, Miles allegedly ran up behind him, put a gun to the back of his head and fired. After the deputy fell, Miles stood over his body and emptied his .40 caliber semi-automatic pistol into the deputy\'s back, shooting 15 rounds, Harris County District Attorney Devon Anderson said Monday. \n \n The chilling allegations, seen by witnesses and caught on surveillance video, left dozens of police officers shaking their heads in disbelief as Miles made his first appearance in a Harris County courtroom on charges of capital murder. \n \n ""They found Deputy Darren Goforth face down in a pool of his own blood,"" Anderson told state District Judge Denise Collins. Anderson later told reporters that her office is looking into charges that were filed against Miles in Travis County. \n \n In that case, Miles was accused of viciously beating up a man at a Salvation Army shelter where he was apparently staying in Austin in 2012. The victim suffered a broken vertebrae. Several months after the alleged assault, Miles was declared mentally incompetent and sent to North Texas State Hospital. He was later returned to competency, according to Travis County records. The assault case was later dismissed. \n \n As theories swirled Monday about why Goforth was killed, court records reveal a long history of run-ins between Miles and police. In two of those crimes, he pleaded guilty to a physical altercation with a police officer. \n \n In 2005, he was charged with failure to identify himself to police officers. No other information about that misdemeanor was available Monday. Three months after that arrest, his mother filed charges against him for throwing a 19-inch television into a 60-inch TV during a fight with her. \n \n She told police they were arguing because the 20-year-old was living at her home and would not get a job, court records show. He spent three days in jail and later pleaded guilty to misdemeanor criminal mischief in exchange for time served. \n \n A few months after that, Miles was charged with resisting arrest, accused of pushing a Harris County sheriff\'s deputy. He pleaded guilty to a class A misdemeanor and was sentenced to eight days in jail. \n \n A year later, he was arrested on New Year\'s Day for unlawful discharge of a firearm. In that case, police took away a 9mm handgun which was later destroyed. In that case, he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor in exchange for 15 days in jail. Months after that arrest, he was sentenced to 10 days in jail after pleading guilty to evading arrest after fleeing a Jersey Village police officer. Just days later, he was arrested for trespassing and sentenced to 10 days behind bars after admitting guilt. \n \n In 2009, he was charged with resisting arrest in a case where he hit a Houston-area police officer. Miles pleaded no contest in exchange for time served after spending six days in jail. \n \n Before ending up in Austin in 2012, Miles attended the University of Houston main campus in the spring of 2011, school officials said. No degree was awarded. \n \n After Miles was arraigned Monday, Anderson said investigators continue to look for a motive for Friday\'s shooting. \n \n ""We\'re going to try to figure out the motive, even though we don\'t have to prove it under Texas law,"" she said. ""Everybody sure would like to know the motive. I\'d love to know where he got the gun and how he got the gun."" \n \n In hushed tones around Houston\'s criminal courthouse, police officers of all stripes echoed Harris County Sheriff Ron Hickman who, on Saturday, connected Goforth\'s death and other violence against law enforcement to anti-police rhetoric across the country. \n \n After Goforth was killed about 8:20 p.m. Friday, police started searching for vehicles matching the description of the gunman\'s truck, a red Ford extended cab with a distinctive trailer hitch. \n \n They found the truck in the driveway of Miles\' house less than a mile from the crime scene. A man at the house said Miles had left with his mother and while police were looking around, Miles came home. \n \n He told police he had two guns, but had recently gotten rid of his 9mm pistol. The other was in a blue bag in his garage. He declined to give police permission to go inside. When they returned with a search warrant, Anderson said, they found the loaded .40 caliber pistol where Miles said it was. \n \n There was also a box of bullets of the same brand used to kill Goforth. \n \n Ballistics experts said the gun was the same one that fired the shots at the gas station, Anderson said. \n \n She said Miles matched the description of the man on the surveillance video, and a witness to the crime later identified Miles as the shooter in a video line-up. \n \n In court Monday, Miles appeared in the yellow jail uniform typically reserved for high-profile inmates. He did not speak except to acknowledge that he understood the charges against him. \n \n The judge kept him in jail without bail and appointed defense attorneys Charles Brown and Anthony Osso who said they are just beginning to investigate the allegations. \n \n ""We\'re going to look at every aspect of this from mental health all the way down,"" Osso said. ""This is not a guy who has a long history of violent offenses."" \n \n Since the shooting, a makeshift memorial at the Chevron where 47-year-old Goforth was killed has overflowed with American flag balloons and flowers. More than 1,000 people attended a vigil for Goforth at the gas station Saturday and Sunday evenings, Anderson said. \n \n She dismissed questions about whether anti-police rhetoric or similar reasons were behind the shooting. \n \n ""People from all races, from all around the county — over 1,000 on both nights — came out to support law enforcement,"" she said. ""This crime is not going to divide us, this crime is going to unite us."" \n \n Anderson personally prosecuted Harlem Lewis last year, who was sentenced to death for the capital murder of Bellaire Police officer Jimmie Norman. Norman and a good samaritan named Terry Taylor were fatally shot during a traffic stop on Christmas Eve, 2012. \n \n Anderson said she had hoped Norman would be Harris County\'s last officer to be killed in the line of duty. \n \n ""I really never wanted to have to do this again,"" she told reporters. ""I can\'t believe Friday night I was out at a scene looking at an officer dead on the ground."" \n \n Goforth had been with the sheriff\'s office for 10 years and was stationed in District 5 in northwest Harris County. He had a wife and two children. On Monday, President Barack Obama released a statement that he had called Goforth\'s widow. \n \n ""On behalf of the American people, I offered Mrs. Goforth my condolences, and told her that Michelle and I would keep her and her family in our prayers,"" he said. ""I also promised that I would continue to highlight the uncommon bravery that police officers show in our communities every single day. They put their lives on the line for our safety. Targeting police officers is completely unacceptable — an affront to civilized society. As I said in my State of the Union Address, we\'ve got to be able to put ourselves in the shoes of the wife who won\'t rest until the police officer she married walks through the door at the end of his shift. That comfort has been taken from Mrs. Goforth. So we must offer her our comfort — and continue to stand up for the safety of police officers wherever they serve."" \n \n Goforth\'s funeral will be 11 a.m. Friday at Second Baptist Church, 6400 Woodway. There is a viewing an hour before.

Suspected gunman Shannon Miles was today in court for the first time, and a prosecutor got even more specific about the circumstances of Goforth's death. ""He unloaded the entire weapon into Deputy Goforth,"" said Harris County DA Devon Anderson of Miles, per NBC News. That was 15 shots: a bullet in the chamber plus a 14-bullet clip. ""They found Deputy Darren Goforth face down in a pool of his own blood,"" continued Anderson, per the Houston Chronicle. She says 15 shell casings were found at the scene, and a .40 caliber handgun recovered from Miles' home proved a match for the bullets that killed Goforth. The Chronicle reports Miles, 30, didn't say much during his appearance, and was dressed in the yellow uniform given to high-profile inmates. He remains in jail without bail. A motive has yet to be given for the shooting. A GoFundMe campaign for Goforth's family (he has two kids) today surpassed its $100,000 goal."

She was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2012. The suit accused Johnson & Johnson of ""negligent conduct"" in making and marketing its baby powder. \n \n ""We are pleased the jury did the right thing,"" said Jim Onder, an attorney for the plaintiff. ""They once again reaffirmed the need for Johnson & Johnson to warn the public of the ovarian cancer risk associated with its product."" \n \n Carol Goodrich, a spokeswoman with Johnson & Johnson, could not immediately be reached for comment.

But two others in New Jersey were thrown out by a judge who said there wasn\'t reliable evidence that talc leads to ovarian cancer, an often fatal but relatively rare form of cancer. Ovarian cancer accounts for about 22,000 of the 1.7 million new cases of cancer expected to be diagnosed in the U.S. this year. \n \n About 2,000 women have filed similar suits, and lawyers are reviewing thousands of other potential cases, most generated by ads touting the two big verdicts out of St. Louis — a $72 million award in February to relatives of an Alabama woman who died of ovarian cancer, and a $55 million award in May to a South Dakota survivor of the disease. \n \n Much research has found no link or a weak one between ovarian cancer and using baby powder for feminine hygiene, and most major health groups have declared talc harmless. Johnson & Johnson, whose baby powder dominates the market, maintains it\'s perfectly safe. \n \n But Onder of the Onder Law Firm in suburban St. Louis, which represented plaintiffs in all three St. Louis cases, cited other research that began connecting talcum powder to ovarian cancer in the 1970s.

Within two minutes, the Dow had dropped 127 points and fallen into the red. It just as quickly rose (you can see this quite clearly in the chart). \n \n Dow Jones Kaitlyn Kiernan reported: \n \n “Stocks briefly erased a 125-point gain after a tweet from the Associated Press Twitter account erroneously claimed that there were two explosions in the White House and that President Barack Obama had been injured.

177,"['On May 22, 2010, Hanyecz asked a fellow enthusiast on a bitcoin forum to accept 10,000 bitcoin for two Papa John\'s Pizzas. At the time, Hanyecz believed that the coins he had ""mined"" on his computer were worth around 0.003 cents each. \n \n Bitcoin mining involves solving a complex mathematical solution with the miner being rewarded in bitcoin. This is how Hanyecz got his initial coins. \n \n The cryptocurrency has many doubters as it continues to be associated with criminal activity, but it has still seen a stunning rally. Here are two facts, on Bitcoin Pizza Day, however, that highlight this: \n \n While being worth $30 at the time, Hanyecz pizzas would now cost $22.5 million at current bitcoin prices. \n \n If you bought $100 of bitcoin at the 0.003 cent price on May 22, 2010, you\'d now be sitting on around $75 million. \n \n A number of factors have been driving the rally: \n \n Recently passed legislation in Japan that allows retailers to start accepting bitcoin as a legal currency has boosted trading in yen, which now accounts for over 40 percent of all bitcoin trade \n \n Political uncertainty globally has driven demand for bitcoin as a safe haven asset \n \n A debate within the bitcoin community about the future of the underlying technology behind bitcoin known as the blockchain has been taking place. There was fear at one point this could lead to the creation of two separate cryptocurrencies but those worries have largely subsided with an alternative, more palatable option now being put forward. \n \n For an in-depth look at the factors driving bitcoin, click here.', 'Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Bitcoin\'s value has fluctuated sharply over the last four years \n \n The value of Bitcoin has hit a new high with each individual coin now worth more than $2,100 (£1,615). \n \n The valuation caps a strong month for the virtual currency, with its value growing by more than 65% in a month. \n \n The steady rise in value is believed to be linked to policy changes in Japan and China that have made it easier for speculators to trade in bitcoins. \n \n Many other virtual currencies have also enjoyed a sustained rise in value over the last few weeks. \n \n Bitcoin first broke the $1,000 (£768) barrier in November 2013 but its value has fluctuated wildly since then. For instance, in early 2014 one bitcoin was worth only $280 (£215). \n \n And at the end of 2016, each one was changing hands for about $900 (£690). \n \n Unsustainable bubble \n \n Bitcoin emerged in 2008 and is a digital currency based around cryptography. Individual coins can be split into smaller denominations and many people involved with the currency use computers to verify the globally-held log, known as the blockchain, of who spent what where. \n \n Verifying transactions involves solving a complicated mathematical problem and the first person to do so gets rewarded with bitcoins. \n \n Rising interest in bitcoin has sparked the creation of many other crypto-currencies. These have proved popular as the technology underlying bitcoin has struggled to cope with its popularity and growth. One estimate suggests bitcoins now make up only 47% of all traded crypto-currencies. \n \n Rivals such as Ethereum and Ripple have been gaining value far faster than bitcoin over the last few months. \n \n The surging valuations has led some commentators to suggest that an unsustainable crypto-currency bubble is developing. \n \n ""The question is not if but when the market will turn,"" said an editorial in The Economist.', 'laszlo \n \n \n \n Offline \n \n \n \n Activity: 199 \n \n Merit: 319 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Full MemberActivity: 199Merit: 319 Pizza for bitcoins?

But don’t do the two simultaneously, unless you want to risk veering off course, according to a study by Stony Brook University researchers. \n \n Although it’s widely accepted that texting and talking on cell phones while driving can lead to accidents, researchers found texting will throw people off course and interfere with memory– even when walking. \n \n Although it may be self-evident that texting while walking will lead to distractions, Stony Brook researchers measured the impact. \n \n Related stories \n \n They said they were looking at how the brain handles, or runs into problems, handling the two simultaneous activities. \n \n “We were surprised to find that talking and texting on a cell phone were so disruptive to one’s gait and memory recall,” said Eric M. Lamberg, co-author of the study and clinical associate professor in the Department of Physical Therapy at Stony Brook University’s School of Health Technology and Management. \n \n The study, by Lamberg and Lisa M. Muratori, a clinical associate professor in Stony Brook’s Department of Physical Therapy, was published in Gait & Posture titled “Cell phones change the way we walk.” \n \n “We were looking at whether texting had more disruptions than talking on a cell phone,” Lamberg said. \n \n Researchers asked participants to walk to a point 8 feet away and then asked them to return and repeat the exercise while texting, as well as talking on cell phones. \n \n The researchers found “gait velocity is reduced when using a cell phone while talking or texting,” that “navigational errors occur when texting while walking” and “texting while walking produces greater interference than talking on a cell phone.” \n \n “Cell phone use among pedestrians leads to increased cognitive distraction, reduced situation awareness and increases in unsafe behavior,” according to the abstract of the study in Gait and Posture online. “Performing a dual-task, such as talking or texting with a cell phone while walking, may interfere with working memory and result in walking errors.” \n \n Participants who texted while walking “veered off course, demonstrating a 61 percent increase in lateral deviation and 13 percent increase in distance traveled.” \n \n Lamberg said this shows the impact such distractions have on walking, an activity that seems automatic. \n \n “We are using the findings to help physical therapy patients improve true functional walking,” he said, noting some tasks may affect their gait or certain aspects of memory. “In rehabilitation, we should use this as a tool to prepare our patients to be more ready to function in a natural environment.” \n \n He said patients going through rehabilitation might even be told to text or talk while walking as they seek to regain their stride. \n \n “We think using dual-task methodology is a way to challenge people during rehabilitation,” Lamberg said, noting, at a minimum, people might be prepared for this dual tasking. “Using cell phone use as part of a gait-training paradigm isn’t common in physical therapy.” \n \n Reports surfaced last year that Philadelphia banned texting while walking, although city officials quashed those rumors. \n \n And texting while walking causes a fair number of collisions, although not like those while driving. \n \n While she was texting while walking last summer in the Berkshire Mall in Reading, Pa., Cathy Cruz Marrero tumbled into the mall fountain. \n \n The video system at the mall, where she worked, captured that moment. The video was posted on YouTube, generating nearly 4 million views. \n \n “We want to raise awareness that a real disruption occurs because of texting,” Lamberg said of the bigger picture. “Texting disrupts your ability much more than does talking.” \n \n Should texting while walking be banned? That’s not the idea behind the research. \n \n “Absolutely not,” Lamberg said. “I think it’s just to raise an awareness to this issue, that it does disrupt your ability to walk naturally.” \n \n More breaking news']",4,"– Monday was Bitcoin Pizza Day, the anniversary of the day in 2010 when developer Laszlo Hanyecz paid 10,000 bitcoins for two pizzas in the online currency's first recognized transaction. The same amount of bitcoins would be worth around $22.5 million now. The currency, which sank to $443 a year ago, is up more than 65% so far this month and has been soaring to record highs, passing $2,000 for the first time over the weekend and breaking through the $2,100 and $2,200 marks on Monday, reports CNBC, which notes that a $100 investment in bitcoins exactly seven years ago would be worth more than $75 million at the $2,251 price it reached Monday. Analysts say several factors are behind the steep rise in the price of the currency, including political uncertainty worldwide and the ironing out of technical issues. Japan has also given bitcoins a big boost with new legislation allowing retailers to accept the currency.

178,"['DALLAS, April 18 A gray and black dress worn by Vivien Leigh in her role as Scarlett O\'Hara in the classic 1939 film ""Gone with the Wind"" sold for $137,000 at an auction in California on Saturday. \n \n The outfit, featuring black appliques, was one of more than 150 items from the film up for auction by Dallas-based Heritage Auctions in Beverly Hills. \n \n The items were part of the private collection of James Tumblin, formerly in charge of the hair and makeup department at Universal Studios. \n \n Tumblin began collecting onscreen costumes, props and behind-the-scenes artifacts from the film in the 1960s, amassing a collection of more than 300,000 pieces of memorabilia, according to Heritage Auction officials. \n \n During a visit to the Western Costume Company he spotted the Scarlett O\'Hara dress on the floor. He learned that the dress was about to be thrown away and negotiated a deal to buy it for $20, according to Heritage Auction. \n \n Tumblin has ""devoted his life and efforts to promoting Hollywood and this film, touring his items throughout the United States,"" Kathleen Guzman, managing director of Heritage Auctions in New York, said in a statement. \n \n Other top selling items from the auction were a straw hat worn by Leigh that sold for $52,500; the trousers and jacket from a suit worn by Clark Gable as Rhett Butler, selling for $55,000; and a black bonnet worn by both Leigh and Olivia De Havilland as Melanie Wilkes, which fetched $30,000. (Editing by Jonathan Kaminsky and Clarence Fernandez)', 'Gone with the Wind pretty much swept the board at the 1940 Oscars. \n \n Now, 75 years later, an impressive collection of memorabilia from one of the most iconic films of the 20th century is up for sale. \n \n The collection assembled by Jim Tumblin, who spent 22 years working at the Universal Studios hair and make-up department, could raise as much as $1 million (£668,000). \n \n In all, more than 150 lots will go under the hammer at the sale being held by Heritage Auctions next month. \n \n Most interest is expected to centre on a dress worn by Vivien Leigh, whose portrayal of Scarlett O’Hara won one of the film’s 10 Oscars. \n \n Bidding will start at $60,000, rather more than the $20 Mr Tumblin paid for the dress in the early 1960s. \n \n Scarlett\'s dress (Hertiage Auctions) \n \n He spotted it while doing some research at Western Costume – a company which has served Hollywood since the days of silent cinema. \n \n “I saw this dress on the floor and a docent told me not to bother to pick it up, because they were throwing it away,” he said. \n \n “I asked if he would sell it to me. I had noticed there was a printed label saying Selznick International Pictures and ‘Scarlett production dress’ was written in ink.” \n \n Bonnie\'s blue riding suit is among the lots (Heritage Auctions) \n \n This modest purchase sowed the seeds for what has become one of the most significant collections of Hollywood memorabilia, now numbering more than 300,000 artefacts. \n \n “Word started going around the studios and people who had relatives who had worked on the film got in touch. \n \n Ashley\'s Confederate suit is up for sale (Heritage Auctions) \n \n ""Then I started getting inter-office memos and phone calls,"" Mr Tumblin added. \n \n “Hollywood was one big family. We all knew each other in the business. \n \n “The collection grew, it was almost like rust – it just never went away.” \n \n It has been something of a labour of love as he has travelled around the US with his collection. Visitors to his exhibitions have included the former US president, Jimmy Carter. \n \n Vivien Leigh wore the dress in several key scenes and it is not the only evocative item up for auction. \n \n There is also Clark Gable’s grey suit which he wore as Rhett Butler in the scene where he kicks down Scarlett O’Hara’s door. \n \n Clark Gable in the suit (Heritage Auctions) \n \n It is in pristine condition. \n \n Also up for sale is Leslie Howard’s tattered Confederate uniform which he wore as Ashley Wilkes when he found his way back to the Tara plantation. \n \n According to Mr Tumblin, in many cases the costumes were hardly cherished at the time, often being left unloved on racks once they had fulfilled their purpose. Others have since been restored, including two owned by the Harry Ransom Centre at the University of Texas, which were displayed at the V&A in 2012. \n \n It is not only costumes from the film which are up for sale. \n \n A presentation script, signed by David O Selznick and belonging to Hattie McDaniel, the first black actress to win an Oscar, is expected to fetch $25,000. \n \n Then there is the typewriter used by Sidney Howard, who wrote the film’s screenplay – for which he earned a posthumous Oscar. \n \n Hattie McDaniel in Gone with the Wind (Rex) \n \n One thing which Mr Tumblin is keeping is Vivien Leigh’s Oscar. \n \n Selling the collection will enable Mr Tumblin to share it with others, he said. \n \n “I am really looking forward to walking through a museum and seeing something that I once owned. \n \n Despite owning so much Gone with the Wind memorabilia, it is not his favourite film of all time – that accolade goes to Stella Dallas, starring Barbara Stanwyck. \n \n “Gone with the Wind is in my all time top 10 films I would watch if I was stranded on a desert island with a generator.”', 'A huge cache of secret US military files today provides a devastating portrait of the failing war in Afghanistan, revealing how coalition forces have killed hundreds of civilians in unreported incidents, Taliban attacks have soared and Nato commanders fear neighbouring Pakistan and Iran are fuelling the insurgency. \n \n The disclosures come from more than 90,000 records of incidents and intelligence reports about the conflict obtained by the whistleblowers\' website WikiLeaks in one of the biggest leaks in US military history. The files, which were made available to the Guardian, the New York Times and the German weekly Der Spiegel, give a blow-by-blow account of the fighting over the last six years, which has so far cost the lives of more than 320 British and more than 1,000 US troops. \n \n Their publication comes amid mounting concern that Barack Obama\'s ""surge"" strategy is failing and as coalition troops hunt for two US naval personnel captured by the Taliban south of Kabul on Friday. \n \n The war logs also detail: \n \n • How a secret ""black"" unit of special forces hunts down Taliban leaders for ""kill or capture"" without trial. \n \n • How the US covered up evidence that the Taliban have acquired deadly surface-to-air missiles. \n \n • How the coalition is increasingly using deadly Reaper drones to hunt and kill Taliban targets by remote control from a base in Nevada. \n \n • How the Taliban have caused growing carnage with a massive escalation of their roadside bombing campaign, which has killed more than 2,000 civilians to date. \n \n In a statement, the White House said the chaotic picture painted by the logs was the result of ""under-resourcing"" under Obama\'s predecessor, saying: ""It is important to note that the time period reflected in the documents is January 2004 to December 2009."" \n \n The White House also criticised the publication of the files by WikiLeaks: ""We strongly condemn the disclosure of classified information by individuals and organisations, which puts the lives of the US and partner service members at risk and threatens our national security. WikiLeaks made no effort to contact the US government about these documents, which may contain information that endanger the lives of Americans, our partners, and local populations who co-operate with us."" \n \n The logs detail, in sometimes harrowing vignettes, the toll on civilians exacted by coalition forces: events termed ""blue on white"" in military jargon. The logs reveal 144 such incidents. \n \n Some of these casualties come from the controversial air strikes that have led to Afghan government protests, but a large number of previously unknown incidents also appear to be the result of troops shooting unarmed drivers or motorcyclists out of a determination to protect themselves from suicide bombers. \n \n At least 195 civilians are admitted to have been killed and 174 wounded in total, but this is likely to be an underestimate as many disputed incidents are omitted from the daily snapshots reported by troops on the ground and then collated, sometimes erratically, by military intelligence analysts. \n \n Bloody errors at civilians\' expense, as recorded in the logs, include the day French troops strafed a bus full of children in 2008, wounding eight. A US patrol similarly machine-gunned a bus, wounding or killing 15 of its passengers, and in 2007 Polish troops mortared a village, killing a wedding party including a pregnant woman, in an apparent revenge attack. \n \n Questionable shootings of civilians by UK troops also figure. The US compilers detail an unusual cluster of four British shootings in Kabul in the space of barely a month, in October/November 2007, culminating in the death of the son of an Afghan general. Of one shooting, they wrote: ""Investigation controlled by the British. We are not able to get [sic] complete story."" \n \n A second cluster of similar shootings, all involving Royal Marine commandos in Helmand province, took place in a six-month period at the end of 2008, according to the log entries. Asked by the Guardian about these allegations, the Ministry of Defence said: ""We have been unable to corroborate these claims in the short time available and it would be inappropriate to speculate on specific cases without further verification of the alleged actions."" \n \n Rachel Reid, who investigates civilian casualty incidents in Afghanistan for Human Rights Watch, said: ""These files bring to light what\'s been a consistent trend by US and Nato forces: the concealment of civilian casualties. Despite numerous tactical directives ordering transparent investigations when civilians are killed, there have been incidents I\'ve investigated in recent months where this is still not happening. \n \n Accountability is not just something you do when you are caught. It should be part of the way the US and Nato do business in Afghanistan every time they kill or harm civilians."" The reports, many of which the Guardian is publishing in full online, present an unvarnished and often compelling account of the reality of modern war. \n \n Most of the material, though classified ""secret"" at the time, is no longer militarily sensitive. A small amount of information has been withheld from publication because it might endanger local informants or give away genuine military secrets. WikiLeaks, whose founder, Julian Assange, obtained the material in circumstances he will not discuss, said it would redact harmful material before posting the bulk of the data on its ""uncensorable"" servers. \n \n WikiLeaks published in April this year a previously suppressed classified video of US Apache helicopters killing two Reuters cameramen on the streets of Baghdad, which gained international attention. A 22-year-old intelligence analyst, Bradley Manning, was arrested in Iraq and charged with leaking the video, but not with leaking the latest material. The Pentagon\'s criminal investigations department continues to try to trace the leaks and recently unsuccessfully asked Assange, he says, to meet them outside the US to help them. Assange allowed the Guardian to examine the logs at our request. No fee was involved and WikiLeaks was not involved in the preparation of the Guardian\'s articles.']",3,"– James Tumblin's 300,000-piece collection of Gone With the Wind memorabilia started with a single gray dress with black appliques that lay crumpled on the floor of the Western Costume Company in Los Angeles in the 1960s. ""A docent told me not to bother to pick it up, because they were throwing it away,"" Tumblin, who once ran the hair and makeup department at Universal Studios, told the Telegraph last month. But ""I had noticed there was a printed label saying Selznick International Pictures, and 'Scarlett production dress' was written in ink,"" he said. ""I asked if he would sell it to me."" He ended up paying just $20 for the costume, worn by Vivien Leigh as Scarlett O'Hara in four scenes of the 1939 film—an incredible bargain considering the dress sold at auction on Saturday for $137,000. The outfit—really a jacket and skirt ensemble—was actually pale blue during filming. But some of the 150 Gone With the Wind pieces sold by Heritage Auctions this weekend remain in pristine condition, including a gray wool suit Clark Gable wore when he kicked down Scarlett O'Hara's boudoir door as Rhett Butler, CNN reports; it sold for $55,000. A straw hat worn by Leigh fetched $52,500, while a black bonnet donned by Leigh and Olivia de Havilland's character Melanie Wilkes sold for $30,000, Reuters reports. Tumblin seems happy to have been able to offer up his pieces, many of which have toured the country. ""I am really looking forward to walking through a museum and seeing something that I once owned,"" he said. He still maintains the largest private collection of Gone With the Wind memorabilia, which includes Leigh's Oscar. (The film almost didn't make it to the screen.)"
179,"['(CNN) A federal criminal investigation into a deadly duck boat sinking on a Missouri lake was initiated after the US Coast Guard determined the 17 deaths resulted from ""misconduct, negligence or inattention to the duties"" by the captain of the duck boat, according to a court document filed Wednesday. \n \n The new investigation also is looking at another duck boat captain and officials at the company that operates the tourist ride, the court document says. \n \n There are several investigations into the July 19 incident, including the state of Missouri, which is also looking into criminal liability, and the National Transportation Safety Board, which is trying to determine what caused the sinking. \n \n Survivors of some of the people who died are, in four cases, suing Ripley Entertainment, which runs the duck boat tours called Ride the Ducks Branson. \n \n On Wednesday, the US government attached a motion to the civil cases, asking that a court rule that federal investigators be allowed first to talk to the pertinent witnesses and participants in the case. \n \n Read More', 'The captains of two Ride the Ducks boats that battled rough waters before one sank last month are targets of a criminal investigation, according to federal court documents filed Wednesday. \n \n Kenneth Scott McKee, captain of the sunken Stretch Duck 07, and Barry King, captain of Stretch Duck 54, “are aware of their status as targets of the Government action,” the document says. They are under investigation for allegedly operating the vessel in a manner that endangered lives. \n \n Seventeen of the 31 passengers on Duck 07 died when the boat sank in Table Rock Lake near Branson on July 19. Duck 54 was also on the water but made it to shore. \n \n The documents filed in U.S. District Court Wednesday also indicate that Ripley Entertainment, which owns the duck boats, is another “target” or “subject” of the investigation. And they say that “several Ripley agents, employees, or officers have been identified as targets and/or subjects of the Government action.” \n \n Digital Access For Only $0.99 For the most comprehensive local coverage, subscribe today. \n \n The U.S. Attorneys’ manual defines a “target” as “a person as to whom the prosecutor or the grand jury has substantial evidence linking him or her to the commission of a crime and who, in the judgment of the prosecutor, is a putative defendant.” A “subject” of an investigation, the manual says, “is a person whose conduct is within the scope of the grand jury’s investigation.” \n \n King’s wife turned to social media after the sinking that night to tell Facebook friends her husband was OK. She wrote that he was also on the lake that night, at the same time, and faced rough weather. \n \n “He said he rode 4 ft waves and prayed,” she said. “He and his passengers rode on angels wings to safety. Our heart aches for the Captain and passengers of the Duck that capsized.” \n \n One woman responded: “So thankful Barry was guided to safety! Definitely on angels wings! Prayers for all.” \n \n The Star repeatedly has attempted to talk with both captains. Those attempts have been unsuccessful. \n \n SHARE COPY LINK Three members of a family describe the duck boat tragedy as seen from the Showboat Branson Belle on Thursday at Table Rock Lake near Branson. \n \n Cellphone video taken from the nearby Showboat Branson Belle, which was docked at the time of the storm, captured the two boats as they struggled in the lake. A viral video of the incident ended right before McKee’s boat went under. He was among the 14 survivors. \n \n The first 911 call about Stretch Duck 07 came at 7:09 p.m., 14 minutes after the boat entered the water that night. \n \n The National Weather Service had issued a severe thunderstorm warning at 6:32 p.m., specifically naming Table Rock Lake. The warning said winds in excess of 60 mph were possible. In reality, winds on the lake reached 73 mph with waves of more than 3 feet. \n \n According to a recent report by the National Transportation Safety Board, the captain and driver were on board at 6:28 that evening when someone stepped onto the back of the boat and told the crew to take the water portion of the tour first. It isn’t known who that person is. The driver, whose job is to steer the duck boat on land, died in the sinking. \n \n The U.S. Coast Guard referred the investigation to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Missouri on Aug. 13 to pursue possible federal criminal charges. That office, based in Kansas City, includes the Table Rock Lake area. \n \n According to the document filed Wednesday, the Coast Guard notified the U.S. Attorney’s Office that its preliminary probable cause determination was that the sinking of Stretch Duck 07 and the loss of lives “resulted from the misconduct, negligence, or inattention to the duties of the captain of the vessel at the time of the sinking, which is a violation of federal criminal law.” \n \n The certificate of inspection for Stretch Duck 07 set stringent guidelines for wind and water conditions. It states that the “vessel shall not be operated waterborne when winds exceed 35 mph, and/or the wave height exceeds two feet.” \n \n The Coast Guard also notified the U.S. Attorney’s Office of its preliminary probable cause determination “that the operation of Stretch Duck 54 on July 19, 2018, was undertaken by the captain of that vessel in a grossly negligent manner that interfered with the safe operation of the vessel and endangered the lives or bodies of persons on board the vessel.” \n \n The federal investigation is being conducted in addition to a separate criminal probe by the Missouri attorney general. \n \n Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley’s office confirmed to The Star on July 30 that it had opened a criminal investigation to explore the possibility of violations of the Missouri Merchandising Practices Act. \n \n The act forbids fraud and deception in the sale of goods and services. \n \n Several lawsuits have been filed in federal and state courts, three on behalf of passengers who died and one on behalf of a survivor. Another was filed earlier this month by a man who jumped in the lake to try to help pull passengers to safety. \n \n The latest suit was filed Aug. 20 in U.S. District Court by the daughter of William Asher, a St. Louis man who died in the tragedy. Jennifer Asher alleges that Ripley Entertainment “took the lives of seventeen people when it made the conscious decision to disregard the known dangers of its vehicles in volatile weather and instructed its employees to begin their excursion on the water.” \n \n Wednesday’s filing asked the court to put a hold on the discovery process for all lawsuits until the criminal investigation is complete. Prosecutors say the action is necessary to prevent civil lawsuits from interfering with a federal probe. \n \n Ripley spokeswoman Suzanne Smagala-Potts said last week that the company was cooperating fully with federal and state authorities. \n \n “We are providing all documentation and materials requested in the case,” she said in an email to The Star. “However, as a party to the ongoing NTSB investigation, we are refrained from commenting to the media on the matters being investigated.” \n \n The court documents filed Wednesday, however, cite a federal law regarding negligence or misconduct when operating a vessel. \n \n According to that law: “Every captain, engineer, pilot, or other person employed on any steamboat or vessel, by whose misconduct, negligence, or inattention to his duties on such vessel the life of any person is destroyed ... shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both.”', 'SHARE THIS ARTICLE Share Tweet Post Email \n \n In a 2007 purchase of medicines from Merck KGaA, drugmaker Mylan picked up a decades-old product, the EpiPen auto injector for food allergy and bee-sting emergencies. Management first thought to divest the aging device, which logged only $200 million in revenue. Then Heather Bresch, now Mylan’s chief executive officer, hit on the idea of using old-fashioned marketing in part to boost sales among concerned parents of children with allergies. That started EpiPen, which delivers about $1 worth of the hormone epinephrine, on a run that’s resulted in its becoming a $1 billion-a-year product that clobbers its rivals and provides about 40 percent of Mylan’s operating profits, says researcher ABR|Healthco. EpiPen margins were 55 percent in 2014, up from 9 percent in 2008, ABR|Healthco estimates. \n \n Photo illustration: 731 \n \n How Mylan pulled that off is a textbook case in savvy branding combined with a massive public awareness campaign on the dangers of child allergies. Along the way, EpiPen’s wholesale price rose roughly 400 percent from about $57 each when Mylan acquired the product. “They have done a tremendous job of taking an asset that nobody thought you could do much with and making it a blockbuster product,” says Jason Gerberry, a Leerink Partners analyst. \n \n But while EpiPen has given countless parents a sense of security that their children can go out in the world safely, the device’s soaring price—up 32 percent in the past year alone—has forced some families to make difficult choices in order to afford the life-saving medicine. The price increases are among the biggest of any top-selling brand drug, according to DRX, a unit of Connecture that tracks drug pricing. After insurance company discounts, a package of two EpiPens costs about $415, DRX says. By comparison, in France, where Meda sells the drug, two EpiPens cost about $85. “There is a danger with that,” says George Sillup, chairman of the pharmaceutical and health-care marketing department at Saint Joseph’s University. If the company raises the price too much, “that could create some backlash.” \n \n The company sees it differently. “Mylan has worked tirelessly over the past years advocating for increased anaphylaxis awareness, preparedness, and access to treatment,” Mylan spokeswoman Nina Devlin said in a statement. She said the company doesn’t control final retail prices for EpiPen and offers coupons that eliminate co-pays for most patients. Bresch declined to comment for this story. \n \n The CEO has made no secret of her strategy to increase demand for EpiPens by getting them stocked for emergency use in more schools and other public places. (So-called entity prescriptions allow for this.) “We are continuing to open up new markets, new access with public entity legislation that would allow restaurants and hotels and really anywhere you are congregating, there should be access to an EpiPen,” Bresch said at a conference on Sept. 17. \n \n Over the past seven years, Mylan has hired consultants who had worked with Medtronic to get defibrillators stocked in public places. Bresch, the daughter of Senator Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), turned to Washington for help. Along with patient groups, Mylan pushed for federal legislation encouraging states to stock epinephrine devices in schools. \n \n CEO Bresch Photographer: Chris Goodney/Bloomberg \n \n In 2010 new federal guidelines said patients who had severe allergic reactions should be prescribed two epinephrine doses, and soon after Mylan stopped selling single pens in favor of twin-packs. At the time, 35 percent of prescriptions were for single EpiPens. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration had changed label rules to allow the devices to be marketed to anyone at risk, rather than only those who’d already had an anaphylaxis reaction. “Those were both big events that we’ve started to capitalize on,” Bresch said in October 2011. \n \n In 2013, the year following the widely publicized death of a 7-year-old girl at a school in Virginia after an allergic reaction to peanuts, Congress passed legislation encouraging states to have epinephrine devices on hand in schools. Now 47 states require or encourage schools to stock the devices. \n \n Since 2012, Mylan has helped popularize its brand by handing out free EpiPens to more than 59,000 schools. Last year it signed a deal with Walt Disney to stock EpiPens in Disney’s theme parks and on cruise ships. And Mylan spent $35.2 million on EpiPen TV ads in 2014, up from $4.8 million in 2011, according to researcher Nielsen. Mylan disputes the ad spending figures but declines to offer alternatives. \n \n In part because of Mylan’s efforts, the number of patients using EpiPen has grown 67 percent over the past seven years. Many kids with allergies own multiple sets, for school and home. And for doctors, who write prescriptions for the name they know best, the EpiPen brand “is like Kleenex,” says Robert Wood, a pediatric allergist at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. \n \n So far rivals haven’t been able to break Mylan’s market grip. Sanofi’s Auvi-Q, introduced in 2013, is in the shape of a credit card and—unlike EpiPen—gives step-by step audio instructions. But Sanofi priced Auvi-Q about the same as EpiPen, and the product struggled initially to gain insurance coverage. Sanofi says 9 out of 10 patients with commercial insurance can now receive coverage for Auvi-Q prescriptions. Yet in the first half of 2015, EpiPen had about an 85 percent share of epinephrine prescriptions vs. only 10 percent for Auvi-Q, according to Symphony Health Solutions data compiled by Bloomberg. \n \n Still, allergy sufferers without generous health benefits feel the pain. Denise Ure, a social worker in Seattle, has a peanut allergy so severe that the last time she ingested a nut crumb in 2011, she needed three EpiPens and was hospitalized. Ure says she cried last year when she found out a prescription for two EpiPens would cost her about $350. “I was terrified because there’s this life-saving medicine that I needed, and I couldn’t afford it,” she says. Ure now carries two EpiPens she got in Canada, where they cost about half as much. \n \n The biggest threat to EpiPen could come from Teva Pharmaceutical Industries. It settled a patent lawsuit in 2012 allowing it to market a generic version of EpiPen as early as this year, if it wins FDA approval. Mylan isn’t too worried. Predicted Bresch in August: “You would not see the traditional market loss because of just the brand equity with EpiPen.” \n \n The bottom line: When Mylan bought EpiPen in 2007, the devices had $200 million in annual sales. Today revenue exceeds $1 billion. \n \n (This story updated the graphic to show a more accurate usage of the EpiPen.) \n \n (This story updated the graphic to show a more accurate usage of the EpiPen.)']",3,"– The duck boat sinking that killed 17 on a Missouri lake is now the subject of a federal criminal investigation after the Coast Guard found probable cause for negligence. The US Attorney's Office for the Western District of Missouri is seeking to delay civil lawsuits over the July 19 incident until the end of its ""wide-ranging"" investigation to prevent revealing evidence too early, though two boat captains already know themselves to be targets. Per the Springfield News-Leader, the Coast Guard found probable cause for ""misconduct, negligence, or inattention to the duties of the captain"" by Kenneth McKee of Ride the Ducks Branson's sunken Stretch Duck 07, and also probable cause that Barry King acted in a ""grossly negligent manner"" while operating Stretch Duck 54, which made it to safety. The Branson area had been under a severe thunderstorm warning for 20 minutes before Stretch Duck 07 entered Table Rock Lake, where 73mph winds whipped up waves more than three feet high. Per the Wichita Eagle, the boat wasn't to be operated in winds exceeding 35mph or waves exceeding two feet. Civil cases also accuse Ride the Ducks Branson, owned by Ripley Entertainment, of putting passengers at risk through use of boat canopies, citing a National Transportation Safety Board recommendation to remove them following a 1999 tragedy. The NTSB is also investigating this case, along with the state, per CNN. ""We continue to fully cooperate,"" Ripley says in a statement, adding ""we are providing all documentation and materials requested in the case."""

Zuckerberg and Chan are making the grant from their fund at the nonprofit Silicon Valley Community Foundation. \n \n Also on Tuesday, the World Health Organization said West Africa could see up to 10,000 new Ebola cases a week within two months and confirmed that the death rate in the current outbreak is now 70 percent.

(Associated Press) \n \n Protect Environmental workers move disposal barrels to a staging area outside the apartment of a healthcare worker who treated Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan and tested positive for the disease, Monday,... (Associated Press) \n \n About 70 staff members at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital were involved in the care of Thomas Eric Duncan after he was hospitalized, including a nurse now being treated for the same Ebola virus that killed the Liberian man who was visiting Dallas, according to medical records his family provided to The Associated Press. \n \n The size of the medical team reflects the hospital\'s intense effort to save Duncan\'s life, but it also suggests that many other people could have been exposed to the virus during Duncan\'s time in an isolation unit. \n \n On Monday, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the infection of the nurse means the agency must broaden the pool of people getting close monitoring. Authorities have said they do not know how 26-year-old nurse Nina Pham was infected, but they suspect some kind of breach in the hospital\'s protocol. \n \n The medical records given to the AP offer clues, both to what happened and who was involved, but the hospital said the CDC does not have them. \n \n A CDC spokeswoman said the agency reviewed the medical records with Duncan\'s care team and concluded that the documents were not helpful in identifying those who interacted directly with the patient. \n \n ""This is not something we can afford to experiment with. We need to get this right,"" said Ruth McDermott-Levy, who directs the Center for Global and Public Health in Villanova University\'s College of Nursing. \n \n Until now, the CDC has been actively monitoring 48 people who might have had contact with Duncan after he fell ill with an infection but before he was put in isolation. The number included 10 people known to have contact and 38 who may have had contact, including people he was staying with and health care professionals who attended to him during an emergency room visit from which he was sent home. None is sick. \n \n The CDC has not yet established a firm number of health care workers who had contact with Duncan. \n \n ""If this one individual was infected — and we don\'t know how — within the isolation unit, then it is possible that other individuals could have been infected as well,"" said Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the CDC. ""We do not today have a number of such exposed people or potentially exposed health care workers. It\'s a relatively large number, we think in the end."" \n \n Caregivers who began treating Duncan after he tested positive for Ebola were following a ""self-monitoring regimen"" in which they were instructed to take their temperatures regularly and report any symptoms. But they were not considered at high risk. Pham went to the hospital Friday night after she took her temperature and found she had a fever. \n \n Typically, the nurses, doctors and technicians caring for a contagious patient in isolation would be treating other people as well, and going home to their families after decontaminating themselves. The hospital has refused to answer questions about their specific duties. \n \n The 1,400-plus pages of medical records show that nurses, doctors and other hospital employees wore face shields, double gowns, protective footwear and even hazmat suits to avoid touching any of Duncan\'s bodily fluids. Ebola spreads through direct contact with those fluids, usually blood, feces and vomit. The virus has also been detected in urine, semen and breast milk, and it may be in saliva and tears. \n \n CDC officials said there were chinks in that protection at Texas Presbyterian, but they have not identified them and are investigating. \n \n ""Patient had large, extremely watery diarrhea,"" a nurse wrote in a report filed the day Duncan tested positive. \n \n Another nurse noted that Duncan\'s urine was ""darker in color with noted blood streaks."" \n \n It was unclear from the records released to the AP how many of the approximately 70 individuals involved in Duncan\'s care had direct contact with his body or fluids. \n \n Dr. Aileen Marty, a World Health Organization doctor who recently returned to Florida International University after a month fighting Ebola in Nigeria, said no amount of protection is going to help if hospital workers do not put on and take off their protective layers carefully. \n \n ""The first thing in caring for someone with Ebola is to do everything in your power to never become a victim,"" she said. \n \n And tracking all contacts, even within the medical setting, is complicated. \n \n Generally, the first step in locating care providers for isolated infected patients is a personnel log on the door, ""that should have everyone going in and out, signing in and out,"" said Dr. Lisa Esolen, Geisinger Health System\'s Medical Director of Health Services and Infection Prevention and Control. Medical records indicate the Dallas hospital had a log. \n \n On the day before Duncan died, records indicate that at least nine caregivers entered and exited the room. \n \n A spokesman for Texas Health Resources, the hospital\'s parent company, said the CDC probably has a log from the room door that would list everyone who got close to Duncan. \n \n Dr. Christopher Ohl, who heads Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center\'s infectious-disease department and has worked with the CDC in the past, said the expanding monitoring ""is an abundance of caution that\'s probably beyond what needs to be done"" because medical caregivers will notice if they\'re getting a fever, and they\'re not contagious until that point. \n \n ""You start to know when you get those body aches and headaches, most people know that,"" he said.

181,"['Resources Thank the PFMC for Protecting the West Coast Ecosystem \n \n The Pacific coast of North America supports one of the most vibrant and diverse marine ecosystems on Earth, largely because of the presence of thick schools of small prey fish such as Pacific sardines. Unfortunately, this crucial forage fish appears to be in the midst of a severe population decline. Its absence will be felt by dozens of species of West Coast seabirds, whales, sharks, dolphins, and commercially important fish such as salmon and tuna that depend on sardines as a major food source. In addition, because sardines have been a staple of commercial purse-seine fishing on the West Coast, their decline raises the potential for fishing pressure to shift to similar, but more abundant, schooling species of forage fish. \n \n \n \n The Pacific Fishery Management Council, which manages fishing in federal waters off California, Oregon, and Washington, should do two things to help maintain a healthy Pacific Ocean: \n \n Set conservative catch limits on sardines when the population is so low. \n \n Fulfill its September 2013 commitment to prohibit unregulated fishing on forage fish species such as sand lance, saury, and lanternfish that are not currently managed or monitored. \n \n \n \n Cause for concern \n \n Populations of forage fish along the West Coast fluctuate widely, so a species can be abundant one year and dwindle unexpectedly the next. That’s because forage fish are highly dependent on the upwelling of cold nutrient- rich waters to stimulate the growth of phytoplankton, their primary food source. \n \n The Pacific sardine fishery, immortalized in John Steinbeck’s novel Cannery Row, collapsed notoriously the 1950s. The November 2013 population estimate of 378,000 tons is the lowest in more than a decade, far below the peak of 1.5 million tons estimated in 2000 and a major decline by historical standards. Geological records of fish scales deposited off Southern California indicate that the unfished sardine population fluctuated naturally between a low of 400,000 tons to as much as 16 million tons. \n \n \n \n Keeping an eye on the big picture \n \n Forage fish account for more than one-third of the global catch of marine fish and are mostly used for industrial purposes such as feed for livestock, poultry, and farmed fish rather than being directly eaten by people. Most forage fish landed on the West Coast are exported for purposes such as bait in tuna longlining in Asia or as feed for farmed fish. In 2012, the Lenfest Forage Fish Task Force, a group of eminent scientists from around the world, calculated that forage fish worldwide are worth twice as much when left in the water—about $11.3 billion—as they are when caught because of their value as food for commercially important predators. \n \n For further information, please visit: pewenvironment.org/pacificfish \n \n \n \n Write the Pacific Fishery Management Council at: pfmc.comments@noaa.gov', 'Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive. Flowing in every day, these data are added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period.']",2,"– The West Coast sardine population was down 72% since 2006 per a fall assessment—the worst crash since the mid-20th century, and one with far-reaching implications, particularly since the steep decline is expected to continue. One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing. Last month, Pew Charitable Trusts warned that dozens of species, including whales, sharks, dolphins, salmon, and tuna, could feel an impact."
182,"['Seattle-based Investigative Reporter Chris Halsne (KIROTV- CBS- COX MEDIA GROUP) just returned from El Salvador, where he interviewed a U.S. government subcontractor who worked extensively with the Secret Service advance team (snipers, K-9 and explosives sweeps) in San Salvador prior to President Obama’s trip there in March of 2011. \n \n The eyewitness says he joined about a dozen Secret Service agents and a few U.S. military specialists at a strip club in San Salvador a few days before President Obama and his family arrived in El Salvador to meet with its new president, Mauricio Funes. \n \n This source witnessed the majority of the men drink heavily (""wasted,"" ""heavily intoxicated"") at the strip club. He says most of the Secret Service ""advance-team"" members also paid extra for access to the VIP section of the club where they were provided a number of sexual favors in return for their cash. Although our source says he told the agents it was a ""really bad idea"" to take the strippers back to their hotel rooms, several agents bragged that they ""did this all the time"" and ""not to worry about it."" Our source says at least two agents had escorts check into their rooms. It is unclear whether the escorts who returned to the hotels were some of the strippers from the same club. \n \n These alleged incidents in El Salvador occurred a full year prior to recent revelations that secret service agents used prostitutes in Cartagena, Colombia, on a presidential trip this month. \n \n To further confirm information provided about behaviors in El Salvador that reportedly occurred in March of 2011, Halsne interviewed the owner of the San Salvador strip club in which the subcontractor said they visited. The strip club’s owner confirmed a large number of U.S. secret service agents (and some military escorts) “descended on his club” that week prior to President Obama’s visit. He claims agents were there at least three nights in a row. ""No surprise to me."" The owner told Halsne his club routinely takes care of high-ranking employees of the U.S. embassy in San Salvador as well as visiting FBI and DEA agents. The owner says his reputation for ""security"" and ""privacy"" makes him a popular strip club owner with ""those who want to be discreet."" He told Halsne during a lengthy interview, he doesn’t allow prostitution inside the club and that all his ""girls"" are at least 18-years-old. He says the girls can do what they want after work, but he discourages them from making contact with customers at other locations. \n \n This investigation is still fast-developing. Halsne has names of some of the agents allegedly involved in the partying and has viewed records which add credibility to the subcontractor’s eyewitness testimony. KIRO-TV is currently writing and editing-together a series of television stories for air beginning at 5 p.m. on Thursday, April 26.', 'ADVERTISEMENT \n \n The station also interviewed the owner of the strip club, who corroborated the allegations.

183,"['COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Gov. John Kasich on Wednesday announced he has postponed Ronald Phillips\' execution date until next summer in order to investigate whether the convicted killer\'s organs can be donated to family members. \n \n The governor\'s decision came one day before the 40-year-old Summit County man was scheduled to be put to death under a newly approved lethal-injection drug cocktail. \n \n Phillips, sentenced to death in 1993 for raping and killing the 3-year-old daughter of his girlfriend, sought the delay in order to see whether he would be a viable organ donor to his mother, who has kidney disease, and his sister, who has a heart condition, according to the Associated Press. \n \n Phillips is also willing to donate organs to other people if he couldn\'t help his relatives, his attorney, Lisa Lagos, told the AP. Lagos said the request wasn\'t a delaying tactic but an attempt by Phillips to make a final gesture for good. \n \n The Department of Rehabilitation and Correction had denied Phillips\' request earlier this week, citing logistics and security concerns, according to the AP. \n \n The DRC isn\'t aware of any other time that an Ohio death-row inmate has made an organ donation, according to spokeswoman JoEllen Smith. However, Smith noted that it has happened in other states such as California. \n \n In a statement, Kasich said he realized the situation ""is a bit of uncharted territory"" for Ohio. \n \n ""But if another life can be saved by his willingness to donate his organs and tissues, then we should allow for that to happen,"" he said. \n \n Under DRC policy, state prison officials will conduct the initial compatibility tests. \n \n If a transplant of any non-vital organs is feasible, Phillips would undergo an operation at Ohio State University Medical Center before returning to death row, the governor\'s office said in a release. His execution has been rescheduled for July 2, 2014 at Southern Ohio Correctional Facility in Lucasville. \n \n Phillips\' execution has drawn increased attention because he was scheduled to be the first person put to death in Ohio using a new and untried lethal-injection cocktail consisting of midazolam, a sedative, and hydromorphone, a morphine derivative. \n \n The new method was announced last month because of a shortage of pentobarbital caused by European manufacturers\' reluctance to sell the drug for executions. \n \n With Phillips\' execution postponed, Dennis McGuire may become the first inmate put to death using the new cocktail. McGuire, a Preble County man convicted of raping, choking and stabbing a pregnant woman in 1989, is scheduled to die Jan. 16, 2014. \n \n Under the DRC\'s new protocol, the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility warden must notify department Director Gary Mohr within 14 days of McGuire\'s execution date whether he has enough pentobarbital to carry out the execution or if the new cocktail must be employed instead.', 'Convicted child-killer Ronald Phillips was in the Death House and had ordered his last meal when he got the word yesterday: Gov. John Kasich had postponed his execution set for today to determine whether his “nonvital” organs could be harvested as he requested. \n \n His execution now is scheduled for July 2. \n \n “His first words were, ‘God is good.’ He feels immense gratitude to the governor,” said Tim Sweeney, the condemned man’s Cleveland attorney. \n \n Kasich’s action is unprecedented in the nation in the case of an imminent execution, a death-penalty expert said. \n \n The Republican governor said he halted Phillips’ execution “so that medical experts can assess whether Phillips’ nonvital organs or tissues can be donated to his mother or possibly others.” \n \n “Ronald Phillips committed a heinous crime for which he will face the death penalty,” Kasich said in a statement less than 18 hours before the condemned man was to be lethally injected using two drugs never before used in combination. “I realize this is a bit of uncharted territory for Ohio, but if another life can be saved by his willingness to donate his organs and tissues, then we should allow for that to happen.” \n \n The governor said if Phillips “is found to be a viable donor to his mother or possibly others awaiting transplants of nonvital organs, such as kidneys, the procedures would be performed and then he would be returned to Death Row to await his new execution date.” \n \n There was no immediate comment from Akron Prosecutor Sherry Bevan Walsh, who handled the case. \n \n Phillips, 40, was to be executed at 10 a.m. today at the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility near Lucasville for the 1993 beating, rape and murder of 3-year-old Sheila Marie Evans, the daughter of his girlfriend at the time. He had exhausted all legal appeals and was moved yesterday to the Lucasville prison, where executions take place. Last night, he was returned to Death Row at the Chillicothe Correctional Institution. \n \n Sweeney said his client was motivated “by love for his mom and for the desire to do something good. He’s been very remorseful for what he did, thoughtful and reflective over the past couple weeks.” \n \n He wants to donate a kidney to his mother, who is on dialysis treatment for kidney disease, but is willing to donate to others if that is not possible. \n \n Sweeney said he wasn’t sure what Phillips can donate, but he said it might include his kidneys, lungs, liver or bone marrow. \n \n Prisons policy requires that the cost of transplant surgery be paid by Phillips or the organ recipients, not by Ohio taxpayers, spokeswoman JoEllen Smith said. The policy also requires that Phillips’ surgery be performed at the Wexner Medical Center at Ohio State University. \n \n It is the first time in the United States that an execution was stopped to permit an inmate’s organs to be harvested, said Richard Dieter of the Death Penalty Information Center in Washington, D.C. He said a Delaware inmate, Steven Shelton, was allowed to donate his kidney in 2005, but he was not facing immediate execution. \n \n Phillips had ordered, but did not have time to eat, his “last meal,” which included pizza with mushrooms, onions and double cheese, spaghetti, corn chips, Dr Pepper, rocky road ice cream and Oreo cheese cake. \n \n ajohnson@dispatch.com \n \n @ohioaj', 'A veteran city firefighter\'s refusal to respond to the Jan. 8 shooting spree, citing ""political bantering,"" may have slowed his Tucson Fire Department unit\'s response to the incident that left six dead and 13 wounded, city memos show. \n \n The firefighter, Mark Ekstrum, retired from his 28-year career two days later, while his supervisors were still considering how to discipline him, internal memos obtained by the Arizona Daily Star in a public-records request show. \n \n In a Jan. 9 report on Ekstrum\'s actions, fire Capt. Ben Williams wrote that when Ekstrum first told him he would not go out on the call, ""he mentioned something about \'political bantering\' and he did not want to be part of it."" He said he was acting ""for the good of the crew."" \n \n Williams said he told Ekstrum he could not refuse a call for that reason, and then talked to the firefighter privately in his office. He said Ekstrum ""started to say something about how he had a much different political viewpoint than the rest of the crew and he was concerned."" Despite being told that was not acceptable, Williams said Ekstrum informed him he was going home ""sick,"" so they answered the call without him. \n \n In a statement provided to the Fire Department late Wednesday, after he was contacted by the Star about the incident, Ekstrum said he was distraught over the shootings and had no problem with U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who is recovering from a bullet wound to the brain, and even voted for her in the last election. \n \n Ekstrum was on duty at a station on the far southeast side and was part of a team specially trained to handle large medical emergencies. While the crew was not among those called first to the shooting scene - they were not dispatched until about 90 minutes after the shootings - a memo from Ekstrum\'s supervisor said his actions caused ""confusion and delay"" in the emergency circumstances. The department previously sent several paramedic units to the Safeway at North Oracle Road and West Ina Road. \n \n The Fire Department later backtracked from that statement, saying Ekstrum\'s actions caused delay during the preparatory process, but did not cause a delay of the actual call. \n \n However, one of the fire engines had to stop at another fire station to pick up personnel to take Ekstrum\'s place. \n \n Crews at Tucson Fire\'s Station 6,10251 S. Wilmot Road, were dispatched at 12:03 p.m. Jan. 8, seven minutes after the last patient arrived at the hospital, said Joe Gulotta, an assistant fire chief. They responded as a support crew, in a non-emergency way with the Metropolitan Medical Response System (MMRS), a large delivery truck with tents, medical supplies, water and cots, used after the shootings to assist those who were not seriously injured. \n \n Williams said he told Ekstrum they all have differences, but they put those differences aside and respond as professionals, the memo said. However, Ekstrum said ""I\'m leaving, I am going home,"" the memo said, and Williams said at that time he realized arguing was pointless and time was wasting so he told Ekstrum to go. \n \n After the crew returned from the call, Ekstrum was waiting at the station with his wife and asked if he could come in to apologize to the crew, the memo said. The crew accepted his apology, and then Williams talked in his office with Ekstrum and his wife. \n \n ""He stated that there were underlying issues regarding the call that brought up a lot of anger and made him ineffective as a firefighter,"" the memo said. ""I told him that as his captain I had lost confidence in his future ability to perform his duties. He stated that he felt this call was unique and did not think this would happen again."" \n \n When contacted at his house Wednesday, and later by telephone, Ekstrum declined to comment. \n \n However, in the statement he submitted to the department late Wednesday - a statement the department was not expecting - he said he was distraught over the shootings and was ""distracted to the point of not being able to perform my routine station duties to such an extent that I seriously doubted my ability to focus on an emergency call."" \n \n He said he failed to effectively communicate that was the reason he needed to go home and ""my communication centered more on how this event would affect the country and them and us, and, of course, led to their misunderstanding about my need to go home because I was at a point of distraction."" \n \n Ekstrum said he realized the next day, ""I had crossed a line with myself in relation to our citizens. I should have been there, regardless of how responsible I was attempting to be from the standpoint of distraction."" \n \n Ekstrum said he decided to retire right then, without knowing that the Tucson Fire Department was starting a disciplinary action against him. \n \n He said in his statement that he voted for Giffords in the last election, and spoke with her early on in her tenure about a communication vehicle that TFD had for mass-casualty incidents. ""She asked many pertinent and intelligent questions,"" Ekstrum said. ""She has always impressed me as a person that was willing to listen."" \n \n Ekstrum has been registered as an independent since 1999, Pima County Recorder\'s Office records show, after being registered as a Democrat for the previous 17 years. He did not appear to be very politically active. The records show he hadn\'t voted in a primary election in 28 years and his name couldn\'t be found in campaign finance records as a donor. \n \n Williams recommended a 20-day suspension, the maximum sanction for a first time offense.

He appeared to be referring to text messages the Justice Department provided Congress this week in which a senior agent described candidate Trump as an ""idiot"" and made other political remarks in the course of the presidential campaign. \n \n Trump\'s comments are the latest in a barrage of criticism he has directed at the FBI. Earlier this month, he declared on Twitter that the bureau\'s reputation is ""in Tatters — worst in History!"" \n \n That assessment came days after special counsel Robert Mueller, who is leading the Russia investigation, secured a guilty plea from Trump\'s first national security adviser, Michael Flynn. \n \n Trump opened the door Friday to pardoning Flynn. \n \n ""I don\'t want to talk about pardons with Michael Flynn — yet,"" Trump said. ""We\'ll see what happens. Let\'s see."" \n \n Flynn has not been sentenced and appears to be a cooperating witness as part of Mueller\'s Russia probe. Trump called the investigation a ""Democrat hoax,"" ""an excuse for losing the election"" and claimed again ""there is absolutely no collusion."" \n \n toggle caption Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images \n \n Later, White House lawyer Ty Cobb said, ""There is no consideration at the White House of a pardon for Michael Flynn."" \n \n Trump\'s remarks on his way to Quantico, Va., carried new potency given the president\'s audience Friday morning: the latest graduating class at the FBI\'s National Academy for law enforcement managers. \n \n In his speech, the president refrained from attacking the FBI. He made only passing references to the bureau in his remarks before U.S. and international law enforcement officers who were graduating from a program at the FBI\'s prestigious training center. \n \n Instead, Trump\'s speech focused on his ""law and order"" agenda, and he echoed comments Attorney General Jeff Sessions has frequently made since Inauguration Day: The administration backs the police. \n \n ""With me as your president, America\'s police will have a true friend and loyal champion in the White House. More loyal that anyone else can be,"" Trump said. ""You very rarely get the recognition you deserve."" \n \n He promised to work with law enforcement to crack down on drug cartels and gangs, such as MS-13, whose members he referred to as ""savages."" \n \n ""We\'ll get rid of them completely, very soon, right?"" Trump said as he turned and pointed to Sessions. ""To any member of MS-13 listening: We will find you; we will arrest you; we will jail you; we will throw you the hell out of the country."" \n \n While Trump refrained from criticizing the FBI in his speech, his comments earlier in the day hung over his appearance in Quantico — and dominated TV news coverage leading up to his address. \n \n That is because it\'s unusual for a president to blast the bureau — the premier law enforcement agency in the country. \n \n In fact, over the past 15 years, it has been the other way around. President Barack Obama famously visited bureau headquarters a few months after he took office in 2009, donning an FBI baseball cap and sharing ""the thanks of a grateful nation."" A year earlier, President George W. Bush praised ""the character and courage of those who carry the badge."" \n \n The appearance at the FBI had already promised to be complicated for Trump, given his record of derogatory public statements and negative tweets about the FBI this year. \n \n Recently, Trump tweeted that the FBI\'s reputation was in ""Tatters - worst in History!"" He called popular former FBI Director James Comey, whom he fired in May, ""a liar"" and ""a leaker."" Trump also accused the FBI, without providing any evidence, of illegally wiretapping Trump Tower in 2016. And he continues to cast doubt on a conclusion by the bureau and other intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in last year\'s presidential election. \n \n On Friday morning, Trump reaffirmed to reporters, ""there is absolutely no collusion. I didn\'t make a phone call to Russia. I have nothing to do with Russia. Everybody knows it. That was a Democrat hoax. It was an excuse for losing the election."" \n \n Another source of awkwardness: the FBI\'s longtime former leader, Mueller, is the man running the ongoing special counsel probe into election interference — and into whether anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign took part. So far, Mueller\'s team has secured indictments against Paul Manafort, Trump\'s onetime campaign chairman, and won guilty pleas from a campaign foreign policy official and Flynn. \n \n That last development, on Dec. 1, prompted a new wave of attacks from Trump and his supporters on the integrity of the FBI and the Justice Department, fueled by the disclosure that the Justice Department Inspector General had uncovered text messages in which a senior agent working on the Russia probe had called Trump an ""idiot"" during the campaign. \n \n While Mueller removed the agent from the investigation months ago, one of Trump\'s lawyers, Jay Sekulow, has cited the matter to call for a second special counsel to investigate conflicts of interest at the bureau. \n \n In response to a stream of harsh criticism this month, the FBI Agents Association mounted a rare public defense. \n \n ""Every day, FBI special agents put their lives on the line to protect the American public from national security and criminal threats,"" President Tom O\'Connor tweeted. ""Agents perform their duties with unwavering integrity and professionalism and a focus on complying with the law and the Constitution. This is why the FBI continues to be the premier law enforcement agency in the world."" \n \n Trump\'s pick to lead the FBI, former Justice Department official Christopher Wray, also raised his voice to defend the workforce in congressional testimony last week. \n \n ""Let me start by saying that it is for me the honor of a lifetime to be here representing the men and women of the FBI,"" Wray said. ""There is no finer institution than the FBI and no finer people than the men and women who work there and are its very beating heart."" \n \n Trump appeared on stage with Wray to welcome the new class of National Academy graduates at what is known as the agency\'s ""police training center."" \n \n The program puts attendees through a series of academic and physical challenges, building partnerships between police and the FBI. Nearly 10 years ago, Mueller told an FBI graduating class at Quantico, ""For the past 100 years, the FBI has stood for the best of America."" \n \n It remains to be seen whether the new president agrees.', 'President Donald Trump gestures to the crowd at the FBI National Academy graduation ceremony, Friday, Dec. 15, 2017, in Quantico, Va.

185,"['Many news organizations will make election integrity issues a central part of their coverage plans, especially given accusations by the U.S. government of Russian cyber espionage and Donald Trump’s evidence-less allegations of vote tampering and rigging. | AP Photo Media launches joint war-room to spot voting problems To covering 2016’s voting obstacles and hoaxes, press tries sharing tips, sources and data across typically competing newsrooms. \n \n After spending 2016 trying to outmaneuver each other and deliver the next big break, hundreds of newsrooms are now engaged in unprecedented reporting partnerships to uncover barriers to voting and debunk fake news that can cause chaos and confusion on Election Day. \n \n The biggest of the new alliances is Electionland, a project involving more than 400 newsrooms across the country casting aside competitiveness to share real-time data and tips on everything from reports about long lines and voter intimidation to hoax tweets suggesting stuffed ballot boxes. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n New York-based journalism non-profit ProPublica created the free service earlier this year by partnering up with national desks at USA Today and The New York Times, as well as scores of local news organizations including the Arizona Republic, Miami Herald and the Virginian-Pilot. Participating reporters and editors are all connected to an online smorgasbord of story leads and sources culled from social media, text messages and a national telephone helpline that the public is using to report voting problems. \n \n “It’s an entire national newsroom, essentially only looking at problems facing people who vote,” said Jessica Huseman, a ProPublica senior reporting fellow. \n \n While the Associated Press and CNN were among the major media outlets that declined invitations to join Electionland, it was a no-brainer for many local outlets crushed in recent years by layoffs and budget cuts. After all, what they’re getting is no-strings-attached data, technology and information that can go a long way to covering one of most challenging days of a journalist’s year. \n \n “Any help a newsroom can get to sift through some of this stuff, to get to the more useful stuff, is absolutely valuable,” said Matt Dempsey, a Houston Chronicle data reporter leading his office’s coordination with Electionland. \n \n Last week, Dempsey’s team published a front-page story based off multiple Electionland tips that led them to find poll workers in Harris County, Texas, giving voters incomplete instructions about photo identification. Other recent stories tied to Electionland’s analysis during the early voting period include Donald Trump supporters using a bullhorn outside the polls in West Palm Beach, Fla., and debunking a pair of internet hoaxes: one purporting to show video of Democrats stuffing ballot boxes and the other co-published with Univision that appears to show an immigration officer arresting someone waiting in line to vote. \n \n Much of the dot-connecting is emanating from Electionland’s national desk based out of a pop-up newsroom at the City University of New York. There are also regional teams stationed at 14 journalism schools around the country, where students will be mining social media through keyword searches in multiple languages, looking out for local, regional and national trends about long lines, provisional ballot shortages, overly aggressive poll watchers and other forms of voter intimidation. Students have been trained to identify legitimate Twitter accounts, and they’re getting on-site help from professional reporters dispatched by ProPublica, the USA Today and The New York Times to package up relevant information for sharing – jump-ball style – to their media partners for follow-up reporting. \n \n Electionland is also tapping into data generated by the national 866-OUR-VOTE telephone hotline that’s been taking calls on everything from malfunctioning election equipment to voter ID and intimidation problems. “They’re seeing the meat and potatoes of complaints,” said Kristen Clarke, the president and executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, which has been running its phone-reporting program since 2002. \n \n USA Today’s editors said in an interview that they expect Electionland will be a useful tool for their network of regional reporters at 25 sister newspapers across the country. They anticipate some of the leads will be false starts, and in some instances they’ll need to skip a tip because of staffing constraints, picking up on it later if it pans out through aggregation from other news sources. \n \n But they said the project had plenty of relevance in a high-stakes election ripe with voting challenges, and where memories remain strong of the 2000 debacle when Florida’s hanging chads led to a prolonged legal dispute over recounts that lasted more than a month before George W. Bush was declared the president-elect. \n \n “This is a really interesting experiment,” said Lee Horwich, managing editor for USA Today’s politics team. “I don’t know exactly how it’s going to work. I don’t think any of us do. It seems like the right thing to do.” \n \n The most useful stories of national interest will be highlighted on Electionland’s blog, and local partners are urged to tout their network on social media when they publish something inspired by a tip. Several of the members described the project as historic for the journalism industry given the collaboration across so many different newsrooms and despite the press’s inherent nature to fight over exclusives. \n \n “The competitiveness of this is harder and harder to measure since everybody publishes everything they can confirm on Twitter, on Facebook, on whatever social platform you care to mention,” Horwich said. “The competitive advantage of being out 10 seconds, 3 minutes before others is not my top priority that day. My top priority is to get as complete a report and as accurate report as we possibly can.” \n \n Journalists turning to a collaborative approach are doing so at the end of a 2016 presidential campaign unlike any other in modern times. Entire news organizations including the Washington Post, Buzzfeed and POLITICO have been banned at various times from attending Trump events, though those restrictions were later lifted. Crowds at the Republican’s rallies routinely boo and jeer at mainstream media outlets and the candidate’s traveling press corps. Fact checking has become a ubiquitous part of campaign coverage, while fake news articles maintain long shelf lives despite repeated attempts to debunk them and pledges by Facebook and Twitter to implement policies to address the issue. Meanwhile, the public’s trust in the media has hit its lowest level since Gallup polling on the topic started in 1972. \n \n Against that backdrop, many news organizations will make election integrity issues a central part of their coverage plans, especially given accusations by the U.S. government of Russian cyber espionage and Trump’s evidence-less allegations of vote tampering and rigging. \n \n At the networks, CBS has assigned its justice beat reporter to cover cyber and election hacking concerns on Election Day. Four NBC reporters will be on air covering voting irregularities, and it has a dedicated blog on the issue written by the author of a book on voter suppression. \n \n “It’s going to be a shit show,” warned Brooke Binkowski, managing editor at Snopes, which is deploying about two dozen reporters and researchers for fact checking on internet hoaxes and other voting problems surrounding Election Day. \n \n Another new startup aimed at helping the press and public to sift through the noise of Election Day is Votecastr, a partnership between data scientists, journalists and tech investors that plans to publish detailed projections Tuesday based off real-time turnout figures, combined with pre-polling surveys on voting preferences. The project will be pulling information from about 700 precincts in eight key battleground states -- Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, Ohio and Pennsylvania – and publishing on Slate. A live video steam of the analysis will be available on Vice Media. \n \n Sasha Issenberg, one of the founding partners of the project, said the information can be useful to journalists looking for real-time evidence of polling problems. They would see signs if turnout levels are down at a precinct, which could suggest anything from broken voting machines to shortages on provisional ballots or intimidation. \n \n “I hope that we are a generator of leads and hypotheses for reporters to chase,” he said. \n \n While journalists may be encouraging the cross-newsroom partnerships and data and source sharing, they are also exposing themselves to heightened scrutiny from critics in Trump’s camp who may interpret their work as another example of the press trying to sabotage the Republican’s campaign. \n \n “People will think even more what they always thought: the press is in collusion. We’re all one big group think. I think that can go either way depending on who you are talking to,” said Jane Elizabeth, a senior manager of the American Press Institute’s accountability journalism project. \n \n “I’d hate to be in the middle of an election where this type of fact checking isn’t taking place,” she added. “You don’t know how much it’s going to help. But you don’t want to see the reverse side of that either.”', 'In a historic ruling that provided a huge morale boost to the gay-rights movement, U.S. District Judge Bernard Friedman Friday struck down Michigan�s ban on same-sex marriage, making it the 18th state in the nation to allow gays and lesbians to join in matrimony, just like their heterosexual counterparts. \n \n Just hours later, Washtenaw, Muskegon and Oakland counties announced they�ll open their clerk�s offices to issue marriage licenses on Saturday. \n \n �Many Michigan residents have religious convictions whose principles govern the conduct of their daily lives and inform their own viewpoints about marriage,� Friedman wrote in his 31-page ruling. �Nonetheless, these views cannot strip other citizens of the guarantees of equal protection under the law.� \n \n ■ PDF: Read the judge�s ruling on gay marriage \n \n ■ Related: Questions, answers on today�s ruling \n \n Friedman, who declared Michigan�s ban on same-sex marriage unconstitutional, went a step further than other judges across the country who have made similar decisions. \n \n Friedman did not stay his ruling. \n \n That prompted Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette to file an emergency stay request to prevent gay couples from marrying right away. That includes the two plaintiffs in the case: Hazel Park nurses April DeBoer and Jayne Rowse, who fought for the right to marry and adopt each other�s special needs children. \n \n �It�s just amazing,� said DeBoer, who wiped tears and hugged her partner after learning of Friedman�s ruling. �This is what we�ve wanted for our family and families like ours �we are just so happy ... We got our day in court and we won.� \n \n Rowse was overwhelmed. \n \n �We�re going to actually be a legalized family, a recognized family by everybody,� she said. \n \n In his 31-page ruling, Friedman heavily criticized the state�s position that the will of the voters should have been upheld, noting that just because voters approve something doesn�t make it right, especially when it violates the Constitution. \n \n �In attempting to define this case as a challenge to �the will of the people,� state defendants lost sight of what this case is truly about: people. \n \n �No court record of this proceeding could ever fully convey the personal sacrifice of these two plaintiffs who seek to ensure that the state may no longer impair the rights of their children and the thousands of others now being raised by same-sex couples,� Friedman wrote. \n \n �It is the court�s fervent hope that these children will grow up to �understand the integrity and closeness of their own family and its concord with other families in their community and in their daily lives.� \n \n �Today�s decision is a step in that direction, and affirms the enduring principle that regardless of whoever finds favor in the eyes of the most recent majority, the guarantee of equal protection must prevail.� \n \n Schuette, meanwhile, vowed to continue to fight to uphold the Michigan Marriage Amendment Act, which 2.7 million voters approved in 2004 when they decided that marriage can only be defined as a union between a man and a woman. \n \n �In 2004, the citizens of Michigan recognized that diversity in parenting is best for kids and families because moms and dads are not interchangeable. Michigan voters enshrined that decision in our state constitution, and their will should stand and be respected,� Schuette said following today�s ruling. \n \n Schuette said he expects the U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals will grant his request for a stay, noting the U.S. Supreme Court intervened in Utah�s gay-marriage case and granted that state�s request for a stay. \n \n The state has long argued that the will of the voters should not be drowned out by a single judge. The state also argues that it has a �legitimate� interest in preserving the traditional family structure because � it claims � children thrive best when raised by married moms and dads. \n \n Friedman, though, sided with the plaintiffs. \n \n For DeBoer and Rowse, the case did not start out about marriage rights but about adoption rights. The two women want to adopt each others�s children � two preschool-age boys and a 4-year-old girl � but can�t because Michigan doesn�t allow same-sex couple adoptions. \n \n Now, if Friedman�s ruling stands, they can get married and adopt each other�s children. \n \n Unlike most federal judges who have taken up the gay-marriage issue, Friedman opted last fall to hold a trial and give both sides the chance to present their arguments and scientific evidence. \n \n The state�s experts said that their studies show that children of same-sex couples have poorer outcomes than kids raised by married moms and dads. \n \n Friedman didn�t find the state�s experts credible, stating in his ruling that the testimony of one state witness was �entirely unbelievable and not worthy of serious consideration.� He said the state�s four witnesses �clearly represent a fringe viewpoint that is rejected by the vast majority of their colleagues across a variety of social science fields.� \n \n Friedman, however, said he did find the plaintiffs� experts to be credible. They said their research showed that there were no real differences in the outcomes of children raised by same-sex couples compared with those raised by moms and dads. \n \n The plaintiffs also argued that child outcomes should have nothing to do with the marriage issue anyway, because having kids isn�t a prerequisite for getting married. \n \n Friedman agreed. \n \n Meanwhile, legal experts believe the gay-marriage debate ultimately will be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court, which has not yet issued a definitive ruling on same-sex marriage. \n \n Dana Nessel, one of the lawyers for DeBoer and Rowse, said the patchwork of legislation involving same-sex marriage has led to chaos, specifically for same-sex couples who are legally recognized in one state but then move to another and have no legal recognition. It�s especially problematic come tax time, she said, noting same-sex couples, depending on where they live, have to file separately because their marriage isn�t recognized. \n \n �This has to be resolved,� Nessel said. �This can�t continue. You can�t have this patchwork system anymore.�']",2,"– If misery and politics make strange bedfellows, their Election 2016 love child in the Fourth Estate is a nascent project called Electionland.

186,"['Four juniors from Florida A&M University were waiting to get into their friend’s apartment building late Saturday night when a white man claiming to live in the building allegedly accosted them before pulling out a gun, according to police and a now-viral social media video. \n \n One of the students, Isaiah Butterfield, captured part of the 10-minute confrontation on video and posted it on Twitter, where it has since been retweeted nearly 6,000 times. \n \n The clip shows a white man wearing a baseball cap claiming to be a resident of the building and then getting into a verbal altercation with the group of black students, before pulling a gun out in an apparent effort to stop them from getting in an elevator. \n \n Social media users and local outlets identified the man as Don Crandall, a manager at the Baymont Inn & Suites by Wyndham Hotels. On Tuesday, the Pax Hotel Group, which owns the inn, posted a statement on Instagram confirming that its general manager was involved, condemned his actions, and said that he had been fired. \n \n ""Our team has gone ahead and took the actions necessary,"" the group said, adding that it does not ""stand behind the actions of our former general manager...we would like to apologize to those affected by the actions of our former employee."" \n \n In a message to residents Monday night, the apartment complex\'s management said Crandall is not a resident of the building, Stadium Centre, which is marketed as off-campus housing to college students in Tallahassee. \n \n “Firearms are prohibited on our property and we take this matter very seriously,” the management said in the message, which Butterfield sent to BuzzFeed News. “Moreover, we are firmly committed to creating a diverse residential community that is inclusive and welcoming to all.” \n \n In an interview, Butterfield described the encounter, which he said occurred while he and three friends — Stephen Brooks, Joshua Cosby, and Fitzroy Rhoden — were waiting at the garage entrance to the apartment building. Another friend, Zavian Flowers, had just moved into the building and was throwing a party, Butterfield said. \n \n As they waited for Flowers to let them in, Crandall walked past them and through the door. \n \n “Then he turned and he said, ‘You aren’t getting in here if you don\'t have a key,’” Butterfield said. “We were shook because we hadn’t said anything to him. We were just standing there and then he closed the door and locked it.” \n \n According to the junior, Crandall, who is white, came back a few moments later and began harassing the students again. The encounter then caught the attention of another man — whom Butterfield identified as “Chad” — who intervened on the students’ behalf. \n \n \n \n “He came at us for no reason and that’s when Chad walked up and I started recording,” Butterfield said. “Chad stood up for us and pushed back on the guy and said we could come in with him.”', 'Danny Iudici/New York Daily News Union members of local 1181 amalgamated were on strike this morning at 1616 Stillwell Ave. in the Bronx at the Little Richie Bus Company.

""They don\'t have a solid plan for how they\'re going to deal with these more-complicated issues,"" she said. \n \n The union behind the strike, Amalgamated Transit Workers Union Local 1181, is protesting a city plan to bid out private bus contracts with no job guarantees for the union\'s 8,800 drivers and escorts. \n \n Its leaders have promised picket lines at bus yards, and other drivers unions have vowed not to cross those lines. \n \n The bus companies have hired replacement workers, but the new, nonunion drivers won\'t begin this week because they must undergo three days of alcohol and drug tests. The new drivers are getting training, and it\'s not clear when they\'ll try to cross lines to begin work. \n \n Carolyn Daly, a spokeswoman for the companies, noted an increased police presence was expected at bus depots early Wednesday. \n \n Joe Marino/for New York Daily News \n \n The bus companies, meanwhile, delivered a letter to the National Labor Relations Board Tuesday demanding a stop to the strike.

Video of a portion of the Saturday night incident went viral after one of the students, Isaiah Butterfield, posted it on Twitter; Butterfield tells BuzzFeed News that before he started filming, the white man in the video walked past him and his friends and through the building's entrance. ""Then he turned and he said, ‘You aren’t getting in here if you don't have a key,'"" Butterfield says. ""We were shook because we hadn’t said anything to him."" He says the man then came back outside and started harassing the group, at which point another white person walked up and started defending the black students. Butterfield then started filming. The white bystander, who had a key to the building, let the group inside; the first white man then insisted they not get on the elevator with him and asked repeatedly whether they had a key to the building. As the group attempted to enter the elevator, the man pulled out a gun. ""He made sure we saw that he had a gun so we didn't get in the elevator,"" says Butterfield, who notes that the group had earlier questioned whether the man actually lived in the building, since it is student housing and he looked older than most residents. (At one point in the video, the man can be heard saying, ""Where am I going? I am going upstairs to get laid."") The students, who were ultimately let into the building by their friend, reported the incident to police the following day. Building management has since released a statement saying the man in the video is not a resident. Social media users identified him, and his employer announced he has been fired from his position as general manager of a nearby hotel."

The patient had thrombocytopenia and leukopenia and was given doxycycline for a presumed tickborne illness. His condition did not improve. Multiorgan failure developed, and he died 11 days after illness onset from cardiopulmonary arrest. Molecular and serologic testing results for known tickborne pathogens were negative. However, testing of a specimen for antibodies against Heartland virus by using plaque reduction neutralization indicated the presence of another virus. Next-generation sequencing and phylogenetic analysis identified the virus as a novel member of the genus Thogotovirus. \n \n The genus Thogotovirus (family Orthomyxoviridae) contains >6 distinct viruses, including Araguari, Aransas Bay, Dhori, Jos, Thogoto, and Upolu viruses (1–3). These viruses have been primarily associated with either hard or soft ticks and have a wide geographic distribution (1–8). The only virus in this genus known to occur in the United States is Aransas Bay virus, which was isolated from soft ticks (Ornithodoros spp.) collected from a seabird nest off the coast of Texas (3). \n \n Two viruses in the genus Thogotovirus (Thogoto and Dhori viruses) are currently known to cause human infection and disease. Antibodies against Thogoto virus have been identified in humans living in parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa (1,4,6,8). Two persons from Nigeria infected with this virus were identified in 1966. The first patient was a man with a febrile illness in whom neuromyelitis optica later developed. The second patient was a 14-year-old boy in whom meningitis developed and who died 6 days later because of complications of sickle cell disease (9). \n \n Antibodies against Dhori virus in humans have been reported in a similar distribution as those against Thogoto virus (1,6,8,10). Five patients with disease have been described after accidental laboratory exposure to Dhori virus; encephalitis developed in 2 of these patients (11). We report a novel Thogotovirus associated with a febrile illness and death that occurred in a man in the United States in 2014. \n \n The Case-Patient The patient was a previously healthy man >50 years of age from Bourbon County, Kansas, USA. While working outdoors on his property in late spring 2014, the patient had several tick bites and found an engorged tick on his shoulder several days before he became ill with nausea, weakness, and diarrhea. The following day, a fever, anorexia, chills, headache, myalgia, and arthralgia developed. On the third day of illness, the patient went to his primary care physician, who empirically prescribed doxycycline for a presumed tickborne illness because of his history of tick bites, symptoms, and no reported travel outside the immediate area. The following morning, the patient’s wife found him obtunded (experiencing reduced consciousness) but arousable. He was taken by ambulance to a local hospital. At the hospital, he had a temperature of 37.3°C, a pulse rate of 84 beats/min, and an increased blood pressure of 151/65 mm Hg. The patient had a papular rash on his trunk, but otherwise results of his physical examination were unremarkable. Initial laboratory findings showed leukopenia (2,200 cells/μL), lymphopenia (absolute lymphocyte count 550 cells/μL), thrombocytopenia (72,000 cells/μL), mild hyponatremia (sodium 133 mmol/L), hypokalemia (potassium 3.0 mmol/L), a creatinine level (0.8 mg/dL) within the reference range (0.6 mg/dL–1.2 mg/dL), a slightly increased level of blood urea nitrogen (25 μg/dL), and increased levels of aspartate aminotransferase (138 U/L) and alanine aminotransferase (86 U/L). He was admitted because of the principal problems of dehydration, syncope, and possible tickborne illness. He was given an intravenous (IV) fluid bolus, then maintenance fluids, and doxycycline (200 mg IV every 12 h for the first 24 h, then 100 mg IV every 12 h). Despite doxycycline therapy, the patient continued to report malaise and anorexia, and periodic fevers (maximum temperature 38.8°C) developed. At day 8 postillness onset, the patient was transferred to a tertiary care center for further evaluation and management. Patient samples collected before transfer showed no serologic evidence of Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Lyme disease, or ehrlichiosis. At initial assessment at the tertiary care center, the patient was febrile (temperature 39.4°C) and had a nontender left axillary lymphadenopathy; a diffuse maculopapular rash on his chest, abdomen, and back; petechiae on his soft palate and lower extremities; and bibasilar crackles in the lung fields. Laboratory testing continued to show mild leukopenia (3,600 cells/μL) but also showed worsening thrombocytopenia (34,000 cells/μL). His renal function was normal, but his aspartate aminotransferase level had increased to 119 U/L. Doxycycline treatment (100 mg IV every 12 h) was continued, and the patient was evaluated further for a potential etiology of his illness. Hematologic results suggested that his persistent thrombocytopenia and leukopenia were secondary to acute bone marrow suppression. A chest, abdomen, and pelvis computed tomography scan with contrast showed trace pleural effusions, bibasilar atelectasis, and multiple prominent abdominal lymph nodes. At day 9 postillness onset, he remained lucid and interactive, but he continued to have episodic high fever (temperature >39°C) and progressive dyspnea developed, which resulted in a need for supplemental oxygen. A chest radiograph showed new findings of pulmonary venous congestion and interstitial edema, suggestive of progressive heart failure or fluid overload, and an echocardiogram showed global hypokinesis. Because of increasing supplemental oxygen needs and progressive lactic acidosis, he was transferred to the intensive care unit and given broad-spectrum antimicrobial drugs on day 10 of his illness. His renal function began to deteriorate and his aminotransferase levels continued to increase. The patient was intubated because of acute respiratory distress syndrome and was given 3 vasopressor medications because of shock. The patient subsequently had sustained ventricular tachycardia with persistent hypotension and eventual pulseless electrical activity with refractory shock. After multiple resuscitations, the decision was made to withdraw further care, and he died shortly after being extubated, 11 days after first becoming ill. An autopsy was not performed. Results of comprehensive evaluations for tickborne diseases, including serologic testing for Rocky Mountain spotted fever, tularemia, brucella, babesiosis, and Q fever; molecular testing for Ehrlichia spp. and Anaplasma phagocytophilum; and blood thin smears for Babesia spp. were negative. Results of evaluations for fungal pathogens (Aspergillus spp. galactomannan, antibodies against Histoplasma spp., and Histoplasma spp. antigen in serum and urine) were negative. Evaluations for cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and parvovirus showed past infection. Test results for hepatitis B and C viruses, West Nile virus, and HIV were also negative. Blood, sputum, and urine bacterial cultures were negative. A whole blood specimen collected 9 days after illness onset was sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (Fort Collins, CO, USA) for Heartland virus testing as part of an active institutional review board-approved protocol. \n \n Materials and Methods Clinical Specimen Handling and Evaluation At CDC, EDTA-treated blood, along with serum separated from that blood, were tested for Heartland viral RNA and neutralizing antibodies by real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) with 6-well plates with confluent Vero E6 monolayers, according to protocols described elsewhere (12,13). Standard virus isolation methods were also used. In brief, 200 μL of undiluted and 1:10 dilutions of blood or serum specimens were inoculated onto confluent Vero cells in T25 flasks. Inoculated flasks were then incubated at 37°C and reviewed for cytopathic effect daily. Viral Genome Sequencing, RT-PCR, and Phylogenetic Analyses Supernatants collected from standard virus isolation cell cultures were subjected to next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods by using the Ion Torrent PGM sequencer (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) and methods as described (14). After novel viral sequences were identified by NGS, a real-time RT-PCR was designed to target the newly derived sequences and applied to blood and serum samples by using methods described (15). Phylogenetic analyses were conducted on deduced amino acid sequences from multiple genomic segments of selected viruses of the same viral family by using MEGA 5.05 software (http://www.megasoftware.net/) as described (16). \n \n Results Isolation and Identification of Virus in Blood and Serum Figure 1 Blood and serum showed negative results for Heartland viral RNA and antibodies against this virus. However, heterologous viral (non–Heartland viral) plaques were noted in PRNT cell culture wells, which indicated the presence of another virus (Figure 1). Standard virus isolation methods showed a substantial cytopathic effect at day 3 postinoculation in cells that were inoculated with blood or serum specimens. These findings were confirmed by repeated isolation attempts. Figure 2 Negative stain and thin-section electron microscopy showed pleomorphic viral particles consistent with viruses in the family Orthomyxoviridae (Figure 2). NGS methods applied to cell culture supernatants from multiple isolations showed the presence of novel orthomyxoviral RNA. We observed ≈70% overall average nucleotide sequence percentage identity with Dhori virus in multiple genomic segments. Blood and serum samples were verified as the source of the novel virus by real-time RT-PCR–based detection of viral RNA in these samples. Phylogenetic Analyses Figure 3 Three phylogenies, each generated by a neighbor-joining method applied with 2,000 bootstrap replicates for grouping analysis, were chosen as representative of overall genetic relationships of selected viruses (Figure 3). The novel virus was found to group with strong support along with Dhori virus, and the closely related Batken virus, in all trees. \n \n Discussion Using traditional techniques (i.e., PRNT and culturing on animal cells) in combination with NGS, we isolated a novel virus from a blood sample collected 9 days after illness onset from a previously healthy man. It is likely that this novel Thogotovirus, which we are proposing to call Bourbon virus after the county of residence of the patient, was the cause of his illness. Although it is unclear what role the virus played in the death of the patient, the high level of viremia, as shown by multiple isolations from the blood of the patient 2 days before his death, suggests that this might have contributed to the death of the patient. The patient had a history of tick exposure, as well as symptoms and laboratory findings (i.e., leukopenia and thrombocytopenia) consistent with a tickborne illness. Several tickborne pathogens, such as Ehrlichia chaffensis, Rickettsia, and Heartland virus, are present in eastern Kansas and adjacent areas (17–19). However, the patient did not respond to doxycycline therapy initiated 3 days after illness onset and had negative results for these and other tickborne pathogens. Of the 7 symptomatic human infections that have been associated with viruses in the genus Thogotovirus, most case-patients have had neurologic findings (e.g., meningitis, encephalitis) without any described abnormalities in blood counts (9,11). Although cerebrospinal fluid was not tested for the patient reported, his clinical signs and symptoms were not suggestive of neurologic infection. Furthermore, the patient did not have any respiratory symptoms that would be expected with other viruses that are known human pathogens in the large family of Orthomyxoviridae, such as influenza virus (1). Phylogenetic analyses indicated that Bourbon virus is most closely related to Dhori and Batken viruses. However, the branch lengths suggest a relatively distant evolutionary distinction of Bourbon virus from Dhori and Batken viruses, which have only been described in the Eastern Hemisphere. Dhori, Batken, and Thogoto viruses have been identified in various hard tick species (1). However, Batken virus also has been identified in mosquitoes (1). It is currently unknown how Bourbon virus is transmitted to humans. However, illness onset of the patient in late spring and a history of finding an embedded tick before becoming ill support the notion that Bourbon virus might be transmitted by ticks. Therefore, to potentially prevent Bourbon virus disease, as well as other tickborne diseases, persons should be advised to avoid tick bites by using an insect repellent registered with the US Environmental Protection Agency to be effective against ticks, wearing long sleeves and pants, avoiding bushy and wooded areas, and performing tick checks after spending time outdoors. The discovery of Bourbon virus, in addition to recent discoveries of tick-associated Heartland and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome viruses (19,20), suggests that the public health burden of these pathogens has been underestimated. As nonselective molecular methods of pathogen identification (i.e., NGS sequencing) become more widely used, ideally in combination with classical microbiologic techniques, it is anticipated that similar discoveries will be made in the future. It is currently not known how many human infections and disease cases might be attributable to this novel pathogen. On the basis of limited information for our case-patient, health care providers might consider Bourbon virus as a potential infectious etiology in patients in whom fever, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia develop without a more likely explanation and who have shown negative results for other tickborne diseases (e.g., ehrlichiosis, anaplasmosis, or Heartland virus disease) or have not responded to doxycycline therapy. Work is planned to identify additional human infections with this novel virus, as well as to explore its potential geographic distribution. Also, more comprehensive virologic characterizations and field work are ongoing to better understand the biology of, and to identify potential vectors and reservoirs for, Bourbon virus. These data will be critical to further characterize the epidemiology and illness caused by Bourbon virus and to implement potential prevention and control measures. \n \n Ms. Kosoy is a microbiologist at the Arboviral Diseases Branch, Division of Vector-Borne Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Fort Collins, Colorado.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. \n \n Scientists are reporting on a new virus, never seen before anywhere, that apparently killed a Kansas man last year. \n \n They’re calling it Bourbon virus, after the county in Kansas where the previously healthy man lived. He’d been bitten by ticks before he got sick so doctors believe the virus is carried by ticks. \n \n “We were not looking for a new virus,” said Charles Hunt, Kansas state epidemiologist, who helped report on the new virus. \n \n “We are surprised. We really don’t know much about this virus. It’s important to find out more from a public health perspective. It is possible that other persons have been infected with this and not known it?” \n \n “It took months to find out this a novel virus that belonged to a genus of viruses called Thogotovirus."" \n \n The research team is not giving details on the man other than that he was healthy, under the age of 50 and working outdoors on his property in eastern Kansas last spring when he came inside with tick bites and one fat tick still on his shoulder. \n \n A few days later, he developed nausea, diarrhea and felt weak. By the third day, he had fever, muscle aches and chills and went to the doctor, who prescribed an antibiotic called doxycycline which can treat several tick-borne infections, including one that causes Lyme disease. \n \n But by the fourth day, the patient was drifting in and out of consciousness and was taken by ambulance to the hospital. He just got sicker, and blood tests cleared him of the usual tickborne illnesses such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Lyme disease, or ehrlichiosis. \n \n His heart started to fail and then his kidneys, and he died 11 days after first becoming ill, the researchers report in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases. \n \n Doctors tested his blood for all sorts of infections, from tularemia and Q fever to fungal infections such as aspergillosis. The medical team finally decided to check for another new mystery virus called Heartland virus, another tickborne virus that had only turned up in 2011. \n \n Hunt passed the samples along to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s lab in Fort Collins, Colorado, which is looking for cases of Heartland virus. \n \n Technicians there ran all sorts of tests that came back negative, says the CDC’s Dr. Erin Staples. CDC microbiologist Olga Kosoy noticed a virus growing on the patient’s blood sample. Her colleague Amy Lambert sequenced the virus’s genome using advanced molecular detection. It wasn\'t anything that had been seen before. \n \n “It took months to find out this a novel virus that belonged to a genus of viruses called Thogotovirus,” Staples told NBC news. \n \n “Thogotoviruses have been described throughout the world.” But they rarely cause human disease, and the closest relative to the virus ever seen in the U.S. was a sample found in a bird’s nest in Aransas Bay, off the coast of Texas. \n \n Staples thinks the new virus may have occasionally infected people, but they never knew what they had. Scientists only recently have possessed the tools and facilities needed to make this kind of identification. \n \n “I think it has probably been present for a while,” Staples said. \n \n When the weather warms up, scientists will visit the area looking for ticks, mosquitoes and perhaps animals that might be carrying the virus. They may also take a look at the blood of people with illnesses that were never definitively diagnosed to see if they have antibodies to Bourbon virus. \n \n “I think it has probably been present for a while."" \n \n In the meantime, people should not worry, but it does give people yet another reason to avoid ticks by wearing long sleeves and using insect repellant outside, Staples and Hunt both said. \n \n The best-known is tickborne disease is Lyme disease, which infected about 30,000 people in the U.S. in 2010. Other infections include anaplasmosis and ehrlichiosis, which affect about 1,000 people each a year, and babesiosis, which infects about 1,100 people a year. Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever infects about 2,500 people a year. \n \n As of March 2014, eight cases of Heartland virus disease have been identified among residents of Missouri and Tennessee, CDC says. \n \n Heartland virus was first noticed in 2009 when two men in Missouri developed high fevers, diarrhea, fatigue and a severe drop in the number of their white blood cells, immune cells that fight infection. The symptoms are very similar to those caused by Bourbon virus in the Kansas man.', 'How I followed the paper trail \n \n In 1945 Van Gogh’s bed formed part of a donation to a Netherlands community (© Courtesy of NIOD Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies, Netherlands) \n \n Vincent van Gogh’s painting of his bedroom gives a deep insight into his personal life in Arles in Provence, where he accomplished his greatest work. The actual bed depicted in the celebrated work survived until after the Second World War, we can reveal. In 1945, a descendant donated the bed to a community near Arnhem that suffered during the liberation of the Netherlands.Van Gogh bought the bed (and another for a guest) in September 1888, just before Gauguin arrived to stay with him at the Yellow House. Each bed cost 150 francs, a very large sum equivalent to ten months’ rent. The fact it was a double bed suggests that Van Gogh had a lingering hope that he might eventually share it with a woman. Ensconced in the first comfortable home of his own as an adult, he proudly completed a picture of his newly furnished bedroom. “The most beautiful paintings are those one dreams of while smoking a pipe in one’s bed,” he wrote. It was there that he conceived some of his finest works.Gauguin arrived a month after the beds but his stay was abruptly curtailed by the events of 23 December. It was to his bed that the bleeding Van Gogh returned after his notorious self-mutilation and visit to a local brothel where he delivered part of his ear to a girl. From then on he only spent a few nights at home, being mainly confined to the Arles hospital.He had thought of taking his bed to the asylum in Saint-Rémy, where he retreated in May 1889 but instead left it in Arles, and in 1890 had it “flat-packed” and sent by rail to Auvers-sur-Oise, north of Paris, where he worked for the last weeks of his life. While in Auvers, he wrote to his brother, saying that, like painted portraits, “pieces of furniture one knows… recall memories for a long time”. On 27 July 1890 he shot himself in the wheat fields above the village, dying two days later.Vincent’s brother Theo, who inherited his estate, died of syphilis six months later, and the bed then passed to his widow, Jo. She immediately moved back to Holland, where she set up a small guest house. Van Gogh’s bed came, too, since it would prove useful for the lodgers. Jo died in 1925, and the bed then passed to her son, also called Vincent, who was living in the village of Laren, east of Amsterdam.While working in the archives of the Van Gogh Museum I found an unpublished reference to the bed. In 1937 there were plans to turn the Yellow House into a small museum, and Fernand Benoît, the curator of the Arles museum who championed the idea, wrote to Vincent van Gogh, the artist’s nephew who received Jo’s inheritance, to ask to borrow paintings. Vincent replied positively, adding that “I could give you the bed which appears in the painting of the bedroom”. This letter, written on flimsy paper, which has partly disintegrated, provided the first evidence that the bed had survived. The Yellow House was never turned into a museum. The building was later hit by Allied bombs in 1944 and then demolished.My next step was to contact the son of Van Gogh’s nephew, Johan van Gogh, then aged 93. I visited him at his home outside The Hague in 2015. He remembered the bed in store in his family’s cellar and recalled what had happened in 1945. That year his father had donated the bed to victims of the war who lived “somewhere in the Arnhem area” in the eastern Netherlands.Teun Koetsier, a historian in the town of Laren and author of a book on the Second World War, provided me with further information. In September 1945, the citizens of Laren had collected several truckloads of furniture to donate to Boxmeer, a small town 40km south of Arnhem. Photographs of the lorries arriving in Boxmeer survive.The needy Boxmeer recipient of Van Gogh’s bed would have had no idea of its famous provenance. It would have been nearly 60 years old and its new owner may well have replaced it some years later, when life became easier. But there remains the intriguing possibility that the bed still survives in Boxmeer—a silent witness to the story of Van Gogh in Arles.', '(CNN) Kenyan rangers killed a lion that pounced on a man in a crowd after it escaped from a park in the capital of Nairobi. \n \n The man, who was hospitalized with deep lacerations and bruises, had joined hundreds of bystanders surrounding the animal. \n \n The death of Mohawk, a majestic 13-year-old big cat so named because of the shape of his black mane, sparked an outcry among Kenyans.

A man with the first known case of the disease died last year, and since then, experts have been working to learn more about it. A new study outlines findings, NBC News reports. ""It took months to find out this a novel virus that belonged to a genus of viruses called Thogotovirus,"" which have been seen ""throughout the world,"" CDC researcher Erin Staples tells NBC. Just one example of the Thogotovirus has appeared in the US, the researchers write in a CDC publication: Aransas Bay virus, found in ticks in a seabird nest off Texas. Though the Kansas death is the first scientists have linked to the illness, Staples believes it has probably affected others; they just didn't know it. That doesn't mean we should panic, she notes; we should just continue to protect ourselves against ticks, which may be carriers. Mosquitoes and other animals may also be involved, and researchers are preparing to investigate."

(Associated Press) \n \n Cleveland Cavaliers forward LeBron James, bottom, is helped off the floor by forward Jeff Green (32) during the first half of Game 1 of basketball\'s NBA Finals against the Golden State Warriors in Oakland, Calif., Thursday, May 31, 2018. (AP Photo/Ben Margot) (Associated Press) \n \n OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) — The Golden State Warriors somehow withstood LeBron James\' latest brilliance on the NBA Finals stage. \n \n A costly blunder by J.R. Smith and a disputed foul call involving James himself sure helped. \n \n Stephen Curry scored 29 points and the Warriors capitalized on Smith\'s mistake that sent the game into overtime, overcoming a 51-point performance by James to beat Cleveland 124-114 in Game 1 on Thursday night. \n \n The game nearly over, James jawed with both Curry and Klay Thompson, then Tristan Thompson and Draymond Green tangled moments later and made contact. After replay review, Tristan Thompson received a Flagrant 2 foul and ejection with 2.6 seconds left. \n \n James was in utter disbelief as regulation ended stunningly: George Hill made the first of two free throws with 4.7 seconds left after being fouled by Klay Thompson, but when Smith secured the rebound of the second, he dribbled back toward halfcourt instead of shooting, apparently thinking the Cavs had a lead. \n \n ""He thought it was over. He thought we were up one,"" coach Tyronn Lue said. \n \n Yet Smith insisted he knew the score. Green figured Smith was simply looking for James, saying, ""I would have looked for LeBron, too."" \n \n ""I just thought we were going to call a timeout. Because I got the rebound, I\'m pretty sure I couldn\'t shoot it over KD,"" Smith said of Kevin Durant. ""If I thought we were ahead, I would have just held on to the ball so they could foul me. Clearly that wasn\'t the case."" \n \n Instead, OT. \n \n And why not? Both these teams were pushed to their limits in seven-game conference finals they each had to win on the road. \n \n ""I can\'t talk about a situation that way because I do some dumb stuff on the court,"" Durant said of how the fourth quarter finished. ""I don\'t know what was going through J.R.\'s head. He made a great rebound and gave them an opportunity to win the basketball game."" \n \n Game 2 is Sunday night back at Oracle Arena, where the Warriors have won 18 of their last 19 postseason games. In 2015, when the Golden State beat the Cavs to capture the franchise\'s first title in 40 years, the first two games of the series went to OT — Golden State winning the opener and Cleveland Game 2. \n \n James shot 19 for 32 to go with eight assists and eight rebounds in the opener of his eighth straight NBA Finals and ninth overall, as well as Cavs-Warriors Take IV. James notched his eighth 40-point game during this playoff run to tie Hall of Famer Jerry West\'s feat in 1965 for most in a single postseason. \n \n ""We\'ve got to move on,"" James said. ""This game is over and done with. We had opportunities."" \n \n James drove past Curry for a three-point play with 50 seconds remaining in the fourth. But James was given a foul following a review with 36.4 seconds left and Durant converted a pair of free throws to tie it at 104. \n \n The call had initially been a charge on 2017 finals MVP Durant and James protested the change — while KD said afterward he thought it was the right decision because ""I knew he was late on the drive and I knew I had my man beat and he came over a little late."" \n \n James called it a ""huge play"" and said ""I knew I was outside the charge line."" \n \n ""I read that play as well as I\'ve read any play in my career, maybe in my life,"" James said. \n \n Rules allow officials to go to replay in the final 2 minutes of regulation or in overtime to determine if a defender attempting to draw a charge was in the restricted area. When doing so, they can view if the defender was in a legal guarding position. They decided James wasn\'t and changed their original call. \n \n Lue was disgusted to lose this way, saying of the overturned call: ""It\'s never been done, ever in the history of the game. And then tonight in the finals on the biggest stage, when our team played well, played our (butt) off, man, it ain\'t right."" \n \n Lue added that the way James played, ""to come up robbed, it\'s just not right."" \n \n Durant struggled to find his stroke but wound up with 26 points on 8-for-22 shooting and nine rebounds. \n \n Golden State got a serious scare when Thompson went down after Smith slid hard into the Splash Brother\'s left leg at the 6:17 mark of the first quarter. Thompson lay grimacing in pain then went to the locker room with what was called a bruised left leg that needed re-taping. He returned for the start of the second quarter to huge roars from the yellow-clad sellout crowd and scored 24 points. He and Curry each connected on five 3s. \n \n Curry drained one of those way-out-there 3-pointers that have been hard to come by this postseason to beat the halftime buzzer and Golden State shot 13 for 36 from deep. \n \n Kevin Love returned from a concussion to provide a big boost for Cleveland with 21 points and 13 rebounds. \n \n The Warriors missed the defensive presence of 2015 NBA Finals MVP Andre Iguodala, who was out for a fifth straight postseason game dealing with a bone bruise in his left knee. He is scheduled to be re-evaluated ahead of Game 2. \n \n Everybody expects another wild one with so much talent on both sides. \n \n ""It was a crazy game,"" Curry said. ""...

It\'s not a selfie, nor a normal photo (which all the cool kids call a ""youie""), but a hybrid of the two. It\'s a composite shot from both cameras on your phone, showing both you and whatever else is out there. It\'s a bothie. \n \n Crazy idea? Maybe. And yet, if history is any indication, you\'ll scoff at the bothie now and then while you\'re not looking they will take over the world. \n \n Now, allow me to introduce you to The Bothie Phone. Technically, it\'s called the Nokia 8. Either way it\'s the first flagship phone from HMD Global, the Finnish company that now owns the Nokia smartphone name. The Nokia 8, in addition to its Bothie-ness, offers most of the trappings of a good phone: 4 gigs of RAM, 64 gigs of storage, brand-spankin\'-new processor, crisp 5.3-inch screen, pure Android. It\'s not waterproof and it doesn\'t have a tiny bezel, but it does have some of the standard Nokia design flair. It\'s a clean, slim, softly rounded device that comes in a bunch of cool colors, like blue and orange. It does all the things a good phone should. \n \n But its bothie-bilities set the 8 apart. At least, HMD Global hopes so. The company made the camera rig with the help of longtime Nokia partner Carl Zeiss, and made the phone for the YouTubers and Instagrammers of the world. The phone has three cameras: two 13-megapixel sensors on the back, one color and one monochrome, and another 13-megapixel shooter on the front. Even the audio has been tuned for 360-degree sound. You can fire up the camera, switch to dual-sight mode, and either capture or livestream both views from your device. Viewers will see a split-screen live feed on YouTube or Facebook, so make sure you don\'t absent-mindedly pick your nose or anything. \n \n Such camera-melding techniques are hardly new. The app Frontback offered a similar effect, albeit a more manual one. Samsung, for a while, let you snap a selfie and then drop it into the frame of a photo. You could also make the case that 360 photos are bothies and then some. (Everythingies?) In theory, the feature offers a way to be part of a scene without interrupting it. And since it\'s right next to the most important buttons in your camera app, HMD hopes you\'ll make it part of your social routine. \n \n The Nokia 8 won\'t be available in the US, which will surely disappoint at least a few creators. It\'ll be available in Europe and elsewhere for about 599 euros, which puts the 8 into nearly the top tier of smartphones everywhere. That\'s a lot of pressure to put on the 8\'s camera, its only truly unique feature. HMD\'s smart to emphasize the camera, which has become more and more important to all smartphone users in the Snapchat and Instagram era. But if people do like the feature, other manufacturers and developers can likely copy it quickly. Still, HMD had to make phones for someone, and it picked people who love selfies.

190,"['China Stringer Network / Reuters ID: 6604407 \n \n Supporters of Al Gore have begun a round of conversations among themselves and with the former vice president about his running for president in 2016, the latest sign that top Democrats have serious doubts that Hillary Clinton is a sure thing. \n \n \n \n Gore, 67, won the popular vote in the 2000 election and has been mentioned as a possible candidate in every contested Democratic primary since then. He instead spent much of the 2000s focused on environmental campaigning and business ventures. He has largely slipped out of public view in more recent years. \n \n But in recent days, “they’re getting the old gang together,” a senior Democrat told BuzzFeed News. \n \n “They’re figuring out if there’s a path financially and politically,” the Democrat said. “It feels more real than it has in the past months.” \n \n The senior Democrat and other sources cautioned not to overstate Gore’s interest. He has not made any formal or informal moves toward running, or even met with his political advisers about a potential run. \n \n A member of Gore’s inner circle asked to be quoted “pouring lukewarm water” — not, note, cold water — on the chatter. \n \n “This is people talking to people, some of whom may or may not have talked to him,” the Gore adviser said. \n \n Roy Neel, a former top adviser to Gore, said Thursday he hadn’t spoken to Gore about it and dismissed the idea of a bid. “It’s extremely unlikely,” he said. \n \n Gore himself didn’t immediately reply to an inquiry emailed to his personal account. \n \n Polling this week put Vermont socialist Bernie Sanders ahead of Clinton for the first time in New Hampshire. And she is contending with another round of stories about her use of personal email, and the security of the server on which it was hosted, during her time as secretary of state. \n \n In June, when asked who will be the next president, Gore joked that he would dodge the question, before saying that it was “actually too early” to say. Gore declined to endorse Clinton in 2008, choosing to stay out of the Democratic primary until after Obama secured the nomination. \n \n Gore has had other focuses in recent years. In particular, Gore and a business partner are suing Al Jazeera, which purchased Current TV from him, over $65 million dollars held in escrow during the deal; Gore and his associate contend the money belongs to him. The Qatar-based network acquired Current in early 2013 in a deal reportedly worth $500 million. \n \n \n \n The former vice president has taken a step back from the climate change advocacy groups he helped to found, focusing instead on his business ventures and being a public climate change expert, if not the active lobbyist he once was. Climate change is still a top issue for Gore, and he’s been happy to trash the Keystone XL pipeline, putting him to the left of both President Obama and Clinton on the issue. Both have publicly reserved judgment on the project until a State Department review is complete. \n \n In March, Vox editor Ezra Klein argued that Gore, with his ability to fund a campaign and to mount a serious challenge to Clinton, should run for president. \n \n \n \n Klein cited Gore’s support for single-payer health care, his advocacy on climate change, and his opposition to the Iraq War to make the case that “the rest of his positions are closer in line with Democratic Party activists than, say, Clinton’s.”', 'Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks in New York, Wednesday, June 22, 2016. (AP Photo/Mary Altaffer) (Associated Press) Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks in New York, Wednesday, June 22, 2016. (AP Photo/Mary Altaffer) (Associated Press) \n \n WASHINGTON (AP) — Donald Trump\'s fierce denunciation of Hillary Clinton on Wednesday was rife with distortion. \n \n He accused Clinton of announcing a withdrawal from Iraq that wasn\'t on her watch, pulled numbers out of nowhere on her plan for refugees and went beyond the established facts behind the killing of the U.S. ambassador to Libya in stating starkly that she ""left him there to die."" In doing so, he assigned her far more influence in the world than she exercised as secretary of state. \n \n A look at some of his assertions and how they stack up with the facts: \n \n TRUMP: ""In just four years, Secretary Clinton managed to almost single-handedly destabilize the entire Middle East."" He blamed her for an invasion of Libya that ""handed the country over to ISIS,"" for making Iran the dominant Islamic power in the region and for supporting regime change in Syria that led to a bloody civil war. He charged that her ""disastrous strategy"" of announcing a departure date from Iraq created another opening for ISIS there. \n \n THE FACTS: These statements make only passing acquaintance with reality. \n \n There was no U.S. invasion of Libya. Clinton initially opposed but then sought credit for the NATO-led air campaign to help rebels overthrow Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi in 2011. (Trump spoke in support of U.S. intervention at the time.) While the violence destabilized Libya, Islamic State inroads there have been more recent and are largely limited to a small coastal area of the country. \n \n Arguments about Iranian domination of the Middle East predate Clinton\'s tenure, going back a decade to the George W. Bush administration\'s deposing of Saddam Hussein in neighboring Iraq. \n \n While secretary of state, Clinton supported arming Syria\'s moderate rebels, but the Islamic State group only arrived later. It\'s unclear what effect such a policy would have had as President Barack Obama rejected the advice at the time. \n \n And she had nothing to do with the ""disastrous strategy"" of giving a departure date from Iraq. It was the George W. Bush administration that announced the planned withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq in 2008. \n \n ___ \n \n TRUMP: U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens and his staff ""made hundreds and hundreds of requests for security. They were desperate. They needed help. Hillary Clinton\'s State Department refused them all. She started the war that put them in Libya, denied him the security he asked for, then left him there to die."" \n \n THE FACTS: Trump greatly exaggerates the security requests, not all of which were denied, and gets the history of U.S.-Libyan relations wrong. The reference to security requests appears to reflect the Republican-led House Select Committee on Benghazi\'s tally of ""requests/concerns"" related to the diplomatic outpost in Benghazi. For many of those, there\'s no record of denials. And some security upgrades did occur before the Sept. 11, 2012, attack that killed Stevens and three other Americans. \n \n Clinton did not start the war in Libya. She supported a NATO intervention well after large-scale violence had broken out between Gadhafi\'s forces and rebels. Nor did the conflict put Stevens or any U.S. diplomat in Libya. The U.S. had maintained a full-fledged embassy there since President George W. Bush re-established diplomatic relations with Gadhafi\'s government in 2006. \n \n Several congressional investigations have shown that Clinton had no role in military decisions related to Benghazi, and that it would have been impossible for U.S. armed forces to intervene in time to save Stevens. \n \n ___ \n \n TRUMP: ""Hillary also wants to spend hundreds of billions to resettle Middle Eastern refugees in the United States, on top of the current record level of immigration."" \n \n THE FACTS: For a businessman, Trump is shaky on his numbers. The entire U.S. budget for refugee resettlement is less than $1.2 billion a year — and that includes refugees from Cuba, Bhutan and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Even including the value of all future public benefits they might receive — and excluding their contribution to the country through taxes — Trump\'s assertion about the cost of resettlement is still baffling. \n \n ___ \n \n TRUMP: ""I started off in Brooklyn, New York, not so long ago, with a small loan and built a business that today is worth well over $10 billion."" \n \n THE FACTS: Trump\'s $1 million loan from his father was just the beginning of his family subsidies, which included a far larger inheritance, loan guarantees and even occasional bailouts — one of which was found to be illegal by New Jersey casino regulators. As for the value of Trump\'s business, every independent appraisal has found his assets to be worth far less than he says; Forbes says Trump is worth less than half what he claims. \n \n ___ \n \n TRUMP: ""Hillary Clinton accepted $58,000 in jewelry from the government of Brunei when she was secretary of state — plus millions more for her foundation. The sultan of Brunei has pushed oppressive Sharia law. \n \n THE FACTS: Clinton is not sporting Brunei bling. \n \n In September 2012, she accepted a $58,000 jewelry set with gold, sapphire and diamond earrings, a necklace and bracelet, given by the queen of Brunei when Clinton visited for meetings and to inaugurate an English-language training program, according to the Federal Register. The gift was not to her, but to the United States. \n \n Federal law prohibits officials from keeping such gifts unless they pay the estimated value to the U.S. government. According to the State Department\'s protocol office, Clinton chose not to buy the jewelry, and instead turned it over to the General Services Administration — the standard procedure for most gifts from foreign leaders. \n \n It\'s true that Brunei is an Islamic nation that observes Sharia law and has been widely criticized for its human rights record, particularly when it comes to gays and lesbians. \n \n But gift exchanges are standard practice. As with almost all gifts to all officials, the Federal Register notice says ""non-acceptance would cause embarrassment to donor and U.S. government."" \n \n ___ \n \n TRUMP: ""Our trade deficit with China soared 40 percent during Clinton\'s time as secretary of state."" \n \n THE FACTS: Trump\'s claim is more than double the actual increase. From late 2008 through 2012, a period coinciding with Clinton\'s tenure, the trade deficit with China rose 17.6 percent. Trump\'s campaign may be using data from the end of 2009 through 2013, when the deficit did rise 40 percent, but that does not match up with Clinton\'s time in office and leaves out a sharp, recession-induced drop in 2009. \n \n More broadly, the secretary of state is not typically held responsible for the trade deficit, which mostly reflects the health of the U.S. and global economies, the difference in how much the nation spends and saves, and trade policies implemented by the U.S. trade representative. \n \n ___ \n \n TRUMP: ""We are the highest-taxed nation in the world."" \n \n THE FACTS: Closer to the opposite is true. \n \n The U.S. tax burden is actually one of the lowest among the 34 developed and large emerging-market economies that make up the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. \n \n Taxes made up 26 percent of the total U.S. economy in 2014, according to the OECD. That\'s far below Sweden\'s tax burden of 42.7 percent, Britain\'s 32.6 percent or Germany\'s 36.1 percent. Only three OECD members had a lower figure: Chile, South Korea and Mexico. \n \n ___ \n \n TRUMP: ""Under her plan, we would admit hundreds of thousands of refugees from the most dangerous countries on Earth, with no way to screen who they are, what they are, what they believe, where they come from."" \n \n THE FACTS: Clinton has called for the United States to continue to accept refugees, including as many as 65,000 from Syria. But Trump is wrong about Clinton\'s stance on refugee screening. She\'s never said she would scale back the current refugee processing system. Under that system, a person\'s beliefs are not generally a disqualifier for entrance into the U.S. Refugees are checked to make sure they don\'t have criminal records or have been identified by intelligence agencies as having ties to terrorist organizations. \n \n ___ \n \n TRUMP: ""She has pledged to grant mass amnesty and in her first 100 days, end virtually all immigration enforcement, and thus create totally open borders in the United States."" \n \n THE FACTS: It\'s not true that Clinton\'s plan would create open borders. Her plan does call for a pathway to citizenship that would allow people currently in the country illegally to stay, but only after going through a series of steps to become a citizen. On enforcement, Clinton has called for focusing on ""detaining and deporting those individuals who pose a violent threat to public safety,"" but not ending enforcement outright. \n \n ___ \n \n TRUMP: ""We will repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare. It is a total disaster."" \n \n THE FACTS: Job growth has been solid by historical standards since Obama\'s health care overhaul was signed into law in March 2010. Since then, employers have added nearly 14 million jobs and businesses have been on the longest hiring streak in the post-World War II era. And 2014 and 2015 were the two best years of private-sector hiring since the late 1990s. The unemployment rate, meanwhile, has fallen to 4.7 percent, an 8 ½ year low, from 9.9 percent when the law was passed. \n \n ___ \n \n TRUMP: ""We\'ll pass massive tax reform to create millions of new jobs and lower taxes for everyone."" \n \n THE FACTS: Trump\'s proposed tax cuts are indeed massive, but most economists conclude they will create a huge amount of government debt. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center estimates that Trump\'s tax plan would slash government revenue by $9.5 trillion over the next decade. Trump hasn\'t specified any offsetting spending cuts or other sources of revenue to make up the difference. That means the tax cuts would balloon the deficit. All that additional government borrowing could push up interest rates, the center concludes, and offset much of the economic benefit of lower taxes. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writers Christopher S.

Reporting in the journal Neuron, University of Hawaii researchers found that the brain development of children as young as preschool age with two copies of e4 or one of e4 and one of e2 seem most adversely affected—an intriguing find in light of previous research that has linked the e4 variant to Alzheimer's. Researchers scanned the brains of 1,187 healthy people between the ages of 3 and 20 and found, for instance, that the size of the hippocampus tends to be smaller in those with the e2/e4 combination. They also found some kids with e4 didn't perform as well on tests of memory, though they caught up with their peers by age 10, reports HealthDay News. And while brain researcher Rebecca Knickmeyer, who didn't participate in the study but wrote an accompanying editorial, says the variants aren't necessarily predictive and people shouldn't start testing their kids, the research suggests that Alzheimer's may in fact be a developmental disorder, not strictly an aging one, reports the Los Angeles Times. That raises the possibility that adjustments to ""diet or cognitive training"" early on could change someone's ""trajectory,"" per Knickmeyer. Three in four people have at least one copy of e3, which seems to offer a protective effect. About 14% of people have an e4 variant, which has been linked with an elevated risk of Alzheimer's, but Knickmeyer points out that there are many Alzheimer's patients without e4, and many with e4 who never develop Alzheimer's. (Some research suggests that memories lost to Alzheimer's are actually retrievable.)"

192,"['Scientists have learned that upwards of 25 percent of all people who become infected with Ebola show none of the typical symptoms. The finding suggests the recent West African Ebola Epidemic was more widespread than previously thought, and that new methods need to be developed to diagnose and contain the dreaded virus during an outbreak. \n \n \n \n Typically, Ebola produces a panoply of symptoms, including fever, unexplained bleeding, headache, muscle pain, rash, vomiting, diarrhea, breathing problems, and difficulty swallowing. As is well documented, this virus is particularly deadly, killing between 10 to 80 percent of people who exhibit these symptoms (the statistical spread reflects the divide between those who have access to intensive care and those who don’t). \n \n But as a new study published in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases shows, a significant portion of people who contract Ebola don’t show any of the typical signs, meaning they’re asymptomatic, or their symptoms are relatively mild and not wholly reflective of how the virus affects most people. In other words, they have “minimally symptomatic infections.” \n \n Prior to the new study, scientists suspected that Ebola, like many other viruses, might not always manifest in the same predictable way. The new study, led by Gene Richardson, a PhD candidate in anthropology at Stanford University and a former fellow in the Division of Infectious Diseases and Geographic Medicine, now confirms this suspicion, while providing an actual estimate for the rate of asymptomatic and minimally symptomatic infections in Ebola patients. \n \n Following the recent West African Ebola Epidemic, Richardson and his colleagues went back to the rural village of Sukudu in Sierra Leone, a major hotspot for the outbreak. The village, which is home to 900 residents, recorded 34 cases of Ebola during the epidemic, including 28 deaths. Working with a local physician, Richardson’s team tested 187 men, women, and children from Sukudu who had likely been exposed to Ebola, either because they lived in the same household or shared a public toilet with a person known to have had the disease. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Of these, 14 were found to carry an antibody to Ebola—a sure sign that they were infected at some point. A dozen of these villagers said they had no symptoms of the disease, while two recalled having a fever at the time of the outbreak. \n \n It’s now certainly possible that some of these villagers had full-blown symptoms but were fearful of admitting the truth to doctors. Consequently, more research with a larger sample pool will have to be performed. However, Richardson and his colleagues think they’re onto something, and that the villagers were probably telling the truth. \n \n Importantly, the researchers aren’t sure if an asymptomatic person with Ebola can transmit the virus. “They were not passing it along in the usual way, through vomiting or diarrhea,” noted Richardson in a statement. “It’s unclear if they can pass it along it sexually.” \n \n Advertisement \n \n More research is needed to determine if Ebola can be spread by a person who shows no or very few symptoms, but it’s a very distinct possibility. A person with an infection still has Ebola particles in their body, which could find a way to “jump” to another person. But without the typical symptoms, it’s certainly much more difficult. As Richardson noted, the virus might be transmitted sexually, though that still needs to be proven in an asymptomatic individual. \n \n Richardson and his colleagues are now working in other villages in Sierra Leone to get a better handle on the true number of people affected during the crisis. But if the figure of 25 percent is correct—and if Ebola can spread via asymptomatic people (that’s still a big if)—that presents a massive headache for health officials. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Adding insult to injury, the Ebola virus mutated into a deadlier form during the last outbreak, showing an ability to quickly adapt to human biology and become even more virulent. Taken together, these new findings show that Ebola spreads more rapidly and more broadly through a population, highlighting the need for new detection and containment techniques for when the next outbreak hits. \n \n \n \n [PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases]', 'By using ELISA to measure Zaire Ebola virus antibody concentrations, we identified a significant number of individuals with previously undetected EBOV infection in a ‘hotspot’ village in Sierra Leone, approximately one year after the village outbreak. The findings provide further evidence that Ebola, like many other viral infections, presents with a spectrum of clinical manifestations, including minimally symptomatic infection. These data also suggest that a significant portion of Ebola transmission events may have gone undetected during the outbreak. Further studies are needed to understand the potential risk of transmission and clinical sequelae in individuals with previously undetected EBOV infection. \n \n We conducted a cross-sectional serosurvey in Sukudu, Kono District, Sierra Leone, from October 2015 to January 2016. A blood sample was collected from 187 study participants, 132 negative controls (individuals with a low likelihood of previous exposure to Ebola virus), and 30 positive controls (Ebola virus disease survivors). IgG responses to Ebola glycoprotein and nucleoprotein were measured using Alpha Diagnostic International ELISA kits with plasma diluted at 1:200. Optical density was read at 450 nm (subtracting OD at 630nm to normalize well background) on a ChroMate 4300 microplate reader. A cutoff of 4.7 U/mL for the anti-GP ELISA yielded 96.7% sensitivity and 97.7% specificity in distinguishing positive and negative controls. We identified 14 seropositive individuals not known to have had Ebola virus disease. Two of the 14 seropositive individuals reported only fever during quarantine while the remaining 12 denied any signs or symptoms during quarantine. \n \n Evidence for minimally symptomatic Ebola virus (EBOV) infection is limited. During the 2013–16 outbreak in West Africa, it was not considered epidemiologically relevant to published models or projections of intervention effects. In order to improve our understanding of the transmission dynamics of EBOV in humans, we investigated the occurrence of minimally symptomatic EBOV infection in quarantined contacts of reported Ebola virus disease cases in a recognized ‘hotspot.’ \n \n With over 28,000 reported cases, the 2013–16 West African Ebola virus disease epidemic is the largest and longest on record. This study provides further evidence that Ebola, like other viruses, causes a spectrum of clinical manifestations that may include minimally symptomatic infection. The findings also suggest that many episodes of human-to-human transmission of Ebola virus in West Africa may have gone undetected in the recent outbreak. This has implications for the definition of Ebola virus disease survivorship, delineation of transmission chains, and future vaccine studies. \n \n In order to improve our understanding of the transmission dynamics of EBOV in humans, we investigated the occurrence of minimally symptomatic EBOV infection in a recognized Ebola ‘hotspot’ [ 11 ], which we defined as an area with a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed EVD attack rate above 2% in a two-month period. \n \n Evidence for minimally symptomatic EBOV infection is limited. During the 2013–16 outbreak in West Africa, it was not considered epidemiologically relevant to published models or projections of intervention effects [ 7 – 10 ]. Moreover, it is not known if clinical sequelae seen in survivors of EVD (e.g., uveitis) exist in individuals who had minimally symptomatic EBOV infection. \n \n Despite over 28,000 reported cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in the 2013–16 pandemic as of March 27, 2016 [ 1 ], we are only beginning to trace the complex biosocial processes that have promoted spread of the virus [ 2 , 3 ]. Important questions remain, including how to best use tools such as new vaccines [ 4 ] and rapid diagnostic tests [ 5 ] to contain future outbreaks, the extent to which symptomatic individuals do not present for care, how to identify and manage clinical sequelae of EVD [ 6 ], and the incidence and transmission dynamics of minimally symptomatic Ebola virus (EBOV) infection. \n \n In addition to the 16 confirmed EBOV infections with a fatal outcome, the 12 probable deaths from EVD, and 6 confirmed EBOV infections who survived (34 total cases), our serosurvey identified an additional 14 individuals who were anti-GP ELISA IgG-positive. Two of these individuals reported fever during the quarantine period, and 12 were classified as minimally symptomatic, contributing 25% (binomial exact 95% CI, 14% to 40%) to the total caseload. After including the 2 undocumented symptomatic cases with the 34 reported by the DERC, we calculated a 78% symptomatic case fatality ratio (binomial exact 95% CI, 61% to 90%). \n \n Data analyses. We considered participants to have had minimally symptomatic EBOV infection if they 1) had an anti-GP ELISA above the cut-off as determined in the validation sub-study and 2) denied symptoms consistent with EVD during the period of active transmission in the village. \n \n Laboratory analyses. Of the 187 exposed individuals tested, none of whom were previously known to have EVD, we identified 14 (7.5%) who tested positive by anti-GP ELISA ( Fig 3 ). Two (14.3%) of these 14 reported fever during quarantine while the remaining 12 denied any signs or symptoms during quarantine. \n \n Table 1 shows that 57.8% of participants were male, 35.8% were less than 15 years of age, 48.6% worked outside the home (mostly as farmers or miners), and 79.1% had completed primary school or less. Among exposed participants who were quarantined, 50.2% shared a public latrine with a confirmed case, and 49.8% slept in the house of a confirmed case. \n \n Survey. We collected the following data from study participants: age, gender, occupation, education level, whether or not they shared a room with a confirmed case of EVD, and whether they had signs or symptoms consistent with EVD that were severe enough to prompt seeking of care during the time of their village outbreak. Specifically, these included fever or unexplained bleeding or any three of the following: headache, myalgia, rash, vomiting, diarrhea, hiccups, breathing problems, or difficulty swallowing [ 13 ]. Other household members verified signs and symptoms. \n \n Of 193 individuals from Sukudu who were quarantined for sharing a public latrine or living quarters with a confirmed case, only 4 declined to participate. Ten individuals were initially excluded because of fever at the time of initial contact; none of these met the case definition for EVD. On reassessment one week later, all but one had defervesced and were able to provide blood samples. Two participants had failed venipuncture attempts for blood draw. We thus sampled a total of 187 individuals for anti-GP in 24 of 25 previously quarantined houses as defined above (the members of 1 quarantined household could not be located). \n \n We recruited healthy children and adults age 4 and older who had been placed under quarantine during the period of active Ebola transmission in Sukudu. None of these individuals had participated in an Ebola vaccine trial. Each potential participant was screened for fever or symptoms consistent with EVD, and he/she was excluded if any were present. Medical referral to a nearby Partners In Health-supported clinic (which provides free medical care to those unable to pay) was provided. \n \n Study population. We conducted a serosurvey in Sukudu, a village of approximately 900 inhabitants (100 households) that was one of three major ‘hotspots’ in Kono District. We obtained a list of quarantined houses and EVD cases from the Kono DERC and verified it with the town chiefs and youth leaders. We also interviewed members of all of the affected households and discussed the identification of EVD cases with them to triangulate DERC records. We defined potential participants as having been exposed to EBOV if they stayed in a house that was quarantined based on sharing a public latrine with a confirmed case or based on a confirmed case living there. All homes were geolocated using a remotely sensed image ( Fig 2 ). \n \n Fig 1 provides ROC curves and AUCs for the individual and combined ELISA assays. AUCs for the anti-GP, anti-NP, and combined assays were 0.992 (SE = 0.005, 95% CI = 0.983–1.000), 0.975 (SE = 0.010, 95% CI = 0.956–0.995), and 0.997 (unable to determine CIs as the combined ROC was generated through logistic regression), respectively, suggesting that these three tests were statistically equivalent. The cutoff for the anti-GP ELISA that yielded optimal sensitivity (96.7%) and specificity (97.7%) was 4.7 U/mL. \n \n To determine overall accuracies for the two ELISAs in combination and individually, we generated receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and compared the areas under the curve (AUCs) for the individual and combined anti-GP and anti-NP tests [ 12 ]. The cutoff for a positive test was established by ROC analysis, defined as the point along the ROC curve that gave the highest sum of sensitivity (%) and specificity (%). \n \n We assessed anti-glycoprotein (anti-GP) and anti-nucleoprotein (anti-NP) responses to EBOV by means of commercial ELISA kits (AE 320620–1 and AE 320520–1, respectively) from Alpha Diagnostic International (ADI), San Antonio, TX, USA. These were processed according to the manufacturer’s instructions, with plasma diluted at 1:200. Optical density (OD) was read at 450 nm (subtracting OD at 630nm to normalize well background) on a ChroMate 4300 microplate reader (Awareness Technologies, Marina Del Rey, CA, USA). Values are reported in units per milliliter (U/mL) with the use of reference antibody provided by the manufacturer. \n \n We recruited 30 EVD survivors as positive controls by contacting the director of the Kono Survivors’ Group and requesting that she identify individuals interested in participating in a serosurvey. Using Kono DERC records, we verified that survivors had been admitted to an Ebola Treatment Unit (ETU) and had a documented RT-PCR positive result for EBOV. To identify a group of people whom we considered at very low risk of previous EBOV infection to serve as negative controls, we used Kono DERC records to locate three villages in Kono District in which no Ebola cases had been reported: In the villages of Tombodu, Wardu, and Njagbwema, we recruited 132 individuals who denied contact with Ebola cases both inside and outside of their communities. \n \n Kono is a diamond-rich district in eastern Sierra Leone which reported 301 cases of EVD (that is, RT-PCR confirmed individuals who presented for isolation or were identified by surveillance teams) between August 2014 and February 2015 (Kono District Ebola Response Centre (DERC), personal communication). Several of the authors worked closely with the Kono DERC, British military, and International Federation of the Red Cross on containment, isolation, and surveillance during the time of active transmission in the district. Parts I and II of this study were conducted from October 2015 to January 2016 by a team consisting of two physicians, a physician-anthropologist, a laboratory technician, and two community health workers. \n \n The study protocol was approved by the Sierra Leone Ethics and Scientific Review Committee and the Stanford University Institutional Review Board (Protocol ID: 33882). We held meetings with Paramount, Sectional, and Town Chiefs to discuss the proposal and supply them with written information. We then held town meetings to describe the project and answer community questions. Individuals provided written informed consent or placed a thumbprint after hearing a consent script read in the Krio or Kono languages (both ethics committees approved the use of an oral script and thumbprint for those participants who could not read or write); parents signed for children under the age of 18, and children and adolescents provided verbal assent. Subjects received 50,000 Leones (~$10 US) for their participation in the study. \n \n Discussion \n \n One year after the peak of the Ebola epidemic in Sierra Leone, we identified positive IgG responses to Zaire-EBOV in 14 individuals not known to have had EBOV infection from a village classified as a hotspot for Ebola transmission. Of these, the majority reported having had no symptoms consistent with EVD during the epidemic while two reported only fever. Thus, we provide further evidence that Ebola, like many other viral infections, presents with a spectrum of clinical manifestations, including minimally symptomatic infection. In addition, our data suggest that a significant portion of Ebola transmission events may have gone undetected during the epidemic. \n \n Although it was difficult to verify symptoms through our retrospective interviews (given the considerable denial of EVD during the outbreak due to stigma and the fear of being admitted to an ETU where those admitted were seldom discharged), our data indicate that 25% of EBOV infections may have been minimally symptomatic, which is similar to the data from empiric studies and to recent modeled estimates [14]. \n \n The phenomenon of previously undetected, minimally symptomatic EBOV infection was evident around the discovery of the virus in 1976. Using an immunofluorescence assay, the World Health Organization/International Study Team found that 19% of contacts of EVD cases—very few of whom gave any history of illness—had antibodies to the virus [15]. In 2000, Leroy and colleagues published a study (based on ELISA/Western blot) and found that of 24 asymptomatic close contacts of Gabonese patients with EVD, 11 developed both IgM and IgG responses to Ebola Zaire antigens, indicating viral infection [16]. Other investigators have found evidence of seropositive individuals in areas without large outbreaks using ELISA and postulate that there may have been active circulation of filovirus without apparent clinical manifestations [17,18]. Heffernan and colleagues also used ELISA in Gabon and found that 1% of individuals in an epidemic zone had IgG antibodies to Ebola Zaire virus, yet no history of exposure [19]. In another study in Gabon, Becquart and colleagues found a 15.3% Ebola Zaire IgG seroprevalence in 220 randomly selected villages and concluded that most of the seropositive persons identified “probably had mild or asymptomatic infection” [20]; however, they used uninfected individuals in France as negative controls. We found that unexposed expatriates (not included as negative controls) had a significantly lower mean log anti-GP (M = 5.25 U/mL, SD = 0.54, N = 12) than unexposed Sierra Leoneans (M = 6.40 U/mL, SD = 1.06, N = 132) using the two-sample t-test for unequal variances, t(20.05) = 6.40, P< = 0.001 (see Fig 3), potentially due to cross-reactivity of our assay with closely related pathogens circulating in the region. \n \n Our study has several possible limitations. First, if asymptomatic EBOV infection is a common occurrence, it is possible that some of the “true negatives” used for the validation of our ELISA assays could have been infected with EBOV. We did not use a microneutralization assay for comparison purposes, nor did our pool of EVD survivors represent all of the possible antibody titers in the regional population. Although the serologic assay conferred sensitivity and specificity greater than 95%, the assay protocol produced antibody titers that were considered qualitative in nature. Second, we relied on study participants and their household contacts’ memories of events that had taken place up to a year prior when we classified them as symptomatic or asymptomatic (potential recall bias); however, during the outbreak, most quarantined households were monitored daily by surveillance teams that conducted symptom screens and measured temperatures, and individuals were brought to treatment facilities for EBOV testing if they screened positive. Third, our IgG assays indicate previous infection but provide no information on when that infection took place. The 3 negative controls with positive tests either represent false positives due to cross-reactive antibodies or previously infected individuals. (We did not perform IgM ELISAs, as other investigators have demonstrated that Ebola IgM titers largely diminish within 60 to 90 days of symptom onset [21,22].) Fourth, we did not ascertain whether there were non-quarantined individuals who had minimally symptomatic infection. \n \n Our study focused on the quarantined population of one village. Extrapolation of our findings to other villages and generalizability to the epidemic should be approached with caution. Although many of the study participants were followed by surveillance teams during the time of active EBOV transmission in their village, the timing of the possible infection cannot be known from IgG data, and it is improbable that surveillance teams followed each individual throughout the duration of the outbreak in Sierra Leone. Thus, the concern that IgG positive persons indeed had but denied symptoms cannot be excluded. \n \n Despite these limitations, our serosurvey provides a deeper perspective on EBOV transmission, and more village-level serosurveys could enhance our understanding of undetected EBOV transmission at the epidemic level. Furthermore, our findings suggest there would be value in exploring the interaction of seropositive persons and EVD cases to improve our understanding of exposure risk. As a result, we may learn more about how efforts at containment can be improved. The data also have important implications for future vaccine studies that rely on detecting antibody to EBOV. Lastly, the findings support the World Health Organization’s interim guidance on clinical care for survivors of EVD, which defines a survivor as a person: \n \n With a confirmed positive result on RT-PCR testing for EBOV on any body fluid who subsequently recovered; \n \n And/or \n \n And/or Who is IgM and/or IgG positive on serological testing for EVD and has not been vaccinated against EBOV [23]. \n \n There is ongoing discussion in West Africa over the definition of survivorship, usually specified by having a positive EBOV RT-PCR result and discharge from an ETU. Plans are underway to develop national registries and provide ID cards to such survivors, so as to delineate individuals eligible for free social and medical support services. Should the notion of survivorship be extended to all those who are IgG positive, including those who had minimally symptomatic infection or who were sick but were never tested at the time of illness? How we define a community of suffering is always problematic and should be revisited given that this definition has implications for identity, stigma, and access to social and medical services. \n \n In conclusion, by using ELISA to measure Zaire-EBOV antibody concentrations, we identified a significant number of individuals with previously undetected minimally symptomatic EBOV infection in a ‘hotspot’ village in Sierra Leone, approximately one year after the village outbreak. Further studies are needed to understand the potential risk of transmission and clinical sequelae in individuals with minimally symptomatic EBOV infection.', 'Between 2013 and 2016, tens of thousands of people in West Africa contracted Ebola virus disease, making the epidemic the largest and longest on record. But the number of reported cases -- roughly 28,000 -- may be an underestimate of the total number of people infected, since it includes only people who showed symptoms of disease. Researchers reporting in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases have discovered individuals in Sierra Leone who showed no signs of the disease but have evidence of prior Ebola infection in their immune systems. \n \n An estimated 10-80 percent of people who show symptoms of Ebola virus disease (EVD) die, depending on their access to intensive care. However, researchers have also seen some evidence that a minority of people may catch the Ebola virus without developing symptoms. During the 2013-2016 outbreak, however, these so-called ""minimally symptomatic infections"" were not considered epidemiologically relevant to models, projections, or intervention efforts so were not studied or tracked in detail. \n \n From October 2015 through January 2016, a year after the peak of the Ebola epidemic, Eugene Richardson, of Partners In Health, and colleagues conducted a survey of people living in Sukudu, Kono District, Sierra Leone, a village of 900 inhabitants which had been a major ""hotspot"" of Ebola. The team identified 193 adults and children over age 4 who had lived with or shared a latrine with a confirmed case of Ebola during the period of active transmission but were never identified as EVD cases. The researchers collected blood from 187 of these individuals. They then tested the blood samples -- as well as positive and negative controls from known Ebola cases and people not exposed to the virus -- for Ebola glycoprotein antibodies, the presence of which indicates a past Ebola infection. \n \n Of the 187 exposed individuals, none of whom were previously known to have Ebola virus disease, the researchers identified 14 who tested positive for Ebola antibodies. Two of these 14 admitted having a fever while being quarantined, while the other 12 denied any signs or symptoms. However, the study could not pinpoint the timing of any past infection, nor guarantee that any individuals were not prevaricating about a lack of symptoms. The results also can\'t be extrapolated to other villages affected by the outbreak without more data. \n \n ""The findings provide further evidence that Ebola, like many other viral infections, presents with a spectrum of clinical manifestations, including minimally symptomatic infection,"" the researchers write. ""These data also suggest that a significant portion of Ebola transmission events may have gone undetected during the outbreak."" \n \n ### \n \n Please contact plosntds@plos.org if you would like more information about our content and specific topics of interest. \n \n All works published in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases are open access, which means that everything is immediately and freely available.

Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts and a sponsor of the bill. “Oftentimes family members notice the symptoms in their loved ones, but it’s only years later that they get diagnosed or understand what resources are available.” \n \n The most striking addition to the guidelines concerns methods that assess brain changes involved in Alzheimer’s, including brain scans and tests of cerebral spinal fluid. Such methods measure what are called biomarkers, physiological indicators that someone is likely to develop dementia eventually, just as cholesterol and blood pressure are biomarkers of impending heart disease. \n \n For now, the guidelines specify that Alzheimer’s biomarkers — including abnormal levels of the proteins amyloid and tau, and shrinkage of certain brain areas — should not yet be put into widespread use, but used only with patients enrolled in clinical trials. \n \n That is because scientists cannot yet standardize the results of the tests, or know “what measure is truly abnormal and what measure is not,” said Marilyn Albert, director of the Johns Hopkins Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center, and a leader of one working group that developed the new guidelines. \n \n As many as a third of people with amyloid plaques in their brains, for example, have not developed Alzheimer’s symptoms by the time they die. The guidelines also urge caution because there is currently no drug known to halt or significantly delay the onset of symptoms, so people told they are likely to get Alzheimer’s have no effective medication to take. \n \n “We don’t have enough information about what to tell people,” said Dr. Steven DeKosky, dean of the University of Virginia medical school, who participated in one of the working groups. “Until you can tell a clinician, ‘If you do this test you have X amount of reliability and to do that will make a difference in the life of your patient’ — until then, it remains in the lab.” \n \n But the guidelines reflect a sense in the medical community that the moment when science will have more specific knowledge about biomarkers is not that far off. They are intended to encourage more research so that drugs can be developed to attack early brain changes and to identify people who might benefit from such drugs when they become available. \n \n The goal, said William Thies, chief medical and scientific officer for the Alzheimer’s Association, is “extending the range of our ability to investigate this disease and eventually find the treatment that is going to be so necessary to avoid the epidemic of Alzheimer’s disease that we see facing us over the next 40 years.” \n \n In the short term, the biggest impact is likely to be seen with people who fall into the middle phase, those with mild cognitive impairment linked to Alzheimer’s. Experts say there are at least as many people experiencing this phase as the 5.4 million people estimated to have Alzheimer’s dementia. And they expect others to now ask their doctors if they are showing signs of mild impairment, which include experiencing some difficulty or inefficiency with memory, attention or other mental faculties, while still being able to function independently. \n \n Dr. Albert said that if patients with symptoms of mild cognitive impairment wanted to “increase the certainty” of the diagnosis by getting a brain scan or spinal fluid test, they should obtain such tests in a research trial so they have a better chance of getting accurate results. \n \n The guidelines also clarify diagnosis criteria for people with dementia symptoms, distinguishing Alzheimer’s from other dementias, including vascular, fronto-temporal and Lewy body. And they note that the earliest symptom of Alzheimer’s dementia is not always memory loss, but could be mood changes or problems with language, spatial perception or reasoning. \n \n Dr. Pierre Tariot, director of the Banner Alzheimer’s Institute in Phoenix, who was not involved in drafting the guidelines, called them “a step in the right direction” that he hoped would not be “misconstrued” as a sign that biomarker tests are further along than they are. He added, “The notion that Alzheimer’s disease is a continuum that has an extensive pre-symptomatic phase is a very important message to get out.” \n \n Dr. Phelps said it would hardly be the last word from the medical community on Alzheimer’s. \n \n “We’re not drawing a line and saying this is it,” Dr. Phelps said. “What we’re saying is this is the best of our knowledge and we’re not going to wait 27 years to revisit these again.”', 'The term “momentum” is used very often in political coverage — but reporters and analysts seldom pause to consider what it means. \n \n Let me tell you what I think it ought to mean: that a body in motion tends to stay in motion. That is, it ought to imply that a candidate is gaining ground in the race — and, furthermore, that he is likely to continue to gain ground. \n \n As a thesis or prediction about how polls behave, this notion is a bit dubious, especially in general elections. In races for the United States Senate, for instance, my research suggests that a candidate who gains ground in the polls in one month (say, from August to September) is no more likely to do so during the next one (from September to October). If anything, the candidate who gains ground in the polls in one month may be more likely to lose ground the next time around. \n \n (Where might there be clearer evidence for momentum, as I’ve defined it? In primaries, especially when there are multiple candidates in the race and voters are behaving tactically in choosing among them. But there is little evidence of it in general elections.) \n \n The way the term “momentum” is applied in practice by the news media, however, it usually refers only to the first part of the clause — meaning simply that a candidate has been gaining ground in the polls, whether or not he might continue to do so. (I’ve used this phrasing plenty of times myself, so I have no real basis to complain about it.) \n \n But there are other times when the notion of momentum is behind the curve — as it probably now is if applied to Mitt Romney’s polling. \n \n Mr. Romney clearly gained ground in the polls in the week or two after the Denver debate, putting himself in a much stronger overall position in the race. However, it seems that he is no longer doing so. \n \n Take Wednesday’s national tracking polls, for instance. (There are now eight of them published each day.) Mr. Romney gained ground in just one of the polls, an online poll conducted for Reuters by the polling organization Ipsos. He lost ground in five others, with President Obama improving his standing instead in those surveys. On average, Mr. Obama gained about one point between the eight polls. \n \n Photo \n \n This is the closest that we’ve come in a week or so to one candidate clearly having “won” the day in the tracking polls — and it was Mr. Obama. \n \n The trend could also be spurious. If the race is steady, it’s not that hard for one candidate to gain ground in five of six polls (excluding the two that showed no movement on Wednesday) just based on chance alone. \n \n What isn’t very likely, however, is for one candidate to lose ground in five of six polls if the race is still moving toward him. In other words, we can debate whether Mr. Obama has a pinch of momentum or whether the race is instead flat, but it’s improbable that Mr. Romney would have a day like this if he still had momentum. \n \n The FiveThirtyEight model looks at a broader array of polls — including state polls — in order to gauge the overall trend in the race. \n \n Our “now-cast” also finds a slightly favorable trend for Mr. Obama over the course of the past 10 days or so. Mr. Romney’s position peaked in the “now-cast” on Friday, Oct. 12, at which point it estimated a virtual tie in the popular vote (Mr. Obama was the projected “winner” by 0.3 percentage points). As of Wednesday, however, Mr. Obama was 1.4 percentage points ahead in the “now-cast,” meaning that he may have regained about 1 percentage point of the 4 points or so that he lost after Denver. Mr. Obama’s chances of winning the Electoral College were up in the FiveThirtyEight forecast to 71 percent on Wednesday from 68.1 percent on Tuesday. \n \n It’s not yet clear how much of this, if any, has to do with the final presidential debate in Florida this Monday, which instant polls regarded Mr. Obama as having won. Instead, it’s been more of a slow and unsteady trajectory for him, with Mr. Obama often taking two steps forward but then one step back. It’s also not out of the question that the apparent trend just represents statistical noise. \n \n At the same time, there is more reason to take a potential change in the polls seriously if it is precipitated by a news event like the debate. The tracking polls that were released on Wednesday contained only one full day of interviews that postdated the Florida debate. If the debate moved the needle toward Mr. Obama, it should become more apparent in the coming days. \n \n The battleground state polls that came in on Wednesday were generally very close to our model’s current projections. For instance, there were three Ohio polls published on Wednesday; one showed a tied race there, while the other two showed Mr. Obama ahead by margins of two and five points.That’s pretty much what you’d expect to see out of a trio of Ohio polls if Mr. Obama’s lead there were about two points, which is where our model now has it. \n \n Some of the polls, especially the Time magazine poll which had Mr. Obama five points ahead in Ohio, seemed to set off a lot of discussion on Twitter, as though people were surprised that Mr. Obama still held the lead there. \n \n But these polls are really nothing new. Since the Denver debate, Mr. Obama has held the lead in 16 Ohio polls against 6 for Mr. Romney. In Nevada, Mr. Obama has had the lead in 11 polls, to Mr. Romney’s 1. Mr. Obama has led in all polls of Wisconsin since the Denver debate, and he has had five poll leads in Iowa to one for Mr. Romney. \n \n Part of the confusion (and part of the reason behind the perception that Mr. Romney is still gaining ground in the race) may be because of the headlines that accompany polls. \n \n We’re still getting some polls trickling in where the most recent comparison is to a poll conducted before the Denver debate. We should expect Mr. Romney to gain ground relative to a poll conducted before Denver. (Mr. Romney may have lost a point or so off his bounce, but he has clearly not lost all of it). But it isn’t news when he does; Mr. Romney’s Denver gains had long ago become apparent, and priced into the various polling averages and forecast models. \n \n The question, rather, is whether Mr. Romney is gaining ground relative to the post-Denver polls — or if, as Wednesday’s polls seemed to imply, the race instead may have ticked back slightly toward Mr. Obama.']",5,"– Ebola doesn't always show itself through fever, vomiting, and diarrhea. A new PLOS study finds that some people with the virus show mild or no symptoms at all—a potential concern for preventing its spread. Researchers who visited the village of Sukudu in Sierra Leone, a hot spot in the recent West African Ebola outbreak, found up to 25% of Ebola infections ""may have been minimally symptomatic,"" meaning ""a significant portion of Ebola transmission events may have gone undetected"" in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, NBC News reports. At least 28,000 people are known to have been infected during the epidemic, at least 11,000 of whom died. In Sukudu, there were 34 known Ebola cases, including 28 deaths among 900 residents, reports Gizmodo. A year after the worst of the outbreak was over, Stanford University researchers tested the blood of 187 people in Sukudu who'd lived with or shared a toilet with someone infected with Ebola, per a release. They found 14 had Ebola antibodies, suggesting they'd previously been infected, while 12 said they didn't recall feeling sick or having a fever. Believing them to be truthful as health workers kept an eye on villagers during the outbreak, researchers now plan to visit other villages ""so we can begin to answer the question of what was the true burden of disease,"" the study author says.

193,"['Topics: War Room, Politics News \n \n The verdict is in: The individual mandate at the heart of President Obama’s healthcare law is not long for this world. \n \n At least that seemed to be the early consensus of the journalists who were allowed to witness the second day of Supreme Court arguments over the constitutionality of Obamacare on Tuesday. Even before the proceedings wrapped up, they began spreading the word that Obama’s solicitor general, Donald Verrilli, had seemed ill-prepared and incapable of defending the law against an onslaught of pointed questions from skeptical justices, and that the critical swing voter on the court – Anthony Kennedy – had all but stated that he considers the mandate unconstitutional. \n \n CNN’s Jeffrey Toobin branded the proceedings “a train wreck for the Obama administration” and predicted that “this law looks like it’s going to be struck down,” while Mother Jones’ Adam Serwer declared on Twitter that “If the justices decided the constitutionality of laws on performance, Obamacare would go down like a flaming zeppelin.” Mike Sacks of the Huffington Post said that opposition to the law seemed “almost unequivocal” from Kennedy, whom Toobin called a “lost cause” for the administration. \n \n It’s worth keeping in mind that all of this alarmism may well amount to nothing. \n \n The stakes of this case and the court’s notorious opacity encourage tea leaf-reading and overreaction. It’s clear from objective reports from inside the court that the administration was repeatedly put on the defensive by Kennedy, Antonin Scalia, Samuel Alito and Chief Justice John Roberts. Along with Clarence Thomas, who rarely speaks but almost always sides with his fellow Republican-appointed justices, they form the court’s conservative majority – with Kennedy the most likely to break ranks. So it’s noteworthy that they (and Kennedy in particular) exhibited such aggressive skepticism. The individual mandate won’t stand unless at least one of them sides with the administration.', 'CONCORD, N.H. (AP) — So much for sharing the good news about a newborn calf named Pitcher Diego. \n \n A New Hampshire farm that posted a video of the Scottish Highland calf is coming under fire from animal rights supporters who don\'t want the animal to be slaughtered. \n \n The video, posted on Facebook, has gotten nearly 13 million views and sparked a heated debate about eating meat. Many of the comments against the video are from people angry because they think the calf will be slaughtered or had been ripped away from its mother. \n \n The Concord Monitor reports Yankee Farmer\'s Market in Warner posted the video of Pitcher Diego, who was born during a snowstorm. In it, the calf — tied up with a red rope — stares into the cameras as he is warmed by an off-screen hair dryer. He appears to quietly moo during the 21-second video. \n \n Some people are trying to drive down the farm\'s reviews using Facebook\'s rating system. Several also have offered to adopt the calf. \n \n ""I\'m not sure how you get that much negativity out of a picture of a baby cow,"" said Farm owner Brian Farmer, who has 30 head of Scottish Highland cattle and 60 head of American buffalo. \n \n Farmer said he was taken aback by the negative reaction, given his animals roam and graze freely in pastures and are raised without antibiotics or hormones. He says the calf has been returned to its mother, and its thick neck, strong body and gentle disposition make it a good candidate for breeding — rather than a trip to the butcher. \n \n Farmer said Pitcher Diego will be registered as a breeding animal as part of the farm\'s effort rebuild its herd of Scottish Highland cattle that have been raised on his other farm, Pitcher Mountain Farm in Stoddard, for five decades.

The top of each card mentions the ""easiest way to avoid conflict with law enforcement officials is simply to stay out of trouble."" The cards have sparked a debate over whether the police are escaping their own responsibility in confrontations, NPR notes. But the kids involved say the point is to de-escalate the situation, not let cops off the hook—and there are phone numbers on the back to report police misconduct.

(AP) \n \n Loretta Lynch delivered opening remarks before the Senate Judiciary Committee at a hearing on Tuesday where she was being considered as President Obama’s nominee for attorney general. (AP) \n \n Attorney general nominee Loretta E. Lynch carefully backed the Obama administration’s policies on immigration and drug enforcement Wednesday, sidestepping political tripwires before lawmakers deeply critical of the department she has been picked to lead. \n \n During an all-day confirmation hearing that highlighted Republican anger with the administration, Lynch declined repeated opportunities to disavow actions taken by the Justice Department under Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. \n \n Instead, the first African American woman nominated to be attorney general cast herself as a career federal prosecutor determined to uphold the rule of law and willing to provide honest counsel to the president even when he might disagree. \n \n In calm, polished replies, Lynch also acknowledged Republican concerns and pledged to foster a better relationship with lawmakers if confirmed. \n \n “You’re not Eric Holder, are you?” Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) asked at one point. \n \n 1 of 16 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Loretta Lynch appears for confirmation hearing View Photos The nominee for U.S. attorney general testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee.

Lynch appears for her confirmation hearing at the Senate Judiciary Committee on Capitol Hill. Andrew Harnik/For The Washington Post Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. \n \n “No, I’m not, sir,” Lynch replied. \n \n Lynch, 55, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, said she supports the use of the death penalty as an effective punishment and considers waterboarding “torture and thus illegal.” She said it was the Justice Department’s job to enforce the laws Congress passes, but when pushed about Holder’s decision not to defend the federal Defense of Marriage Act, she said there are “rare instances” when careful analysis of existing laws raises constitutional issues. \n \n Immigration proved to be the most significant flash point during the hearing, with Republicans voicing continuing outrage over the administration’s executive actions. \n \n At the start of the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, which was interrupted many times as senators left to vote, Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) asked whether the president could defer deportations “for millions of individuals in the country illegally and grant them permits and other benefits, regardless of what the U.S. Constitution or immigration laws say.” \n \n Lynch said that it was important for the Justice Department to ensure that any executive action be legal but that she was not involved in the decisions leading up to the president’s actions. \n \n Referring to a Justice Department memo on the president’s authority on immigration matters, she said, “I don’t see any reason to doubt the reasonableness of those views.” \n \n Sen. David Vitter (R-La.), who has said he plans to vote against Lynch, said he was “very disappointed and frustrated” with her responses. \n \n “I have a huge concern regarding what I think is the president’s illegal, unconstitutional executive amnesty, and I have a huge concern of the fact that you think it is within the law,” Vitter said. Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) agreed with Vitter and said after the hearing that he will vote against Lynch. \n \n Lynch is the first Obama Cabinet nominee to face a confirmation hearing since Republicans took over the Senate this year. The department she has been selected to oversee has been a regular target of Republicans’ ire on a range of issues, including investigations into the Internal Revenue Service and the attacks in Benghazi, Libya, and a botched gun-trafficking operation run by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. \n \n Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) asked his colleagues not to “turn this exceptional nominee into a political point-scoring exercise” by badgering her on immigration and the controversy over the investigation into the IRS. \n \n He described Lynch as “one of the keenest legal minds that our country has to offer, someone who has excelled at every stage of her education and her career, while cultivating a reputation as someone who was level-headed, fair, judicious and eminently likable.” \n \n Holder — whose six-year tenure overshadowed Wednesday’s hearing — had a particularly rocky relationship with Congress. Lynch has chaired the Justice Department committee that advises him on policy decisions. \n \n Among the points of contention between the administration and Congress has been the Justice Department’s policy on marijuana in response to the legalization of the drug in Colorado and Washington state. The department announced that it would not challenge those state laws and said that in prosecutions it would prioritize marijuana offenses\xad such as distribution to minors. \n \n Asked about her own views on marijuana, Lynch said she does not support legalization. \n \n Sessions asked Lynch whether she agreed with a remark made by President Obama — and published last year in the New Yorker magazine — that the drug was no more dangerous than alcohol. \n \n “I certainly don’t hold that view and don’t agree with that view of marijuana,” Lynch said. “I certainly think that the president was speaking from his personal experience and personal opinion, neither of which I’m able to share.” \n \n When pressed on the legality of the National Security Agency’s controversial surveillance programs, Lynch replied that she believed they were “constitutional and effective.” \n \n If Lynch is confirmed as the 83rd attorney general, she will take the reins of the Justice Department at a moment of high tension between law enforcement and minority communities across the country. \n \n In her testimony, she emphasized her strong bonds with law enforcement and her desire to heal the rifts between police and the communities they are tasked with protecting. \n \n One of her priorities, she said, will be to work to strengthen “the vital relationships between our courageous law enforcement personnel and all the communities we serve.” \n \n “In my career, I have seen this relationship flourish — I have seen law enforcement forge unbreakable bonds with community residents and have seen violence-ravaged communities come together to honor officers who risked all to protect them,” Lynch said. “As attorney general, I will draw all voices into this important discussion.” \n \n Lynch was accompanied by her husband, Stephen Hargrove; her father, the Rev. Lorenzo Lynch, who traveled from Durham, N.C., and sat behind her; and her only surviving brother, Leonzo Lynch, who is a preacher in Charlotte. Her other brother, Lorenzo Jr., a former Navy SEAL, died in 2009. She placed his Navy SEAL trident pin on the witness table in front of her while she testified. \n \n A group of two dozen of Lynch’s fellow U.S. attorneys from across the country were in Washington, watching the hearing together on television from the Justice Department building. In the audience at the hearing was a group of Lynch’s Delta Sigma Theta sorority sisters, dressed in bright red. \n \n Lynch told the committee about her family and the values instilled in her by her parents, both from North Carolina. \n \n “My mother, Lorine, who was unable to travel here today, is a retired English teacher and librarian for whom education was the key to a better life,” Lynch said. “She recalls people in her rural community pressing a dime or a quarter into her hands to support her college education. As a young woman, she refused to use segregated restrooms, because they did not represent the America in which she believed.” \n \n “She instilled in me an abiding love of literature and learning, and taught me the value of hard work and sacrifice,” Lynch said. \n \n Lynch’s father, a fourth-generation Baptist preacher, opened his Greensboro church in the early 1960s to those planning sit-ins and marches\xad, standing with the protesters while carrying her on his shoulders. \n \n “As I come before you today in this historic chamber, I still stand on my father’s shoulders, as well as on the shoulders of all those who have gone before me and who dreamed of making the promise of America a reality for all and worked to achieve that goal,” Lynch said. “I believe in the promise of America because I have lived the promise of America.”', 'Groups on both sides of abortion debate boost their support for dueling female candidates \n \n By Julian Pecquet - \n \n The pro-abortion rights group EMILY\'s List launched an Internet campaign on Tuesday aimed at creating support for the 32 female candidates it is endorsing for state and federal office this year.

195,"['Photo \n \n With 1.39 billion active users worldwide, Facebook’s social network is the closest thing we have to a universal communication platform. And people post — or try to post — just about everything you can imagine. \n \n On Monday, the company clarified its community standards to give its users more guidance about what types of posts are not allowed on the service. \n \n Facebook walks a delicate line when it tries to ban violent or offensive content without suppressing the free sharing of information that it says it wants to encourage. Its audience is vast, with a huge variance in age, cultural values and laws across the globe. Yet despite its published guidelines, the reasoning behind Facebook’s decisions to block or allow content are often opaque and inconsistent. \n \n For example, the company flip-flopped repeatedly on whether to allow beheading videos on the service before recently deciding to ban them. In December, it blocked a page in Russia that was promoting an antigovernment protest, then allowed copycat pages to stay up. And in October, it created an exception to its requirement that people use their real names on the service when it allowed San Francisco’s drag queens to use their stage names while continuing to crack down on others using false names. \n \n “We’re trying to strike the balance based on the way our community works,” Monika Bickert, Facebook’s head of global policy management, said in an interview. “The landscape is complicated.” \n \n The company hopes that more specific explanation of its rules will take some of the mystery out of what it will and will not allow. \n \n Terrorist organizations like the Islamic State have long been banned from the service. But supporting or praising groups involved in “violent, criminal or hateful behavior” is also banned, the updated rules say. \n \n Threatening people with physical or financial harm, or bullying them by posting items intended to degrade or shame them, is also prohibited. So is anything that encourages suicide or eating disorders. \n \n Facebook has always banned pornography and most other nudity, but it is now diving into the nuances. “We remove photographs of people displaying genitals or focusing in on fully exposed buttocks,” it says. It also restricts some images of female breasts if the nipple shows, “but we always allow photos of women actively engaged in breast-feeding or showing breasts with post-mastectomy scarring.” Photos of paintings, sculptures and other art that depicts nude figures are also fine. \n \n The company is for the first time explicitly banning content promoting sexual violence or exploitation, including so-called revenge porn, which it defines as intimate images “shared in revenge or without permission from the people in the images.” (Twitter has also updated its rules to forbid revenge porn.) \n \n One thing that has not changed: Facebook has no plans to automatically scan for and remove potentially offensive content, Ms. Bickert said. \n \n Facebook will still rely on users to report violations of the standards. Ms. Bickert said that the company had review teams working at all hours of the day around the globe, and that every report was examined by one of them before a decision was made. \n \n The process can take time — typically 48 hours on matters of safety, she said. That may not be fast enough for some people in an era where graphic content can go viral in minutes. Twitter, which is a much more public forum, has come under fire from women’s advocates and antiterror groups for not responding quickly enough to reports of abusive or violent tweets. \n \n But Facebook wants to take into account the full context of a post, Ms. Bickert said. For example, a victim of a violent attack might post images on Facebook as a way of raising public awareness. “Sometimes the best way to share information about atrocities in the world is Facebook,” she said. “We recognize that is a very challenging issue.” \n \n Facebook’s rulings can also be appealed. “If a person’s account is suspended, those appeals are read by real people who can look into the specifics,” she said. \n \n Ms. Bickert said that clarifying its rules helped not only Facebook users but also the people who reviewed possible violations to decide what was permissible. “We can only do this if we have objective rules,” she said. \n \n Governments also ask Facebook to take down posts. In conjunction with the updated community standards, the company published on Monday its latest transparency report, which discloses country-by-country information on government requests for user data and the removal of content. \n \n In the report, Facebook says that in the second half of 2014, it restricted 9,707 pieces of content for violating local laws, up 11 percent from the first half of the year. Of those, India requested the most takedowns, with 5,832, and Turkey was not far behind with 3,624. No content was restricted in the United States based on government requests. \n \n The number of government requests for account data increased slightly, to 35,051, compared with 34,946 in the first half. The United States was at the top of the list, making 14,274 requests for information on 21,731 Facebook accounts, with the company agreeing to turn over information in 79 percent of the cases. \n \n “As difficult questions arise about the limits of what people can share, we have a single guiding principle: We want to give the most voice to the most people,” Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s co-founder and chief executive, wrote in a post that accompanied the report. \n \n “Some people say we should ignore government orders requiring us to restrict people’s voice, even if that means the whole service would be blocked in those countries. I don’t think that’s right,” he said. “I believe we have a responsibility to the millions of people in these countries who rely on Facebook to stay in touch with their friends and family every day. If we ignored a lawful government order and then we were blocked, all of these people’s voices would be muted, and whatever content the government believed was illegal would be blocked anyway.” \n \n “It’s tempting to think of free expression and having a voice as black and white — either you have it or you don’t,” Mr. Zuckerberg said. “But giving people a voice, like most things in our society, is something that we must make incremental progress towards.”', 'By Monika Bickert, Head of Global Policy Management, and Chris Sonderby, Deputy General Counsel \n \n Every day, people around the world use Facebook to connect with family and friends, share information and express themselves. The conversations that happen here mirror the diversity of the more than one billion people who use Facebook, with people discussing everything from pets to politics. Our goal is to give people a place to share and connect freely and openly, in a safe and secure environment. \n \n We have a set of Community Standards that are designed to help people understand what is acceptable to share on Facebook. These standards are designed to create an environment where people feel motivated and empowered to treat each other with empathy and respect. \n \n Today we are providing more detail and clarity on what is and is not allowed. For example, what exactly do we mean by nudity, or what do we mean by hate speech? While our policies and standards themselves are not changing, we have heard from people that it would be helpful to provide more clarity and examples, so we are doing so with today’s update. \n \n There are also times when we may have to remove or restrict access to content because it violates a law in a particular country, even though it doesn’t violate our Community Standards. We report the number of government requests to restrict content for contravening local law in our Global Government Requests Report, which we are also releasing today. We challenge requests that appear to be unreasonable or overbroad. And if a country requests that we remove content because it is illegal in that country, we will not necessarily remove it from Facebook entirely, but may restrict access to it in the country where it is illegal. \n \n Billions of pieces of content are shared on Facebook every day. We hope these two updates help provide more clarity about the standards we have, whether they are our own Community Standards or those imposed by different laws around the world. \n \n More Detailed Community Standards \n \n The updated Community Standards are broken into four sections: \n \n Helping to keep you safe \n \n Encouraging respectful behavior \n \n Keeping your account and personal information secure \n \n Protecting your intellectual property \n \n In particular, we’ve provided more guidance on policies related to self-injury, dangerous organizations, bullying and harassment, criminal activity, sexual violence and exploitation, nudity, hate speech, and violence and graphic content. While some of this guidance is new, it is consistent with how we’ve applied our standards in the past. \n \n It’s a challenge to maintain one set of standards that meets the needs of a diverse global community. For one thing, people from different backgrounds may have different ideas about what’s appropriate to share — a video posted as a joke by one person might be upsetting to someone else, but it may not violate our standards. \n \n This is particularly challenging for issues such as hate speech. Hate speech has always been banned on Facebook, and in our new Community Standards, we explain our efforts to keep our community free from this kind of abusive language. We understand that many countries have concerns about hate speech in their communities, so we regularly talk to governments, community members, academics and other experts from around the globe to ensure that we are in the best position possible to recognize and remove such speech from our community. We know that our policies won’t perfectly address every piece of content, especially where we have limited context, but we evaluate reported content seriously and do our best to get it right. \n \n If people believe Pages, profiles or individual pieces of content violate our Community Standards, they can report it to us by clicking the “Report” link at the top, right-hand corner. Our reviewers look to the person reporting the content for information about why they think the content violates our standards. People can also unfollow, block or hide content and people they don’t want to see, or reach out to people who post things that they don’t like or disagree with. \n \n While the Community Standards outline Facebook’s expectations when it comes to what content is or is not acceptable in our community, countries have local laws that prohibit some forms of content. In some countries, for example, it is against the law to share content regarded as being blasphemous. While blasphemy is not a violation of the Community Standards, we will still evaluate the reported content and restrict it in that country if we conclude it violates local law. \n \n Countries contact us to let us know when content may be in violation of local laws and we compile these requests into a public report called the Global Government Requests Report. \n \n Global Government Requests Report \n \n The Global Government Requests Report, which covers the second half of 2014, includes information about the government requests we received for content removal and account data as well as national security requests under the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and through National Security Letters. \n \n Overall, we continue to see an increase in government requests for data and content restrictions. The amount of content restricted for violating local law increased by 11% over the previous half, to 9,707 pieces of content restricted, up from 8,774. We saw a rise in content restriction requests from countries like Turkey and Russia, and declines in places like Pakistan. \n \n The number of government requests for account data remained relatively flat, with a slight increase to 35,051 from 34,946. There was an increase in data requests from certain governments such as India, and decline in requests from countries such as the United States and Germany. \n \n We publish this information because we want people to know the extent and nature of the requests we receive from governments and the policies we have in place to process them. \n \n Moving forward, we will continue to scrutinize each government request and push back when we find deficiencies. We will also continue to push governments around the world to reform their surveillance practices in a way that maintains the safety and security of their people while ensuring their rights and freedoms are protected.', 'Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The cow is considered sacred by India\'s Hindu majority \n \n The western Indian state of Gujarat has passed a law making the slaughter of cows punishable with life imprisonment. \n \n Under an amendment to the state\'s Animal Preservation Act, those found guilty of transporting beef will also be jailed for 10 years. \n \n The cow is considered sacred by India\'s Hindu majority, and killing cows is illegal in many states. \n \n But the new amendment means Gujarat now has the toughest laws on the issue in the country. \n \n Offenders will face heavy fines, as well as time behind bars.

(Photo: WXIA-TV, Atlanta) \n \n JONESBORO, Ga. — It was just past midnight Saturday when Clayton County Police Sgt. Joanne Southerland pulled back a piece of wood from the back of a linen closet and uncovered a hidden space between the garage and the attic. Inside, 13-year-old Gregory Jean Jr. huddled. \n \n ""We told him who we were, we told him we were there to help him,"" Southerland said. ""When we finally got him calmed down he said, \'Thank you. Thank you.\' "" \n \n Clayton County Police held a news conference Monday to answer questions about the case that\'s drawn intense national attention. \n \n Police Chief Gregory Porter left many of the specifics unanswered, repeatedly saying he didn\'t want to damage the case against Gregory Jean Sr. and Samantha Joy Davis. Three teenagers, children of Davis, also were arrested early Saturday morning. \n \n They face charges of false imprisonment, cruelty to children and obstruction of an officer, Porter said. \n \n ""The investigation is ongoing,"" said Porter. \n \n “We weren\'t going to leave until we found him.” Sgt. Joanne Southerland, Clayton County (Ga.) Police Department \n \n Police had received information that the child did not want to be there and had been physically abused. \n \n Porter, Southerland and Officer Daniel Day focused on how they found Gregory. The boy\'s birth mother called 911 and told them her son was being held at the home against his will. When police went to investigate, his father and stepmother said they didn\'t know the child, and didn\'t know why police were coming to their home. They granted police access to search the home. Police found nothing. \n \n Gregory was able to reach his mother again through a MagicJack app. She, again, called 911. When Southerland, who worked several years in the Crimes Against Children Unit, heard the specifics of that 911 call, she insisted they return to the house. \n \n ""We weren\'t going to leave until we found him,"" she said. \n \n After police left following the first visit, the incident report says the boy ""was thrown down the stairs and punched several times ... (causing) bleeding and lacerations around his mouth."" The report says the boy was assaulted by a juvenile in the house at the direction of the boy\'s father, apparently in retribution for contacting his mother. \n \n Thirty minutes later, using more specific information the boy was able to pass to his mother, they finally found the hidden compartment. The space included just wooden beams and insulation. \n \n ""A space where no person should be living,"" Porter said. He wouldn\'t go into specifics about how long and how often the boy was kept there, but there was a bedroom he shared at the home with the other children. \n \n Porter wouldn\'t answer specific questions about why the mother had not contacted police earlier, calling it a ""unique case."" He did confirm Gregory was not officially listed as missing with any police agency. \n \n On Sunday, a judge denied bond for Jean, 37, and Davis, 42. Davis is on probation for child cruelty. She\'s also accused of striking the boy with a stick across the back of his legs, back and buttocks. \n \n ""It concerns me as a police officer and a father,"" Porter said. \n \n Court records show in 2004, Davis heated a pair of scissors on the stove and used them to burn her 6-year-old son on his neck and hand, before cutting off a piece of his tongue. She was ordered in 2006 to 10 years probation and anger management classes. \n \n Police won\'t say whether the child at the center of that case was one of the three teenagers arrested at the house, but officers say they are all Davis\' children. \n \n Police say the 13-year-old found had been abused that night by both Davis and one of her children and he told police he had been physically punished in the past for trying to leave. \n \n The missing boy\'s mother, Lisa Smith, says she did not know exactly where her son was located, and neither did the court in Allen County, Ind. The couple are defendants in a small claims case seeking $4,417 in unpaid rent.

(AP) — A 13-year-old boy used text messages and photos to help lead police to the small compartment behind an upstairs linen closet where he was being hidden inside his father\'s and stepmother\'s home in the Atlanta suburbs, authorities said Monday. \n \n Clayton County Police Chief Gregory Porter said the boy\'s biological mother, who lives in Orlando, Florida, called her local 911 and was routed to the 911 center in Jonesboro just before 11 p.m. Friday. She told police her son was being abused at a home in Jonesboro and was being hidden in a garage. Porter said the boy\'s mother told police he had been missing for four years, and she had been trying to reunite with him during that time. \n \n Those details and others in the case emerged during a press conference at Clayton County Police headquarters. Police declined to say whose phone the boy used, how he knew to contact his mother or which parent had legal custody of the boy. Porter said he didn\'t want to compromise the investigation. \n \n Two officers who responded initially couldn\'t find the boy after searching and shouting out for him inside the garage. They left, but were told to go back by a supervisor, Porter said. \n \n As police resumed their search shortly after midnight, the boy used an app to send his mother text messages, including a photo of the home\'s garage according to the initial police report. She then passed those updates to police, who continued questioning the other residents of the house and searching. \n \n The boy\'s stepmother eventually directed officers to a closet on the home\'s third floor, according to the report, where Sgt. Joanne Southerland found a panel at the back wall. \n \n She pushed it in, discovering the boy who looked ""absolutely afraid,"" she told reporters on Monday. Southerland said she helped him out of the concealed compartment and calmed him down. She said the space where the boy had been hidden was bounded by the home\'s exterior siding, and he was enclosed within the wooden frame of the house and garage. \n \n The boy then thanked officers for helping him, and later posed for photos with police while smiling widely. \n \n The boy\'s 37-year-old birth father and 42-year-old stepmother face charges of false imprisonment, cruelty to children and obstruction. A message left for the attorney listed in jail records for the two adults was not returned late Monday. \n \n The woman\'s three teenage children also were arrested, Porter said. Police said all five had denied knowing anything about another child living at the home, and the police report says they turned lights off and were slow to answer the door each time officers arrived. \n \n The boy\'s father later told police he did have a 13-year-old son but he was in New York with a family member, according to the report. \n \n Neighbors said the family appeared normal, and the 13-year-old often was seen outdoors. Porter said police have not found the boy was enrolled in public schools. It was not clear whether the mother had previously reported her son missing. Porter said he did not appear to be listed on any registries of missing children. \n \n Julie Pizarro, who lives nearby, said the boy seemed quiet but she never thought anything was wrong. She said her own son even played with the boy a few times. \n \n ""And again there was nothing usual about the situation to me,"" Pizarro said.

She was treated at a hospital in the Sacramento area and released. Koester said she’s met with her sister, but she declined to provide details about her condition. \n \n The sheriff said police are looking for two Hispanic women driving a dark-colored SUV in connection with the abduction, based on Papini’s description. Authorities have no other information about the captors, including other details of their appearance or clothing. \n \n On Friday, Koester expressed gratitude to investigators, search teams and media outlets for keeping Papini’s story alive.

Like Koester, he said Papini was overjoyed to be reunited with her family. “Of course, she was very emotional to be released and hear her husband’s voice and then a few hours later to be reunited with him,” he told the news program. \n \n With little new information being released Friday, various online sleuths have been trying to find out what might have motivated two women to abduct Papini and then let her go. \n \n Before Papini reappeared, investigators said they had spoken with her friends and acquaintances, as well as “people Sherri has had past relationships with” to try to find her. Investigators said they had gone out of state tracking down leads. \n \n Detectives have authored close to 20 search warrants – some of which are sealed – and they said they’re examining cellphone records, bank accounts, email and social media profiles.

(Associated Press) \n \n Mourdock, who\'s been locked in one of the country\'s most watched Senate races, was asked during the final minutes of a debate with Democratic challenger Rep. Joe Donnelly whether abortion should be allowed in cases of rape or incest. \n \n ""I struggled with it myself for a long time, but I came to realize that life is that gift from God. And, I think, even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that it is something that God intended to happen,"" Mourdock said. \n \n Mourdock became the second GOP Senate candidate to find himself on the defensive over comments about rape and pregnancy. Missouri Senate candidate Rep. Todd Akin said during a television interview in August that women\'s bodies have ways of preventing pregnancy in cases of what he called ""legitimate rape."" Since his comment, Akin has repeatedly apologized but has refused to leave his race despite calls to do so by leaders of his own party, from GOP presidential hopeful Mitt Romney on down. \n \n It was not immediately clear what effect Mourdock\'s comments might have during the final two weeks before the Nov. 6 election. But they could prove problematic. Romney distanced himself from Mourdock on Tuesday night _ a day after a television ad featuring the former Massachusetts governor supporting the GOP Senate candidate began airing in Indiana. \n \n ""Gov. Romney disagrees with Richard Mourdock\'s comments, and they do not reflect his views,"" Romney spokeswoman Andrea Saul said in an email to The Associated Press. Romney aides would not say whether the ad would be pulled and if the Republican presidential nominee would continue to support Mourdock\'s Senate bid. \n \n Other Republicans did not immediately weigh in. Indiana Republican Party spokesman Pete Seat referred comment to the Mourdock campaign. A spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee and a spokeswoman for Romney did not immediately return a request for comment Tuesday night. \n \n National Democrats quickly picked up on Mourdock\'s statement and used it as an opportunity to paint him as an extreme candidate, calling him a tea party ""zealot."" DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz described Mourdock\'s comments as ""outrageous and demeaning to woman"" and called on Romney to take his pro-Mourdock ad off the air. \n \n Later Tuesday after the debate, Mourdock further explained he did not believe God intended the rape, but that God is the only one who can create life. \n \n ""Are you trying to suggest somehow that God preordained rape, no I don\'t think that,"" said Mourdock. ""Anyone who would suggest that is just sick and twisted. No, that\'s not even close to what I said."" \n \n In response, Donnelly said after the debate in southern Indiana that he doesn\'t believe ""my God, or any God, would intend that to happen."" \n \n Along with Romney\'s ad, top Republicans have been flocking to Indiana as part of an effort to break open the high-stakes race for the Senate seat, currently held by veteran GOP Sen. Richard Lugar who was defeated by Mourdock in the May primary. Republicans need to gain three seats, or four if President Barack Obama wins re-election, and seats that were predicted to remain or turn Republican have grown uncertain. \n \n Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell came to Indianapolis for a fundraiser Monday, and Arizona Sen. John McCain and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham campaigned for Mourdock last week. New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte is due in the state Wednesday. \n \n Romney\'s coattails carry special significance in deeply conservative Indiana, where Mourdock has underperformed Romney by 12 points in most public polls.

200,"['It focuses on a notorious act of white police brutality against mostly Black citizens, in a July 1967, siege at the Motor City’s Algiers Motel, where racism met frustration and blood was wantonly shed. Three young Black men were left dead and many questions were left unanswered. The mostly white Detroit Police Department emerged officially exonerated but not blameless. \n \n The incident is set against the larger story of the Detroit riots of the same year, which left 43 people dead, nearly 1,200 injured and 7,200 arrested, as the National Guard along with city and state police combined to enforce law and order in a city literally burning from racial tensions. \n \n No one would accuse the cops in Detroit of being “too nice,” although Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal — who previously teamed for Zero Dark Thirty and Oscar-winning The Hurt Locker — are careful not to demonize every authority figure. Many of the police and soldiers in the film are appalled by the acts of racism and violence they’re witnessing, among them the commanding officer of trigger-happy young patrol officer Philip Krauss, who is played by cherry-cheeked Will Poulter (The Revenant). \n \n Despite civil-rights advances and eight years of an African-American U.S. president, the colour of a person’s skin can still determine everything from employment opportunities to treatment by police — who were recently encouraged by President Donald Trump to “please don’t be too nice” when dealing with crime suspects, wink, wink. \n \n The injustice and anger behind it all feels like current reality, even a half-century on, making Detroit urgent viewing regardless of its character-development flaws. \n \n Being appalled, however, isn’t the same as taking full ownership. The commander severely reprimands Krauss for fatally shooting a fleeing looter. He then allows the unrepentant patrolman to return to the streets. \n \n Krauss later becomes the central antagonist of the Algiers Motel siege, which is sparked by a teen’s reckless firing of a starter’s pistol at a passing group of National Guardsmen. As cops and soldiers converge on the seedy establishment, seeking the sniper they believe hides inside, fate has also drawn in multiple unlucky bystanders, who thought they’d escaped the riots. \n \n Among them are rising R&B singer Larry Reed (Algee Smith) and his friend Fred Simple (Jacob Latimore); private security guard Melvin Dismukes (John Boyega); a Vietnam vet named Greene (Anthony Mackie); and two white visitors from Ohio (Hannah Murray and Kaitlyn Dever), who picked a bad time and place to party. \n \n That’s a lot of characters, and there are more, and here you have the central deficiency of Boal’s script: it tries to tell us everything about the circumstances without telling us much about the people. The film is less a character study and more of a situational one; a post-script notes that the Algiers Motel incident has never been fully explained. \n \n Detroit opens with a roughly animated history lesson about how poor southern Blacks moved to white-dominated northern cities while affluent whites fled to the suburbs, taking the best jobs with them. The resulting powder keg of inequities exploded not just in Detroit, but across America. \n \n And it led to situations like the motel standoff, which Bigelow and cinematographer Barry Ackroyd powerfully depict cinéma vérité style as a cascading series of bad choices, evil intentions and escalating violence. \n \n Krauss and his fellow racist cops torture the rounded-up motel guests by beating them and threatening to shoot them one by one until the identity of the alleged sniper is disclosed. \n \n Watching it unfold over the bulk of the film’s 143-minute running time makes for a grim sit, made all the more so by James Newton Howard’s minimalist score, which at times disappears altogether. Bigelow deserves credit for not trivializing the drama with a soundtrack packed with driving Motown tunes, although a version of Martha and the Vandellas’ “Nowhere To Run” is briefly heard in the film at one point. \n \n You don’t need a big backbeat to drive images like these home; Detroit’s deep fury and essential message sears the eye and brain.', 'There is no nice or pretty way to tell a story about the systemic oppression and mistreatment of black people in the United States. It\'s fitting then that Kathryn Bigelow\'s "" Detroit ,"" an account of the murders of three unarmed black men that took place in the Algiers Motel in late July 1967, is neither — it is an all-out assault on your senses and soul. \n \n It\'s hard to overstate just how visceral and harrowing an experience it is. ""Detroit"" is a well-made and evocative film that is also numbingly brutal with little to no reprieve. And while it might be the only true way to tell this story, it\'s also one that is not going to be for everyone. The stomach-churning horror begins immediately and does not let up for 2 hours and 23 minutes. \n \n To set the stage for the Algiers Motel, Bigelow begins by speeding through the history of black people in United States with animated acrylics and pounding music — emancipation, the great migration, white flight and the racist zoning practices that led to the overcrowding of black residents in urban pockets. Tensions have already reached a tipping point, and then in the summer of 1967, Detroit police bust an after-hours club in what would become the inciting incident for the riots. \n \n Three days after the riots begin, a local singing group called The Dramatics are about to go on stage at a big, crowded theater hoping to get their big break, but are interrupted and sent home due to the events outside. The men exit the theater in their sparkly suits into what looks like a war zone. As they run through the streets they assure every cop who isn\'t already beating someone with a night stick that they\'re just on their way home. Bigelow shows all of this with handheld, ground level docudrama realism. There is no orienting yourself to the bigger picture, only what is right in front of you. \n \n The charismatic lead singer Larry (Algee Smith) and his buddy Fred (Jacob Latimore) decide to peel off and get an $11 room at the Algiers and wait out the night. There they meet two white party girls, a veteran, Greene (a terrific Anthony Mackie), and a provocateur, Carl (Jason Mitchell), who plays around with a starter pistol that eventually catches the attention of the police in the area. The officers, who we\'ve already learned are rotten, storm the motel on the hunt for the sniper they presume is there. \n \n The local police, led by a maniacal, hotheaded racist, Krauss (played by the English actor Will Poulter), kills Carl immediately and then continue to terrorize the guests relentlessly with inhuman torture tactics in what seems like an endless sequence of horror upon horror until two more end up dead and they call it a night. \n \n Bigelow collaborated again with screenwriter Mark Boal on ""Detroit,"" which is perfectly evocative of this specific time and place, but lacking the perspective and illumination that one might hope a 50-year-old event would warrant. Perhaps they wanted to leave conclusions and interpreting to the audience, and as the film notes at the end, no one knows for certain what happened in the Algiers Motel and some of the scenes were pieced together and imagined by the filmmakers. \n \n There is some nuance — in the National Guard officer who is horrified by the situation and the local security officer (John Boyega) who only wanted to ease tensions — but not nearly as much as Bigelow and Boal have previously achieved in ""Zero Dark Thirty"" and ""The Hurt Locker."" \n \n Also very little insight is given to the victims\' lives outside of this event. Maybe that\'s not the point, though. Maybe anger is all you\'re supposed to feel when you step outside the theater. Maybe not feeling satisfied with ""Detroit"" is the point. \n \n This was America, you think. This is still America. And the movies can\'t offer a resolution that history hasn\'t. \n \n ""Detroit,"" an Annapurna Pictures release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America for ""strong violence and pervasive language.""

Inspired in part by the 1992 Los Angeles riots — which were sparked by the acquittal of the LAPD officers who\'d beaten Rodney King near to death — the movie\'s plot involved the murder of black hip-hop artist ""Jeriko One"" by a pair of white Los Angeles cops. \n \n As ambitious as it was unwieldy, Strange Days flopped so hard that Bigelow\'s career took years to recover. But she landed on her feet, becoming the first and so far only woman to win the Academy Award for best director, for the Iraq war movie The Hurt Locker, which also won best picture. Her follow-up, Zero Dark Thirty, got a Best Picture nod, too. And that\'s how a sexagenarian woman in Hollywood earns the juice to make a movie like the incendiary new Detroit — Bigelow\'s vivid, inevitably divisive reenactment of a real 1967 incident wherein three Motor City police officers were charged in the killings of three adolescent black men while the city was under martial law following riots. \n \n Seemingly in a position to make any movie she wanted, she chose a lightly fictionalized historical drama that bares a striking resemblance to her little-seen Angela Bassett-starring sci-fi flick from 1995. (Strange Days even climaxes in a riot touched off by white police using excessive force on a black suspect, which is where Detroit begins.) \n \n Until now, the highest-profile accounting of what happened that night was John Hersey\'s 1968 book The Algiers Motel Incident. (Hersey\'s estate declined to sell Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal the rights, The New York Times reported.) Detroit isn\'t as dispassionate as that. Just as the movie Hidden Figures buffed and polished the story told in the eponymous nonfiction book for maximum uplift, Detroit heats and sharpens the facts that formed it for maximum outrage. \n \n Not that those facts weren\'t outrageous already: In the case Detroit revisits, the cops were acquitted after the confessions they gave and then recanted were ruled inadmissible in court. That\'s a cruel irony, because it was in their attempt to coerce confessions from the young men they\'d confined in Detroit\'s Algiers Motel — a $6-a-night flophouse that the law considered a den of sin —that those out-of-control cops resorted to intimidation, torture, and finally murder. (The presence of two white girls from Ohio among all those black men appeared to inflame the cops\' further — they accused the women of prostitution, stripping and beating them.) The police claimed a sniper had fired upon them from inside the motel, but they never recovered a rifle from the scene. Detroit subscribes to accounts from several witnesses that the shots that summoned the police came from a starter pistol fired first as a stupid prank, then as an impotent and costly gesture of defiance. Carl Cooper, the 17-year-old who\'d allegedly fired it, was the first to die that night. \n \n One of the witnesses who testified for the prosecution, and who said he was assaulted by the accused policemen himself at the Algiers, was a musician. Singer Larry Reed quit his vocal group The Dramatics after that hellish night in 1967; the group broke out a few years later and had a long career without him. (They\'re still touring.) Reed was one of the incident\'s key figures that frequent Bigelow collaborator Boal interviewed while working on the movie. And though Boal\'s research team included Pulitzer Prize-winning Detroit Free Press reporter David Zeman, he has used his artistic license to plug some gaps in the legal record. (Other limits on the film\'s authenticity were merely budgetary, like the fact that tax incentives resulted in most of Detroit being filmed on location in... Boston.) \n \n Boal\'s script commingles real and fictional people: Real-life witnesses Melvin Dismukes, Julie Hysell, and Larry Reed (played onscreen by John Boyega, Hannah Murray, and Algee Smith, respectively), are represented, but the brutal cops in the movie have different names than the officers who were eventually acquitted of the Algiers Motel killings. Their ringleader is played by Will Poulter, a redheaded, freckled 24-year-old English actor whose permanently right-angled eyebrows make him look like the satanic cousin of MAD magazine mascot Alfred E. Neuman. ""We\'ve failed these people,"" he says early in the film, sounding like a peace-loving Hubert Humphrey voter moments before he fatally shoots one of ""these people"" in the back on suspicion of stealing groceries. A detective tells him he\'s recommending that the District Attorney file murder charges against him, but Poulter\'s character is sent right back out to active duty in the meantime. Did this really happen? Well, there was a riot on. \n \n Other credulity-straining aspects of Detroit appear to be factual: For one thing, Dismukes, a private security guard called in to protect a store near the Algiers from looters, was allowed to enter the Algiers with a weird coalition of Detroit cops and National Guardsmen and remain at a crime scene for hours while trying, ineffectually, to prevent the cops from brutalizing their suspects. (Boyega radiates Denzel-like calm in the face of the storm, proving that the way he livened the The Force Awakens was no fluke — he\'s a bonafide movie star. And to see him in a role where he\'s essentially helpless is unusual, and compelling.) In real life, Dismukes was charged with the felonious assault of two of the suspects and tried before any of the three cops accused of more serious offenses were; an all-white jury acquitted him. To the extent Detroit addresses this, it implies an unsuccessful attempt by the police to frame Dismukes for their own wrongdoing. \n \n I\'m also curious to know whether another one of its plot points is historical or invented: When Michigan State Police arrive at the Algiers, the ranking officer among them decides he wants no part of the ""civil rights mix-up"" the Detroit P.D. has already created, so the state troopers just drive away. What\'s the expression? Huge if true. \n \n Bigelow and Boal\'s recreation of a 50-year-old police brutality case seems bound to be as controversial as their last project, 2012\'s Zero Dark Thirty. Accused in some quarters of defending the C.I.A.\'s use of torture in its decade-long hunt for Osama Bin Laden, Zero Dark Thirty was really more of a high-tone Rorshach blot for each viewer\'s opinion of the endless War on Terror. Bigelow has always gone for immersion before reflection or judgment. \n \n ""I don\'t think it\'s up to the filmmaker to judge,"" the director told Washington Post chief film critic Ann Hornaday in a profile published last week. And it\'s not as though she\'s only just become interested in identity politics or policing: Long before her metamorphosis into an Oscar-winning maker of Important Films, she made 1990\'s Blue Steel, a sordid thriller that starred Jamie Lee Curtis as a rookie patrol officer who comes under suspicion after she kills a robbery suspect whose weapon can\'t be found. It\'s not a particularly good movie, nor one that would remotely satisfy any 2017 test of its wokeness, but it is at least more evidence that Bigelow was thinking about the problems of policing even when she was just making pulp films. \n \n Bigelow\'s quasi-journalistic style has long alienated some viewers; now it\'s infuriating them, too. Chicago critic Angelica Jade Bastien slammed Detroit as ""soulless,"" claiming it isn\'t harsh enough in its condemnation of the misconduct it depicts so mercilessly. Some of her specific complaints about Boal\'s screenplay — that it makes Melvin Dismukes ""too passive a character,"" or that ""there are also brief, disconcerting moments that present some white cops in a great light"" — come from the moments where Boal hews closest to the firsthand accounts Dismukes and Reed shared with him. Dismukes says he did all he could to prevent the bloodshed, which wasn\'t much, and Reed says that after he fled the Algiers he was picked up and taken to the hospital by a cop—one who wasn\'t involved in the nightmare at the hotel. Molding facts into the emotional construct we refer to when use the word story is messy work, even when it\'s done in good faith. \n \n I\'ve seen Detroit only once, but I\'m of the option that Bigelow and Boal have done that good but messy work, resulting in a movie that is maddeningly imperfect but still honorable. The movie opens with a semi-animated sequence that fashions Jacob Lawrence\'s ""Migration Series"" of paintings into a primer on the mass movement of African-Americans from the rural south to the urban north and west after World War I, and the subsequent white flight to the suburbs. That meant that by the 1960s, Detroit was a majority-black city with a majority-white police force. \n \n It\'s to Bigelow\'s credit that she doesn\'t survey the worlds in which she sets her movies in schematic screenwriting terms: Detroit\'s early scenes, wherein a police raid on an unlicensed nightclub that\'s hosting a party for returning veterans sparks a riot, includes a few left turns — one of the black party guests who mouths off to the ""pigs"" turns out to be a narc, for example. This detail serves no narrative purpose; it only serves to underscore the absence of trust between the police and the citizens they\'re sworn to protect and serve. Editor Billy Goldenberg splices in documentary footage with the newly-shot material in this section of the movie, creating a panorama of the climate of mortal fear and volcanic anger between the citizens and the police. \n \n We begin to get our bearings when Reed (Algee Smith) and The Dramatics prepare to perform on a revue at the Fox Theatre where they know a Motown A&R; scout will be in the audience. When the police order the performance stopped and the Fox evacuated, and then their bus home is set upon by rioters, Reed and his friend Fred Temple (Jacob Latimore) make the ill-fated decision to wait out the curfew poolside at the Algiers. \n \n The police occupation of the Algiers forms the film\'s harrowing, quite long centerpiece. Bigelow uses all her gifts as a communicator of visceral sensation to summon the horror of spending a night under these vicious cops\' bootheels. It\'s nauseating. By the time Anthony Mackie — playing an out-of-work Vietnam vet who gets thanked for his service by being beaten and spat on by cops — agrees never to speak of what he\'s witnessed, Bigelow and Boal have said all they have to say. \n \n But Detroit continues on to depict the trial of the three officers, leaking tension as it does. If the intent of this section of the film is to illustrate that these cops are not bad apples but rather the functioning-as-designed armature of an inherently racist justice system, it\'s only partially successful. The tactics their lawyer (John Krasinski, weirdly) uses to discredit the prosecution\'s witnesses are as familiar as the Algiers scenes are revolting, and our rage circuits have already blown. \n \n Maybe it\'s just impossible for even a scene-setter as skilled as Bigelow to do anything new in a courtroom. The coda she chooses, showing Larry Reed\'s resolution to continue his musical career in a far more modest fashion than before, has nothing to do with consoling the audience after 135 minutes of trauma. It\'s about Reed becoming a militant for peace. It\'s about him making a choice to survive. If nothing else, Detroit gets you thinking about how those might be the same thing.']",3,"– Kathryn Bigelow's Detroit tells the story of a black singer who takes refuge in a dingy motel to escape the 1967 Motor City riots. Based on real events, the film reunites Bigelow with screenwriter Mark Boal, both of the Oscar-winning film The Hurt Locker. It's got a strong 89% ""fresh"" rating at Rotten Tomatoes. Here's what critics are saying: ""Bigelow drills down into one of American history's most egregious cases of abuse of police power, bringing it to life with visceral detail and slowed-down meticulousness"" in what ""feels like her timeliest movie yet,"" writes Ann Hornaday at the Washington Post. It's ""daring, sophisticated and unforgettably disturbing."" And ""in scale, scope and the space it offers for a long-awaited moral reckoning, it's nothing less than monumental."" ""It's hard to overstate just how visceral and harrowing an experience it is,"" writes Lindsey Bahr at the AP, calling Detroit ""a well-made and evocative film"" jam-packed with ""stomach-churning horror."" She argues there could be more nuance and perspective. But ""maybe anger is all you're supposed to feel when you step outside the theater. Maybe not feeling satisfied with Detroit is the point."" Chris Klimek says Detroit is ""maddeningly imperfect but still honorable,"" citing ""lightly fictionalized"" aspects of the otherwise true story that set it up ""for maximum outrage."" This is ""messy work, even when it’s done in good faith,"" he writes at NPR. He applauds John Boyega, previously of The Force Awakens. Radiating a ""Denzel-like calm,"" he shows ""he's a bonafide movie star,"" Klimek writes. Peter Howell's main gripe is that the film ""tries to tell us everything about the circumstances without telling us much about the people."" But Detroit still makes for ""urgent viewing,"" he writes at the Toronto Star. Why? ""The injustice and anger behind it all feels like current reality, even a half-century on,"" when ""a person's skin can still determine everything from employment opportunities to treatment by police."""

202,"['Photo \n \n The parent of the in-flight shopping magazine SkyMall said on Friday that it had filed for bankruptcy protection, citing in-flight Wi-Fi access as one of the factors luring shoppers away from its quirky catalog of travel products, pet toys and garden gnomes. \n \n The company, Xhibit, said that it would sell off its online retail business and other assets. \n \n “Historically, the SkyMall catalog was the sole in-flight option for potential purchasers of products to review while traveling. With the increased use of electronic devices on planes, fewer people browsed the SkyMall in-flight catalog,” Xhibit said in a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission disclosing its Chapter 11 bankruptcy. \n \n Founded in 1990 to cater to airplane passengers with time and money to spare, SkyMall catalog’s often featured wacky product offerings and provided comic relief for travelers riffling through the seat pockets for light reading. \n \n Its 2014 holiday catalog offered a Santa Claus Sculptural Glass-Topped Holiday Table for $129; and $1,000 Serenity Pods for cats and dogs, fitted with a wireless sound system and LED lights, which promised to gently rock them to sleep. More sensible offerings included travel-related items like passport wallets or wrinkle-free resort wear. \n \n Photo \n \n SkyMall’s eclectic lineup contributed to its downfall, its bankruptcy filing suggested. \n \n “Because SkyMall historically did not narrowly tailor its product offerings, SkyMall faced well-established competitors in every market vertical, as well as competition from significant, broad-based e-commerce providers, such as Amazon.com and eBay.com,” the filing said. \n \n Many of SkyMall’s competitors have greater, or vastly greater, resources, longer histories, more customers and higher brand recognition.” \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n The costs of carrying printed SkyMall catalogs also made them increasingly unattractive to airlines, the company said. Delta’s contract with SkyMall ended Nov. 30, and Southwest Airlines told Xhibit in December that it would not carry the catalog beyond April of this year, according to the filing. By the end of December, SkyMall faced “a severe liquidity crisis,” it said. \n \n Sales from Southwest travelers alone made up about 7 percent of its overall merchandise sales and the negative impact on its bottom line could be even greater, the company had warned in an earlier statement. \n \n Still, Paul Swinand, an analyst for Morningstar who covers the retail industry, called the bankruptcy filing surprising. \n \n Photo \n \n “That would seem like it’s a monopoly business,” he said. “Nobody competes with them. Where the SkyMall fell flat was with mobile. If people are on their phones, they’re not browsing the SkyMall catalog.” \n \n Scott Wiley, Xhibit’s acting chief executive, said in a statement that he was “extremely disappointed in this result.” Mr. Wiley replaced the former Xhibit chief, Kevin Weiss, who resigned from the company last year as its woes mounted. \n \n He said Xhibit was “hopeful that SkyMall and the iconic ‘SkyMall’ brand find a home to continue to operate as SkyMall has for the last 25 years.” \n \n In its filing, Xhibit listed assets of $1 million to $10 million, and liabilities of $10 million to $50 million. Delta, American and US Airways were listed among its creditors. \n \n The SkyMall business generated revenue of about $33.7 million in 2013 and $15.8 million for the nine months ended Sept. 28, according to the filing. Debtors estimate that total creditor claims are approximately $12 million, according to the filing', ""SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch)—There’s still time to get that special tortilla baby blanket from SkyMall, of course, but the in-flight catalog’s bankruptcy filing is just the latest black eye for an industry that has lost ground for more than a decade. \n \n The mail-order industry generated $71.4 billion in revenues last year, down 6% from five years ago, according to estimates from analysts at IBISWorld. The analysts predicted a drop to $61 billion in revenues, or 14%, by 2019. \n \n The main reason? A dwindling customer base and the relentless competition from the likes of Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -1.29% and other online retailers. \n \n After all, that same resin yeti sculpture some may consider adorning their lawn with can be found at Amazon. In many cases, e-commerce companies offer more convenience, quicker transactions and more thorough product information than traditional mail order catalogs, IBISWorld analysts said. \n \n Not to mention price: the yeti sculpture is actually cheaper at SkyMall’s site than on Amazon, but broadly speaking, e-retailers’ prices are “highly competitive,” the analysts said. \n \n Mailing costs have also increased, coinciding with a growing consumer backlash against unsolicited mail and concerns about paper waste. \n \n SkyMall and parent company Xhibit Corp. US:XBTC executives couldn't be reached for comment. The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Thursday, and in filings in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Phoenix, acting Chief Executive Scott Wiley cited e-commerce as one of the reasons for his company’s financial dire straits. \n \n In addition, air travelers increasingly snubbed SkyMall’s catalogs in favor of their electronic devices, he said. SkyMall is looking for a buyer and will attempt to a scaled-down business operating during the process. \n \n Don’t dismiss mail-order businesses just yet. The industry has thrived for decades, and some companies have embraced online retail and mobile platforms to expand their customer bases, IBISWorld said. \n \n Survival will hinge on their ability to identify a target audience through demographic data and advertise their niche products to specific customers through catalogs and digital methods, the analysts said."", 'SkyMall, whose in-flight shopping catalogs have long been a staple of airline travel, has filed for bankruptcy protection, blaming changing consumer habits and the loss of contracts from two major carriers, Delta and Southwest. \n \n Xhibit Corp XBTC.PK, SkyMall\'s parent, on Friday said it hoped to sell its main assets, including the SkyMall online retail business, in April through a court-supervised auction, and then complete an ""orderly wind-down"" of its affairs. \n \n It also said it suspended its retail catalog operations on Jan. 16, laying off 47 of its 150 employees. \n \n Xhibit and SkyMall filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors on Thursday night in the U.S. bankruptcy court in Phoenix, their hometown.

Black pastors demand apology from Donald Trump \n \n Instead of endorsements, many black pastors issued Donald Trump demands for an apology for his treatment of racial minorities at a closed-door meeting at Trump Tower in New York on Monday. \n \n The demands, part of an hours-long meeting with dozens of black faith leaders that has been mired in controversy since it was announced on Wednesday, come after many leaders came under fire for meeting with Trump and after his campaign canceled the public portion of the event. But Trump, rarely one to avoid news cameras, held an impromptu press conference anyways and described the meeting as full of “love.” \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n “It went longer only because of the love. It didn\'t go longer for other reasons,” Trump said of the two-and-a-half hour session. “There were unbelievable solutions, I think, to problems that we will solve that other people won’t be able to solve.” \n \n But there were also disagreements. During the meeting, pastors demanded Trump apologize not only to the black community, but also to Mexicans for his inflammatory rhetoric, according to Bishop Orrin Pullings, a Richmond, Virginia-based pastor. \n \n “Our community really wants him to be sensitive with the way he handles people and they feel he’s insensitive,” said Pullings. “We told him that you are insensitive in appearance to our community and that’s not a good position. He listened to us and you know, I think Donald Trump is a very good listener.” \n \n But others advised Trump against backing down, according to Pullings. “Another crowd said, ‘No you should never apologize. You’re ahead in the polls now because of your big mouth … You start apologizing, you’ve got to keep apologizing.’” \n \n Pullings said Trump remained noncommittal, which he took as a sign that the mogul will not be issuing an apology any time soon. “It’s probably out of the question.” \n \n In Trump’s account of the meeting, pastors did not ask him to tone down his rhetoric. “The tone has taken me to first position in every single poll,” he told reporters afterward. “The beautiful thing about the meeting is they didn’t ask me to change the tone.” \n \n The back-and-forth echoes a similar debate that emerged among evangelical leaders at a similar meeting at Trump Tower in September. At that meeting, which included evangelical leaders of all races, several attendees challenged Trump on his habit of personally attacking critics and rivals and asked him to tone down his rhetoric while others defended Trump’s bombast. The September meeting concluded with those gathered laying hands on Trump and praying over him. \n \n Monday’s meeting was held under more contentious circumstances, and while it opened and closed with prayer, there was no laying on of hands. \n \n Trump has come under fire in the past week for condoning the rough treatment of a Black Lives Matter protester by his white supporters at a campaign rally in Alabama and for tweeting a chart with made-up statistics overstating the percentage of white murder victims killed by blacks. \n \n On Wednesday, Trump’s campaign initially announced the meeting with 100 black pastors and a press conference at which the pastors were to endorse the mogul. But backlash built quickly as other black faith leaders condemned Trump — including in an open letter published by Ebony Magazine. \n \n And on Sunday, Trump’s campaign canceled the open-press portion of the event, writing instead that it expected some pastors to issue endorsements after Monday’s closed-door meeting. \n \n Trump said Monday morning on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” that he believed the Black Lives Matter movement had pressured black clergy to withhold their endorsements of him. ""It gets publicity — unfortunately, as everything I do gets publicity — and probably some of the Black Lives Matter folks called them up and said: \'You shouldn\'t be meeting with Trump because he believes that all lives matter,\'"" he said. \n \n According to Pullings, when Trump began to defend the treatment of the Black Lives Matter protester by explaining that there were 10,000 people at the rally and he did not know the race of the man, he was interrupted by Maryland-based Bishop Michael Freeman, who told him, “I have 10,00 members. If someone yells out in my crowd I don’t have them thrown out.” \n \n Pastors also criticized Trump’s mocking impression of a New York Times reporter’s physical handicap. Though Trump and the reporter have met on several occasion and he prefaced his impression by saying, “You ought to see this guy,” Trump maintains he does not know what the reporter looks like.', 'NEW YORK (AP) — Dozens of black pastors pressed Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump on Monday to address what some called his use of racially charged rhetoric, with several describing a meeting that became tense at times as attendees raised concerns about his blunt language. \n \n Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump, center, talks with reporters while surrounded by a group of African-American religious leaders in New York, Monday, Nov. 30, 2015.

(Associated Press) \n \n While some left the gathering at Trump\'s skyscraper in midtown Manhattan with hopes their message had resonated, Trump said afterward he had no plans to change his approach, which he said had taken him to ""first position in every single poll."" \n \n ""The beautiful thing about the meeting is that they didn\'t really ask me to change the tone,"" Trump said. ""I think they really want to see victory, because ultimately it is about, we want to win and we want to win together."" \n \n At a rally later Monday in Macon, Georgia, Trump told a nearly all-white audience of about 5,000 that the meeting was ""inspiring"" and ""unbelievable."" \n \n ""It was a really terrific day,"" he said. \n \n But several pastors who met in New York with the billionaire real estate mogul, who has held a consistent lead in preference polls of GOP voters for several months due in large part to his aggressive style of campaigning, said the session was a bit more complicated. \n \n Bishop George Bloomer, who traveled to the gathering from North Carolina, said he arrived in New York with concerns about ""the racial comments that have been made and the insensitive comments that have been made,"" including an incident earlier this month in which a black protester was roughed up by Trump supporters at a rally in Birmingham, Alabama. \n \n Trump said after the incident, ""Maybe he should have been roughed up because it was absolutely disgusting what he was doing."" \n \n ""I asked him: \'Are you a racist? People are saying that about you,\'"" Bloomer said. ""If you are seeking the African-American community to support you, at the least, you\'re not helping with these kind of things that are going on."" \n \n Bloomer said he told Trump that ""if he wants to have our ear as a community, to at least tone down the rhetoric some kind of way, tone it down. And he said that he would."" \n \n Pastor Al Morgan of Launch Ministries in Raleigh, North Carolina, said part of the group\'s discussion focused on whether Trump should lighten up a bit. \n \n ""What he said was that he would take that into consideration,"" Morgan said. ""So the thing was trying to be who he is, so you have to remain true to yourself. And, in his defense, that\'s gotten him where he is. So the thing is, how do you convey a person\'s heart with their personality? That\'s the dilemma."" \n \n Trump is seeking to replace President Barack Obama, who won two terms in the White House by bringing together a coalition of young people, single women and black and Hispanic voters. \n \n Democrats maintain an enormous edge with African-American voters, with Republican presidential candidates faring poorly among minorities in the past two elections. In 2012, according to exit polls conducted for The Associated Press and television networks, 93 percent of black voters backed Obama. In 2008, the number was 95 percent. \n \n But Trump has been courting the support of evangelical black clergy members and other African-American leaders as he works to broaden his appeal in a crowded Republican field. \n \n In Georgia, radio host and failed 2012 presidential hopeful Herman Cain was among those who introduced Trump. Cain was the lone major black Republican candidate four years ago. Trump also interrupted his own 75-minute speech to bring another black Georgia Republican to the microphone. Bruce LeVell, who has served as party chairman in suburban Atlanta\'s Gwinett County, announced his endorsement, drawing roars from Trump\'s backers. \n \n Monday\'s meeting with the pastors was originally promoted by the campaign as an endorsement event, in which he would receive the backing of 100 black evangelical and religious leaders. \n \n But many of those invited to the meet-and-greet objected to that description, saying they accepted the invitation only because they wanted to challenge Trump about what he\'s said as a candidate. \n \n Trump kicked off his campaign with a speech in which he said some Mexican immigrants are rapists and criminals, and recently drew criticism for retweeting an image of inaccurate statistics that vastly overrepresented the number of whites killed by blacks, among other errors. \n \n In a letter published by Ebony magazine, more than 100 black religious leaders wrote that ""Trump\'s racially inaccurate, insensitive and incendiary rhetoric should give those charged with the care of the spirits and souls of black people great pause."" \n \n They also expressed concern that Monday\'s gathering would ""give Trump the appearance of legitimacy among those who follow your leadership and respect your position as clergy."" \n \n Pastor Victor Couzens, from Cincinnati, Ohio, said he nonetheless felt an obligation to attend the meeting to hear what Trump had to say. \n \n ""It\'s very unfortunate the way he has talked to not just the African-American community, but things he\'s said about women and Mexicans and Muslims,"" Couzens said. ""But what\'s more discouraging than the things that he has said is the fact that in the face of him saying all of these things, he continues to surge in the polls."" \n \n And some attendees emerged expressing full-throated support for Trump. \n \n ""What we were able to do today was allow people to see his heart for themselves and to make up their own minds about him,"" said Darrell Scott, the senior pastor of New Spirit Revival Center in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, who helped to organize the meeting. ""They find out that he\'s not the person that the media has depicted him to be."" \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press reporter Bill Barrow contributed from Macon, Georgia. \n \n ___ \n \n Follow Jill Colvin on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/colvinj', 'It seemed like a powerful counterpoint to the perception of Donald Trump as intolerant: A hundred black ministers and religious leaders would endorse him at his offices in Manhattan, vouching for his sensitivity and broad-mindedness. \n \n But within hours of the announcement a few days ago, furious backtracking, denials and finger-pointing were underway. \n \n By Monday afternoon, the supposed declaration of support from a cross-section of African-Americans seemed to crumble as several pastors insisted they had never agreed to attend or back Mr. Trump. In the end, his political debut with black leaders was refashioned into a private meeting with a smaller group that played down talk of endorsements. \n \n A few of those who showed up sounded uncomfortable. “It appears as if he’s a possible racist based upon some of the things he said about black America,” said Brehon Hall, a preacher from Toledo, Ohio, as he headed into the meeting at Trump Tower.', 'UPDATE, 11:19 a.m. A statement from American Airlines, posted by Staff Writer Terry Maxon on our Airline Biz Blog. \n \n This morning Flight 2332 had left the gate at DFW bound for Chicago, when an incident occurred involving some of the cabin crew.

""The Maduro regime has refused to heed this call, which has been echoed around the region and the world.

204,"['The average worker spends a full day of their work week doing things other than, well, work. \n \n A survey from staffing firm OfficeTeam found the average office employee spends 56 minutes per day using their cell phone at work for non-work activity. That’s 43% more than the 39 minutes most managers said they thought occurred. \n \n That works out to just under five hours per week of goofing off on phones. Personal email and social media made up the majority of the wasted time, with sports sites, mobile gaming, and shopping placing a far distant third, fourth, and fifth place. \n \n More than half of the 600+ office employees surveyed said they used their phones to access websites blocked by company IT departments. \n \n Phones weren’t the only ways employees waste time, though. The average employee spends 42 minutes a day—3.5 hours a week—attending to personal tasks, such as errands, according to the survey. \n \n Added together, that’s nearly 8 hours a week of total lost productivity. \n \n And if the office is mostly comprised of younger workers, the amount of lost time jumps dramatically.

Hours, if you’re like most office rats. \n \n A survey of professionals by staffing firm OfficeTeam found that office workers squander an average of 56 minutes a day, or nearly five hours a week, using their mobile devices for non-work activities in the office. \n \n Add to that another 42 minutes a day, on average, spent doing other personal tasks, and the average employee could be wasting more than eight hours per workweek on activities unrelated to their jobs. \n \n Younger workers are even bigger offenders.

""It's understandable that employees may occasionally use their mobile devices or attend to personal tasks during business hours,"" OfficeTeam's' district president says. ""But these activities can easily become big distractions."" Fortune reports that most of the personal time on phones is spent on social media and non-work email; in distant third, fourth, and fifth places come sports sites, mobile gaming, and shopping. Beyond this, the survey found that 58% of office workers visit pages their company prohibits, but there's a breakdown between the sexes: 68% of men do this, compared to just 43% of women. (In the UK, some women get time off to cope with menstrual pain.)"

The Catholic church in the Castro district has arguably the largest gay parish in the nation, and controversial new decisions have members worried about leadership, policies - even that the church might be shut down. \n \n And it all began with drag queens. \n \n When the archdiocese refused to allow drag queens to serve as emcees for charity events at the church\'s community hall, it fed rampant paranoia about antigay sentiment. The decision was initially blamed on incoming Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone, an outspoken opponent of same-sex marriage who has been championed by extreme conservative Catholic groups. Some read the drag-queen ban as a calculated slap in the face. \n \n Cordileone doesn\'t start his new job until October, but clearly the issue is bigger than drag queens at a fundraiser. The decision calls into question the responsibility of a church in the community, of the acceptance of all walks of life and the tenets of religion. \n \n ""Paranoia is very high,"" said Supervisor Scott Wiener, who represents the district. ""There are a lot of gay people for whom this religion is very important. It\'s just very, very sad."" \n \n Even the possibility of closing the church, despite its illustrious San Francisco history, seems real. \n \n ""The (incoming) archbishop holds the keys to this building,"" said church business manager Mike Poma. ""He could close us any time."" \n \n And for some, the move to quell the drag-queen decision by declaring that Ellard Hall would be closed to community events only made things worse. \n \n Most Holy Redeemer\'s new pastor, the Rev. Brian Costello, who did not return a phone call, arrived in July from a church in the Richmond District. But he made a point in his first official message to welcome ""old, young, married, gay, lesbian, transgender, affluent, home-cradle Catholics, radical, traditional, questioning and fervent."" \n \n So, while he was initially opposed to having drag queens as entertainment for two fundraisers for sobriety and wellness groups at Ellard Hall, he listened when Poma asked him to reconsider. \n \n ""I told him, this is just dinner. It\'s not a strip show,"" Poma said. ""I told him it was going to be a powder keg."" \n \n Poma says Costello responded by making two calls to the archdiocese, where the idea was turned down flat. \n \n ""We have to give (Costello) a break,"" Poma said. ""He\'s got a boss, you know. And he\'s never been immersed in gay culture in his life. He\'s learning."" \n \n What he\'s learning is that what might seem very strange in Middle America is everyday life in the Castro. Drag queens may not be mainstream, except at Most Holy Redeemer, where they regularly attend Mass. \n \n ""We had some boys in miniskirts last Sunday,"" Poma said. ""And Father Costello met with them."" \n \n It should also be said that some of the gay groups that have been using the hall have gone way over the top. Several years ago the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence featured a drag queen known as Peaches Christ, who waved a crucifix shaped like a dildo. Even longtime gay parishioners thought that was too much. \n \n The odd part of this manufactured controversy is how well the church has been working. A robust congregation of 450 to 550 members, more than 80 percent of whom are gay or lesbian, consider themselves practicing Catholics. For a religion that doesn\'t always seem welcoming to gays, that\'s impressive. \n \n So are services. Poma says he brought his mother to Mass and she couldn\'t get over the warm sound of ""all those men\'s voices."" Poma says the music at Most Holy Redeemer is so renowned that visitors come from all over the country. \n \n ""We had some the other day,"" he said. ""Afterward they said, \'You\'ve renewed my faith.\' "" \n \n Hopefully, incoming Archbishop Cordileone will also attend with an open mind. And leave with the same feeling.']",3,"– Christopher ""Big Black"" Boykin, star of MTV reality show Rob & Big, died Tuesday of an apparent heart attack at the age of 45, TMZ reports. “He was a long time and beloved member of the MTV family and will be greatly missed,"" Variety quotes MTV as saying in a statement.

The reaction to Williams’ death in August 2014 topped Google’s list... (Associated Press) \n \n SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Robin Williams\' suicide seared into the world\'s collective mindset more than anything else this year, based on what people were searching for on Google. \n \n The reaction to Williams\' death in August topped Google\'s list of 2014\'s fastest-rising search requests. It beat notable events such as the World Cup, the Ebola outbreak, the March disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 and the Ice Bucket Challenge, an Internet video craze to raise awareness and money for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig\'s Disease. \n \n Other topics of worldwide intrigue on Google included the addictive smartphone game ""Flappy Bird,"" bearded drag queen Conchita Wurst, the Middle East extremist group ISIS, the hit Disney movie ""Frozen,"" and the Winter Olympics in Russia. \n \n Williams, Ebola, the World Cup and the Ice Bucket also ranked among the most-discussed subjects this year on Facebook, which released its list last week. Google released its list Tuesday. \n \n Williams\' death drove many people to reminisce about his career highlights. In the first few days after his suicide, there was a six-fold increase in the number of Google searches for ""carpe diem"" — a Latin phrase for ""seize the day"" that Williams popularized in the film ""Dead Poets Society."" Reports about Williams\' long-running battle with depression caused searches for that term to triple. There was also a flurry of searches about his movies (the top five were: ""Mrs. Doubtfire,"" \'\'Dead Poets Society,"" \'\'Good Will Hunting,"" \'\'Jumanji"" and ""Patch Adams."") \n \n Google\'s worldwide list of the year\'s hottest search requests mirrored the activity in the U.S. with a few exceptions. Wurst didn\'t make the Top 10 list in the U.S., nor did the Winter Olympics. Instead, Web surfers in the U.S. were seeking more information about the August confrontation that culminated in a white policeman shooting and killing Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. Ukraine\'s conflict with Russia also held more intrigue in the U.S. than the rest of the world. \n \n Google\'s review follows annual roundups compiled during the previous two weeks by its main search rivals. Although Google\'s list usually comes last each year, its rankings typically provide more telling insights into what people were thinking because the company\'s technology processes about two out of every three search requests made on the Internet. \n \n Yahoo\'s search lists indicated that its websites tend to attract entertainment-minded people. While Ebola topped Yahoo\'s rankings for 2014, celebrities or entertainers occupied six of the other slots. They were singer Ariana Grande (No. 3), actress Jennifer Lawrence (No. 4), actress Kaley Cuoco (No. 5), reality TV star Kim Kardashian (No. 6), singer Miley Cyrus (No. 8) and actress Jennifer Aniston (No. 10). Yahoo\'s list was rounded out by: the video game ""Minecraft,"" whose popularity prompted Microsoft to buy it for $2.5 billion earlier this year; ""Frozen"" and Apple\'s latest gadget, the iPhone 6. \n \n Instead of doing a wide-ranging compilation of top searches, Microsoft\'s Bing separated its lists into disparate categories, such as athletes (NBA star LeBron James soared the highest), celebrities (Kardashian reigned), vacation destinations (Costa Rica) and musicians (Beyonce).', ""I’ve criticized press coverage of Apple quite a bit. \n \n But I have to acknowledge something: The company’s NSA-like secrecy makes it a bear to cover, and readers really want to read about Apple (me, too!). Those factors don’t excuse weak coverage, but they complicate providing good coverage. \n \n Today, as an example, we have this San Jose Mercury News story reporting that Apple is about to launch a digital newspaper-subscription service. \n \n First, the sourcing is thin and unclear. There’s nothing but the old passive-voice attribution in the lede: \n \n Apple is expected to announce soon a new subscription plan for newspapers, which hope tablets like the iPad will eventually provide a new source of profits as media companies struggle with declining print circulation and advertising revenue. \n \n And the second paragraph makes us doubt the accuracy of the first, relying as it does on speculation (at least as far as we know) from an outsider. \n \n Apple did not respond to a request for comment. But Roger Fidler, head of digital publishing at the Donald W. Reynolds Journalism Institute in Columbia, Mo., said Apple probably will take a 30 percent cut of all subscriptions sold through the company’s online App Store, and as much as 40 percent of the advertising revenue from publications’ apps. \n \n Finally, in the third graph we get some sourcing for the actual news: \n \n The Cupertino company has agreed to provide an opt-in function for subscribers to allow Apple to share with publishers their information, which includes vital data that news organizations use to attract advertisers, industry sources say. \n \n Anonymous sourcing is fine here. It’s either that or nothing. But it’s the only time any of the news angle is sourced in the whole story, and the only piece of news that looks solid. Look at the weasel words in the first two graphs—all at critical places: “is expected to… soon… probably… as much as…” \n \n Again, it’s extremely tough to cover this company, but this isn’t good enough. Look at some of the headlines of the blog rewrites on Google News: \n \n — Rumor: Apple will announce newspaper subscription plan \n \n — Rumor: Apple to announce newspaper subscription service \n \n — Rumor Alert! Apple Reaches Newspaper Subscription Deal \n \n Those are three of the 165 news results so far. The market is so starved for any nugget of news or “news” about Apple that when a scrap appears, it gets rewritten and repackaged almost immediately by hundreds of online outlets. Pageviews soar. \n \n So let’s be honest here, that—rather than the difficulty of reporting around Steve Jobs & Co.—is what causes news organizations to forego their standards when it comes to Apple (although in this case it doesn’t hurt that everybody assumes that Apple is going to do some deal with newspapers anyway). \n \n Otherwise they’d rather be scooped than have their work labeled “rumor,” accurately, by a bunch of bloggers who know it when they see it. \n \n And if you want my guess (pure speculation—labeled as such!) I’d say newspapers won’t give Steve Jobs 30 percent cut. Far be it from me to overestimate the business prowess and intelligence of newspaper executives, but surely they’re not so dumb as to give him nearly a third of a recurring revenue stream. \n \n — Further Reading: \n \n The Press in the Reality Distortion Field: Gossip, rumor, rank speculation—all on the table if it’s an Apple product \n \n Steve Jobs, Holy Moses. Did you hear the one about the most-anticipated tablet since the Ten Commandments? Yes. Over and over and over… \n \n The Dead Go On the Record in The Wall Street Journal: The paper held Apple director’s newsmaking comments until after his death. \n \n Advertising for Apple: We’re not even talking about the crush of breathless stories and live blogs that accompany its pronouncements. \n \n Has America ever needed a media watchdog more than now?

Reaction to his death tops this year's list, the AP reports. Some notable examples: In the first few days after, the number of searches for ""carpe diem,"" a phrase Williams popularized in Dead Poets Society, increased six-fold; searches related to depression tripled; and many people also searched for information related to his movies (especially Mrs. Doubtfire, Dead Poets Society, Good Will Hunting, Jumanji, and Patch Adams.)

207,"['The U.S. Census Bureau reported Wednesday that 16 million children living in America received food stamps in 2014, or about one out of every five kids. \n \n Census said that number is up dramatically from 2007, before the Great Recession, when 9 million kids were receiving food stamps, or about one in eight. The data comes from Census’ 2014 survey on families. \n \n “The rate of children living with married parents who receive food stamps has doubled since 2007,” Census said. \n \n The findings are likely to bolster claims from some Republicans that the Obama administration seems to have a goal of putting more people under government aid programs. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich in 2012 called President Barack Obama the “food stamp president,” which led some to say his comment was racist. \n \n The debate over food stamps has led to a sort of chicken-and-egg argument between Republicans and Democrats. The GOP has said the end of the recession should allow Congress to reduce spending on food stamps. \n \n While Democrats have tried to give President Barack Obama credit for a rebounding economy, they also note that millions of additional people are using food stamps, and that the program should not be cut yet. The total number of people using food stamps has almost doubled since the start of the Great Recession, to nearly 48 million in 2013. \n \n The number finally dipped from that peak in 2014, but just a little, to about 46 million people. \n \n Republicans have tried since 2013 to cut food stamp spending, as part of their overall plan to slow spending and get control of the budget deficit. In 2013, the House voted to cut $39 billion from food stamps over a decade, and almost a year ago, President Barack Obama signed a final deal that will cut just $8.7 billion from the program over ten years. \n \n That cut was estimated to reduce food stamp benefits by about $90 per month for the hundreds of thousands of homes that use them.', 'WASHINGTON The number of children in the United States relying on food stamps for a meal spiked to 16 million last year, according federal data, signaling a lopsided economic recovery in which lower income families are still lagging behind. \n \n The roughly one in five children who received food stamps in 2014 surpassed pre-recession levels, when one in eight or 9 million children were on food stamps, according to the U.S. Census survey of American families released on Wednesday \n \n Republicans in Congress have sought to cut back on the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program or food stamp program as part of a larger plan to balance the budget. \n \n Early last year lawmakers proposed $40 billion in cuts from the program over 10 years. The final farm bill signed into law trimmed $8.6 billion from the program, eliminating benefits for about 850,000 people, according to estimates by anti-hunger advocates. \n \n Other findings of the survey show a rapidly changing America in which more children are being raised in single-parent homes and more young people are delaying marriage. \n \n Of the 73.7 million children under 18 in the United States, 27 percent were living in single parent homes last year, tripling the 9 percent in 1960. \n \n The number of marriages also dwindled last year with less than half of households in America made up of married couples, compared to three-quarters in 1940, the survey found. \n \n The median age for people first getting married in 2014 was 29 for men and 27 for women up from 24 and 21 respectively in 1947. \n \n (Reporting by Elvina Nawaguna; Editing by Sandra Maler)', 'The number of children receiving food stamps remains higher than it was before the start of the Great Recession in 2007, according to the U.S. Census Bureau’s annual Families and Living Arrangements table package released today. \n \n \n \n The rate of children living with married parents who receive food stamps has doubled since 2007. In 2014, an estimated 16 million children, or about one in five, received food stamp assistance compared with the roughly 9 million children, or one in eight, that received this form of assistance prior to the recession. \n \n \n \n These statistics come from the 2014 Current Population Survey’s Annual Social and Economic Supplement, which has collected statistics on families and living arrangements for more than 60 years. Today’s table package delves into the characteristics of households, including the marital status of the householders and their relationship to the children residing in the household. The historical data on America’s families and living arrangements can be found on census.gov.', 'Barry Brecheisen/Getty Images There is no question that Americans are frustrated with their elected officials, but the latest Gallup poll shows that frustration has reached a fever pitch, plummeting Congress to its lowest approval rating in history. Just 10 percent of Americans approve of the job Congress is doing, fewer than at any previous point in Gallup\'s nearly 40 years of polling. With an approval rating that low, it is hard to find anything that is actually less popular than Congress. In the nearly half a century-long history of Gallup polling, the only people or institutions that have been more unpopular than the current Congress are Fidel Castro, Saddam Hussein, Osama bin Laden and Mark Fuhrman, a detective in the O.J. Simpson murder trial, said Gallup\'s Editor in Chief Frank Newport. Here\'s a look at some of the things Americans like more than Congress: \n \n Derick E. Hingle/Bloomberg /Getty Images BP During the Oil Spill At the height of the BP oil spill in 2010, while thousands of barrels of crude oil were streaming into the Gulf of Mexico daily, the BP oil company, which owned the gushing offshore rig, had a higher approval rating than Congress currently has. A June 2010 Gallup poll shows that 16 percent of respondents approved of how BP was handling the spill, which went uncapped for two months. \n \n Jacques DeMarthon/AFP/Getty Images Socialism It\'s a label than many of Obama\'s critics have attempted to plaster on the president\'s re-election campaign like the scarlet A on Hester Prynne\'s dress. But judging by the latest polls, socialism is actually more popular than Congress. Three times as many people have a positive view of socialism than have a positive view of Congress. According to a CBS/New York Times poll released last month, 33 percent of Americans view socialism positively. \n \n John Moore/Getty Images Waterboarding More people think waterboarding, where interrogators pour water over a prisoner\'s face so they feel like they are drowning, should be used as an interrogation tactic against suspected terrorists than support Congress. According to a November CNN/ORC poll an even 50 percent of respondents said Waterboarding should be allowed. The same poll found that 31 percent of Americans do not think the practice is torture while 68 percent said it is torture. \n \n Getty Images Abortion In a July ABC/Washington Post poll 19 percent of respondents supported abortion being legal ""in all cases,"" nearly double the percentage of people who support the current Congress. A slightly smaller percentage were on the opposite end of the spectrum, with 15 percent of respondents saying abortion should be outlawed in every circumstances. \n \n Pierre Manevy/Express/Getty Images President Nixon In the midst of one of the greatest scandals in presidential history, President Richard Nixon had a higher approval rating that Congress currently has. A 1974 Gallup poll shows that 24 percent of Americans supported the president at the height of the Watergate scandal. \n \n Getty Images Santa Clause Non-Believers More people in the United States have never believed in Santa Clause than currently put their faith in Congress. An AP/Gfk poll in December showed that 16 percent of Americans did not believe in Old Saint Nick as a child. Put another way, roughly the same number of people believe or have believed in Santa as currently disapprove of Congress. Cue Congressional Scrooge/Grinch jokes… \n \n Yiannis Liakos/AFP/Getty Images Prime Minister of Greece More than twice as many people approve of the job Greek leader George Papandreou did in 2011, the year his country plummeted into the worst debt crises in the Western world, than support the U.S. Congress. Even after Papandreou resigned amid Greece\'s debt catastrophe, 21 percent of respondents worldwide still supported him, according to a worldwide Gallup poll conducted throughout 2011. \n \n Seth Wenig/AP Photo Occupy Wall Street The groups representing outraged citizens on both ends of the political spectrum – Occupy Wall Street and the Tea Party – both have more support than the current Congress.

That number is particularly alarming when compared to pre-recession levels: In 2007, some 9 million, or one in eight, kids were on food stamps. There are currently about 46 million Americans total on food stamps, down from the 2013 peak of 48 million. The jump signals what Reuters says is a ""lop-sided"" economic recovery that has left low-income people behind, but it also underscores a fundamental partisan divide over social welfare programs. As the Blaze notes, Republicans want to scale back the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program—arguing that the end of the recession should indicate less need—and trimmed $8.6 billion and 850,000 people from its rolls with last year's farm bill. Democrats, meanwhile, argue that it's too soon to scale back the program. Meanwhile, some other highlights from the Census numbers: 27% of children live in single-parent homes, three times the 9% who did in 1960 10% of kids live with a grandparent, 15% have a stay-at-home mom, 0.6% have a stay-at-home dad, and 38% have at least one foreign-born parent 48% of households are made up of married couples, down from 76% in 1940 Americans are continuing to marry later, at a median age of 29 for men and 27 for women; that's up from 24 and 21 in 1947"
208,"['Study Highlights: \n \n A commonly used heartburn medication caused blood vessel cells to age faster in laboratory testing. \n \n These findings could help explain recent reports linking long-term use of heartburn medication to several serious illnesses, including heart disease, kidney disease and dementia. \n \n Clinical studies still are necessary to determine if the drugs damage blood vessel cells within the body. \n \n Embargoed until 3 p.m. CT / 4 p.m. ET Tuesday, May 10, 2016 \n \n DALLAS, May 10, 2016 — A popular over-the-counter medication for heartburn, caused laboratory blood vessel cells to age quicker, according to new research in Circulation Research, an American Heart Association journal. \n \n Reflux, often called heartburn, occurs when stomach acid backs up into the esophagus, causing irritation and damage. Mild reflux is fairly common, but frequent, severe occurrences, known as GERD for gastroesophageal reflux disease, can cause significant discomfort and may require treatment. Many people find relief by using over-the-counter medications called proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), which reduce acid produced by the stomach. In fact, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration estimates that 1 in 14 Americans have used PPIs. \n \n After recent evidence linking long-term PPI use to several serious illnesses, including heart disease, kidney disease and dementia, researcher sought to identify how PPIs increase risk by studying their effects on blood vessel cells. \n \n Now, researchers at Houston Methodist Research Institute (HMRI) say they have discovered that long term exposure to PPIs “accelerated biological aging in human endothelial cells which line the inside of blood vessels. When healthy, human endothelial cells create a Teflon-like coating that prevents blood from sticking. When older and diseased, the endothelium becomes more like Velcro, with blood elements sticking to the vessel to form blockages.” \n \n They also found that long-term PPI exposure impairs acid production by the lysosomes in the cells lining the blood vessel walls. They noted that the lysosome — the part of the cell that typically clears waste products — did not produce enough acid to clear waste. In turn, the buildup of waste caused the cell to age rapidly. Notably, another type of antacid known as an H2 antagonist, did not have this adverse effect. \n \n “Lysosomes are like the garbage disposal of cells,” said John P. Cooke, M.D., Ph.D., study lead author and professor and chair of the Department of Cardiovascular Sciences at the HMRI and director of the Houston Methodist Research Institute Center for Cardiovascular Regeneration in Texas. “They need to generate acid to get rid of cellular rubbish, and when cellular rubbish accumulates the cells age faster.” \n \n Although PPIs can be effective for short-term use, they are not meant for extended treatment, researchers said. PPIs do not require a prescription or doctor’s supervision, which can lead to overuse. \n \n “With the knowledge that PPIs are being used by millions of people for indications and durations that were never tested or approved, it may be time for the pharmaceutical industry and regulatory agencies to re-visit the specificity and the safety of these agents,” Cooke said. “Unless otherwise indicated, physicians should consider PPIs only for short-term use for relief of symptoms of GERD, since we now have a ‘smoking gun’ that helps explain the consistent observational evidence of increased risk.” \n \n Cooke added that there are other approaches to long-term treatment that might be considered for GERD including H2 antagonists, lifestyle modifications, and in severe cases, surgical approaches. \n \n The current one has several limitations. Although two different PPIs were tested, only one of these esomeprazole (brand name Nexium) is commercially available. In addition, it did not show how PPIs actually impair the lysosome’s ability to produce enough acid to clear waste. Finally, since this study was in a laboratory setting, it could not show whether PPIs act in the same way within the human body, and long-term clinical trials are necessary. \n \n Co-authors are Gautham Yepuri, Ph.D.; Roman Sukhovershin, Ph.D.; Timo Z.

It feels a little bit like a 21st century urban Western. It’s “Pulp Fiction” meets “La La Land,” and why shouldn’t those two meet? (Wright is also clearly a fan of the films of Walter Hill — the veteran director even has a cameo in this film — and I wouldn’t be surprised if he really dug Nicolas Winding Refn’s “Drive” as well.) \n \n The appropriately baby-faced Ansel Elgort delivers a charming and cocky and infectious and borderline irritating performance as Baby, who is charming and cocky and infectious and, yes, borderline irritating. \n \n Baby is a savant behind the wheel who doesn’t talk much, rarely goes without shades and is always, always wearing ear buds and grooving to his iPod tunes, the better to drown out the constant ringing in his ears from tinnitus that’s plagued him since a tragic car accident when he was just a boy. \n \n We meet Baby as he’s parked outside a downtown bank in a bright red, tricked-out Subaru. He fidgets with his iPod and clicks on “Bellbottoms” by the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion. \n \n A moment later, three armed robbers come flying out of the bank and dive into Baby’s car. Baby cranks up the volume, races the engine, shifts gears — and off we go on one of the most creative and exhilarating car chases you’ll ever see. \n \n At the obligatory rendezvous in a remote warehouse, we get to know the team of hardened criminals that pulled off the heist. There’s the tattooed and menacing Griff (Jon Bernthal); the weirdly coiffed and dangerous but outwardly amiable Buddy (Jon Hamm), and Buddy’s tough and gorgeous and wisecracking wife Darling (Eiza Gonzalez). \n \n Oh, and a perfectly deadpan Kevin Spacey is Doc, the big boss and mastermind who plans the heists and hires various gun-persons for each job — the only constant being Baby behind the wheel, because Baby never gets caught and Baby has become Doc’s good-luck charm. (Also, Baby owes Doc and doesn’t have a choice. We’ll leave it at that.) \n \n Writer-director Wright serves up familiar, almost corny tropes that might have us rolling our eyes if we didn’t feel we were in on the references. Lily James is the sweet-faced Debora, a dreamy waitress who talks and moves as if she’s in a 1950s B-romance. CJ Jones is Baby’s foster father, Joseph, who is deaf and mute and in a wheelchair. Jamie Foxx is sensational as Bats, the obligatory bloodthirsty maniac who’s so psycho he even freaks out semi-psycho fellow criminals. \n \n We even get the old “One last job and then I’m out!” plot development. \n \n Yet nothing about “Baby Driver” feels like a retread. The dialogue pops and crackles with sharp one-liners, the chase sequences are gritty and exuberant and fueled by the eclectic pop soundtrack, the editing is tight and timely and the performances are spectacular. \n \n At one point during a shootout sequence, each blast of gunfire is in sync with the rhythm section of the pop song on the soundtrack. It’s goofy and precise and really, really cool. \n \n “Baby Driver” is rich with intriguing characters. I’d love to see an entire movie about Hamm’s Buddy and Gonzalez’ Darling, and how they got to where they are. (In a tense diner scene, the seemingly unhinged Bats speculates about their back story, drilling deeper and deeper, and seems to be hitting some pretty serious nerves, judging by their expressions.) \n \n And what’s the deal with Spacey’s Doc? He knows all and sees all, and he’s capable of cold and calculating retribution if someone crosses him — and yet he has an almost fatherly affection for Baby. Where did THIS guy come from? \n \n In sepia-toned flashbacks, we learn about Baby’s beloved mother — a singer with the voice of an angel — and his monstrous father. In brief fantasy sequences, Debora appears as a black-and-white vision. Like Baby’s mother, she is pure and lovely and she represents all that is good and innocent and wonderful about life. \n \n As opposed to the maniacs with guns who want Baby dead after Baby makes some, shall we say, questionable decisions. \n \n And all the while, we hear the soundtrack feeding Baby’s every move and reflecting Baby’s every mood — literally dozens of songs, from “Tequila” by the Champs to “Brighton Rock” by Queen to “Nowhere to Run” by Martha Reeves & the Vandellas to “Radar Love” by Golden Earring to “Hocus Pocus” by Focus, arguably the most ridiculous and undeniably catchy gimmick tune of the 1970s. \n \n It all works. All of it. The music, the performances, the twists and turns in the plot, the sheer energy and life force of the movie. \n \n If you see this movie and tell me you didn’t have a great time, we’re going to have to sit down and talk about your idea of a great time. \n \n ★★★★ \n \n TriStar Pictures presents a film written and directed by Edgar Wright. Rated R (for violence and language throughout). Running time: 113 minutes. Opens Wednesday at local theaters.']",3,"– Heartburn is a big problem in the US. In fact, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), which are used to treat acid reflux and heartburn, are among the most prescribed drugs in the country, with millions taking them, and they're becoming more widely available over-the-counter, reports CNN. But a preliminary report just released by the American Heart Association is concerned that the drug—already associated with a higher risk of heart attack and other vascular problems, as the AHA reported earlier this year—may also increase one's risk of ischemic stroke, the most common type caused when a clot cuts off blood flow to the brain. ""At one time, PPIs were thought to be safe, without major side effects,"" the study's lead author says. “This study further questions the cardiovascular safety of these drugs."" Researchers followed nearly a quarter-million patients in Denmark who were suffering from stomach pain and indigestion and had an endoscopy. Their average age was 57, and six years later those taking one of four PPIs (Prilosec, Protonix, Prevacid, or Nexium) had a 21% higher risk of stroke than those not taking one. Lowest-dose PPIs didn't increase the risk much if at all, while highest-dose increased it, from 30% for Prevacid to 94% for Protonix. Another type of acid-lowering meds called H2 blockers (think Pepcid and Zantac) showed no elevated risk. ""As a culture, we tend to want a pill to deal with our problems, when a lot of people could reduce their heartburn by eating smaller meals, drinking less alcohol, or not smoking,"" one doc told CNN in 2010. (PPIs are also associated with a higher risk of dementia.)"

That\'s because her first was born on Aug, 8, 2008, her second on Sept. 9, 2009 and her most recent on Oct. 10, 2010. Yes, that\'s 8-8-08, 9-9-09 and 10-10-10. The Rockford, Mich., mom and husband Chad weren\'t thinking about dates when their children were born. Their doctor had to give drugs to start labor for the couple\'s first daughter, Chloe Corrin Soper, who was born full term on Aug. 8 at Spectrum Health\'s Butterworth Hospital in Grand Rapids, Mich. Their son was a surprise all around. ""He wasn\'t a planned baby at all, he was a miracle,"" says Barbara Soper. He was due on Sept. 20, 2009, but because sister Chloe\'s birth had caused some hemorrhaging, their doctor, Andrew Van Slooten, suggested he come out a little early so he\'d be smaller. Soper was started on drugs to induce labor on Sept. 8, but it took 24 hours before Cameron Dane Soper made his way into the world, arriving on 9-9-09. Soper says she and her husband had thought it would be ""neat"" if their third child was born on 10-10-10 but because her due date wasn\'t until Nov. 4, it seemed unlikely. But it ended up being ""kind of a mandatory eviction,"" says Soper. She developed blood clots in her legs and three weeks before her due date doctors told her the baby needed to be delivered. The induction was begun on 10-9-10, but it wasn\'t until 6:53 on Sunday night, 10-10-10, that Cearra Nicole Soper arrived. Despite being three weeks early, ""she\'s feeding well,"" says mom. ""She\'s a trooper."" While the dates might seem ""incredibly rare,"" they\'re really not. Such a lineup can only happen in the first 12 years of the century and at least 10 months apart, says Shannon McWeeney, a professor of biostatistics at the Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland. ""Given that the first birth occurred in that window, the probability is not as astronomical as you might be compelled to think,"" she says.In fact, it\'s not that high a number at all, says Philip Stark, a professor of statistics at the University of California, Berkeley. ""The \'chance\' you get depends on the assumptions you make,"" he says. One set of assumptions gives a chance of about 1 in 50 million. More realistic assumptions — including allowing at least 11 months between births — increases it to about 1 in 2,500. Since thousands of women in the United States had kids in 2008, 2009 and 2010, this suddenly seems a little less extraordinary. But humans ""like to look for patterns, to make sense of things"" he says.For the Sopers, three is simply their lucky number — ""we don\'t have any more planned,"" says Barbara.

That\'s because it was the third baby for the Soper family born on a numerical anomaly. \n \n Baby number one came on 8-8-08. Baby number two came on 9-9-09, and, yes, Sunday was 10-10-10. \n \n It\'s an almost impossibly cool coincidence -- especially when you consider her third baby wasn\'t due until November of this year but came early, and she didn\'t schedule C-sections with any of the kids. \n \n But let\'s do a little math of our own here, shall we? \n \n Barbara Soper has been either pregnant or recovering from giving birth since late 2007. It is now late 2010. \n \n Can we send her some condolence cards along with those congratulatory bouquets? \n \n Many women who have had their kids in quick succession tout the advantages to getting their childbearing over in one fell swoop: having little to no break in between the kids means they\'re closer in age and can play with each other on almost the same level; once you potty train one you can start the next one and escape the diaper stage faster; and of course you don\'t have the ""lost baby weight, now I\'m pregnant again"" conundrum. \n \n But there\'s a reason doctors discourage the practice. \n \n Pregnancy and childbirth both do a number on the body -- especially the uterus, your baby\'s house for the next nine months. It takes a minimum of six weeks after delivery to return to its normal size, but it still needs time to recover to again be a hospitable home for a fetus. \n \n New studies have likewise found women really DO need to lose that baby weight before embarking on a new pregnancy. As counter-intuitive as it sounds, there\'s less strain on the body (and less risk to the fetus) if your body has gone back down to a healthy weight before the next pregnancy begins. \n \n Add to that, if you\'re planning to nurse your kids for longer than nine months, it\'s possible to do it -- but it\'s needlessly complicated when babies are born one on top of another. \n \n Barbara and Chad Soper say she never planned for this to happen. Her son was a surprise pregnancy, and her second and third children were born earlier than their due dates -- she was due on September 20, 2009 with Cameron, who was born September 9, and little Cearra born this month was actually due November 4. \n \n Congrats to the family on their mathematical surprises! \n \n Does anyone have tips for them on three kids under 3? \n \n Image via Spectrum Health', 'Cairo (CNN) -- Police on Monday arrested the head of the defense team for the 21 women and girls sentenced for protesting in Egypt last month, a colleague and member of the defense team told CNN. \n \n Lawyer Ahmed El-Hamrawy was arrested at his home in Alexandria at dawn Monday, lawyer Mahmoud Farouq told CNN.

The harsh sentence sparked wide criticism of the way the Interior Ministry and the judiciary have been handling the cases of Morsy supporters. An appeals hearing for their case is scheduled to take place Saturday. \n \n ""We don\'t have any doubt that this verdict is a new episode in a series of politicized judicial rulings, which include the sentencing of several Al-Azhar students to 17 years for various misdemeanors based on accusations that are mostly trumped up and generalized,"" said a joint statement issued by 14 rights groups last week. \n \n Egyptian lawmakers begin vote on new constitution \n \n The verdict coincided with an increasing crackdown on non-Islamist activists who oppose the military-led regime and Morsy.

210,"['WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald J. Trump on Thursday named David M. Friedman, a bankruptcy lawyer aligned with the Israeli far right, as his nominee for ambassador to Israel, elevating a campaign adviser who has questioned the need for a two-state solution and has likened left-leaning Jews in America to the Jews who aided the Nazis in the Holocaust. \n \n Mr. Friedman, whose outspoken views stand in stark contrast to decades of American policy toward Israel, did not wait long on Thursday to signal his intention to upend the American approach. In a statement from the Trump transition team announcing his nomination, he said he looked forward to doing the job “from the U.S. embassy in Israel’s eternal capital, Jerusalem.” \n \n Through decades of Republican and Democratic administrations, the embassy has been in Tel Aviv, as the State Department insists that the status of Jerusalem — which both Israel and the Palestinians see as their rightful capital — can be determined only through negotiations as part of an overall peace deal. \n \n Mr. Friedman, who has no diplomatic experience, has said that he does not believe it would be illegal for Israel to annex the occupied West Bank and he supports building new settlements there, which Washington has long condemned as illegitimate and an obstacle to peace.', 'WASHINGTON (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump has announced that he will nominate attorney David Friedman as U.S. ambassador to Israel, selecting an envoy who supports Israeli settlements and other changes to U.S. policies in the region. Friedman said he looked forward to carrying out his duties from ""the U.S. embassy in Israel\'s eternal capital, Jerusalem,"" even though the embassy is in Tel Aviv. \n \n Like some of his predecessors, Trump has vowed to move the American embassy to Jerusalem, a politically charged act that would anger Palestinians who want east Jerusalem as part of their sovereign territory. The move would also distance the U.S. from most of the international community, including its closest allies in Western Europe and the Arab world. \n \n The president-elect said Friedman would ""maintain the special relationship"" between the U.S. and Israel. \n \n But the announcement sparked anger from liberal Jewish groups. Jeremy Ben-Ami, the president of J Street, called nominating Friedman ""reckless,"" citing his support for settlements and his questioning of a two-state solution with the Palestinians. \n \n The statement doesn\'t detail how Friedman could work in Jerusalem. However, Trump advisers have insisted in recent days that the president-elect will follow through on his call for moving the embassy. \n \n ""He has made that promise,"" Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway told reporters Thursday. ""I can guarantee you, just generally, he\'s a man who is going to accomplish many things very quickly."" \n \n One option Trump allies have discussed would involve Friedman, if confirmed by the Senate, working out of an existing U.S. consulate in Jerusalem. According to a person who has discussed the plan with Trump advisers, the administration would essentially deem the facility the American embassy by virtue of the ambassador working there. \n \n It\'s unclear how far those discussions have gotten or whether Trump himself has been briefed on the proposal.

Bush promised to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, but backed away from the idea once in office. \n \n Israel captured east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war and annexed it in a move that is not internationally recognized. It claims the entire city as its capital. The Palestinians seek east Jerusalem, home to key Jewish, Muslim and Christian holy sites, as the capital of their future state. \n \n Virtually all embassies to Israel are located in or around Tel Aviv. \n \n Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat told The Associated Press this week that he has been in touch with Trump\'s staff about the embassy issue.

Friedman says he looks forward to carrying out his duties from ""the US embassy in Israel's eternal capital, Jerusalem,"" even though the embassy is in Tel Aviv. Like some of his predecessors, Trump has vowed to move the American embassy to Jerusalem, a politically charged act that would anger Palestinians who want east Jerusalem as part of their sovereign territory. The move would also distance the US from most of the international community, including its closest allies in Western Europe and the Arab world. The president-elect says Friedman will ""maintain the special relationship"" between the US and Israel. But the announcement sparked anger from liberal Jewish groups, with the president of J Street calling Friedman's nomination ""reckless,"" citing his support for settlements and his questioning of a two-state solution with the Palestinians. (Friedman has previously likened liberal Jews in the US to Jews who aided the Nazis during World War II, notes the New York Times.) The statement doesn't detail how Friedman could work in Jerusalem. One option would involve Friedman, if confirmed by the Senate, working out of an existing US consulate in Jerusalem. The administration would essentially deem the facility the American embassy by virtue of the ambassador working there."
211,"['Presence of 3rd person\'s genetic markers never before revealed \n \n John Ramsey looks on as his wife Patsy Ramsey holds an ad promising a reward for information leading to the conviction of the killer of their 6-year-old daughter, JonBenet, during a television interview on May 1, 1997. Eleven years later, Boulder\'s top prosecutor exonerated the Ramseys — but a new independent analysis of DNA evidence in the case calls that into question. ( Patrick Davison / Rocky Mountain News via AP ) \n \n The DNA evidence in the JonBenet Ramsey case doesn\'t support a pivotal and controversial development in Colorado\'s most vexing unsolved murder — a former Boulder prosecutor\'s decision to clear the girl\'s family from all suspicion in her death, a joint Daily Camera/9NEWS investigation has found. \n \n Forensic experts who examined the results of DNA tests obtained exclusively by the two news organizations disputed former District Attorney Mary Lacy\'s conclusion that a DNA profile found in one place on JonBenet\'s underpants and two locations on her long johns was necessarily the killer\'s — which Lacy had asserted in clearing JonBenet\'s family of suspicion. \n \n In fact, those experts said the evidence showed that the DNA samples recovered from the long johns came from at least two people in addition to JonBenet — something Lacy\'s office was told, according to documents obtained by the Camera and 9NEWS, but that she made no mention of in clearing the Ramseys. \n \n The presence of a third person\'s genetic markers has never before been publicly revealed. \n \n Additionally, the independent experts raised the possibility that the original DNA sample recovered from JonBenet\'s underwear — long used to identify or exclude potential suspects — could be a composite and not that of a single individual. \n \n About this story Charlie Brennan of the Daily Camera and Kevin Vaughan of 9NEWS exclusively obtained laboratory test results and reports from the JonBenet Ramsey case on which then-Boulder County District Attorney Mary Lacy based her decision to exonerate members of the Ramsey family. The reporters sought a review of that evidence by independent experts. This is the result of their investigation. \n \n More from 9NEWS See additional coverage of the DNA evidence in the JonBenet Ramsey case at 9 and 10 p.m. Thursday and Friday on KUSA-Channel 9, or watch the full report at 9NEWS.com. \n \n ""It\'s a rather obvious point, but I mean, if you\'re looking for someone that doesn\'t exist, because actually it\'s several people, it\'s a problem,"" said Troy Eid, a former U.S. Attorney for Colorado. \n \n The documents obtained by the Camera and 9NEWS included results from the actual DNA testing process on the long johns and summary reports sent to Lacy\'s office in the months leading up her July 9, 2008, letter exonerating the Ramseys. \n \n The experts who examined the laboratory results at the request of the Camera and 9NEWS reached similar conclusions on multiple points: \n \n • Two of the three samples that led Lacy to declare publicly that no one in the Ramsey family could be responsible for the murder actually appear to include genetic material from at least three people: JonBenet, the person whose DNA profile originally was located in JonBenet\'s underwear during testing in the late 1990s and early 2000s, plus at least one additional as-yet-unidentified person or persons. Consequently, its meaning is far from clear. \n \n • The DNA profile referred to as Unknown Male 1 — first identified during testing on the panties — may not be the DNA of a single person at all, but, rather, a composite of genetic material from multiple individuals. As a result, it may be worthless as evidence. \n \n • The presence of that DNA on JonBenet\'s underwear and long johns, be it from one or multiple people, may very well be innocent; the profiles were developed from minute samples that could have been the result of inconsequential contact with other people, or transferred from another piece of clothing. If true, it would contradict the assertions that DNA will be key to finding JonBenet\'s killer. \n \n A Boulder police officer sits in her cruiser on Jan. 3, 1997, outside the 15th Street home in which 6-year-old JonBenet Ramsey was found dead on Dec. 26, 1996. The murder remains unsolved nearly 20 years later. (David Zalubowski / Associated Press) \n \n This represents the first time independent experts have reviewed the DNA evidence on which Lacy based her widely questioned exoneration of the family. \n \n And the findings could cut both ways. \n \n ""It\'s certainly possible that an intruder was responsible for the murder, but I don\'t think that the DNA evidence proves it,"" said William C. Thompson, a professor in the Department of Criminology, Law and Society at the University of California-Irvine and an internationally respected authority on DNA evidence and its applications in the criminal justice system. \n \n Similarly, the findings don\'t implicate or exonerate anyone in the family. \n \n Ramsey lawyer Lin Wood, who has not reviewed the documents or the work of the experts consulted by the Camera and 9NEWS, said, however, ""I have absolute and total confidence in the integrity of former District Attorney Mary Lacy, and I am also aware of internet comments by former Boulder police Chief Mark Beckner where he, within the last several months, affirmed that the Ramsey case was a DNA case. \n \n ""So I know what Chief Beckner has said publicly in recent months, I know what ... former District Attorney Mary Lacy has said, and until someone impugns her integrity, or contradicts former Chief Beckner\'s statement, I continue to believe, as I have said before, that this is a DNA case and that the best chance for solving the case will be a hit and match on the DNA in the future. I hope that day comes."" \n \n \'The silver bullet misfired\' \n \n Lacy was long known as a believer in the Ramseys\' innocence, something others noticed as early as June 1998, when Boulder police detectives put on a detailed two-day presentation of the evidence and sought either charges against John and Patsy Ramsey or a grand jury investigation. \n \n ""My impression of her response to that was that she was among the very, very skeptical,"" said former Adams County District Attorney Bob Grant, who attended the police presentation in his role as adviser to then-Boulder County District Attorney Alex Hunter. \n \n The experts consulted by the Camera and 9NEWS suggested that Lacy may have been guilty of ""confirmation bias,"" a phenomenon in which investigators become so blinded by their own theories that they give extra credence to evidence that supports them, and ignore evidence that does not. \n \n The lab that performed the DNA testing, for example, told Lacy in March 2008 that it was ""likely"" the two samples found on JonBenet\'s long johns came from ""more than two people"" and ""should not be considered a single-source profile,"" according to the documents obtained by the Camera and 9NEWS. \n \n But in exonerating the Ramseys with a three-page letter made public July 9, 2008, Lacy failed to disclose any of that, writing that ""the previously identified profile from the crotch of the underwear worn by JonBenet at the time of the murder matched the DNA recovered from the long johns."" \n \n The word ""match"" actually never appears in the reports from Bode Technology, which conducted the testing in March through June of 2008. \n \n Similarly, the Camera and 9NEWS have learned that investigators in Lacy\'s office suggested no additional testing was needed once they learned male DNA had been located on the long johns that she later labeled as a ""match"" to the DNA found in JonBenet\'s panties. \n \n Correspondence from an investigator on Lacy\'s staff indicated that ""my bosses"" were ""very excited"" and ""pleased"" about the purported match, ""and don\'t see the need for additional testing (unless you strongly recommend otherwise)."" \n \n The twin realities pointed to by the experts — that the genetic profile may not be from a single individual and that DNA on the girl\'s clothing may have landed there innocently — turn on its head Lacy\'s assertion that investigators had identified the killer\'s genetic fingerprint and that it was the key critical to solving the case. \n \n Thompson, the UC-Irvine professor, noted that many people have come to see DNA evidence as a foolproof ""silver bullet"" to solving many crimes. \n \n ""Here, the silver bullet misfired,"" said Thompson, one of the experts who reviewed the evidence at the news organizations\' request. \n \n \'Something I can\'t explain\' \n \n Former Colorado Gov. Bill Owens, who called for a review of the Ramsey case in October 1999 to determine whether it merited the attention of a statewide grand jury — his panel of advisers told him it did not — said Lacy\'s exoneration made no sense to him at the time and is even more troubling now. \n \n ""This is an important development. This is new information,"" Owens said. \n \n ""She knew, based on your investigation, that this DNA wasn\'t necessarily from one person and that it, in fact, was potentially accumulated DNA,"" Owens said. ""She knew it at the time, and why she used this evidence to clear the Ramsey family ... is something I can\'t explain. And she should explain."" \n \n Lacy did not respond to repeated requests for comment on this story, sent to her by email, U.S. mail and left at her home. \n \n Donald R. Von Hagen, a spokesman for Virginia-based Bode Cellmark Forensics, as the lab is now known, said in an email that the company\'s report ""stands on its own"" and that he would not have further comment. \n \n The murder of JonBenet exploded into the national consciousness within days of the discovery of her body on Dec. 26, 1996, in the sprawling home she shared with her parents, John and Patsy Ramsey, and older brother, Burke, on 15th Street in Boulder. The 6-year-old\'s skull was fractured by a blow to the head, and her killer cinched a garrote around her neck, placed duct tape over her mouth and bound her wrists. \n \n Everyone from seasoned investigators to amateur sleuths to talk show hosts quickly settled on one of two theories: That JonBenet was slain by someone in her family, either accidentally or in a fit of rage, and that the killer then tried to make it look like a botched kidnapping; or, that she was the victim of a cunning intruder who intended to spirit the child out of the house, but ended up committing murder instead. \n \n John Ramsey, the girl\'s father, declined a request for an interview. \n \n ""I think we have said all that can be said and I need to get back to my job!"" Ramsey wrote in an email. \n \n \'We don\'t actually have to live with it\' \n \n The implications of the conclusions reached by the experts consulted by the Camera and 9NEWS could, if considered by investigators still working the state\'s most famous cold case, dramatically impact the future direction of their work. At the time the Bode results were returned, Lacy\'s office had control of the Ramsey investigation, and Boulder police did not reclaim responsibility for the probe until Lacy left office the following year. \n \n On one hand, it could lead detectives to consider anew the possibility that someone in JonBenet\'s family was responsible for her death. And it could also lead them to take a new look at dozens of potential suspects who were ruled out because their DNA didn\'t match the profile known as Unknown Male 1. \n \n Eid, who served as Owens\' chief counsel and was on the governor\'s statewide panel that reviewed the case in 1999, said in a recent interview he had suspected in 2008 that Lacy\'s exoneration was, at the very least, misleading. \n \n ""But now, it really looks wrong in the scheme of things,"" Eid said. ""And it\'s not one of these instances where you think, in hindsight, she made a tough call, but we\'ve got to live with it. No, we actually don\'t have to live with it anymore. Right?"" \n \n Lacy\'s successor as Boulder\'s district attorney, Stan Garnett, remembers exactly where he was when he learned of Lacy\'s decision to exonerate the Ramseys: sitting at LaGuardia Airport in New York waiting for a flight home when news of Lacy\'s letter crawled across a television screen. Although he called Lacy ""an honorable person"" and an ""honest district attorney,"" he also said he was — and is — puzzled by her decision. \n \n The job of a district attorney is to file charges in cases where the evidence warrants it, Garnett said. \n \n ""Our role is not to issue random exonerations of people in cases, and it\'s very confusing when that happens,"" Garnett added. \n \n Although Garnett said he is not bound by Lacy\'s decision, it has lasting ramifications for countless people beyond John Ramsey and Burke Ramsey, now 29. Patsy Ramsey succumbed to ovarian cancer in June 2006. \n \n Boulder police investigators continue to use the problematic DNA profile known as Unknown Male 1 to clear others who might potentially have been involved in the killing. A case investigator said dozens of suspects have been cleared that way. \n \n Boulder police Chief Greg Testa declined this week to comment on the DNA evidence. But in a video statement released to all media on Sept. 1, Testa said detectives in the department had submitted more than 200 DNA samples in the case for analysis. \n \n \'This could easily be a composite profile\' \n \n At the crux of the evidence is the DNA profile referred to as Unknown Male 1. \n \n That profile was first developed in late 1998 and early 1999 from tests on JonBenet\'s panties — but analysts couldn\'t at that time identify sufficient genetic markers. Sending it to the FBI\'s Combined DNA Index System — the national genetic database commonly known as CODIS — requires at least 10 markers. \n \n Further lab work in 2003 yielded an additional marker, and the profile, featuring the required minimum of 10 genetic markers, was entered into CODIS that December. \n \n ""People believed back in those days almost all mixtures are two-person mixtures — that was like gospel truth,"" said Phillip Danielson, a professor of molecular biology at the University of Denver and science adviser to the National Law Enforcement and Corrections Technology Center. \n \n In the ensuing years, as the ""kits"" used to detect DNA became ever more sensitive, scientists came to realize that many mixtures contained genetic markers from more than two people. \n \n ""You know,"" Danielson said, ""looking at the profiles in this case, it seems pretty clear that their idea of this \'unknown male\' — this could easily be a composite profile. Meaning that we have multiple contributors. But because of the low sensitivity of the kit, they interpreted those multiple contributors as being just one extra person."" \n \n However, Lacy — and others — concluded that profile must belong to JonBenet\'s killer. \n \n Against that backdrop, an investigator in Lacy\'s office submitted JonBenet\'s panties, long johns, nightgown and other items for further testing at Bode\'s lab in Lorton, Va., in late 2007 and early 2008. \n \n The Bode scientists could not replicate the profile found in JonBenet\'s panties, which bothered Danielson as he examined the materials obtained by the two news organizations. \n \n ""Reproducibility and repeatability is a hallmark of science,"" Danielson said. ""To me, as a scientist, that does raise concern. If there was this unknown male DNA on the underwear, you would expect that Bode would have been able to reproduce that. Now, are there any possible explanations why they would not be? Sure."" \n \n The sample could have been degraded, though Danielson said that\'s not likely given the way evidence is handled and stored. Another possibility is that the original tests consumed all of the foreign genetic material in the panties. It\'s also possible that variations in the way the original tests were done could account for the failure to find the same profile in the panties during the 2008 tests. \n \n \'Should not be considered a single source profile\' \n \n When analysts at Bode tested the long johns, they focused on four distinct areas: the inside and outside of both the upper left and upper right sides of the garment. The tests on the two spots on the inside of the long johns yielded too little DNA to be useful. \n \n But on the outside of the long johns, Bode analysts found much more DNA. \n \n According to a March 24, 2008, report from Bode, a copy of which was obtained by the Camera and 9NEWS, the sample from the right side, labeled as 2S07-101-05A, included DNA containing ""a mixture of at least two individuals including the victim and at least one male contributor."" They got the same results on the left side, which was labeled 2S07-101-05B. \n \n But in notes included with the report, it\'s clear the Bode analysts concluded that those two samples contained genetic material from at least three people. After assuming that JonBenet was one of those people, the analysts were left with the ""remaining DNA contribution."" \n \n ""Based on the results,"" according to the report, ""it is likely more than two people contributed to the mixtures observed in 2S07-101-05A and 2S07-101-05B therefore, the remaining DNA contribution should not be considered a single source profile."" \n \n Christopher McKee, a former public defender in both Atlanta and Washington, D.C., and now director of the Schaden Experiential Learning & Public Service Programs at the University of Colorado Law School, concurred. \n \n ""My own personal review of the material and looking at the allele information at the various loci is that it looks and appears to me to be at least three individuals,"" McKee said. McKee also teaches an advanced course on Forensic Science in the Courts at the CU Law School, teaches on the subject around the country and has been recognized by courts and nationally as an expert on the topic. \n \n Danielson also said, ""There are too many alleles to be accounted for by only JonBenet and this alleged Unknown Male No. 1 profile."" \n \n An allele is a specific genetic marker. \n \n Lacy\'s investigator asked Bode\'s analysts to compare the DNA from the two spots on the outside of the long johns with the Unknown Male 1 profile. \n \n Bode\'s analysts concluded that Unknown Male 1 ""could not be excluded as a possible contributor to the mixture DNA profile"" obtained from the outside of the long johns on the right side, according to a June 20, 2008, report obtained by the Camera and 9NEWS. On the left side, the Unknown Male 1 profile ""cannot be included or excluded from the mixture DNA profile."" \n \n In other words, the link between the two spots on the long johns and the DNA in the underwear is tenuous at best, according to analysts at the lab Lacy used for the testing. \n \n \'There is no innocent explanation\' \n \n But a little more than two weeks later, Lacy wrote the letter clearing members of the Ramsey family of suspicion. However, she included none of the caveats spelled out in the Bode reports and used language suggesting the lab work was ironclad. \n \n ""The Bode Technology laboratory was able to develop a profile from DNA recovered from the two sides of the long johns,"" Lacy wrote. ""The previously identified profile from the crotch of the underwear worn by JonBenet at the time of the murder matched the DNA recovered from the long johns at Bode. \n \n ""Despite substantial efforts over the years to identify the source of this DNA, there is no innocent explanation for its incriminating presence at three sites on those two different items of clothing that JonBenet was wearing at the time of her murder."" \n \n The experts consulted by the news organizations disagreed, to varying degrees, on both assertions — that the Unknown Male 1 profile ""matched"" the DNA found on the outside of the long johns, and that there was ""no innocent explanation"" for the presence of that DNA on JonBenet\'s clothing. \n \n ""You have to understand a match is an analyst\'s judgment that the two samples fall into the \'included\' category,"" Thompson said. ""A match doesn\'t mean that the material examined is necessarily identical — just that there\'s a sufficient consistency to think that it might have come from the same source."" \n \n Thompson said his analysis found ""a strong level of consistency"" between the two long johns samples and the Unknown Male 1 profile. \n \n ""But,"" he said, ""there are also some genetic characteristics that could not be accounted for by either JonBenet Ramsey or Unknown Male 1, thus suggesting there could be DNA from other people."" \n \n Danielson and another expert consulted by the Camera and 9NEWS offered similar opinions. \n \n ""To simply state that there\'s no innocent way that this DNA could have arrived at separate sites on JonBenet\'s underwear ... there\'s simply no scientific justification to make such a statement,"" Danielson said. ""It\'s just simply not true."" \n \n Danielson offered a hypothetical: Say JonBenet had physical contact with other kids she was recently playing with, or had contact at a party on Christmas night, or say she touched anything bearing others\' DNA; she could have then transferred that genetic material to her own clothes simply while getting dressed. \n \n McKee, based on his review of the evidence, called Lacy\'s actions based on the lab reports ""a cautionary tale."" \n \n ""I don\'t think her letter at all reflects an appreciation or understanding for what that said in the report,"" McKee said. ""You know, as I read the (Lacy) letter, it seems to suggest that there\'s just one single profile that was found here."" \n \n \'False logic of declaring this as exonerating\' \n \n Michael Kane, who served as lead counsel to the Ramsey grand jury, is now senior legal counsel to the Judiciary Committee in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. He expressed little surprise that Lacy\'s decision had been thrown into serious doubt. \n \n ""Until you ID who that (unknown sample) is, you can\'t make that kind of statement (that Lacy made),"" Kane said in an email. ""There may be circumstances where male DNA is discovered on or in the body of a victim of a sexual assault where you can say with a degree of certainty that had to have been from the perpetrator and from that, draw the conclusion that someone who doesn\'t meet that profile is excluded. \n \n ""But in a case like this, where the DNA is not from sperm, is only on the clothing and not her body, until you know whose it is, you can\'t say how it got there. And until you can say how it got there, you can\'t connect it to the crime and conclude it excludes anyone else as the perpetrator. And that\'s the false logic of declaring this as exonerating. It seems to me to be pretty self-evident."" \n \n As for potentially innocent explanations to the presence of DNA on the clothes JonBenet was wearing when she died, all three experts said they are numerous. \n \n ""There have been some very intriguing studies where they had people hold hands for a very short period of time and then touch a knife handle,"" Danielson said. \n \n In some cases, subsequent tests found DNA from both people on the knife. In others, DNA from only the person who actually touched the knife. And in still others, no DNA was found from the person who actually touched the knife, yet DNA from the other person was found. \n \n Thompson recently testified in a case involving sex toys. Analysts located DNA on the sex toys, Thompson said, in ""quantities comparable"" to that found on JonBenet\'s long johns — but it turned out to have no link to the crime. \n \n ""The DNA came from a person who had carried the wrapped items from the crime scene to a truck to take to the crime lab,"" Thompson said. ""So somebody who had never touched the items, but had touched the exterior of the wrappers of the items, that person\'s DNA was apparently transferred onto the wrappers. Then when the wrapped items got back to the crime lab and were unwrapped, the analyst apparently touched the wrappers and then touched the items, transferring it onto the items — in a way that made it indistinguishable from DNA that would have been deposited there during that crime. \n \n ""So if that can happen in this sexual assault case that I worked on, it\'s easy to imagine similar scenarios that could have gotten the DNA found on JonBenet Ramsey\'s clothing to where it was found. And I think the fact that DNA can be transferred so easily in small quantities is a weakness of the technology at this time."" \n \n \'Can\'t get my arms around that one\' \n \n Lacy established herself as a supporter of the intruder theory in the Ramsey case when she was still Mary Keenan, a chief deputy specializing in sexual assault cases under the man she would soon succeed, then-District Attorney Alex Hunter. \n \n In June 1998, JonBenet\'s parents were questioned at length for the second time — Patsy Ramsey by Denver district attorney\'s investigator Tom Haney and Boulder prosecutor Trip DeMuth, and John Ramsey by retired El Paso County homicide detective Lou Smit and Kane, the attorney who directed the grand jury investigation. \n \n Lacy wasn\'t directly involved in the interrogations. But Haney recalls that after she saw videotape of the interview with Patsy Ramsey, Lacy chided him for being hard on JonBenet\'s mother. \n \n Haney said Lacy volunteering such an opinion seemed odd to him at the time. And, he said in a recent interview, ""It still does."" \n \n Lacy took other steps that left many to believe she ruled out the Ramseys as suspects long before she issued her letter in 2008. \n \n Lacy succeeded Hunter as Boulder County\'s elected district attorney in 2001. It was in that role that, in 2003, she made her first public proclamation on her belief in the Ramseys\' innocence. \n \n A federal judge in Atlanta — in dismissing a libel case filed against the Ramseys by a journalist they named as a potential suspect in their 2000 book ""The Death of Innocence"" — ruled that exhibits in the case led her to believe an intruder was more likely to have killed JonBenet than Patsy Ramsey. \n \n Although Lacy had not been a party to that suit, she nevertheless volunteered a public statement in support of the federal judge\'s ruling, saying, ""I agree with the conclusion that the weight of the evidence is more consistent with the theory that an intruder murdered JonBenet than it is with a theory that Mrs. Ramsey did so."" \n \n After Patsy Ramsey succumbed to ovarian cancer in 2006 following a 13-year battle, she was buried alongside JonBenet in St. James Episcopal Cemetery in Marietta, Ga. Lacy attended her funeral. \n \n Former Boulder police detective Steve Thomas, who had investigated the case in its first years, said that stunned him. \n \n ""I know of no other case in which a sitting district attorney or prosecutor attended the funeral of a person whom she knew a grand jury had voted to criminally indict, and traveled across the country to do so, as Mary Lacy did in the case of Patsy Ramsey,"" he wrote in an email. \n \n ""I can\'t get my arms around that one. I can assure you that many in law enforcement were also distressed by it."" \n \n Thomas quit the investigation in August 1998 over multiple frustrations, including Hunter\'s reluctance at that time to take the case to a grand jury. He later wrote a book about the case and was sued by the Ramseys. That suit resulted in an undisclosed settlement. \n \n \'Culmination of what she wanted\' \n \n Lacy also presided over what is widely seen as one of the greatest debacles in a case marred by numerous missteps: the high-profile 2006 arrest of John Mark Karr, a suspect unearthed by University of Colorado journalism professor Michael Tracey, followed almost immediately by an about-face. \n \n Karr was arrested in Thailand and brought back to Boulder with a sea of photographers recording virtually every moment of his transport — only to be abruptly cut loose a few days after arriving in Colorado when his DNA was found not to match the Unknown Male 1 sample. \n \n Numerous experts have cautioned about the importance of maintaining objectivity, both that of the scientists examining forensic samples, and those who are evaluating the results. They also underscored the importance of severely limiting what is termed contextual information, which is supplied to a laboratory along with items to be tested. \n \n In the case of testing done by Bode Technology for Lacy\'s office, the Bode staff was provided not only a PowerPoint presentation on the case, but a six-page Nov. 7, 2007, letter providing background so extensive that it even made mention that John Ramsey was president of Access Graphics, a Lockheed Martin subsidiary that had just cleared $1 billion in sales at the time of JonBenet\'s murder. \n \n ""Just as they need to make sure that evidence is not physically contaminated, you want to make sure that they\'re not cognitively contaminated, so that they\'re not aware and influenced by irrelevant contextual information that biases how they perceive and interpret the information, the judgments they make,"" said Itiel Dror, senior cognitive neuroscience researcher at University College London. He has presented training at the Colorado Bureau of Investigation, the California Department of Justice and elsewhere on objectivity in forensic examination. \n \n ""The investigators, the lawyers and everybody else need to stay emotionally disconnected from the case as much as humanly possible, so they keep as objective as possible and not fall into a lot of cognitive problems, wishful thinking, self-fulfilling prophecy,"" Dror said. \n \n Grant, the former Adams County district attorney, was skeptical about the Karr arrest at the time as he watched it unfold from a distance. \n \n ""Just listening to him, and seeing the televised interviews, it just struck me as improbable that he had anything to do with it,"" Grant said. \n \n Lacy, he said, ""was one of the folks that was more skeptical of the someone-in-the-house theory from the beginning. When she agreed — I thought, hastily — to bring Mr. Karr back on the flimsiest of non-evidence, it kind of cemented for me that she was looking for some way to bolster the intruder theory."" \n \n And alluding to the exoneration letter of July 2008, Grant said, ""That was the culmination of what she wanted to do all along."" \n \n Not a DNA case \'pure and simple\' \n \n The ramifications for the case in the wake of Lacy\'s letter were considerable, and continue to reverberate to this day. \n \n The day Lacy issued the letter, John Ramsey hailed the news in an exclusive interview with 9NEWS. \n \n ""The most significant thing to me was the fact that we now have pretty irrefutable DNA evidence, according to the DA\'s office,"" Ramsey said. ""And that\'s the most significant thing to me. And certainly we are grateful that they acknowledged that we, you know based on that, certainly could not have been involved. But the most important thing was we now have very, very solid evidence."" \n \n It was first reported by the Camera in January 2013 that the grand jury that heard the Ramsey case from September 1998 to October 1999 had signed indictments against both John and Patsy Ramsey, charging both with child abuse resulting in death. \n \n Hunter declined to file those indictments with the court and prosecute the case at trial. While the standard for filing of charges is that of probable cause, the hurdle for conviction is proof beyond a reasonable doubt, and Hunter didn\'t believe the evidence was strong enough for him to do so. \n \n A lawsuit filed against Garnett in September 2013 led to the unsealing the following month of the 1999 indictments, confirming the child abuse charges as well as charges against both parents for accessory to first-degree murder. \n \n But still, the subsequent Lacy exoneration held sway for many, coming, as it did, nearly 10 years later, from the very same office that had secured those indictments. \n \n As recently as September, Wood, the lawyer for the Ramsey family, cited the DNA-based exoneration in a tweet in the wake of national television broadcasts that had raised anew the question of whether someone in JonBenet\'s family was involved in her murder. \n \n ""In 2008, Boulder DA publicly exonerated them and apologized. DNA evidence conclusive. End of story,"" Wood tweeted. \n \n And the same day, Wood tweeted, "" This is a DNA case plain and simple."" \n \n That contention is flatly refuted by the independent experts consulted by the Camera and 9NEWS. \n \n ""No, it is not,"" Danielson said. ""It\'s clearly not. We have a questioned profile that is very low level in terms of the amount of DNA. The quantity of DNA is very small, the profile is extremely complex. The one thing this case is not, it is not a \'DNA case pure and simple.\'"" \n \n McKee, at the University of Colorado, agreed. \n \n ""I don\'t think any case is just a DNA case. And laboratories across the country operate, and their analysts are trained, not to talk in terms like that,"" said McKee, emphasizing that genetic evidence should be considered an investigative thread that is part of a larger fabric to be considered in its entirety. \n \n ""I think it would be a big mistake to say that, you know, DNA is the only thing that you\'re going to look at,"" McKee said. ""And certainly, in this case, I don\'t think it is the only thing to look at."" \n \n They were echoed by Thompson, the UC-Irvine professor. \n \n ""I would say that the DNA evidence is not conclusive,"" Thompson said. ""I would say that the DNA evidence is indeterminate, leaving us uncertain as to what really happened in this case, and who really killed this little girl."" \n \n Thompson added, ""I mean, wasn\'t there other evidence in this case as well? I heard something about a ransom note, and handwriting analysis, and so on."" \n \n Wood, in an interview, said his tweets were based on Lacy\'s official statements, and on comments by former Boulder police Chief Beckner, made in a Reddit conversation on Feb. 24, 2015. \n \n ""My statements are 100 percent supported by the public statements of the Boulder district attorney and the former Boulder police chief,"" Wood said. ""They\'re almost verbatim."" \n \n But those waiting for nearly 13 years for a match in the CODIS database to the Unknown Male 1 profile could wait forever for something that is never going to happen, Danielson said. \n \n Although the unknown male sample had been entered into CODIS, it has never been matched to any of the other DNA profiles in the system. According to the FBI, as of August that included 12,517,059 offender profiles, 2,462,335 arrestee profiles and 726,709 forensic profiles of unknown individuals, such as the one submitted from the Ramsey case. \n \n One possible answer to the question of why a match has never occurred is that the profile is a composite containing genetic material from multiple people. \n \n ""As I looked at this case, the more I looked, I was just like, \'Oh, OK, that would explain why no database hits,\'"" Danielson said. \n \n A call for new testing \n \n The JonBenet Ramsey investigation remains under the control of the Boulder Police Department, which has been in command of the case since Garnett passed it back to the department\'s detectives when he became DA in 2009. \n \n Revelations about the questioned value of the DNA evidence as it now stands is stirring calls for renewed action on the case. \n \n Owens hesitated to be telling others what should happen now, but said he was unsurprised to have his longtime suspicions that the DNA cited by Lacy could, in fact, be innocently explained — and may even be insignificant to the investigation — confirmed. \n \n ""And it would be very good to hear from Mary Lacy or from others involved, in terms of what this new evidence should show them in terms of where we should go,"" Owens said. \n \n Eid, his former chief counsel who was part of the governor\'s October 1999 case review, hopes it will prod new action in the investigation, possibly employing the latest in DNA technology, which has evolved by quantum leaps since Lacy\'s letter was issued. \n \n No new DNA testing in the Ramsey case has been conducted since 2008. \n \n ""And there ought to be a process to reevaluate this in light of what you have brought forward. That\'s my view,"" Eid said. ""And you shouldn\'t feel locked in because some person who is no longer an elected official made a decision and said something. How many people have said things about this case that turned out to not be very relevant, or very accurate?"" \n \n One important step in the evolution of DNA testing, which was available in 2008 but has matured considerably since then, is known as Y-STR testing, which looks exclusively at male-inherited Y chromosome DNA. \n \n Testing in this manner on key pieces of evidence, such as JonBenet\'s underwear, long johns and perhaps the cord on the garotte used to strangle her or other items associated with the crime scene, would not pick up any of JonBenet\'s genetic markers. That would enable analysts to focus with greater accuracy on only male contributors to the mixed samples. \n \n ""If you are able to ignore, completely, the female contribution, and can focus just on the male, you are able to then get much more robust results,"" McKee said. ""I don\'t really see a reason why it hasn\'t been done, or why you couldn\'t do it."" \n \n Danielson agreed, saying, ""With the Y-STR testing, you eliminate all of the female DNA. So you can amplify male DNA, even if the male DNA is a fraction of 1 percent of the DNA of the females\' on the samples. So that\'s, if I were going to do any additional testing, that\'s the additional testing that I would do. It would help to at least answer some of the questions."" \n \n Grant, the former Adams County district attorney and one-time adviser to Boulder prosecutors, also pointed out that if Lacy truly had faith in the profile on which she based her exoneration, she could have done far more than simply write a letter. \n \n ""A prosecutor can file a John Doe warrant identifying the suspect by that DNA profile,"" Grant said. ""If then-District Attorney Lacy was convinced that that suspect, that DNA profile, was the killer, and she was going to exonerate somebody else, then that\'s what she should have done. \n \n ""The fact that she didn\'t do that tells me something — tells me something about how strong she thinks the DNA evidence may or may not be."" \n \n Garnett expressed faith in the work of the Boulder Police Department, and also said his own office remains committed to doing whatever can be done to solve a case that he sees as still severely compromised by mistakes made in the past. \n \n ""I\'m not going to talk publicly about what we\'re doing or what we would do,"" Garnett said. ""But what I can tell you is that DNA evidence and the theory behind DNA work is changing almost daily, and I have excellent people on staff who review those issues and handle that, and we will make sure that any appropriate testing that can be done to update the theories of the evidence is done."" \n \n Garnett said Lacy\'s 2008 decision was ""legally insignificant"" and ""has no meaning,"" largely due to the fact that the evidence she cited in her letter was never subjected to the rigorous scrutiny and cross-examination that all evidence in any case goes through in a courtroom. \n \n ""None of that happened with the bits and pieces of evidence that was the basis of the exoneration,"" Garnett said. ""And so it\'s just not significant."" \n \n Eid observed that ""it\'s incredible the number of cases that get solved later. And also as DNA testing gets better, it sometimes removes doubt and sometimes adds doubt."" \n \n Eid remains convinced that, ""It\'s not too late for justice."" \n \n Charlie Brennan: 303-473-1327, brennanc@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/chasbrennan \n \n Kevin Vaughan: 303-871-1862, kevin.vaughan@9news.com or twitter.com/writerkev', 'Image copyright I Khalil, S Misra Image caption Sperm-inspired robots ""swim"" when they are made to wiggle by a moving magnetic field \n \n Engineers have built a sperm-like robot that they can control with magnets. \n \n The simple design has a metal-coated head and a flexible body about six times longer than a human sperm. \n \n Using a magnetic field no stronger than a fridge magnet, the team made the robot ""swim"" forward and steered it towards a fixed point. \n \n They hope the findings, published in the journal Applied Physics Letters, will be useful in medical and manufacturing applications. \n \n ""We have built a biologically inspired micro-robot that looks like a sperm cell but is completely fabricated in the lab,"" said Dr Sarthak Misra, a robotics engineer at the University of Twente in the Netherlands. \n \n Sperm, like some bacteria, use a whip-like ""flagellum"" to propel themselves through fluid. \n \n Other studies of this process have included coupling a magnetic tail to a red blood cell, or controlling real sperm by steering them in metal microtubes. \n \n The new gadget is made from a strong but flexible polymer, with a metal layer painted onto its head using a technique called electron beam evaporation. \n \n That metal element is forced in different directions when the device is placed into a moving field, produced by the coils of an electromagnet. \n \n Precise navigation \n \n ""The magnetic head is used to orient it in a certain direction and then, just by flapping its tail, it starts to move forward,"" Dr Misra told the BBC. ""The flapping happens because we change the current in the coils."" \n \n Image copyright I Khalil, S Misra Image caption The simple robots consist of a flexible tail and a head with an added metallic layer \n \n For its size, the robot can hardly compete with its biological inspiration for pace: it wiggles along at up to 0.5 body lengths per second, whereas a human sperm can cover several times its body length in that time. \n \n Importantly, however, Dr Misra and his colleagues also showed that they could steer the robot with some precision. By adjusting the magnetic field changes with a computer, they navigated their creation towards a fixed point. \n \n This means the little robots could be useful for positioning materials in nanomanufacturing, or for medical purposes. ""It opens up a lot of applications, from targeted drug delivery to in vitro fertilisation - where you want to reach precise locations,"" Dr Misra said. \n \n For these ideas to work, the researchers need to test the technique in more complicated environments. They are moving on to those experiments, as well as working on making their ""MagnetoSperm"" smaller and faster. \n \n Image copyright SPL Image caption Human sperm are another six times smaller than the tiny robots that were modelled on them \n \n Dr Matthew Baker, who studies molecular motors at the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute in Sydney, told BBC News the work was ""very cool"" but commented that the tiny contraptions are not robots in the sense that most of us would imagine. \n \n ""It\'s just a piece of metal and it\'s the field that\'s doing the hard work,"" Dr Baker explained. ""The clever part is the oscillating, small, tunable magnetic field."" \n \n This out-sourcing of power and navigation is what allows the gadget to be so small, according to the new study\'s first author Dr Islam Khalil. ""As technology progresses and many products get smaller, it becomes difficult to assemble objects on nano- and micro-scales,"" he said in a press statement. \n \n ""MagnetoSperm can be used to manipulate and assemble objects at these scales, using an external source of magnetic field to control its motion.""']",2,"– After just short of 20 years, the murder of JonBenet Ramsey is as much of a mystery as ever—especially in light of a new examination of DNA evidence. A joint investigation by the Boulder Daily Camera and 9News calls into question former District Attorney Mary Lacy's decision to exonerate the Ramsey family. At the time, Lacy concluded that DNA evidence found on JonBenet's underwear and long johns belonged to a male intruder who was not part of the Ramsey family. But now three forensic experts who examined the DNA test results and lab reports used by Lacy say they do not support her conclusion. For one thing, a sample on her underwear identified as coming from ""Unknown Male 1"" may in fact be a composite from multiple people and thus ""worthless as evidence,"" says the news report. Another revelation that further muddles the picture: DNA samples on her long johns appear to come from JonBenet and at least two other people, not one, a fact that has never been revealed before. What's more, the independent experts say all of the unknown DNA may be the result of ""inconsequential contact with other people,"" reports the Camera. With the exoneration, ""I was trying to prevent a horrible travesty of justice,"" Lacy tells ABC. (The interview was done before these latest revelations.) ""I was scared to death that despite the fact that there was no evidence, no psychopathy, and no motive, the case was a train going down the track and the Ramseys were tied to that track."" Comparison to the DNA profile now in doubt was used to exonerate dozens of other potential suspects. (JonBenet's older brother is suing a pathologist who accused him of the killing.)"

Mr Stumpf has so far ignored calls for him to step down. \n \n \'Deeply sorry\' \n \n During the hearing by a panel of US senators on 20 September, Mr Stumpf said he was ""deeply sorry"" for that and failing to act quickly. \n \n ""There is no question with some of our customers we violated trust,"" he said. ""We never directed nor wanted our team members to provide products and services to our customers that they didn\'t want. \n \n ""That said, I accept full responsibility for all unethical sales practices,"" he added. \n \n Image copyright Getty Images \n \n During the questioning, Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has long been a critic of the US banking industry, was unmoved by his apology. \n \n ""You squeezed your employees to the breaking point so they would cheat customers,\'\' she said. \n \n ""You should resign. You should give back the money you took while the scam was going on,"" she added. \n \n Record fine \n \n Wells Fargo said it would be contacting every deposit customer across the country to see if their accounts were properly authorised. \n \n It will also contact hundreds of thousands of customers with open credit cards to see if they want or need those cards. \n \n In the future, confirmation emails will be sent to customers within one hour of the opening of a new deposit account. \n \n The fine imposed on the bank by the US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was the largest ever imposed by the regulator.', 'The longtime chief executive of Wells Fargo agreed on Tuesday to forfeit $41 million in performance pay three weeks after the bank acknowledged that for at least five years, thousands of low-level employees set up sham accounts to meet sales quotas. \n \n The San Francisco-based bank has repeatedly apologized for the scheme and said it had fired 5,300 employees for misconduct and put in place more stringent internal controls. But that has not been enough for lawmakers, who have been pushing for the company’s top leaders to give back the millions of dollars in bonuses they earned while the irregularities were occurring. \n \n The independent directors of the Wells Fargo board announced Tuesday that they were launching an investigation into the bank’s retail business. \n \n “We are deeply concerned by these matters, and we are committed to ensuring that all aspects of the Company’s business are conducted with integrity, transparency, and oversight,” Stephen Sanger, the lead independent director, said in a statement. Sanger, who has been a member of Wells Fargo’s board since 2003, is the former chairman of General Mills, the packaged-food company. \n \n John Stumpf, the chief executive, will forfeit unvested stock awards worth about $41 million, will not receive a salary while the investigation is underway and will not be eligible for a 2016 bonus, the committee said in a statement. Carrie Tolstedt, the former head of Wells Fargo’s community banking unit, where the misconduct took place, will give up $19 million in unvested stock awards and not be eligible for a 2016 bonus. Tolstedt had announced her retirement in July but had initially planned to stay at the bank until the end of the year. \n \n In a tense exchange, Senator Elizabeth Warren badgered Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf on why he had not offered to give up any of his compensation or to resign in the wake of the fake accounts controversy. (Reuters) \n \n Stumpf and Tolstedt still have millions of dollars in stock and other compensation from Wells Fargo. Stumpf, for example, was awarded $161 million in bonuses and performance awards between 2011 and 2015, the period in which the misconduct took place, according to Equilar, a research firm. Tolstedt was awarded more than $60 million in bonuses in the same period. \n \n But this action by the bank’s board is, by far, the most aggressive and public effort by a bank since the 2008 financial crisis to show that top executives will be held responsible for their companies’ misdeeds. \n \n In early September, Wells Fargo was fined $185 million by regulators after it discovered that thousands of employees were setting up unauthorized accounts, including credit cards and checking accounts, that customers had not requested. In some cases, the customers were charged various fees for accounts they did not know existed. \n \n The case has sparked a national outcry, with lawmakers pummeling Stumpf before the Senate Banking Committee last week, with one even calling on him to resign. He is to be the only witness before the House Financial Services Committee when he attends a hearing this week, and the move to take back financial awards could help head off some of the inevitable anger of lawmakers. \n \n The debate comes as regulators try to finalize rules called for by the 2010 financial-reform bill, known as Dodd Frank, to overhaul the way Wall Street executives are paid and to address years of complaints that excessive bonuses helped lead to the 2008 financial crisis. \n \n The long-awaited rules were aimed at stopping executives from making risky financial bets to boost their pay and then collecting large bonuses before the consequences of their actions are clear. But the banking industry is mounting a counterattack against the rules, which critics say do not allow enough flexibility. Some employees would be subject to claw-backs for up to 11 years after being awarded bonuses, much longer than the current industry standard of three to five years, industry officials have said. \n \n In July, Wells Fargo joined the debate, saying it was concerned that the rules may have unintended consequences. “We have worked, and are continuing to work, diligently . . . to improve and evolve our incentive-based compensation practices,” Hope Hardison, Wells Fargo’s director of human resources, said in a letter to regulators. \n \n But the rules would “create an un-level playing field, driving high-quality talent” away from big banks subject to the rules, she wrote. \n \n The controversy surrounding Wells Fargo is likely to make it more difficult for banks to mount efforts to weaken the rules, industry officials say. \n \n Stumpf is expected to face tough questioning when he appears before the House Financial Services Committee on Thursday. In addition to questions about executive compensation, he is likely to face questions about a recently launched Labor Department inquiry into the bank. \n \n The Labor Department says it is conducting a “top-to-bottom review” of Wells Fargo after lawmakers complained that the bank’s workers were forced into a hypercompetitive environment that led thousands of them to set up the sham accounts to meet aggressive sales goals. \n \n Some former employees allege that they were unfairly fired when they did not cut corners to meet Wells Fargo’s aggressive sales targets. \n \n That could violate federal rules, according to lawmakers and some labor experts. Last week, former Wells Fargo employees who say they were fired for following the law filed a $2.6 billion lawsuit against the bank. They are seeking class-action status. \n \n The Labor Department said it has set up a working group to expedite a review of the issue. \n \n “Given the serious nature of the allegations . . . I have directed enforcement agencies within the Department to conduct a top-to-bottom review of cases, complaints, or violations concerning Wells Fargo over the last several years,” Labor Secretary Thomas Perez said in a letter released Tuesday by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who had asked the agency to look into the matter. \n \n “We take the concerns raised . . . very seriously,” Perez wrote. \n \n A Wells Fargo spokeswoman declined to comment on the Labor Department review. \n \n It is just the latest sign that San Francisco-based bank will be grappling with the fallout from this case for some time.

Call the police’ \n \n Baltimore man who called 911 for help dies after being punched by police \n \n A 21-year-old man died in a hospital near Baltimore on Wednesday, after an altercation with county police officers who repeatedly punched him as they responded to a call for an ambulance. \n \n Keith Scott shooting: video emerges of fatal encounter with Charlotte police Read more \n \n Tawon Boyd was pronounced dead after doctors failed to revive him following his encounter with the police. An autopsy has not been completed. \n \n According to initial accounts by the Baltimore County police department, officers were responding to a 911 call placed by Boyd’s girlfriend, Deona Styron. But a lawyer for Boyd’s family, Latoya Francis-Williams, told a different story. She said Boyd called 911 himself because he was feeling disoriented and needed an ambulance. \n \n “They really were supposed to be there to get him to the nearest healthcare facility,” Francis-Williams said. \n \n After being questioned on the discrepancy, the police department updated its account, saying: “Police originally thought the girlfriend was the caller because the information passed on to police from the dispatcher said ‘female yelling on the phone’.” \n \n According to the police incident report: “The call stated that there is a female yelling in the background. 911 added that a female keeps saying ‘Tell them hurry up’.” \n \n Boyd repeatedly asked officers to enter his home, the report said, and asked a neighbor to call the police. Boyd told officers that Styron, who lived with him, “got him intoxicated and is secretly recording him while someone else is in the home”. The author of the police report described Boyd as “confused and paranoid”. Boyd asked officers to go into the house and find out who was inside. \n \n According to the report, Boyd attempted to enter two police cars and then ran to a neighbor’s house and banged on the door, calling: “Help! Call the police!” \n \n “It was obvious suspect Boyd was under the influence of a narcotic and/or suffering [REDACTED] and needed to be taken to the hospital for emergency evaluation,” the report noted. \n \n By the time medics loaded Boyd into the back of an ambulance, he reportedly had physical injuries imposed by officers. \n \n The report does not describe Boyd as violent or threatening, saying Boyd seemed to scratch the author’s neck and accidentally kick another officer, named Garland, “while trying to stand”. Boyd grabbed a third officer’s face, the report said, describing his hand slipping down to the officer’s badge and microphone. That officer, Bowman, “delivered two closed fist strikes to the suspect’s face with his right fist”. \n \n Francis-Williams said: “He is literally attacked. And by attacked, I mean the witness [Styron] is describing that he [was] struck many times and struck to the ground. \n \n “Officer Bowman is the one that when he arrived, really started wailing on Mr Boyd, meaning Mr Boyd was on the ground in a prone position and Bowman sat on him, almost straddled his back, and put his left arm under Boyd’s neck and pulled his head up in a choking fashion.” \n \n This is not too far from the language used in the incident report, which says “officers were able to get him under control by using our body weight to keep him on the ground. Officer Bowman controlled Suspect Boyd’s head and arms by holding him down with his arms while [the report author] held Suspect Boyd down by leaning on his buttocks/thigh area with my knees and using my arms.” \n \n Boyd’s grandmother, Linda Burch, told the Baltimore Sun: “I kept telling them stop before they hurt him because I told them they could kill him like that. They told me to go across the street before they lock me up.” \n \n Betty Shelby released on $50,000 bail in Terence Crutcher shooting Read more \n \n Styron could not be reached for comment. Of her own conversation with Styron, Francis-Williams said: “According to the witness, Mr Boyd was screaming, ‘Stop, stop, I can’t breathe.’ That could have been from the choking but at the same time, officer Bowman is punching and striking Mr Boyd in the face and in the neck area. \n \n “The witness described that after a little she’s screaming, ‘Stop,’ and Mr Boyd is kind of foaming at the mouth or spitting and his body goes limp.” \n \n According to the incident report, Boyd became so calm that Bowman “asked a medic to check the suspect for a pulse”. The report noted that the “medics advised that the suspect did have a heartbeat prior to being transported”. \n \n The report ends with a redacted list of minor injuries sustained by the officers. Boyd ended up in intensive care. \n \n Though an autopsy has not been released, Francis-Williams said there was “swelling on the brain and fluid on the brain because the doctors attempted to drain that. \n \n “My understanding is his kidneys end up failing and at some point, his heart stops,” she said. \n \n Police officials said the autopsy report could take as long as a month to complete.', 'Baltimore County police and fire officials are investigating the circumstances behind the death of 21-year-old Tawon Boyd, who died Wednesday, three days after police struggled with him while responding to a disturbance call. \n \n A medic who was called to the scene gave Boyd medication to calm him down. Autopsy results are a critical component in this case, because they might reveal whether the drug haloperidol, which sources said medics gave the victim to calm him down, contributed to his death.

Dwight Pettit, an attorney representing the Boyd family. \n \n Instead of a wedding and baby shower, Boyd\'s family is planning a funeral. \n \n ""I just want my son back. They could have Tased him. They could have maced him. They could have done anything,"" said Martha Boyd, Tawon Boyd\'s mother. \n \n Baltimore County police responded to a disturbance call around 3 a.m. Friday at Akin Circle in Middle River. Officers said Tawon Boyd seemed confused, paranoid and sweated heavily. \n \n Police called an ambulance. According to sources, one of the medics gave Tawon Boyd haloperidol, an antipsychotic drug used to calm agitated individuals. Police write in their report, ""Boyd became so calm that Officer Bowman asked a medic to check the suspect for a pulse."" \n \n PDF: Read the police report \n \n According to the incident report, Tawon Boyd told police, ""There is someone in the house. You need to go inside and search. He further stated that he believes his girlfriend got him intoxicated and is secretly recording him while someone else is in the home."" \n \n ""There has been a statement put out that his mind wasn\'t right cognitively, but certainly nothing dealing with aggression, or anger, or abuse,"" said Latoya Francis-Willilams, an attorney representing the Boyd family. \n \n Tawon Boyd\'s girlfriend told police that he had been drinking and smoking pot. Officers reported that when they tried to take him to a hospital for an emergency evaluation, Tawon Boyd ran, screaming, knocking on neighbors\' doors, asking them to call police. Officers said he resisted all attempts to restrain him. \n \n ""Police were on his shoulders and had him face-down on the ground. They was (sic) holding him. (It looked) like they was (sic) hitting him, or something,"" said Linda Burch, Tawon Boyd\'s grandmother. \n \n Police write in their report that during the scuffle, an officer punched Tawon Boyd twice in the face. \n \n ""I said, \'You are hurting him, hurting him.\' He kept saying, \'Grandma, they trying (sic) to kill me. They trying (sic) to kill me, grandma,\'"" Burch said. \n \n It will be at least seven days before autopsy results are available. \n \n Baltimore County authorities said there were two 911 calls. The calls have not yet been released. The Baltimore County 911 Center received the first call at 3:06:45 (it ends at 3:20:11), and Tawon Boyd is the caller. Police originally thought the girlfriend was the caller because the information passed on to police from the dispatcher said, ""Female yelling on the phone."" \n \n The caller, assumed to be Tawon Boyd, is understandable at various moments, but the tape consists mostly of screaming from Tawon Boyd and the girlfriend, and is difficult to understand. Tawon Boyd does not call for medical help. Based on this call, police were dispatched to a disturbance. \n \n The second call came at 3:25:49 and ended at 3:33:58. This was an open call that consists mostly of screaming and other noise. It is unclear who placed the call. \n \n A review of dispatch records has indicated the following timeline: \n \n Police are dispatched at 3:09 for a disturbance. \n \n Police unit arrives at 3:18. \n \n Police call for EMS at 3:28. \n \n EMS arrives at 3:33. \n \n EMS leaves scene with patient at 3:58. \n \n EMS arrives at hospital at 4:10.']",2,"– A 21-year-old Baltimore County man died in the hospital three days after being repeatedly punched by officers responding to his 911 call, the Guardian reports. According to the Baltimore Sun, Tawon Boyd called 911 early last Sunday. He told officers his girlfriend, Deona Styron, had ""got him intoxicated and is secretly recording him."" Boyd's grandmother, Linda Burch, says Boyd ""was acting...like he was on something."" Police noted he seemed ""confused and paranoid,"" and it was clear he ""needed to be taken to the hospital."" But Boyd started trying to get into police cars and resisted attempts to restrain him, resulting in minor injuries to three officers. Based on the police report, it doesn't appear Boyd was trying to hurt the officers. He was holding onto one of the officer's shirts when the officer punched him twice in the face. At that point, the family's lawyer, Latoya Francis-Williams, says Boyd was ""literally attacked"" by officers. She says they got on top of him and ""really started wailing."" “I kept telling them stop before they hurt him,” Burch tells the Sun. “They told me to go across the street before they lock me up.” WBAL reports a medic gave Boyd haloperidol, an antipsychotic drug, to calm him down. An autopsy is now looking into whether the drug played a role in Boyd's death Wednesday from heart and kidney failure. Boyd's family is accusing the police of using too much force. “Mr. Boyd was in need of medical attention, and the police responded with violence,” Francis-Williams tells the Sun."

Police say the 50-year-old, who has a developmental delay and functions at a child's level, has spent the last 30 years living in St. Catharines, around 80 miles from where he disappeared, CTV reports. From what investigators can piece together, Latulip took a bus to Niagara Falls in September 1986 and ended up in St. Catharines, where he suffered a head injury and ""effectively forgot who he was"" until this year, when he told a social worker he remembered. Before his disappearance, Latulip had attempted suicide at least once, leading to fears he may have killed himself. Police officer Duane Gingerich, who investigated the disappearance, tells the Guelph Mercury that he's thrilled that Latulip has turned up alive. ""I had hopes that he was out there somewhere,"" he says. ""For us as investigators, this is great, this is awesome. It's satisfying because most of these cases don't turn out this way. You expect the worst when a person is missing for that period of time."" A DNA test confirmed Latulip's identity and police say a reunion with his mother, who moved to Ottawa years ago, is being arranged. In a 2014 interview, she told the Mercury she was still haunted by the disappearance. ""This is always at the back of my mind. Having an answer would mean closure,"" she said. (A California hospital recently identified the man it had called ""Garage 66"" for 16 years.)"

It's not over, either: Storms are poised to strike regions from Dallas to Memphis until tomorrow and Arkansas through Monday. The north will also get its share, with sleet or snow hitting central New England through the central Appalachians into today, and blanketing the nation's capital tomorrow. In other details: Dallas/Forth Worth had it worst, canceling nearly 700 flights and the downtown Dallas holiday parade for the first time in 26 years. The storm cut out power for more than 200,000 customers. Temperature swings were shocking: In Hot Springs, Arkansas, a temperate 75-degree day on Wednesday turned into an ice storm yesterday.

What he didn't know then that he knows now: Some 275 people have died at the dam over the last decade, and no one has successfully made it across the full width of the Colorado River there. But he apparently had luck on his side: Only one of the 10 hydroelectric turbines were powered on during his swim. ""I swam from Arizona to Nevada,"" he tells the Post. ""I went across first and then swam back. ... It took about 30 minutes to do. Even though I was knackered half way across I knew I had to get to the other side."" He reportedly told the Sun that he was about 160 feet from the dam and felt a strong tug. ""I was sucked towards the wall and had to swim hard."" He says police were waiting for him and handcuffed him for what he didn't realize wasn't permitted, as he says there aren't any ""no swimming"" signs posted. ""You're just expected not to.""

219,"['Senior U.S. commanders argued that increasing electricity through the “Kandahar Bridging Solution” would be an important part of the overall American military effort to beat back the Taliban in Kandahar province. Those commanders asserted that more power to operate lights, television sets and fans would please residents and lead many of them to throw their support behind the Afghan government. \n \n But other civilian and military officials have questioned that logic. When U.S. Army Maj. Gen. Kenneth Dahl was the deputy commander of U.S. forces in Kandahar last year, he said he could not find any evidence that the additional electricity was yielding greater employment, stability or support for the government. “This is a bridge to nowhere,” he declared to his staff in 2011. \n \n Back then, Dahl also noticed a disturbing disparity: The installation of the turbine at the dam, which will not occur for at least two more years, will produce significantly less power than the city receives from the generators. Since the Afghan government will not have the financial ability to buy diesel for the generators, that means the city’s power supply will inevitably ebb once the turbine is operational and U.S. funding for diesel ends. \n \n That gap was seized upon by the inspector general. “While the Kandahar Bridging Solution may achieve some immediate [counter\xadinsurgency] benefits because — as stated by USAID officials — ‘people like having their lights on,’ the U.S. government may be building an expectations gap that cannot be met in a timely manner,” the report states. \n \n The inspector general’s report also questions whether a new $23 million road in Helmand province will have adverse effects because the Afghan government has not compensated landowners for the destruction of their property. In addition, the report reveals that four electricity projects — costing a total of more than $300 million from the infrastructure fund — have not yet been awarded to contractors, despite claims from the military and USAID that they will have important counterinsurgency benefits. \n \n Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.), a frequent critic of Afghan reconstruction efforts, said the report raises fundamental questions about the strategic rationale of U.S. development programs in the war-torn nation. “There’s no data that shows these major projects have changed the security environment in the country,” she said. “We cannot just throw money at a country like this and expect it to have a good ending.” \n \n In its response to the report, the U.S. Embassy defended the importance of large-scale development initiatives. “These critical infrastructure projects have signaled to Afghan populations the U.S. government’s long term commitment to Afghanistan.” \n \n Although the United States has spent almost $90 billion on Afghan reconstruction and development over the past decade, such examinations traditionally had not been conducted by the special inspector general’s office, which was more interested in contracting waste and fraud. This report was approved by a new inspector, former federal prosecutor John F. Sopko, who took charge of the office this month. He has vowed to scrutinize how projects are conceptualized and designed, not just how they are implemented.', 'A U.S. initiative to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on construction projects in Afghanistan, originally pitched as a vital tool in the military campaign against the Taliban, is running so far behind schedule that it will not yield benefits until most U.S. combat forces have departed the country, according to a government inspection report to be released Monday. \n \n The report, by the special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction, also concludes that the Afghan government will not have the money or skill to maintain many of the projects, creating an “expectations gap�? among the population that could harm overall stabilization efforts. \n \n “Implementing projects that the Afghan government is unable to sustain may be counter\xadproductive�? to the U.S. counterinsurgency mission, the inspector general wrote. “If goals are set and not achieved, both the U.S. and Afghan governments can lose the populace’s support.�? \n \n The study calls into question a fundamental premise of the U.S. strategy to counter the Taliban insurgency — that expensive new roads and power plants can be funded and constructed quickly enough to help turn the tide of war — and it poses a sobering, counterintuitive question for policymakers in Washington: whether the massive influx of American spending in Afghanistan is actually making problems worse. \n \n Many U.S. military commanders, diplomats and reconstruction experts have long believed that large infrastructure projects were essential to fixing Iraq and Afghanistan. Now-retired Gen. David H. Petraeus, the former top commander in both wars who is now director of the CIA, used to say that cash was one of his most important weapons. \n \n But the latest report adds new weight to the argument — voiced by independent development specialists and even a few government officials — that the United States attempted to build too much in a country with limited means to assume responsibility for those projects. All U.S. combat forces are expected to be withdrawn from Afghanistan by the end of 2014. \n \n Until now, most critiques have asserted only that the massive U.S. foreign assistance program has led to waste and fueled corruption. The new report goes further by suggesting that some projects may ultimately prove detrimental. \n \n In a written response to the report, the U.S. Embassy in Kabul said it was “speculative�? for the inspector general to conclude that some of the projects would have adverse effects. The top Pentagon official responsible for Afghanistan called the report premature and insisted that the announcement of the projects, even though they have not been completed, has generated goodwill and excitement among the Afghan people. \n \n The inspector general’s examination focuses on the Afghan Infrastructure Fund, which was authorized by Congress in 2010 in part to prevent the Defense Department from dipping into a discretionary account for military commanders to bankroll large projects. The infrastructure fund was supposed to allow the Defense and State departments to collaboratively plan and pool money for large infrastructure improvements aimed at supporting the U.S. counter\xadinsurgency campaign. \n \n Since then, Congress has poured $800 million into the fund and the State Department has committed about $1 billion of its funds to related infrastructure programs. \n \n Among the projects criticized by the inspector general is a plan to use costly diesel generators to provide electricity to residents of Kandahar, the country’s second-largest city, until the U.S. Agency for International Development and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers install a new hydropower turbine at a dam in the violence-plagued hills of neighboring Helmand province. Purchasing diesel to run the generators, which produce about 25 megawatts of electricity each — enough to power about 2,500 Afghan homes or small businesses — is projected to cost U.S. taxpayers about $220 million through 2013. \n \n Senior U.S. commanders argued that increasing electricity through the “Kandahar Bridging Solution�? would be an important part of the overall American military effort to beat back the Taliban in Kandahar province.

The Ebola outbreak is now the largest recorded in history. \n \n President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, who is skipping a summit of African leaders in Washington this week amid the crisis, also called for the closure of markets in an area near the borders with infected countries Guinea and Sierra Leone. \n \n ""My fellow Liberians, Ebola is real, Ebola is contagious and Ebola kills,"" she warned. ""Denying that the disease exists is not doing your part, so keep yourselves and your loved ones safe."" \n \n Fear and panic over the mounting death toll has prompted some rural communities to accuse foreign aid workers of bringing the deadly virus. Others have kept people with Ebola symptoms at home instead of bringing them to quarantine centers. In anger, one man recently set fire to part of the health ministry building in the Liberian capital, Monrovia, after his teenage brother reportedly died of Ebola. \n \n Sirleaf said that security forces would enforce the new precautions taken a week after an American man of Liberian descent boarded a plane in Monrovia and flew to Nigeria, where authorities said he died of Ebola. The fact that he was able to board a plane and traveled through a major airport transit hub in Togo has only heightened fears about Ebola\'s possible spread in the region. \n \n The airline involved, ASKY, has suspended its flights to both the capitals of Liberia and Sierra Leone, and said passengers departing from Guinea would be carefully screened. \n \n Ebola has no vaccine and no specific treatment, with a fatality rate of at least 60 percent. But experts say the risk of travelers contracting it is considered low because it requires direct contact with bodily fluids or secretions such as urine, blood, sweat or saliva. Ebola can\'t be spread like flu through casual contact or breathing in the same air. \n \n Patients are contagious only once the disease has progressed to the point they show symptoms, according to the World Health Organization. The most vulnerable are health care workers and relatives who come in much closer contact with the sick. \n \n Still, Liberia is among the poorest countries in the world, and the outbreak already has taxed the capacity of local health clinics and doctors, prompting concern for those who remain in the country. \n \n In a statement released Wednesday, the Peace Corps said that 340 volunteers in the three affected countries were being evacuated and ""a determination on when volunteers can return will be made at a later date."" \n \n Two U.S.-based missionary groups also have ordered the evacuation of their non-essential personnel from Liberia after a doctor and a missionary both contracted Ebola. \n \n SIM USA President Bruce Johnson announced Tuesday that his group and Samaritan\'s Purse decided on the evacuation following an upsurge in the number of Ebola cases in Liberia. A Texas-trained doctor and a missionary from North Carolina have contracted the disease and are in isolation in Liberia. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writer Krista Larson in Dakar, Senegal contributed to this report.', 'A protester wearing a jacket with ""No THAAD"" letters, participates during a rally to oppose the plan to deploy the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system, or THAAD, in front of the Defense Ministry... (Associated Press) \n \n SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — U.S. missile launchers and other equipment needed to set up a controversial missile defense system have arrived in South Korea, the U.S. and South Korean militaries said Tuesday, a day after North Korea test-launched four ballistic missiles into the ocean near Japan. \n \n The plans to deploy the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system, or THAAD, within this year have angered not only North Korea, but also China and Russia, which see the system\'s powerful radars as a security threat. \n \n China responded quickly, saying it will take ""necessary measures"" to protect itself and warning that the U.S. and South Korea should be prepared to bear the consequences. \n \n Washington and Seoul say the system is defensive and not meant to be a threat to Beijing or Moscow. The U.S. military said in a statement that THAAD can intercept and destroy short and medium range ballistic missiles during the last part of their flights. \n \n ""Continued provocative actions by North Korea, to include yesterday\'s launch of multiple missiles, only confirm the prudence of our alliance decision last year to deploy THAAD to South Korea,"" Adm. Harry Harris, head of the U.S. Pacific Command, said in the statement. \n \n Some South Korean liberal presidential candidates have said that the security benefits of having THAAD would be curtailed by worsened relations with neighbors China and Russia. \n \n ""China firmly opposes the deployment of THAAD,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said at a regular briefing Tuesday. ""We will definitely be taking necessary measures to safeguard our own security interest. All consequences entailed from that will be borne by the U.S. and (South Korea). We once again strongly urge the relevant sides to stop the process of deployment and refrain from going further down that wrong path."" \n \n China\'s condemnation of South Korea\'s plans to deploy THAAD has triggered protests against a South Korean retail giant, Lotte, which agreed to provide one of its golf courses in southern South Korea as the site of THAAD. The South Korean government also raised concerns about a reported ban on Chinese tour groups visiting the country. \n \n On Tuesday, China\'s Global Times, an outspoken nationalist tabloid published by the ruling Communist Party\'s flagship People\'s Daily, criticized North Korea over the missiles. \n \n ""By firing four missiles at once this time, the military confrontation between Pyongyang, Seoul and Washington escalates a notch,"" the paper said. ""Noticeably, the Chinese public is angry that Pyongyang\'s nuclear program has provided an excuse for Seoul to deploy THAAD."" \n \n An official from South Korea\'s Defense Ministry, who didn\'t want to be named, citing office rules, said that the equipment that arrived in South Korea included launchers, but didn\'t confirm how many. \n \n While South Korea\'s media speculate that the THAAD deployment could be completed by as early as April, the ministry official couldn\'t confirm those reports. The official said that the plan was to have the system operational as soon as possible. \n \n On Monday, North Korea fired four ballistic missiles in an apparent protest against ongoing U.S.-South Korean military drills that it views as an invasion rehearsal. The missiles flew about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) on average, three of them landing in waters that Japan claims as its exclusive economic zone, according to South Korean and Japanese officials. \n \n The North\'s state media on Tuesday said leader Kim Jong Un supervised a ballistic rocket launching drill, a likely reference to the four launches reported by Seoul and Tokyo. Involved in the drills were artillery units tasked with striking ""U.S. imperialist aggressor forces in Japan,"" according to the Korean Central News Agency. \n \n There was pride and defiance among the elite citizens who live in North Korea\'s showcase capital, Pyongyang. \n \n ""If the U.S. imperialists and their South Korean puppets shoot even just one spark into our sovereign territory, we will completely destroy those aggressors, without any mercy, with our invincible Hwasong artillery, which are loaded with nuclear warheads,"" Sim Chol Su, echoing the propaganda often found in state media, told The Associated Press. \n \n North Korea uses ""Hwasong"" to describe a broad range of its ballistic missiles, including Scuds and the mid-range missiles that are referred to as Rodong and Musudan by outside analysts. \n \n South Korea\'s Joint Chiefs of Staff said that the missiles fired by the North were believed to be ""improved versions"" of Scud missiles. South Korean experts say North Korea\'s extended-range Scuds and mid-range Rodong missiles are capable of hitting Japan, including U.S. military bases in Okinawa. \n \n Kim ""ordered the KPA (Korean People\'s Army) Strategic Force to keep highly alert as required by the grim situation in which an actual war may break out anytime,"" a KCNA dispatch said. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writers Chris Bodeen and Gillian Wong in Beijing contributed to this report.']",4,"– When US inspectors looked at four border police bases in Afghanistan—funded by the US at a cost of almost $19 million—they found most of the facilities on three of those bases had either been abandoned or weren't being used as intended, the Wall Street Journal reports. The report from the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, a US government watchdog agency, uncovered numerous examples of poor construction work: One base has no water supply, a second is experiencing sewage overflow, some are missing drainpipes, others have leaking fuel lines or broken doors. One even includes a well house being used as … a chicken coop. The US Army Corps of Engineers says it is working on fixing the issues. The report also finds that the US plan to fund hundreds of millions of dollars worth of infrastructure projects in the country is extremely behind schedule—and that some of the ambitious plans may actually hurt the country, the Washington Post adds. The report raises concerns about the 2014 withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan and questions whether local forces are prepared to take over security duties—and whether this new infrastructure can be successfully maintained by a country with limited resources.

221,"['The U.S. Census Bureau reported Wednesday that 16 million children living in America received food stamps in 2014, or about one out of every five kids. \n \n Census said that number is up dramatically from 2007, before the Great Recession, when 9 million kids were receiving food stamps, or about one in eight. The data comes from Census’ 2014 survey on families. \n \n “The rate of children living with married parents who receive food stamps has doubled since 2007,” Census said. \n \n The findings are likely to bolster claims from some Republicans that the Obama administration seems to have a goal of putting more people under government aid programs. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich in 2012 called President Barack Obama the “food stamp president,” which led some to say his comment was racist. \n \n The debate over food stamps has led to a sort of chicken-and-egg argument between Republicans and Democrats. The GOP has said the end of the recession should allow Congress to reduce spending on food stamps. \n \n While Democrats have tried to give President Barack Obama credit for a rebounding economy, they also note that millions of additional people are using food stamps, and that the program should not be cut yet. The total number of people using food stamps has almost doubled since the start of the Great Recession, to nearly 48 million in 2013. \n \n The number finally dipped from that peak in 2014, but just a little, to about 46 million people. \n \n Republicans have tried since 2013 to cut food stamp spending, as part of their overall plan to slow spending and get control of the budget deficit. In 2013, the House voted to cut $39 billion from food stamps over a decade, and almost a year ago, President Barack Obama signed a final deal that will cut just $8.7 billion from the program over ten years. \n \n That cut was estimated to reduce food stamp benefits by about $90 per month for the hundreds of thousands of homes that use them.', 'Tonight, Lady Gaga literally took a leap of faith (via some very trustworthy suspension cables) when she opened her Super Bowl halftime performance with a riff on patriotic classics.

If you\'ve been to a Pride march in the past four years, you know a thing or two about dancing to ""Born This Way"" while you\'re surrounded by a ton of glitter, bare skin, and glorious, rainbow solidarity. Let\'s just be clear here, though: Performing a song that\'s so blatantly gay in front of an audience that includes Mike Pence, one of the most anti-LGBTQ politicians today , is absolutely political — especially when it contains lyrics like ""No matter gay, straight, or bi, lesbian, transgender life."" (P.S.: According to USA Today , that was ""likely"" be the first time the word ""transgender"" was said onstage at a Super Bowl.) \n \n Furthermore, as our friends at The Hive pointed out, the Woody Guthrie song ""This Land Is Your Land"" is inherently activistic. Gaga omitted certain lyrics from the piece, which The Hive printed for your convenience. Here\'s a sampling: \n \n As I went walking I saw a sign there / And on the sign it said ""No Trespassing."" / But on the other side it didn\'t say nothing, / That side was made for you and me.

We can only assume that Lady Gaga had to deal with these constraints as she planned her performance — especially following the accusations Beyoncé received last year for displaying black pride on a national stage. So in this case, rather than not show up at all, she allowed her art to be the activism. She played within the confines and outwitted them as best she could.

The R-rated Django stars Jamie Foxx as a slave promised his freedom if he helps a bounty hunter (Christoph Waltz ) track down a plantation owner (Leonardo DiCaprio). \n \n STORY: \'Jack Reacher\' Lincoln Center Screening Postponed; Pittsburgh Premiere Set for Dec. 19 \n \n On Monday, The Weinstein Co. announced it was cancelling Tuesday night\'s Django premiere in Los Angeles because of the school tragedy. \n \n “Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families of the tragedy in Newtown, Conn., and in this time of national mourning we have decided to forgo our scheduled event,"" the company said in a statement, adding that it would still hold a screening for cast and crew. \n \n At a junket for Django on Saturday in New York, Tarantino said he is weary of defending the violence in his movies. \n \n ""I just think there\'s violence in the world. Tragedies happen,"" the filmmaker said. ""[Django} is a Western. Give me a break."" \n \n Foxx, however, said Hollywood can\'t ""ignore"" that violence in movies has an impact. And this summer, Harvey Weinstein, an advocate for gun control, called for a summit on violence in film after the Aurora theater shooting during a midnight screening of The Dark Knight Rises. \n \n In scrubbing the Django premiere, The Weinstein Co. was following the cue of Paramount, which postponed Saturday\'s planned Jack Reacher premiere in Pittsburgh (the event has been rescheduled for Wednesday). \n \n FILM REVIEW: \'Jack Reacher\' \n \n The Film Society of Lincoln Center in New York City also postponed a special screening of Jack Reacher on Monday night that was to be accompanied by a discussion with Cruise and director Christopher McQuarrie, saying it was doing so out of respect for the families of the victims. \n \n The Weinstein Co. declined to say whether it was changing its marketing materials for Django in the wake of the shooting. \n \n On Sunday, Warner Bros. used NFL football to advertise its upcoming period pic Gangster Squad. The spot was heavy on gunfire. \n \n Gangster Squad was supposed to open in September, but the studio pushed back the release after the Colorado shootings in order to remove a scene depicting a gunfight in a movie theater.', 'Tarantino film ‘Django Unchained’ latest to be pulled after school massacre \n \n By Agence France-Presse \n \n Tuesday, December 18, 2012 1:26 EST \n \n A Hollywood premiere of notoriously violent director Quentin Tarantino’s latest film “Django Unchained” was canceled Monday, the latest such response to the Connecticut school massacre. \n \n A string of movies and TV shows have been pulled or postponed since Friday’s shootings, while sporting events have held moments of silence and players have worn black armbands to honor the victims, 20 of whom were young children. \n \n The Weinstein Company said that a premiere scheduled Tuesday in Los Angeles of “Django Unchained” – which is due to open on Christmas Day in US theaters – had been called off. \n \n “Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families of the tragedy in Newtown, Connecticut, and in this time of national mourning we have decided to forgo our scheduled event,” said a Weinstein Company spokesperson. \n \n The studio will still hold a screening for cast and crew and their friends and families, industry daily “Variety” reported. \n \n Tarantino is known for screen violence, in movies from 1992′s “Reservoir Dogs” to 2009′s “Inglorious Basterds.” \n \n In his new film, a slave-turned-bounty hunter sets out to rescue his wife from a brutal plantation owner. \n \n The move came after the weekend premiere of Tom Cruise’s latest movie, “Jack Reacher” – about a homicide investigator probing a trained military sniper who shot five random victims – was postponed. \n \n “Our hearts go out to all those who lost loved ones,” said studio Paramount, adding that it took the action “out of honor and respect for the families of the victims whose lives were senselessly taken.” \n \n Fox canceled a weekend red carpet event and after-party for “Parental Guidance” starring Bette Midler and Billy Crystal “in light of the horrific tragedy.” \n \n The studio also replaced planned broadcasts Sunday of episodes of “Family Guy” and “American Dad” to avoid any insensitivities to the massacre. \n \n A moment of silence was observed at National Football League (NFL) games across the country Sunday to remember those killed in the normally peaceful town of Newtown, Connecticut. \n \n While some events were canceled because of content, others did not appear to be. \n \n PG-rated “Parental Guidance” got its parental warning for some rude humor, not for violence, according to the IMDb industry website. \n \n Veteran crooner Barry Manilow postponed a planned Friday night show in Palm Desert, California until Sunday, saying on his website: “Perhaps this small gesture of solidarity will help support these families on this terrible day.” \n \n Celebrities were quick to join online expressions of shock and sympathy. \n \n Pop star Justin Bieber tweeted: “My prayers go out to all those suffering in this tragedy. it’s just wrong. Everyone please pray for them.” \n \n “God have mercy!!!! No one deserves this! Praying for the families of the victims of the Connecticut shooting!! What a Christmas it will be,” added singer Rihanna on the micro-blogging site.', 'President Barack Obama Thursday eulogized Nelson Mandela as “a man who took history in his hands and bent the arc of the moral universe toward justice.” \n \n Obama, speaking shortly after South African President Jacob Zuma announced Mandela’s death, called the man for so long known as Prisoner 46664 as “one of the most influential, courageous and profoundly good human beings that any of us will share time with on this earth.” \n \n Text Size - \n \n + \n \n reset Breaking news roundup \n \n “We will not likely see the likes of Nelson Mandela again — so it falls to us as best we can to forward the example that he set: to make decisions guided not by hate, but by love, to never discount the difference that one person can make, to strive for a future that is worthy of his sacrifice.” \n \n (VIDEO: Nelson Mandela, a look back) \n \n The president is expected to travel to South Africa for the state funeral, which has not yet been scheduled. National security staff told Obama in the Oval Office of Mandela’s death shortly before 5 p.m. EST, White House officials said. \n \n Obama ordered American flags lowered to half staff through Monday in recognition that “the United States has lost a close friend, South Africa has lost an incomparable liberator, and the world has lost an inspiration for freedom, justice, and human dignity.” \n \n He reiterated these sentiments to Zuma in a phone call Thursday evening, offering his condolences on behalf of the nation, and speaking of “how profoundly Mandela’s extraordinary example of moral courage, kindness, and humility influenced his own life” and of the deep relationship between the United States and South Africa, the White House said. \n \n (PHOTOS: Nelson Mandela’s life and career) \n \n Mandela is the father of modern South Africa, and Obama addressed part of his remarks to the people of that nation as well, praising them for being an example to the world of “renewal and reconciliation and resilience.” \n \n Beginning his statement at the White House by reading a quote from Mandela, the president spoke for just a few minutes, reflecting on Mandela’s impact on the world — and on him personally. Obama spoke of how reading Mandela shaped his thinking about who he was and who would want to be, recalling that his own entry into politics was a speech at an anti-apartheid, South African divestment rally. \n \n “I am one of the countless millions who drew inspirations from Nelson Mandela’s life,” Obama said. “I cannot fully imagine my own life without the example that Nelson Mandela set. So long as I live, I will do what I can to learn from him.” \n \n The two met just once, and briefly — in Washington in 2005, when the just-elected Senator Obama pushed for a meeting with the former president, and was initially rebuffed — but did produce a well-known photo of Obama leaning over a seated Mandela, holding his hand, one in the shadow, one in the light. \n \n Obama did not meet with him when he traveled to South Africa a year later, but Mandela sent Obama a letter after his election calling it a measure of what was possible in the world, and the two spoke occasionally over the phone in the years since. \n \n A Mandela health scare halted plans for a possible meeting when Obama returned to South Africa this past summer. But Obama visited Mandela’s old cell at Robben Island and met with Mandela’s family, and in a speech while in the country, praised the leader for showing “us that one man’s courage can move the world.” \n \n Carrie Budoff Brown contributed.']",3,"– Hollywood has been responding to the Newtown tragedy with a slew of cancellations, postponements, and other changes to movies: Tonight's LA premiere of Django Unchained, the latest violent film from Quentin Tarantino, has been canceled. ""In this time of national mourning we have decided to forgo our scheduled event,"" says a Weinstein Company rep, according to the New York Times. A private screening will be held instead of a big red carpet gala. Two events related to Tom Cruise's new movie, Jack Reacher, have been postponed: last Saturday's Pittsburgh premiere as well as a Film Society of Lincoln Center screening involving Cruise. Paramount is also tweaking the marketing materials for the movie, according to the Hollywood Reporter. A source says a scene in which Cruise's character, a former military cop, uses a semiautomatic weapon is being removed from promos. Even a comedy, Parental Guidance, saw its red carpet premiere and after-party canceled over the weekend ""in light of the horrific tragedy,"" AFP reports. The film stars Bette Midler and Billy Crystal. Also over the weekend, episodes of Family Guy and American Dad were yanked."
223,"['TOKYO Exhausted engineers attached a power cable to the outside of Japan\'s tsunami-crippled nuclear plant on Saturday in a race to prevent deadly radiation from an accident now rated at least as bad as America\'s Three Mile Island incident in 1979. \n \n Further cabling inside was under way before an attempt to restart water pumps needed to cool overheated nuclear fuel rods at the six-reactor Fukushima plant in northeastern Japan, 240 km (150 miles) north of Tokyo. \n \n Japan\'s unprecedented multiple crisis of earthquake, tsunami and radiation leak has unsettled world financial markets, prompted international reassessment of nuclear safety and given the Asian nation its sternest test since World War Two. \n \n It has also stirred unhappy memories of Japan\'s past nuclear nightmare -- the U.S. atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. \n \n Working inside a 20 km (12 miles) evacuation zone at Fukushima, nearly 300 engineers were focused on trying to find a solution by restoring power to pumps in four of the reactors. \n \n ""TEPCO has connected the external transmission line with the receiving point of the plant and confirmed that electricity can be supplied,"" the plant\'s operator Tokyo Electric Power Co said in a statement. \n \n Another 1,480 meters (5,000 feet) of cable are being laid inside the complex before engineers try to crank up the coolers at reactor No.2, followed by numbers 1, 3 and 4 this weekend, company officials said. \n \n If that works it will be a turning point. \n \n ""If they are successful in getting the cooling infrastructure up and running, that will be a significant step forward in establishing stability,"" said Eric Moore, a nuclear power expert at U.S.-based FocalPoint Consulting Group. \n \n If not, there is an option of last resort under consideration to bury the sprawling 40-year-old plant in sand and concrete to prevent a catastrophic radiation release. \n \n That method was used to seal huge leakages from the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. \n \n Underlining authorities\' desperation, fire trucks sprayed water overnight in a crude tactic to cool reactor No.3, considered the most critical because of its use of mixed oxides, or mox, containing both uranium and highly toxic plutonium. \n \n Japan has raised the severity rating of the nuclear crisis to level 5 from 4 on the seven-level INES international scale, putting it on a par with the Three Mile Island accident in 1979, although some experts say it is more serious. \n \n Chernobyl, in Ukraine, was a 7 on that scale. \n \n THOUSANDS DEAD, MISSING AND SUFFERING \n \n The operation to avert large-scale radiation has overshadowed the humanitarian aftermath of the 9.0-magnitude quake and 10-meter (33-foot) tsunami that struck on March 11. \n \n Nearly 7,000 people have been confirmed killed in the double natural disaster, which turned whole towns into waterlogged and debris-shrouded wastelands. \n \n Another 10,700 people are missing with many feared dead. \n \n Some 390,000 people, including many among Japan\'s aging population, are homeless and battling near-freezing temperatures in shelters in northeastern coastal areas. \n \n Food, water, medicine and heating fuel are in short supply. \n \n ""Everything is gone, including money,"" said Tsukasa Sato, a 74-year-old barber with a heart condition, as he warmed his hands in front of a stove at a shelter for the homeless. \n \n Health officials and the U.N. atomic watchdog have said radiation levels in the capital Tokyo were not harmful. But the city has seen an exodus of tourists, expatriates and many Japanese, who fear a blast of radioactive material. \n \n ""I\'m leaving because my parents are terrified. I personally think this will turn out to be the biggest paper tiger the world has ever seen,"" said Luke Ridley, 23, from London as he sat at Narita international airport using his laptop. \n \n ""I\'ll probably come back in about a month."" \n \n Though there has been alarm around the world, experts have been warning there is little risk of radiation at dangerous levels spreading to other nations. \n \n The U.S. government said ""minuscule"" amounts of radiation were detected in California consistent with a release from Japan\'s damaged facility, but there were no levels of concern. \n \n Amid their distress, Japanese were proud of the 279 nuclear plant workers toiling in the wreckage, wearing masks, goggles and protective suits sealed by duct tape. \n \n ""My eyes well with tears at the thought of the work they are doing,"" Kazuya Aoki, a safety official at Japan\'s Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, told Reuters. \n \n G7 INTERVENTION FOR YEN \n \n The Group of Seven rich nations succeeded in calming global financial markets in rare concerted intervention to restrain a soaring yen. \n \n The dollar surged to 81.98 yen on Friday after the G7 moved to pour billions into markets buying dollars, euros and pounds -- the first such joint intervention since the group came to the aid of the newly launched euro in 2000. \n \n The dollar later dropped back to under 81 yen, but it was still far from the record low of 76.25 yen hit on Thursday. \n \n ""The only type of intervention that actually works is coordinated intervention, and it shows the solidarity of all central banks in terms of the severity of the situation in Japan,"" said Kathy Lien, director of currency research at GFT in New York. \n \n Japan\'s Nikkei share index ended up 2.7 percent, recouping some of the week\'s stinging losses. It lost 10.2 percent for the week, wiping $350 billion off market capitalization. \n \n The plight of the homeless worsened following a cold snap that brought heavy snow to the worst-affected areas. \n \n Nearly 290,000 households in the north were still without electricity, officials said, and the government said about 940,000 households lacked running water. \n \n Aid groups say most victims are getting help, but there are pockets of acute suffering. \n \n ""We\'ve seen children suffering with the cold, and lacking really basic items like food and clean water,"" Stephen McDonald of Save the Children said in a statement on Friday. \n \n (Additional reporting by Linda Sieg, Nathan Layne, Elaine Lies, Leika Kihara, Jon Herskovitz, Joseph Radford and Chris Gallagher in Japan; Fiona Ortiz in Madrid; Scott DiSavino in New York; Writing by Andrew Cawthorne; Editing by Robert Birsel)', 'YAMAGATA, Japan -- Emergency workers seemed to try everything they could think of Thursday to douse one of Japan\'s dangerously overheated nuclear reactors: helicopters, heavy-duty fire trucks, even water cannons normally used to quell rioters. But they couldn\'t be sure any of it was easing the peril at the tsunami-ravaged facility. \n \n (SCROLL DOWN FOR LIVE UPDATES) \n \n Three reactors have had at least partial meltdowns, but an even greater danger has emerged. Japanese and U.S. concerns were increasingly focusing on the pools used to store spent nuclear fuel: Some of the pools are dry or nearly empty and the rods could heat up and spew radiation. \n \n It could take days and ""possibly weeks"" to get the complex under control, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission Chairman Gregory Jazcko said. He defended the U.S. decision to recommend a 50-mile evacuation zone for its citizens, a much stronger measure than Japan has taken. \n \n A senior official with the U.N.\'s nuclear safety agency said there had been ""no significant worsening"" at the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant but that the situation remained ""very serious."" Graham Andrew told reporters in Vienna that nuclear fuel rods in two reactors were only about half covered with water, and in a third they were also not completely submerged. \n \n If the fuel is not fully covered, rising temperatures and pressure will increase the chances of complete meltdowns that would release much larger amounts of radioactive material than the failing plant has emitted so far. \n \n Low levels of radiation have been detected well beyond Tokyo, which is 140 miles (220 kilometers) south of the plant, but hazardous levels have been limited to the plant itself. Still, the crisis triggered by last week\'s earthquake and tsunami has forced thousands to evacuate and drained Tokyo\'s normally vibrant streets of life, its residents either leaving town or holing up in their homes. \n \n President Barack Obama appeared on television to assure Americans that officials do not expect harmful amounts of radiation to reach the U.S. or its territories. He also said the U.S. was offering Japan any help it could provide, and said he was asking for a comprehensive review of U.S. nuclear plant safety. \n \n Japanese and American assessments of the crisis have differed, with the plant\'s owner denying Jazcko\'s report Wednesday that Unit 4\'s spent fuel pool was dry and that anyone who gets close to the plant could face potentially lethal doses of radiation. But a Tokyo Electric Power Co. executive moved closer to the U.S. position Thursday. \n \n ""Considering the amount of radiation released in the area, the fuel rods are more likely to be exposed than to be covered,"" Yuichi Sato said. \n \n Workers have been dumping seawater when possible to control temperatures at the plant since the quake and tsunami knocked out power to its cooling systems, but they tried even more desperate measures on Unit 3\'s reactor and cooling pool. \n \n Two Japanese military CH-47 Chinook helicopters began dumping seawater on Unit 3 on Thursday morning, defense ministry spokeswoman Kazumi Toyama said. The choppers doused the reactor with at least four loads of water in just the first 10 minutes, though television footage showed much of it appearing to disperse in the wind. \n \n Chopper crews flew missions of about 40 minutes each to limit their radiation exposure, passing over the reactor with loads of about 2,000 gallons (7,500 liters) of water. Another 9,000 gallons (35,000 liters) of water were blasted from military trucks with high-pressure sprayers used to extinguish fires at plane crashes, though the vehicles had to stay safely back from areas deemed to have too much radiation. \n \n Special police units with water cannons were also tried, but they could not reach the targets from safe distances and had to pull back, said Yasuhiro Hashimoto, a spokesman for Japan\'s nuclear safety agency. \n \n Unit 3\'s reactor uses a fuel that combines plutonium, better known as an ingredient in nuclear weapons, and reprocessed uranium. The presence of this mixed oxide fuel, or MOX, means potentially that two very harmful radioactive products could be released into the environment. \n \n Tokyo Electric Power said it believed workers were making headway in staving off a catastrophe both with the spraying and, especially, with efforts to complete an emergency power line to restart the plant\'s own electric cooling systems. \n \n ""This is a first step toward recovery,"" said Teruaki Kobayashi, a facilities management official at the power company. He said radiation levels ""have somewhat stabilized at their lows"" and that some of the spraying had reached its target, with one reactor emitting steam. \n \n ""We are doing all we can as we pray for the situation to improve,"" Kobayashi said. Authorities planned to spray again Friday, and Kobayashi said: ""Choices are limited. We just have to stick to what we can do most quickly and efficiently."" \n \n Work on connecting the new power line to the plant was expected to begin Friday and take 10 to 15 hours, said Nuclear Safety Agency spokesman Minoru Ohgoda. But the utility is not sure the cooling systems will still function. If they don\'t, electricity won\'t help. \n \n Four of the plant\'s six reactors have seen fires, explosions, damage to the structures housing reactor cores, partial meltdowns or rising temperatures. Officials also recently said temperatures are rising even in the spent fuel pools of the other two reactors. \n \n The troubles at the nuclear complex were set in motion by last Friday\'s 9.0-magnitude earthquake and tsunami, which knocked out power and destroyed backup generators needed for the reactors\' cooling systems. That added a nuclear crisis on top of twin natural disasters that likely killed well more than 10,000 people and left hundreds of thousands homeless. \n \n Mario V. Bonaca, a physicist sits on an advisory committee to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said he believes the focus of the effort has shifted to the spent fuel pools. ""I understand that they\'ve controlled the cooling of the cores,"" said Bonaca, who said he was basing his understanding on NRC and industry sources. \n \n The storage pools need a constant source of cooling water. Even when removed from reactors, uranium rods are still extremely hot and must be cooled for months, possibly longer, to prevent them from heating up again and emitting radioactivity. \n \n While a core team of 180 emergency workers has been rotating in and out of the complex to avoid exposure, experts said that anyone working close to the reactors was almost certainly being exposed to radiation levels that could, at least, give them much higher cancer risks. \n \n Experts note, though, that radiation levels drop quickly with distance from the complex. While elevated radiation has been detected well outside the evacuation zone, experts say those levels are not dangerous. \n \n U.S. officials were taking no chances. In Washington, the State Department warned U.S. citizens to consider leaving the country and offered voluntary evacuation to family members and dependents of U.S. personnel in the cities of Tokyo, Yokohama and Nagoya. \n \n The first flight left Thursday, with fewer than 100 people onboard, Undersecretary of State Patrick Kennedy said. Plans also call for airlifting several thousand family members of U.S. armed forces personnel as well as nonessential staff stationed in Japan in the coming days. \n \n The U.S. evacuation zone is far bigger than that established by Japan, which has called for a 12-mile zone and has told those within 20 miles to stay indoors. Daniel B. Poneman, U.S. deputy secretary of energy, said at the briefing that his agency agreed with the 50-mile zone - but said Japan\'s measures were also prudent. \n \n Nearly a week after the earthquake and tsunami, police said more than 452,000 people were staying in schools and other shelters, as supplies of fuel, medicine and other necessities ran short. Both victims and aid workers appealed for more help, as the chances of finding more survivors dwindled. \n \n Noriko Sawaki lives in a battered neighborhood in Sendai that is still without running water and food or gasoline supplies and that, she said, makes life exhausting. ""It\'s frustrating, because we don\'t have a goal, something to strive for. This just keeps on going,"" said the 48-year-old. \n \n In the town of Kesennuma, people lined up to get into a supermarket after a delivery of key supplies, such as instant rice packets and diapers. \n \n Each person was only allowed to buy 10 items, NHK television reported. \n \n With diapers hard to find in many areas, an NHK program broadcast a how-to session on fashioning a diaper from a plastic shopping bag and a towel.', 'Smoke billowed from a building at Japan\'s crippled nuclear power plant Friday as emergency crews worked to reconnect electricity to cooling systems and spray more water on overheating nuclear fuel at the tsunami-ravaged facility. \n \n ALTERNATE CROP OF TOK870 OF MARCH 17, 2011 - In this photo taken on Wednesday afternoon, March 16, 2011 and released on Thursday, March 17 by Tokyo Electric Power Co.

(Associated Press) \n \n Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant is pictured before helicopters dump water on the stricken reactor to cool overheated fuel rods inside the core in Okumamachi, Fukushima Prefecture, Japan, Thursday... (Associated Press) \n \n Four of the troubled Fukushima Dai-ichi plant\'s six reactor units have seen fires, explosions or partial meltdowns in the week since the tsunami. While the reactor cores where energy is generated are a concern, water in the pools used to store used nuclear fuel are also major worries. Water in at least one fuel pool _ in the complex\'s Unit 3 _ is believed to be dangerously low, exposing the stored fuel rods. Without enough water, the rods may heat further and spew out radiation. \n \n ""We see it as an extremely serious accident,"" Yukiya Amano, the head of the U.N.\'s International Atomic Energy Agency, told reporters Friday just after arriving in Tokyo. ""This is not something that just Japan should deal with, and people of the entire world should cooperate with Japan and the people in the disaster areas."" \n \n Frantic efforts were made Thursday to douse a number of units with water, and authorities were preparing to repeat many of those efforts. \n \n Friday\'s smoke came from the complex\'s Unit 2, and its cause was not known, the nuclear safety agency said. An explosion had hit the building on Tuesday, possibly damaging a crucial cooling chamber that sits below the reactor core. \n \n Last week\'s 9.0 quake and tsunami in Japan\'s northeast set off the nuclear problems by knocking out power to cooling systems at the reactors. The unfolding crises have led to power shortages in Japan, forced auto and other factories to close, sending shockwaves through global manufacturing and trade, and triggered a plunge in Japanese stock prices. \n \n Low levels of radiation have been detected well beyond Tokyo, which is 140 miles (220 kilometers) south of the plant, but hazardous levels have been limited to the plant itself. Still, the crisis has forced thousands to evacuate and drained Tokyo\'s normally vibrant streets of life, its residents either leaving town or holing up in their homes. \n \n The Japanese government has been slow in releasing information on the crisis, even as the troubles have multiplied. In a country where the nuclear industry has a long history of hiding its safety problems, this has left many people _ in Japan and among governments overseas _ confused and anxious. \n \n ""I feel a sense of dread,"" said Yukiko Morioka, 63, who has seen business dry up at her lottery ticket booth in Tokyo. ""I\'m not an expert, so it\'s difficult to understand what\'s going on. That makes it scarier."" \n \n A senior official with the U.N. nuclear agency said Thursday there had been ""no significant worsening"" at the nuclear plant but that the situation remained ""very serious."" Graham Andrew told reporters in Vienna that nuclear fuel rods in two reactors were only about half covered with water, and they were also not completely submerged in a third. \n \n Edano said Friday that Tokyo is asking the U.S. government for help and that the two are discussing the specifics. \n \n ""We are coordinating with the U.S. government as to what the U.S. can provide and what people really need,"" Edano said. \n \n At times, the two close allies have offered starkly differing assessments over the dangers at Fukushima. U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission Chairman Gregory Jazcko said Thursday that it could take days and ""possibly weeks"" to get the complex under control. He defended the U.S. decision to recommend a 50-mile (80-kilometer) evacuation zone for its citizens, wider than the 30-mile (50-kilometer) band Japan has ordered. \n \n Crucial to the effort to regain control over the Fukushima plant is laying a new power line to the plant, allowing operators to restore cooling systems. The operator, Tokyo Electric Power Co., missed a deadline late Thursday but said Friday that workers hoped to complete the effort in 10 to 15 hours, said nuclear safety agency spokesman Minoru Ohgoda. \n \n But the utility is not sure the cooling systems will still function. If they don\'t, electricity won\'t help. \n \n The official death toll from the disasters stood at 6,405 as of Friday morning, with 10,259 missing, the national police agency said. \n \n President Barack Obama appeared on television to assure Americans that officials do not expect harmful amounts of radiation to reach the U.S. or its territories. He also said the U.S. was offering Japan any help it could provide. \n \n A utility official said Wednesday that the company has been unable to get information such as water levels and temperatures from any of the spent fuel pools in the four most troubled reactors. \n \n Workers have been dumping seawater when possible to control temperatures at the plant since the quake and tsunami knocked out power to its cooling systems, but they tried even more desperate measures on Units 3 and 4. \n \n On Thursday, military helicopters dumped thousands of gallons of water from huge buckets onto Unit 3, and also used military firefighting trucks normally used to extinguish fires at plane crashes. \n \n Officials announced Friday they would not continue with the helicopter drops _ televised footage appeared to show much of that water blowing away _ but would continue spraying from the trucks. \n \n Police said more than 452,000 people made homeless by the quake and tsunami were staying in schools and other shelters, as supplies of fuel, medicine and other necessities ran short. Both victims and aid workers appealed for more help, as the chances of finding more survivors dwindled. \n \n At the Fukushima Dai-ichi plant, a core team of 180 emergency workers has been rotating out of the complex to minimize radiation exposure. \n \n The storage pools need a constant source of cooling water. Even when removed from reactors, uranium rods are still extremely hot and must be cooled for months, possibly longer, to prevent them from heating up again and emitting radioactivity. \n \n In Washington, the State Department warned U.S. citizens to consider leaving the country and offered voluntary evacuation to family members and dependents of U.S. personnel in the cities of Tokyo, Yokohama and Nagoya. \n \n ___ \n \n Yamaguchi reported from Tokyo.

American officials did not release specific radiation readings. \n \n American officials said their biggest worry was that a frenetic series of efforts by the Japanese military to get water into four of the plant’s six reactors — including using water cannons and firefighting helicopters that dropped water but appeared to largely miss their targets — showed few signs of working. \n \n “This is something that will likely take some time to work through, possibly weeks, as eventually you remove the majority of the heat from the reactors and then the spent fuel pool,” said Gregory Jaczko, the chairman of the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission , briefing reporters at the White House. \n \n The effort by the Japanese to hook some electric power back up to the plant did not begin until Thursday and even if they succeed, it is unclear whether the cooling systems, in reactor buildings battered by a tsunami and then torn apart by hydrogen explosions, survived the crisis in good enough shape to be useful. \n \n “What you are seeing are desperate efforts — just throwing everything at it in hopes something will work,” said one American official with long nuclear experience who would not speak for attribution. “Right now this is more prayer than plan.” \n \n On Thursday, President Obama said that the crisis had convinced him to order the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to do a comprehensive review of the safety of nuclear plants in the United States. \n \n After a day in which American and Japanese officials gave radically different assessments of the danger from the nuclear plant, the two governments tried on Thursday to join forces. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Experts met in Tokyo to compare notes. The United States, with Japanese permission, began to put the intelligence-collection aircraft over the site, in hopes of gaining a view for Washington as well as its allies in Tokyo that did not rely on the announcements of officials from the Tokyo Electric Power Company, which operates Fukushima Daiichi. \n \n American officials say they suspect that the company has consistently underestimated the risk and moved too slowly to contain the damage. \n \n Aircraft normally used to monitor North Korea’s nuclear weapons activities — a Global Hawk drone and U-2 spy planes — were flying missions over the reactor, trying to help the Japanese government map out its response to last week’s 9.0-magnitude earthquake, the tsunami that followed and now the nuclear disaster. \n \n President Obama made an unscheduled stop at the Japanese Embassy to sign a condolence book, writing, “My heart goes out to the people of Japan during this enormous tragedy.” He added, “Because of the strength and wisdom of its people, we know that Japan will recover, and indeed will emerge stronger than ever.” \n \n Later, he appeared in the Rose Garden at the White House to offer continued American support for the earthquake and tsunami victims, and technical help at the nuclear site. \n \n Video \n \n But before the recovery can begin, the nuclear plant must be brought under control. On Friday, steam that was likely laced with radioactive particles was again rising over the plant, this time billowing from reactor No. 2, which suffered an explosion Tuesday. But Japanese authorities said they did not yet know the cause of the latest release. \n \n American officials, meanwhile, remained fixated on the temperature readings inside that reactor and two others that had been operating until the earthquake shut them down, as well as at the plant’s spent fuel pools, looking for any signs that their high levels of heat were going down. If the fuel rods are uncovered and exposed to air, they heat up and can burst into flames, spewing radioactive elements. \n \n So far the officials saw no signs of dropping temperatures. And the Web site of the International Atomic Energy Agency , the United Nations nuclear watchdog, made it clear that there were no readings at all from some critical areas. Part of the American effort, by satellites and aircraft, is to identify the hot spots, something the Japanese have not been able to do in some cases. \n \n Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Made for quick assessments of radiation emergencies, the Aerial Measuring System is an instrument system that fits on a helicopter or fixed-wing aircraft to sample air and survey the land below. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Daniel B. Poneman, the deputy secretary of energy, said at a White House briefing on Thursday that preliminary results of the initial flights “are consistent with the recommendations that came down from the chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission,” which led to the 50-mile evacuation guideline given to American expatriates. Although the worst contamination is closer to the plant, the recommendation takes into account the possibility of shifting winds or greater emissions. \n \n The State Department has also said it would fly out of the country any dependents of American diplomats or military personnel within the region of the plant and as far south as Tokyo. Space will be made for other Americans who cannot get a flight, it said. \n \n Getting the Japanese to accept the American detection equipment was a delicate diplomatic maneuver, which some Japanese officials originally resisted. But as it became clear that conditions at the plant were spinning out of control, and with Japanese officials admitting they had little hard evidence about whether there was water in the cooling pools or breaches in the reactor containment structures, they began to accept more help. \n \n The sensors on the instrument pod are good at mapping radioactive isotopes, like cesium 137, which has been detected around the nuclear plant and has a half-life of 30 years. In high doses, it can cause acute radiation sickness . Lower doses can alter cellular function, leading to an increased risk of cancer . \n \n Cesium 137 can enter the body through many foods, including milk. \n \n On Wednesday, when the American Embassy in Tokyo, on advice from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, told Americans to evacuate a radius of “approximately 50 miles” around the Fukushima plant, the recommendation was based on a specific calculation of risk of radioactive fallout in the affected area. \n \n In a statement, the commission said the advice grew out of its assessment that projected radiation doses within the evacuation zone might exceed one rem to the body or five rems to the thyroid gland. That organ is extremely sensitive to iodine 131 — another of the deadly byproducts of nuclear fuel, this one causing thyroid cancer . \n \n The commission says that the average American is exposed to about 0.62 rem of radiation each year from natural and manmade sources. \n \n The American-provided instruments in Japan measure real levels of radiation on the ground. In contrast, scientists around the world have also begun to draw up forecasts of how the prevailing winds pick up the Japanese radioactive material and carry it over the Pacific in invisible plumes. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Private analysts said the United States was also probably monitoring the reactor crisis with spy satellites that can spot the heat from fires — helping it independently assess the state of the reactor complex from a distance. \n \n Jeffrey G. Lewis, an intelligence specialist at the Monterey Institute, a research center, noted that the Japanese assessment of Reactor No. 4 at the Daiichi complex seemed to depend in part on visual surveillance by helicopter pilots. \n \n “I’ve got to think that, if we put our best assets into answering that question, we can do better,” he said in an interview. \n \n One main concern at No. 4 has been a fire that was burning there earlier in the week; American officials are not convinced that the fire has gone out. \n \n American officials have also worried that the spent-fuel pool at that reactor has run dry, exposing the rods. Japanese officials, however, have concentrated much of their recent efforts on Reactor No. 3, which has been intermittently releasing radiation from what the authorities believe may be a ruptured containment vessel around the reactor. Temperatures at that reactor’s spent fuel pool are also high. \n \n Perhaps because of the difficulties experienced Thursday trying to accurately drop water from helicopters, the Japanese military announced Friday that it was halting those efforts for at least a day."", 'George W.

Some of the witnesses still dine out on it. \n \n The venue was the Oval Office. A group of British dignitaries, including Gordon Brown, were paying a visit. It was at the height of the 2008 presidential election campaign, not long after Bush publicly endorsed John McCain as his successor. \n \n Naturally the election came up in conversation. Trying to be even-handed and polite, the Brits said something diplomatic about McCain’s campaign, expecting Bush to express some warm words of support for the Republican candidate. \n \n Not a chance. “I probably won’t even vote for the guy,” Bush told the group, according to two people present.“I had to endorse him. But I’d have endorsed Obama if they’d asked me.” \n \n Endorse Obama? Cue dumbfounded look from British officials, followed by some awkward remarks about the Washington weather. Even Gordon Brown’s poker face gave way to a flash of astonishment. \n \n To be fair, this wasn’t completely unexpected.

But our priority right now is to try and cool them down first,” said an official, as authorities work to restore power. Smoke has been rising from the No. 2 reactor at the plant, and authorities aren’t sure of the cause—though it may be linked to the explosion there Tuesday, notes the AP. New damage has been discovered in the fuel pool at the plant’s No. 4 reactor, hampering cooling efforts to refill it with water (click for more on the alarming situation). US data-collecting flights suggest that radiation hasn’t expanded outside a 19-mile area—but Japan has raised its threat level from 4 to 5 out of 7, pointing to danger that extends beyond the local. The crisis could continue for weeks, said a US official. Meanwhile, the Huffington Post notes, authorities are using every cooling method available, from fire trucks to water cannons."
224,"['Oxytocin, a hormone often referred to as the ""cuddle chemical"" for its role in helping to foster intimate relationships—particularly between mothers and their newborns—may help people with autism to read and react to social cues, according to the preliminary results of a small study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Individuals with autism spectrum disorders often have trouble engaging and interacting in social situations, frequently avoiding eye contact, for example, and previous research has also shown that people who are autistic often have lower levels of the hormone oxytocin. In this recent study, researchers from France\'s Center of Cognitive Neuroscience used nasal inhalers to give oxytocin to 13 individuals with high-functioning autism or Asperger\'s syndrome. Afterwards, the researchers examined the study participants\' reactions to social stimuli. They found that, after the oxytocin, the subjects showed significant improvement on social tasks—including making more eye contact when shown pictures of faces, and responding to other players in a ball tossing game. \n \n Oxytocin, sometimes referred to as the ""love hormone"", is one powerful chemical: during physical intimacy, it increases for both men and women; it acts as a hormone to help induce labor and lactation in mothers; and it also serves as a nuerotransmitter in the brain—research suggests that it influences everything from our ability to fall in love, to our tendency toward monogamous relationships and ability to trust others. Should these initial findings be confirmed, they may suggest a potential therapeutic use of oxytocin for individuals with autism spectrum disorders. What\'s more, it could even increase opportunities for early intervention for children diagnosed with autism.

For this is an army on the advance, and the city they are entering was until 48 hours ago their enemies’ most important redoubt. \n \n Ukrainian forces established a ring of checkpoints around Slavyansk in early May, effectively laying siege to the city in an attempt to contain the rebel expansion. \n \n But the blockade was fractured and the isolated checkpoints vulnerable to attacks by rebel forces based in the city. \n \n A little over a week earlier, rebels used tanks to surprise and destroy a checkpoint to the north of the city, in a demoralising blow to government forces. \n \n It was one strike in a scrappy war of raid and counter-raid at which the highly motivated pro-Russian fighters excelled – and which appeared to be locked in a bloody stalemate. \n \n Ukrainian soldiers look at wrecked tanks and armored personnel carriers left by pro-Russian insurgents in Slavyansk, Ukraine (Getty) \n \n That resistance crumbled suddenly and in the early hours of Saturday morning, following several days of artillery bombardment to which the rebels had no answer. \n \n Gathering their remaining tanks and fighting vehicles, Igor Strelkov, the rebel commander, and his men made a desperate dash for Donetsk, the regional capital 60 miles to the south where the self-declared People’s Republic had established its government. \n \n Most – but not all – of the fighters appear to have got through. With the rebel army regrouping, fears are growing of a similar, and perhaps even bloodier, siege in Donetsk, which, with a population of one million, is 10 times the size of Slavyansk. \n \n Two days after the break-out, Slavyansk – scarred by battle, but far from destroyed – is still a long way from a return to pre-war normality. Ukrainian troops are building their own pillboxes to reinforce checkpoints and sandbag bunkers once manned by pro-Russian militiamen. \n \n There is still no running water or electricity. Gas has cut out more than once and few, if any, businesses are open. The streets remain largely deserted, much of the civilian population having fled or remaining indoors. \n \n On Lenin Square, a small crowd of mostly elderly civilians waited for distribution of the “humanitarian” supplies – mostly food, water and medicines – promised by Kiev. Lenin’s statue now supports a shield emblazoned with the stylised trident of the Ukrainian coat of arms. \n \n The exact extent of the damage is still difficult to assess. Access to the city and surrounding area is strictly controlled by the Ukrainians. \n \n “We’ve got nothing. Nothing. I never expected to feel such fear,” said Elena, 51, as she watched Ukrainian troops trying to salvage a tank – it was not clear whose – that had rolled down a nearby gully. “We’ve only survived because we keep a bit of a reserve of water and food.” \n \n Mines lay near a destroyed pro-Russian APC near the city of Slovyansk (AP) \n \n Like many, she declined to voice a preference for one side or the other, only giving thanks that the fear and danger of the past three months appears to be at an end. \n \n A mile further on, just past the roadside monolith welcoming drivers to Slavyansk, the blackened turret of another tank obstructed the northbound lane. The rest of the vehicle had been thrown off the embankment on the other side of the road. Between them was the crater of the explosion that destroyed it. \n \n Nearby, the tangled remains of an armoured personnel carrier sat among Ukrainian anti-tank mines, destroyed vehicle parts, and its own unused ammunition, apparently scattered but not detonated by the explosion that destroyed it. \n \n Major Andrei Tokatsyuk, the Ukrainian paratrooper who has commanded a checkpoint here since early May, said this was all that remained of a rebel armoured column that had tried to break through his checkpoint in the early hours of Saturday. \n \n He claimed to have lost one man, compared with almost the entire rebel force, though he declined to put a number on the enemy dead. One burnt body remained unburied on the hard shoulder. \n \n This appears to be a victory won partly by superior fire power – it is the vast artillery barrage unleashed by the Ukrainians following the end of a ceasefire last week that appears to have finally forced the rebels into retreat. \n \n But it is also a matter of attrition and numbers. Where the “anti-terrorist operation” was once an undermanned, under-equipped shambles, the area is now swarming with thousands of servicemen in a motley mix of uniforms – special forces, regular army, police and the National Guard, which is largely drawn from the revolutionary militias that overthrew Viktor Yanukovych in February. In a strange twist, they now serve alongside men of the Berkut, the elite riot police with whom they fought running battles in Kiev this winter. Even the freelance pro-Kiev militias such as the Donbass battalion, raised and equipped by private individuals and with a previously fractious relationship with the army, appear to have been brought into the fold. \n \n An elderly woman walks away from a damaged house in Slavyansk, Ukraine (Photoshot) \n \n The columns of advancing troops moving south into the newly captured territory over the past two days may be led by armoured vehicles, but many troops travel in buses, police cars, and Nissan pick-up trucks sprayed green and mounted with machineguns. \n \n Neither side in this war is rich and both armies depend on imaginative battlefield improvisation. But the superior numbers and resources of the Ukrainians are beginning to tell. \n \n Out-gunned, outnumbered, and with the Kremlin refusing to respond to their pleas for military intervention, the fighters of the Donetsk People’s Republic appear to be facing certain defeat. \n \n Yet this war is still far from over. \n \n The rebel militia may have suffered a major setback, but their dogged defence of Slavyansk and the breakout itself shows a fighting ability and level of motivation that will make any battle for Donetsk a bloody affair. \n \n On Monday, Ukraine’s richest man, Rinat Ahmetov, pleaded with the government not to bomb his home city. Pro-Russian rebels put up new barricades and residents said they feared the potential battle to come. Thousands have already left Donetsk, but most have nowhere to go, local officials said. \n \n Meanwhile the rebels are preparing for the expected government assault, destroying a railway bridge to block the highway north of the city and blowing up bridges on two other roads. \n \n They have even commandeered a vintage Soviet tank from the city’s Second World War museum. “We have got an engine to go in it,” said one rebel. “We have got some experts. We have to add the engine, ease the turret and it will be a working battle tank.”']",3,"– ""We are not thugs.

(AP Photo/Michael Probst, File) When you weigh all life on Earth, billions of humans don\'t amount to much compared to trees, earthworms or even viruses. But we really know how to throw what little weight we have around, according to a first-of-its-kind global census of the footprint of life on the planet. \n \n Humans only add up to about one ten-thousandth of the life on Earth, measured by the dry weight of the carbon that makes up the structure of all living things, also known as biomass. \n \n The planet\'s real heavyweights are plants. They outweigh people by about 7,500 to 1, and make up more than 80 percent of the world\'s biomass, a study in Monday\'s Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences said. \n \n Bacteria are nearly 13 percent of the world\'s biomass. Fungi—yeast, mold and mushrooms—make up about 2 percent.

Taking water out of the equation and measuring only dry carbon makes it easier for scientists to compare species. About one-sixth the weight of a human is dry carbon. Humans are about two-thirds water. \n \n ""Even though short in numbers, we have managed to throw a lot of sand in the air and mess up a lot of things,"" said noted Harvard biologist E.O.

Yet since the dawn of civilisation, humanity has caused the loss of 83% of all wild mammals and half of plants, while livestock kept by humans abounds. \n \n The new work is the first comprehensive estimate of the weight of every class of living creature and overturns some long-held assumptions. Bacteria are indeed a major life form – 13% of everything – but plants overshadow everything, representing 82% of all living matter. All other creatures, from insects to fungi, to fish and animals, make up just 5% of the world’s biomass. \n \n Another surprise is that the teeming life revealed in the oceans by the recent BBC television series Blue Planet II turns out to represent just 1% of all biomass. The vast majority of life is land-based and a large chunk – an eighth – is bacteria buried deep below the surface. \n \n “I was shocked to find there wasn’t already a comprehensive, holistic estimate of all the different components of biomass,” said Prof Ron Milo, at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, who led the work, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. \n \n “I would hope this gives people a perspective on the very dominant role that humanity now plays on Earth,” he said, adding that he now chooses to eat less meat due to the huge environmental impact of livestock. \n \n The transformation of the planet by human activity has led scientists to the brink of declaring a new geological era – the Anthropocene. One suggested marker for this change are the bones of the domestic chicken, now ubiquitous across the globe. \n \n The new work reveals that farmed poultry today makes up 70% of all birds on the planet, with just 30% being wild. The picture is even more stark for mammals – 60% of all mammals on Earth are livestock, mostly cattle and pigs, 36% are human and just 4% are wild animals. \n \n “It is pretty staggering,” said Milo. “In wildlife films, we see flocks of birds, of every kind, in vast amounts, and then when we did the analysis we found there are [far] more domesticated birds.” \n \n The destruction of wild habitat for farming, logging and development has resulted in the start of what many scientists consider the sixth mass extinction of life to occur in the Earth’s four billion year history. About half the Earth’s animals are thought to have been lost in the last 50 years. \n \n \n \n But comparison of the new estimates with those for the time before humans became farmers and the industrial revolution began reveal the full extent of the huge decline. Just one-sixth of wild mammals, from mice to elephants, remain, surprising even the scientists. In the oceans, three centuries of whaling has left just a fifth of marine mammals in the oceans. \n \n “It is definitely striking, our disproportionate place on Earth,” said Milo. “When I do a puzzle with my daughters, there is usually an elephant next to a giraffe next to a rhino. But if I was trying to give them a more realistic sense of the world, it would be a cow next to a cow next to a cow and then a chicken.” \n \n Despite humanity’s supremacy, in weight terms Homo sapiens is puny. Viruses alone have a combined weight three times that of humans, as do worms. Fish are 12 times greater than people and fungi 200 times as large. \n \n But our impact on the natural world remains immense, said Milo, particularly in what we choose to eat: “Our dietary choices have a vast effect on the habitats of animals, plants and other organisms.” \n \n “I would hope people would take this [work] as part of their world view of how they consume,” he said. ”I have not become vegetarian, but I do take the environmental impact into my decision making, so it helps me think, do I want to choose beef or poultry or use tofu instead?” \n \n The researchers calculated the biomass estimates using data from hundreds of studies, which often used modern techniques, such as satellite remote sensing that can scan great areas, and gene sequencing that can unravel the myriad organisms in the microscopic world. \n \n They started by assessing the biomass of a class of organisms and then they determined which environments such life could live in across the world to create a global total. They used carbon as the key measure and found all life contains 550bn tonnes of the element. The researchers acknowledge that substantial uncertainties remain in particular estimates, especially for bacteria deep underground, but say the work presents a useful overview. \n \n Paul Falkowski, at Rutgers University in the US and not part of the research team, said: “The study is, to my knowledge, the first comprehensive analysis of the biomass distribution of all organisms – including viruses – on Earth.” \n \n “There are two major takeaways from this paper,” he said. “First, humans are extremely efficient in exploiting natural resources. Humans have culled, and in some cases eradicated, wild mammals for food or pleasure in virtually all continents. Second, the biomass of terrestrial plants overwhelmingly dominates on a global scale – and most of that biomass is in the form of wood.”', 'Significance The composition of the biosphere is a fundamental question in biology, yet a global quantitative account of the biomass of each taxon is still lacking. We assemble a census of the biomass of all kingdoms of life. This analysis provides a holistic view of the composition of the biosphere and allows us to observe broad patterns over taxonomic categories, geographic locations, and trophic modes. \n \n Abstract A census of the biomass on Earth is key for understanding the structure and dynamics of the biosphere. However, a global, quantitative view of how the biomass of different taxa compare with one another is still lacking. Here, we assemble the overall biomass composition of the biosphere, establishing a census of the ≈550 gigatons of carbon (Gt C) of biomass distributed among all of the kingdoms of life. We find that the kingdoms of life concentrate at different locations on the planet; plants (≈450 Gt C, the dominant kingdom) are primarily terrestrial, whereas animals (≈2 Gt C) are mainly marine, and bacteria (≈70 Gt C) and archaea (≈7 Gt C) are predominantly located in deep subsurface environments. We show that terrestrial biomass is about two orders of magnitude higher than marine biomass and estimate a total of ≈6 Gt C of marine biota, doubling the previous estimated quantity. Our analysis reveals that the global marine biomass pyramid contains more consumers than producers, thus increasing the scope of previous observations on inverse food pyramids. Finally, we highlight that the mass of humans is an order of magnitude higher than that of all wild mammals combined and report the historical impact of humanity on the global biomass of prominent taxa, including mammals, fish, and plants. \n \n One of the most fundamental efforts in biology is to describe the composition of the living world. Centuries of research have yielded an increasingly detailed picture of the species that inhabit our planet and their respective roles in global ecosystems. In describing a complex system like the biosphere, it is critical to quantify the abundance of individual components of the system (i.e., species, broader taxonomic groups). A quantitative description of the distribution of biomass is essential for taking stock of biosequestered carbon (1) and modeling global biogeochemical cycles (2), as well as for understanding the historical effects and future impacts of human activities. \n \n Earlier efforts to estimate global biomass have mostly focused on plants (3⇓–5). In parallel, a dominant role for prokaryotic biomass has been advocated in a landmark paper by Whitman et al. (6) entitled “Prokaryotes: The unseen majority.” New sampling and detection techniques (7, 8) make it possible to revisit this claim. Likewise, for other taxa, such as fish, recent global sampling campaigns (9) have resulted in updated estimates, often differing by an order of magnitude or more from previous estimates. For groups such as arthropods, global estimates are still lacking (10, 11). \n \n All of the above efforts are each focused on a single taxon. We are aware of only two attempts at a comprehensive accounting of all biomass components on Earth: Whittaker and Likens (12) made a remarkable effort in the early 1970s, noting even then that their study was “intended for early obsolescence.” It did not include, for example, bacterial or fungal biomass. The other attempt, by Smil (13), was included as a subsection of a book intended for a broad readership. His work details characteristic values for the biomass of various taxa in many environments. Finally, Wikipedia serves as a highly effective platform for making accessible a range of estimates on various taxa (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomass_(ecology)#Global_biomass) but currently falls short of a comprehensive or integrated view. \n \n In the past decade, several major technological and scientific advances have facilitated an improved quantitative account of the biomass on Earth. Next-generation sequencing has enabled a more detailed and cultivation-independent view of the composition of natural communities based on the relative abundance of genomes (14). Better remote sensing tools enable us to probe the environment on a global scale with unprecedented resolution and specificity. The Tara Oceans expedition (15) is among recent efforts at global sampling that are expanding our view and coverage. Continental counterpart efforts, such as the National Ecological Observatory Network in North America, add more finely resolved, continent-specific details, affording us more robust descriptions of natural habitats. \n \n Here, we either assemble or generate estimates of the biomass for each of the major taxonomic groups that contribute to the global biomass distribution. Our analysis (described in detail in SI Appendix) is based on hundreds of studies, including recent studies that have overturned earlier estimates for many taxa (e.g., fish, subsurface prokaryotes, marine eukaryotes, soil fauna). \n \n Discussion Our census of the distribution of biomass on Earth provides an integrated global picture of the relative and absolute abundances of all kingdoms of life. We find that the biomass of plants dominates the biomass of the biosphere and is mostly located on land. The marine environment is primarily occupied by microbes, mainly bacteria and protists, which account for ≈70% of the total marine biomass. The remaining ≈30% is mainly composed of arthropods and fish. The deep subsurface holds ≈15% of the total biomass in the biosphere. It is chiefly composed of bacteria and archaea, which are mostly surface-attached and turn over their biomass every several months to thousands of years (18⇓⇓⇓–22). In addition to summarizing current knowledge of the global biomass distribution, our work highlights gaps in the current understanding of the biosphere. Our knowledge of the biomass composition of different taxa is mainly determined by our ability to sample their biomass in the wild. For groups such as plants, the use of multiple sources to estimate global biomass increases our confidence in the validity of current estimates. However, for other groups, such as terrestrial arthropods and protists, quantitative sampling of biomass is limited by technical constraints, and comprehensive data are thus lacking. Beyond specific taxa, there are entire environments for which our knowledge is very limited, namely, the deep subsurface environments such as deep aquifers and the ocean’s crust, which might hold the world largest aquifer (38). Studies in these environments are scarce, meaning that our estimates have particularly high uncertainty ranges and unknown systematic biases. Main gaps in our knowledge of these environments pertain to the distribution of biomass between the aquifer fluids and the surrounding rocks and the distribution of biomass between different microbial taxa, such as bacteria, archaea, protists, and fungi. Scientists have closely monitored the impact of humans on global biodiversity (39⇓–41), but less attention has been given to total biomass, resulting in high uncertainty regarding the impact of humanity on the biomass of vertebrates. Our estimates for the current and prehuman biomasses of vertebrates are only a crude first step in calculating these values (SI Appendix, Prehuman Biomass). The biomass of amphibians, which are experiencing a dramatic population decline (42), remains poorly characterized. Future research could reduce the uncertainty of current estimates by sampling more environments, which will better represent the diverse biosphere on Earth. In the case of prokaryotes, some major improvements were recently realized, with global estimates of marine deep subsurface prokaryote biomass reduced by about two orders of magnitude due to an increased diversity of sampling locations (7). Identifying gaps in our knowledge could indicate areas for which further scientific exploration could have the biggest impact on our understanding of the biosphere. As a concrete example, we identify the ratio between attached to unattached cells in the deep aquifers as a major contributor to the uncertainties associated with our estimate of the biomass of bacteria, archaea, and viruses. Improving our understanding of this specific parameter could help us better constrain the global biomasses of entire domains of life. In addition to improving our reported estimates, future studies can achieve a finer categorization of taxa. For example, the biomass of parasites, which is not resolved from their hosts in this study, might be larger than the biomass of top predators in some environments (43). By providing a unified, updated, and accessible global view of the biomass of different taxa, we also aim to disseminate knowledge of the biosphere composition to a wide range of students and researchers. Our survey puts into perspective claims regarding the overarching dominance of groups such as termites and ants (44), nematodes (45), and prokaryotes (6). For example, the biomass of termites [≈0.05 Gt C (25)] is on par with that of humans but is still around an order of magnitude smaller than that of other taxa, such as fish (≈0.7 Gt C; SI Appendix, Table S15). Other groups, such as nematodes, surpass any other animal species in terms of number of individuals (SI Appendix, Fig. S2) but constitute only about 1% of the total animal biomass. The census of biomass distribution on Earth presented here is comprehensive in scope and based on synthesis of data from the recent scientific literature. The integrated dataset enables us to draw basic conclusions concerning kingdoms that dominate the biomass of the biosphere, the distribution of biomass of each kingdom across different environments, and the opposite structures of the global marine and terrestrial biomass pyramids. We identify areas in which current knowledge is lacking and further research is most required. Ideally, future research will include both temporal and geographic resolution. We believe that the results described in this study will provide students and researchers with a holistic quantitative context for studying our biosphere. \n \n Materials and Methods Taxon-Specific Detailed Description of Data Sources and Procedures for Estimating Biomass. The complete account of the data sources used for estimating the biomass of each taxon, procedures for estimating biomass, and projections for the uncertainty associated with the estimate for the biomass of each taxon are provided in the SI Appendix. To make the steps for estimating the biomass of each taxon more accessible, we provide supplementary tables that summarize the procedure as well as online notebooks for the calculation of the biomass of each taxon (see data flow scheme in SI Appendix, Overview). In Table 1, we detail the relevant supplementary table that summarizes the steps for arriving at each estimate. All of the data used to generate our estimates, as well as the code used for analysis, are open-sourced and available at https://github.com/milo-lab/biomass_distribution. Choice of Units for Measuring Biomass. Biomass is reported in gigatons of carbon. Alternative options to represent biomass include, among others, biovolume, wet mass, or dry weight. We chose to use carbon mass as the measure of biomass because it is independent of water content and is used extensively in the literature. Dry mass also has these features but is used less frequently. All of our reported values can be transformed to dry weight to a good approximation by multiplying by 2, the characteristic conversion factor between carbon and total dry mass (46⇓–48). We report the significant digits for our values throughout the paper using the following scheme: For values with an uncertainty projection that is higher than twofold, we report a single significant digit. For values with an uncertainty projection of less than twofold, we report two significant digits. In cases when we report one significant digit, we do not consider a leading “1” as a significant digit. General Framework for Estimating Global Biomass. In achieving global estimates, there is a constant challenge of how to move from a limited set of local samples to a representative global value. How does one estimate global biomass based on a limited set of local samples? For a crude estimate, the average of all local values of biomass per unit area is multiplied by the total global area. A more effective estimate can be made by correlating measured values to environmental parameters that are known at a global scale (e.g., temperature, depth, distance from shore, primary productivity, biome type), as shown in Fig. 3. This correlation is used to extrapolate the biomass of a taxon at a specific location based on the known distribution of the environmental parameter (e.g., the temperature at each location on the globe). By integrating across the total surface of the world, a global estimate is derived. We detail the specific extrapolation procedure used for each taxon in both the SI Appendix and supplementary tables (SI Appendix, Tables S1–S23). For most taxa, our best estimates are based on a geometric mean of several independent estimates using different methodologies. The geometric mean estimates the median value if the independent estimates are log-normally distributed or, more generally, the distribution of estimates is symmetrical in log space. Fig. 3. General framework for estimating global biomass. The procedure begins with local samples of biomass across the globe. The more representative the samples are of the natural distribution of the taxon biomass, the more accurate the estimate will be. To move from local samples to a global estimate, a correlation between local biomass densities and an environmental parameter (or parameters) is established. Based on this correlation, in addition to our knowledge of the distribution of the environmental parameter, we extrapolate the biomass across the entire globe. The resolution of the resulting biomass distribution map is dependent on the resolution at which we know the environmental parameter. Integrating across the entire surface of the Earth, we get a global estimate of the biomass of the taxon. Uncertainty Estimation and Reporting. Global estimates such as those we use in the present work are largely based on sampling from the distribution of biomass worldwide and then extrapolating for areas in which samples are missing. The sampling of biomass in each location can be based on direct biomass measurements or conversion to biomass from other types of measurement, such as number of individuals and their characteristic weight. Some of the main sources of uncertainty for the estimates we present are the result of using such geographical extrapolations and conversion from number of individuals to overall biomass. The certainty of the estimate is linked to the amount of sampling on which the estimate is based. Notable locations in which sampling is scarce are the deep ocean (usually deeper than 200 m) and deep layers of soil (usually deeper than 1 m). For some organisms, such as annelids and marine protists and arthropods, most estimates neglect these environments, thus underestimating the actual biomass. Sampling can be biased toward places that have high abundance and diversity of wildlife. Relying on data with such sampling bias can cause overestimation of the actual biomass of a taxon. Another source of uncertainty comes from conversion to biomass. Conversion from counts of individuals to biomass is based on either known average weights per individual (e.g., 50 kg of wet weight for a human, which averages over adults and children, or 10 mg of dry weight for a “characteristic” earthworm) or empirical allometric equations that are organism-specific, such as conversion from animal length to biomass. When using such conversion methods, there is a risk of introducing biases and noise into the final estimate. Nevertheless, there is often no way around using such conversions. As such, we must be aware that the data may contain such biases. In addition to describing the procedures leading to the estimate of each taxon, we quantitatively survey the main sources of uncertainty associated with each estimate and calculate an uncertainty range for each of our biomass estimates. We choose to report uncertainties as representing, to the best of our ability given the many constraints, what is equivalent to a 95% confidence interval for the estimate of the mean. Uncertainties reported in our analysis are multiplicative (fold change from the mean) and not additive (± change of the estimate). We chose to use multiplicative uncertainty as it is more robust to large fluctuations in estimates, and because it is in accord with the way we generate our best estimates, which is usually by using a geometric mean of different independent estimates. Our uncertainty projections are focused on the main kingdoms of life: plants, bacteria, archaea, fungi, protists, and animals. The general framework for constructing our uncertainties (described in detail for each taxon in the SI Appendix and in the online notebooks) takes into account both intrastudy uncertainty and interstudy uncertainty. Intrastudy uncertainty refers to uncertainty estimates reported within a specific study, whereas interstudy uncertainty refers to variation in estimates of a certain quantity between different papers. In many cases, we use several independent methodologies to estimate the same quantity. In these cases, we can also use the variation between estimates from each methodology as a measure of the uncertainty of our final estimate. We refer to this type of uncertainty as intermethod uncertainty. The way we usually calculate uncertainties is by taking the logarithm of the values reported either within studies or from different studies. Taking the logarithm moves the values to log-space, where the SE is calculated (by dividing the SD by the square root of the number of values). We then multiply the SE by a factor of 1.96 (which would give the 95% confidence interval if the transformed data were normally distributed). Finally, we exponentiate the result to get the multiplicative factor in linear space that represents the confidence interval (akin to a 95% confidence interval if the data were log-normally distributed). Most of our estimates are constructed by combining several different estimates (e.g., combining total number of individuals and characteristic carbon content of a single organism). In these cases, we use intrastudy, interstudy, or intermethod variation associated with each parameter that is used to derive the final estimate and propagate these uncertainties to the final estimate of biomass. The uncertainty analysis for each specific biomass estimate incorporates different components of this general scheme, depending on the amount of information that is available, as detailed on a case-by-case basis in the SI Appendix. In cases where information is ample, the procedure described above yields several different uncertainty estimates for each parameter that we use to derive the final estimate (e.g., intrastudy uncertainty, interstudy uncertainty). We integrate these different uncertainties, usually by taking the highest value as the best projection of uncertainty. In some cases, for example, when information is scarce or some sources of uncertainty are hard to quantify, we base our estimates on the uncertainty in analogous taxa and consultation with relevant experts. We tend to round up our uncertainty projections when data are especially limited. Taxonomic Levels Used. Our census gives estimates for the global biomass at various taxonomic levels. Our main results relate to the kingdom level: animals, archaea, bacteria, fungi, plants, and protists. Although the division into kingdoms is not the most contemporary taxonomic grouping that exists, we chose to use it for the current analysis as most of the data we rely upon does not provide finer taxonomic details (e.g., the division of terrestrial protists is mainly based on morphology and not on taxonomy). We supplement these kingdoms of living organisms with an estimate for the global biomass of viruses, which are not included in the current tree of life but play a key role in global biogeochemical cycles (49). For all kingdoms except animals, all taxa making up the kingdom are considered together. For estimating the biomass of animals, we use a bottom-up approach, which estimates the biomass of key phyla constituting the animal kingdom. The sum of the biomass of these phyla represents our estimate of the total biomass of animals. We give estimates for most phyla and estimate bounds for the possible biomass contribution for the remaining phyla (SI Appendix, Other Animal Phyla). Within chordates, we provide estimates for key classes, such as fish, mammals, and birds. We estimate that the contribution of reptiles and amphibians to the total chordate biomass is negligible, as we discuss in the SI Appendix. We divide the class of mammals into wild mammals and humans plus livestock (without a contribution from poultry, which is negligible compared with cattle and pigs). Even though livestock is not a valid taxonomic division, we use it to consider the impact of humans on the total biomass of mammals. \n \n Acknowledgments We thank Shai Meiri for help with estimating the biomass of wild mammals, birds, and reptiles and Arren Bar-Even, Oded Beja, Jorg Bernhardt, Tristan Biard, Chris Bowler, Nuno Carvalhais, Otto Coredero, Gidon Eshel, Ofer Feinerman, Noah Fierer, Daniel Fisher, Avi Flamholtz, Assaf Gal, José Grünzweig, Marcel van der Heijden, Dina Hochhauser, Julie Huber, Qusheng Jin, Bo Barker Jørgensen, Jens Kallmeyer, Tamir Klein, Christian Koerner, Daniel Madar, Fabrice Not, Katherine O’Donnell, Gal Ofir, Victoria Orphan, Noam Prywes, John Raven, Dave Savage, Einat Segev, Maya Shamir, Izak Smit, Rotem Sorek, Ofer Steinitz, Miri Tsalyuk, Assaf Vardi, Colomban de Vargas, Joshua Weitz, Yossi Yovel, Yonatan Zegman, and two anonymous reviewers for productive feedback on this manuscript.

The female-led film had already surpassed $300 million worldwide prior to this weekend. \n \n While the summer box office season has officially begun, Cruise seems to have lost control of the Dark Universe. “The Mummy” was expected to be the equivalent of Marvel’s “Iron Man” or DC Comics’ “Man of Steel,” but Universal’s $125 million movie will have to settle with second place. The reboot of the Brendan Frasier franchise earned only $12 million from 4,035 screenings on Friday, projecting a dead-on-arrival domestic debut of just $30 million. \n \n “Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie” from Fox falls from No. 2 to No. 3 this week. The Kevin Hart, Ed Helms, and Thomas Middleditch animated comedy is expected to make a further $13 million this weekend after pulling in $3.5 million from 3,529 locations on Friday. Those numbers will add up to a two-week total of $42 million for “Captain Underpants.” \n \n Despite two weeks in the top 3, “Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales” has officially walked the plank to No. 4 in the box office. Johnny Depp’s Disney vehicle pillaged $3 million from 3,679 locales on Friday, meaning the fifth film in the Jack Sparrow series will see $10.5 million for the three-day. However, similarly to what can be expected of “The Mummy,” “Pirates'” global total is much more impressive at $384.5 million compared to its $133.5 domestic draw. \n \n Also in its first frame, psychological horror film “It Comes at Night” from A24 is performing particularly well off a $2.4 million budget. The Joel Edgerton and Riley Keough thriller is expected to take in $6.5 million by weekend’s end. “It Comes at Night” scared up about $2.5 million from 2,533 theaters on Friday, despite its shockingly low D CinemaScore. \n \n “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,” “Baywatch,” “Megan Leavey,” “Alien: Covenant,” and “Everything, Everything” round out the top 10.""]",4,"– A first-of-its-kind study reveals that humans make up a minuscule portion of life on the planet.

Tehran also has nearly 440 pounds (200 kilograms) of higher-enriched uranium in a form that can be turned into weapons much more quickly. Experts say 550 pounds (250 kilograms) of 20 percent-enriched uranium are needed to produce a single warhead \n \n Among key concessions wanted by the West, according to two diplomats who spoke with The Associated Press, is that Iran stop enriching uranium to 20 percent. The diplomats say Iran offered to halt 20 percent enrichment at last week\'s Geneva talks. However, the Iranian government hasn\'t publicly commented on that. \n \n Negotiators from Iran and the six powers are due to meet in Geneva for further talks on Nov. 7-8.', 'These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

228,"['(CNN) The shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh -- in which the death toll now stands at 11 -- is believed to be the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in the history of the US, the Anti-Defamation League said. \n \n ""It is simply unconscionable for Jews to be targeted during worship on a Sabbath morning, and unthinkable that it would happen in the United States of America in this day and age,"" the Jewish organization, which tracks anti-Semitic incidents, said in a statement \n \n Until now, the deadliest attack specifically targeting Jews happened in 1985 when a Seattle lawyer Charles Goldmark was bludgeoned and stabbed to death, along with his wife, Annie, and their two sons, the ADL said. David Morse Rice, a drifter and unemployed steelworker, was found guilty of those killings. \n \n Anti-Semitic incidents and online harassment rising, ADL says \n \n The ADL said the attack Saturday comes at a time when both anti-Semitic incidents and online harassment are on the rise. \n \n Jewish people were the victims of more reported hate crimes than any other religious minority in 2016, according to the most recent year of FBI statistics. \n \n In that year , 684 anti-Jewish incidents were reported. That\'s more than the rest of religiously motivated hate crimes combined, records reveal. \n \n Tracking such crimes can be nuanced and difficult. The motivations aren\'t always clear, and the crimes are often not reported by victims and police. \n \n Robert Bowers, 46, faces 29 charges in all, including 11 counts of using a firearm to commit murder and multiple counts of two hate crimes: obstruction of exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death and obstruction of exercise of religious beliefs resulting in bodily injury to a public safety officer. \n \n ""The crimes of violence are based upon the federal civil rights laws prohibiting hate crimes,"" US Attorney Scott W. Brady and Bob Jones, FBI special agent in charge of Pittsburgh office, said in a statement. \n \n The FBI, which calls an offense a hate crime when there\'s an added element of bias, is leading the investigation into the attack. \n \n Bowers told a SWAT officer that he wanted all Jews to die and also that Jews were committing genocide to his people, according to CNN affiliate WTAE, citing a police criminal complaint filed Saturday evening in Pittsburgh. \n \n Last year, The Anti-Defamation League reported, anti-Semitic incidents rose almost 60% , the largest single-year increase on record. \n \n The ADL found 1,986 cases of harassment, vandalism or physical assaults against Jewish people or institutions in 2017. It found 1,267 in 2016. \n \n ""We\'re definitely in a period in our country where there\'s a general decrease in civility,"" Aryeh Tuchman, associate director for the ADL\'s Center on Extremism, said when the ADL released its findings in February. ""People in the past who have tamped down their anti-Semitic proclivities may feel more liberated to express them than before."" \n \n \'An escalating scourge of hate-based violence\' \n \n In a statement condemning the Pittsburgh attack, the Rabbinical Assembly said the shooting was a reminder that anti-Semitism ""is on the rise in America at a rate unprecedented in decades."" \n \n ""This vicious hate crime, perpetrated against innocent people at prayer is but the latest in an escalating scourge of hate-based violence in America,"" it said. \n \n Moishe Bane, president of the Orthodox Union, expressed heartbreak for ""the senseless murder of our fellow Jews and all victims of vicious hate crimes."" \n \n ""We condemn the dangerous rhetoric that foments such senseless violence and we stand with the Tree of Life Congregation and the whole Pittsburgh community at this terrible time,"" he said. \n \n Rabbi Elazar Muskin, president of the Rabbinical Council of America said ""fringe elements of society"" had become ""emboldened by speech which is often disrespectful and hateful."" \n \n FBI says reports of hate crimes have increased \n \n The FBI showed an overall increase in reported hate crimes of more than 4% from 2015 to 2016. \n \n Anti-Islamic (anti-Muslim) crimes accounted for 307, up 19% from the previous year. That was the biggest percentage rise. \n \n The FBI also tracks religiously motivated crimes against Eastern Orthodox Christians, other Christians, Hindus, Sikhs, Mormons, Jehovah\'s Witnesses and Buddhists. \n \n In race categories, African Americans were targeted the most -- in about half of the reported 3,489 racially driven incidents in 2016. \n \n The FBI said 1,200 incidents were motivated by bias against victims based on sexual orientation or gender identity.', ""OUT OF THIS WORLD | What's Up In Space - a weekly look at the biggest news coming down to Earth from space \n \n Bright solar flare brings promise of auroras across Canada \n \n Find Your Forecast Search for a location \n \n Scott Sutherland \n \n Meteorologist/Science Writer \n \n Sunday, July 16, 2017, 2:16 PM - A bright solar flare has exploded on the Sun, throwing out an immense cloud of solar particles into space. With part of this cloud having reached us Sunday morning, aurora watchers are anticipating a great show on Sunday night! \n \n This story has been updated. \n \n \n \n The Sun has continued its quiet progress towards solar minimum - the point in its 11 year cycle where it exhibits the lowest levels of sunspot activity - but on the way there, it can still produce a few surprises. \n \n On Thursday night (early Friday morning, UTC), the larger of two sunspots currently visible on the Earthward side of the Sun blasted out a bright M2-class solar flare. \n \n \n \n Three views of sunspot AR2665, from around 5:00 UTC Friday, July 14, 2017, during the peak of the solar flare. The top frame shows the sunspot itself, while the bottom frames show off the coronal loops surrounding the sunspot (in gold, on the left) and the intense release of energy (in green, on the right). Credit: NASA/SDO/Scott Sutherland \n \n At the same time as the solar flare was blasting out X-rays, which caused a minor radio blackout over parts of Asia, it also released a massive cloud of solar particles - what's known as a coronal mass ejection. \n \n This coronal mass ejection is mostly aimed ahead of Earth's orbital path, and thus the vast majority of it will miss us. As the cloud expands out into space, however, one end of it is projected to sweep past Earth. \n \n \n \n \n \n Even as this swath of solar particles washes past us, much of it will simply be diverted around the planet, due to the protective effects of Earth's magnetic field. A significant portion of them, though, will become snagged within the field lines, and then funneled down into the upper atmosphere near the planet's poles, to produce bright auroras. \n \n RELATED: What is Light Pollution and how does it affect Canadians? \n \n Currently, NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is reporting that the Earth-directed portion of the coronal mass ejection arrived earlier than expected. By their observations, we were already seeing G2 (moderate) geomagnetic storm levels as of mid-morning Sunday, and these are expected to persist throughout the afternoon. \n \n \n \n This evening, storm levels are predicted to diminish slightly - to G1 (minor) geomagnetic storm levels - and then jump back up to G2 storm strength between 8 p.m. to 2 a.m. EDT. Afterwards, activity is expected to ramp down to sub-storm levels by Monday morning. \n \n Based on all of this activity, auroras are expected to stretch down over most of Canada and the northern United States tonight, and likely visible as far south as between the Kp=5 (green) and Kp=7 (yellow) lines on the map below. \n \n There is also a chance, during all of this G2 geomagnetic storm activity, that levels could briefly jump as high as G3 (strong), which would push visibility down over the Kp=7 line. \n \n \n \n Remember that it takes reasonably clear and dark skies to see the auroras, far from the light pollution cast by urban environments. Auroras are also notorious for being random and flighty. Sometimes they can appear faint, only to be seen with long-exposure photography, while other times they can be bright and vibrant to the naked eye, and they can appear and disappear quite suddenly. \n \n \n \n If you plan on getting out to watch, choose your location carefully and be safe. In most regions of the country, simply getting outside of your local community is typically good enough. For those living in southwestern Ontario and the GTA, areas north of Stratford, Guelph and Orangeville tend to be good for viewing, as are those areas to the east of Lake Simcoe and north of Peterborough (the shores of Georgian Bay usually provide excellent viewing!). \n \n \n \n Provincial parks are an excellent resource for skywatching, even if you have to stick to the parking lot at night. \n \n As always with these events, give your eyes some time to adjust to the dark - 30-40 minutes typically - or you will likely miss out on it. Avoid all bright sources of light - streetlights, car headlights, cellphone screens & camera flashes, etc - during that time, then look up and to the north to potentially see the auroras. \n \n \n \n Sources: NOAA | spaceweather.com | teaser image courtesy Team Tanner \n \n \n \n Watch Below: Theresa and Darlene Tanner relate their experiences with the Northern Lights and how they take such amazing photographs"", 'Leaked nude images of Jennifer Lawrence and Kate Upton hacked and posted online over the weekend will be featured in an upcoming art exhibit at The Cory Allen Contemporary Art Showroom in St. Petersburg, Fla. \n \n The images will be included in an collection titled “No Delete” by artist XVALA. \n \n “This show has been in the works for about two years now,” Cory Allen told FOX411. “When this came out…about Jennifer Lawrence [and] Kate Upton, it was the prefect dialogue.

The AP separately reports on a ""vulnerability"" the shooter took advantage of: an unlocked door. While the Tree of Life synagogue required guests to ring a bell to gain access during the week, on the Jewish Sabbath the building was open to all guests for Shabbat services. The Post quotes the FBI special agent in charge as saying it was ""the most horrific crime scene I’ve seen in 22 years."" Federal hate crime charges were filed against Bowers on Saturday: 29 charges in all, including 11 counts of using a firearm to commit murder.

Doctors say he has weeks, maybe a month to live. \n \n But Snyder and Siverio aren’t focusing on that. \n \n They have a wedding to plan. \n \n ••• \n \n They met at Mulrennan Middle School in Valrico. He was a brown-haired class clown, recalled Siverio, 21. \n \n ""He was a dorky kid,"" she said. But she was smitten. \n \n Their middle school romance lasted through sixth grade, until Snyder’s family moved to Lithia and he transferred to Randall Middle School. They lost touch until 2015, when she walked into a Valrico Steak ’n Shake to apply for a job. She was shocked to see Snyder working the grill. They picked up where they left off. \n \n ""He’s just so fun to be around,"" Siverio said. ""He brings people up."" \n \n On June 27, 2016 — the day before his 18th birthday — Dustin went to the hospital with chest pains. His mom thought it was asthma, but the next day doctors diagnosed him with synovial sarcoma, a rare form of cancer that targets soft tissue and is more common among teenagers and young adults. \n \n ""When I first found out I was devastated, but then he told me I needed to be strong for him,"" Siverio said. ""Ever since he said that I’ve been by his side."" \n \n Later that week, surgeons removed Snyder’s lung and began chemotherapy and radiation treatment. \n \n The cancer went into remission. Snyder and Siverio moved into a Valrico townhouse together. A few weeks later, the cancer returned, this time on Snyder’s bladder. Doctors removed part of that tumor but the cancer would return a third time, spreading throughout Snyder’s stomach and pelvis. Doctors said there’s no way to operate. \n \n A few weeks ago, Snyder began hospice care. \n \n On Monday, the couple started talking about marriage. Siverio asked when he wanted to get married.

They continued as the story spread on news and social media. A woman donated a diamond ring. Several people donated tuxedos, but Snyder took an offer by the Men’s Warehouse to fit him with a new one. A company called Solid Asset Solution in Tampa donated a wedding dress — blue sequins with a sweetheart neckline and a long flowing train like Elsa the Snow Queen in Disney’s Frozen — and seven dresses for Siverio’s maid of honor and bridesmaids. The Big Red Barn in Plant City offered to host the wedding and reception on Sunday. \n \n Hails started a GoFundMe page to cover other costs and had raised nearly $13,000 by Friday.

It took under 10 seconds to hit the target. \n \n ""The shot in question actually disrupted a Daesh [Islamic State] attack on Iraqi security forces,"" said a military source. ""Instead of dropping a bomb that could potentially kill civilians in the area, it is a very precise application of force and because it was so far way, the bad guys didn\'t have a clue what was happening."" \n \n The military source said the JTF2 operation fell within the strictures of the government\'s advise and assist mission. \n \n ""As stated multiple times in the past, members of the Canadian Special Operations Task Force do not accompany leading combat elements, but enable the Iraqi security forces who are in a tough combat mission,"" the statement said. ""This takes the form of advice in planning their operations and assistance to defeat Daesh through the use of coalition resources."" \n \n The kill was independently verified by video camera and other data, The Globe and Mail has learned. \n \n Story continues below advertisement \n \n Story continues below advertisement \n \n ""Hard data on this. It isn\'t an opinion. It isn\'t an approximation. There is a second location with eyes on with all the right equipment to capture exactly what the shot was,"" another military source said. \n \n A military insider told The Globe: ""This is an incredible feat. It is a world record that might never be equalled."" \n \n The world record was previously held by British sniper Craig Harrison, who shot a Taliban gunner with a 338 Lapua Magnum rifle from 2,475 metres away in 2009. \n \n Previously, Canadian Corporal Rob Furlong had set the world record in 2002 at 2,430 metres when he gunned down an Afghan insurgent carrying an RPK machine gun during Operation Anaconda. \n \n Weeks before, Canadian Master Cpl. Arron Perry briefly held the world\'s best sniper record after he fatally shot an insurgent at 2,310 metres during the same operation. Both soldiers were members of the 3rd Battalion Princess Patricia\'s Canadian Light Infantry. \n \n JTF2 special forces are primarily tasked with counterterrorism, sniper operations and hostage rescue. Much of the information about this elite organization is classified and not commented on by the government. The unit\'s snipers and members of Canadian Special Operations Regiment, who are carrying out the main task of training Kurdish forces, have been operating in tough conditions in Iraq. \n \n Story continues below advertisement \n \n The Trudeau government pulled CF-18 fighter jets out of Iraq in 2016 but expanded the military mission, which will see the number of Canadian special forces trainers climb to 207 from 69 in an assist, train and advise mission. Canadian commandos are not supposed to be involved in direct combat, but are authorized to go up to the front lines on training missions with Kurdish Peshmerga fighters and to paint targets for coalition air strikes. \n \n For operational security reasons, sources would not reveal the names of the elite Canadian sniper and his partner, nor the location where the action took place. \n \n A sniper and his observer partner are often sent to remote and dangerous locations to hunt down insurgents while having to carry heavy equipment. Once they have located the target, snipers follow the same methodical approach before each shot. Breathe in, out, in, out, find a natural pause and then squeeze the trigger. \n \n Canada has a reputation among Western military forces for the quality of its snipers, despite the small size of the Canadian Armed Forces compared to the United States and Britain. \n \n ""Canada has a world-class sniper system. It is not just a sniper. They work in pairs. There is an observer,"" a military source said. ""This is a skill set that only a very few people have."" \n \n The skill of the JTF2 sniper in taking down an insurgent at 3,540 metres required math skills, great eyesight, precision of ammunition and firearms, and superb training. \n \n Story continues below advertisement \n \n ""It is at the distance where you have to account not just for the ballistics of the round, which change over time and distance, you have to adjust for wind, and the wind would be swirling,"" said a source with expertise in training Canadian special forces. \n \n ""You have to adjust for him firing from a higher location downward and as the round drops you have to account for that. And from that distance you actually have to account for the curvature of the Earth."" \n \n U.S. Sergeant Bryan Kremer has the longest confirmed sniper kill shot by a U.S. soldier. He killed an Iraqi insurgent with his Barrett M82A1 rifle at 2,300 metres in 2004.', 'The distances are mind-boggling: in 2002, Master Cpl. Arron Perry from the Princess Patricia’s Canadian Light Infantry took aim at an Afghan insurgent from a distance of 2,300 metres and hit his target, setting the world record for the longest confirmed kill shot in military history. Not long after, Cpl. Rob Furlong, in the same operation, bested his brother-in-arms with a confirmed kill at 2,430 metres. His record would stand longer, until 2009, when a British sniper, Craig Harrison, made a shot from 2,475 metres. \n \n On June 21, Harrison’s record was shattered by another Canadian, an elite special forces sniper, who, according to the Canadian military, killed an ISIS fighter in Mosul from an incredible 3,540 metres. \n \n Let’s put that in perspective: if you stacked six CN Towers end to end, you would still be more than 200 metres short. The bullet, according to military experts, would have travelled for nearly 10 seconds before hitting its target. The shooter not only would have had to take into consideration wind conditions, but at that distance, also the curvature of the earth. \n \n More astonishing, perhaps, is the fact that over the last 15 years, the active-combat sniping record has been broken four times, and three of those have been by Canadians. \n \n That’s no coincidence, says Furlong, who now runs a marksmanship academy in Edmonton. \n \n “I’ve been saying this forever,” he tells Maclean’s by telephone. “Canadian snipers are the best in the world. The sniper training program has been around for a long time. It’s the foundation, and it’s been retooled from lessons learned in Afghanistan. We’ve built it to be the best.” \n \n This latest record, Furlong adds, has taken sniping “to a different level.” Canadian snipers are considered some of the best in the world in part because they are not simply taught to hit their targets. Like much of the Canadian military, many are trained with skills above their existing rank, in the sniper’s case as Unit Master Snipers, meaning they have the skills to design and run complex operations if the need ever arises. That in itself may not make them better snipers but the gestalt of sniper-training and command-thinking combined could explain their skill. \n \n The practice of equipping soldiers with more than the skills they will need on the battlefield has served the Canadian military well. In Afghanistan, the results were clear. Maclean’s witnessed firsthand how soldiers out on patrol, sometimes for days in enemy territory, operated as closely knit teams. Command decisions were made with input from different ranks, offering multiple perspectives to patrol commanders. \n \n The level of training Canada provides its soldiers, particularly its elite JTF2 commandos, is the driving force behind Canada’s reputation for fielding a highly skilled and intellectually capable military. \n \n “This is a very important point,” says Chris Kilford, a retired Canadian artillery officer and now a fellow at the Queen’s University Centre for International and Defence Policy. “I have been very impressed with the young people in our special forces that I have interacted with overseas. Corporals and master corporals: bright and articulate. I also think that in general our people are often capable of working at a higher level than the rank on their shoulder.” \n \n Furlong agrees, adding that Canadian soldiers are more “cross-trained” than many other soldiers in the world, and Canada’s snipers specifically are given every opportunity to pursue leadership training that refines their mental capabilities, a key component to the psychologically demanding job they do. \n \n Still, there are the naysayers. Warrant Officer Oliver Cromwell, an instructor at the infantry school at CFB Gagetown in New Brunswick* who has taught sniper courses, cautions that more information is needed before the 3,450 meter distance is confirmed. \n \n “There is a difference between slant angle range and true range,” he says. “Slant angle range—if the shooter is at an elevated position relative to the target—may appear longer that the true range, sometimes twice the true distance. I don’t want to be a naysayer but those are just the facts.” \n \n Some online message boards have have also questioned the validity of the new record. In one case a contributor to a military discussion suggested the sniper likely fired into a crowd of ISIS fighters and happened to hit one. \n \n But Furlong points out that these types of distances, 3,000 metres and more, are regularly achieved on the shooting range. \n \n “It’s not an impossible distance,” he says. “The difference is between a shooting range and a battlefield. They are two completely different environments. The pressure these guys are under is huge. So to the naysayers I would just say, this can be done.” \n \n As for the men who accomplished it—snipers work in pairs, including a spotter—Furlong says they probably didn’t realize what they had done until later. “When we broke the record, we didn’t know until we got back to base,” he says. “To be honest, I didn’t really care, neither when I broke it or when mine was broken. Records are made to be broken.” \n \n Still, unless there are major advances in equipment, Furlong adds, this one should stand for a long time. \n \n CORRECTION, June 29, 2017: This story originally stated the location of CFB Gagetown.

""They knew how to handle a gun and handle a gun well."" \n \n The Canadian mission in Iraq has been the subject of much debate over whether Canada\'s troops are involved in a combat mission. \n \n That debate was reignited recently when the Chief of the Defence Staff Gen. Jonathan Vance revealed Canadian troops were operating inside Mosul. \n \n In a statement confirming the sniper\'s successful shot, the Canadian Forces insisted its mission in Iraq is still to merely ""advise and assist"" Iraqi forces. \n \n ""This takes the form of advice in planning for their operations and assistance to defeat Daesh [ISIS] through the use of coalition resources,"" the statement said.', 'Canadian Sniper Hit A Target More Than 2 Miles Away, Military Confirms \n \n Enlarge this image toggle caption Dan Balilty/AP Dan Balilty/AP \n \n A sniper with Canada\'s elite special forces is being credited with making a world record shot, after the military confirmed Thursday that he hit a target from nearly 2.2 miles away during a recent operation in Iraq. \n \n Military sources tell Canada\'s The Globe and Mail newspaper that the sniper killed an ISIS insurgent during an attack on Iraqi security forces. \n \n ""The Canadian Special Operations Command can confirm that a member of the Joint Task Force 2 successfully hit a target from 3,540 meters,"" the force said in an email to NPR.

The newspaper, quoting military sources, says a Canadian sniper in Iraq killed an ISIS militant from the mind-boggling distance of 3,540 meters, or 2.2 miles. The Canadian military has not confirmed what would be the longest kill shot by a sniper in history, but the story has in the meantime drawn attention to something else: the remarkable prowess of Canadian snipers in general. Some coverage: The training: If confirmed, that means the sniper record has been broken four times in the last 15 years, three of those times by Canadians, notes Maclean's magazine. One reason, it says, is because Canadian snipers ""are not simply taught to hit their targets."" The training goes beyond their shooting duties, making sure they're able to ""design and run complex operations"" if necessary. ""That in itself may not make them better snipers but the gestalt of sniper-training and command-thinking combined could explain their skill."" Long history: The CBC examines the history of Canada's military marksmanship, noting that Cpl. Francis Pegahmagabow of the 1st Canadian Infantry Battalion had 378 kills, making him deadliest sniper of World War I. A military historian says the skill carried into WWII. ""The best snipers were usually country boys who knew how to hunt."" Official statement: The Canadian military has not confirmed the kill, but it did confirm the shot. ""A member of the Joint Task Force 2 successfully hit a target from 3,540 meters,"" it says in an email to NPR, adding that it won't divulge further details for troop safety. Really? The Globe and Mail says the shot was verified by video and data, but that hasn't emerged yet, and some are skeptical. The Washington Post talks to former US snipers who say that even seeing a human target would be difficult from that distance, even with advanced scopes. A theory floated by a former Marine shooter: ""A spotter with an advanced optical device was able to verbally walk the sniper onto the target and correct his aim.” Yes: Canadian Cpl. Rob Furlong, who once held the record himself at 2,430 meters, counters the skeptics: “It’s not an impossible distance,” he says. “So to the naysayers I would just say, this can be done.” It's a ""hell of a shot,"" adds former Canadian sniper Jody Mitic, who was written a book called, of course, Unflinching: The Making of a Canadian Sniper. A critic: In a post at Stuff.co.nz, John Edens thinks the shot was possible, given high-tech gizmos to account for everything from wind speed to the curvature of the earth. Plus, the gun used, a McMillan TAC-50 rifle, employs a 50-caliber bullet the size of a ""large cigar."" His beef, though, is with media coverage that he thinks glorifies war. ""It's an achievement to a point, but it's not really one humanity should be proud of."""

Nothing seems to apply. \n \n There’s no playbook, after all, for two women in their 70s who’ve just found out they were switched at birth. \n \n “It’s a crazy thing,” Denice says. “People just automatically assume they got the right family.” \n \n Linda Jourdeans points to herself in a family photo. (Photo: Boyd Huppert, KARE 11) \n \n Only a few weeks have passed since Denice and Linda learned they didn’t, as infants, go home with the right family. \n \n In the journey that brought them to this strange place, Denice, who lives in Eagan, took the first step. \n \n Already an ancestry buff, the 72-year-old grandmother submitted DNA to the genealogy website 23andMe, hoping to learn more about her health history. \n \n A few weeks later, when her list of DNA relatives arrived, she was taken aback. \n \n “I didn't match anybody,” she said. Actually, Denice matched several people, but not one name among them she’d ever heard of. \n \n Denice Juneski (left) and Linda Jourdeans recently learned they were switched at birth.

(Photo: Boyd Huppert, KARE 11) \n \n Linda didn’t waste any time. “I did my DNA right away, because I've got to see this on paper,” she said. \n \n The DNA provided the proof. A 72-year secret had been uncovered. \n \n Denice and Linda quickly put together the pieces. \n \n In the early morning hours of December 19, 1945, at Bethesda Hospital in St. Paul, two baby girls were born: Denice Mary Mayer at 2:17 a.m. and Linda Jean Nielsen, 31 minutes later. \n \n How exactly they were switched, is probably lost to the ages. \n \n “We'll never know,” Linda said, “and I'm sure the nurses are dead that probably took care of us.” \n \n This is known: For 72 years, Denice and Linda have unknowingly walked in each other’s footsteps. \n \n Linda Jourdeans (lower right) was the only redhead in her family.

Linda, the redhead, is pictured growing up in a family of blondes - while Denice, the blonde, is surrounded by brunettes and redheads in pictures with her siblings and cousins. \n \n Denice, lacking both stamina and coordination, found herself in a family of athletes. \n \n For years, her father played baseball around the Twin Cities, including a stint with the St. Paul Saints. Her brother was a ballplayer, too.

235,"['President Trump: Kennedy Retirement Makes Senate Control \'Vital\' For Republicans \n \n Enlarge this image toggle caption Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Justin Sullivan/Getty Images \n \n During a rally in North Dakota Wednesday night, President Trump underscored the importance of protecting the GOP\'s Senate majority this fall, deeming it especially critical in the wake of Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy\'s retirement. \n \n ""Justice Kennedy\'s retirement makes the issue of Senate control one of the vital issues of our time — the most important thing we can do,"" Trump told a crowd in Fargo. \n \n The president was there to campaign for Republican Rep. Kevin Cramer, who\'s challenging Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp in one of the GOP\'s top opportunities to pick up a Senate seat. North Dakota is one of 10 states that Trump carried in 2016 in which Democratic incumbents are up for re-election — and he won North Dakota by about 36 points. \n \n Trump argued that Cramer would support his agenda and, most importantly, his court picks, while Heitkamp will not. \n \n ""Heidi will vote no to any pick we make for the Supreme Court. She will be told to do so,"" Trump said. \n \n Heitkamp, however, was one of three Democrats to vote in favor of Trump\'s first Supreme Court nominee, now-Justice Neil Gorsuch. \n \n Trump didn\'t directly mention that vote, but did later claim that sometimes Heitkamp would give Republicans and the White House a ""quickie vote"" but that ""the day after that election, she\'s voting party line, 100 percent."" \n \n NPR Politics Podcast Analysis: Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy\'s Retirement Analysis: Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy\'s Retirement Listen · 22:57 22:57 \n \n In a statement after the rally, Heitkamp pushed back, saying she would continue to be her own person in the Senate, election year or not. \n \n ""Anytime the president comes to North Dakota, that\'s a good thing for our state. While we saw election-year politics today, I\'m always willing to work with the president if he\'s helping North Dakota — and if he\'s not, I\'ll speak up,"" Heitkamp said. ""I don\'t answer to a political party or president, I only answer to North Dakotans, who deserve an independent voice in the Senate. That\'s why I\'ve always been eager to work across the aisle — including with the president — to get results for our state, and today\'s rally hasn\'t changed that."" \n \n Trump continued to tie Heitkamp to the national party throughout the rally nonetheless. \n \n ""When Heidi ran for office, she promised to be an independent vote for the people of North Dakota. Instead, she went to Washington and immediately joined Chuck — you know who Chuck is,"" Trump said, referring to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., ""and Nancy,"" that is, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. Trump also railed on Democrats\' ""new leader,"" Maxine Waters, hitting the liberal California congresswoman who came under fire even from her own leadership in her call for public confrontations against Trump administration officials. \n \n Trump hit on many of his favorite subjects during the freewheeling rally — immigration, tax cuts, trade, the economy, reveling in his 2016 victory, boasting about the size of the crowd and more. But the Kennedy retirement hung over the night, and Trump also took time in his remarks to honor the retiring justice — an unpredictable swing vote who hasn\'t always been a favorite of conservatives despite being nominated by President Ronald Reagan. Trump called Kennedy a ""very special guy"" and promised that he would pick someone with ""intellect"" as his successor, someone he suggested could serve on the court for 40 or more years. \n \n ""I\'m very honored that he chose to [retire] during my term in office. He felt confident in me to make the right choice to carry on his great legacy,"" Trump said. \n \n Heitkamp and other red state Democrats will play a crucial role in determining how much resistance a new Supreme Court nominee is met with. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell — who controversially blocked President Obama\'s nominee to succeed the late Justice Antonin Scalia until after the 2016 election, allowing Trump to fill the seat with Gorsuch — has indicated he wants a vote ahead of the 2018 midterms. But Democrats have called such a decision hypocrisy, given McConnell\'s insistence against holding a confirmation hearing during an election year. \n \n The Senate is currently split 51-49 for Republicans, but Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., has been absent for months battling brain cancer, so the margin for error is even smaller. There are some GOP wildcard votes too — Maine Sen. Susan Collins and Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski support abortion rights, and one reason Trump supporters are cheering a Kennedy replacement — and Democrats are so fearful — is the belief that a new justice could help overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 case that legalized abortion. \n \n Along with Heitkamp, Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Joe Donnelly of Indiana also voted to confirm Gorsuch last year — and the trio of often centrist Democrats are considered some of the most endangered Senate incumbents in November\'s elections. Given their re-election concerns, they could be under pressure to do so again with Trump\'s new Supreme Court nominee. Even so, Trump made it clear with Heitkamp on Wednesday night, that won\'t earn them a pass ahead of the November elections from him or Republicans.', 'President Donald Trump said that Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy made the decision to retire because “he felt confident in me to make the right choice and carry on his great legacy.” \n \n “I’m very honored he chose to do it during my term in office,” Trump told supporters at a campaign appearance in Fargo, North Dakota on Wednesday evening. \n \n Kennedy, 81, was nominated in 1987 by President Ronald Reagan and served 30 years on the Supreme Court, where he was known as a centrist influence. While he voted with the bench’s conservatives on campaign finance and, earlier this week, to uphold Trump’s travel ban, Kennedy also sided with the Court’s liberal justices on issues such as abortion rights, climate change and authoring the majority opinion to legalize same-sex marriage in 2015. \n \n Read more: How Anthony Kennedy’s Swing Vote Made Him ‘the Decider’ \n \n Kennedy’s retirement gives the Trump administration an opening to swing the balance of the court for decades.

236,"['The owner of the underground drug market Silk Road was a 29-year-old Libertarian engineer living in San Francisco raking in over $80 million in 2 years, according to the indictment revealed today. Who is the man behind the biggest underground drug market, and how did he get caught? The indictment lays out a detailed account of how Silk Road grew and how FBI agent Christopher Tarbell took it down. \n \n According to the indictment, Silk Road was bigger than anyone had suspected: It boasted over $1.6 billion in sales from 2011-2013, which resulted in $80 million in commissions. (Researchers had previously estimated that Silk Road was doing about $22 million in total sales per year.) According to the indictment, which claims that FBI agents obtained a mirror of the server that housed Silk Road\'s business from law enforcement in an unidentified foreign country, Ulbricht ""alone has controlled the massive profits generated from the operation of the business."" He used some of the profits to pay a team of administrators as much as $2,000 a week each. And yet, he only paid $1,000 a month in rent for his San Francisco apartment, according to the indictment. \n \n The most bizarre and spectacular allegation in the indictment is that Ulbricht solicited a murder-for-hire against a Silk Road user who was attempting to blackmail him. The user, FriendlyChemist, told Ulbricht—whose alleged online persona was ""Dread Pirate Roberts,"" or DPR, a reference to the film The Princess Bride—that he had obtained a list of thousands of Silk Road users and was going to release them unless DPR paid off his $500,000 debt to another user, RedandWhite. Instead of paying the debt, DPR contacted RedAndWhite and paid him $150,000 in Bitcoins to off Friendly Chemist. \n \n ""In my eyes, FriendlyChemist is a liability and I wouldn\'t mind if he was executed,"" DPR wrote. DPR even tried to bargain down FriendlyChemist, messaging: ""Don\'t want to be a pain here, but the price seems high. Not long ago, I had a clean hit done for $80K."" DPR gave redandwhite the address of FriendlyChemist in British Columbia, and the indictment reports that redandwhite sent back photo evidence of the deed. But according to the indictment there is no indication the hit actually happened—""Although I believe the foregoing exchange demonstrates DPR\'s intention to solicit a murder-for-hire,"" Tarbell wrote, ""I have spoken with Canadian law enforcement authorities, who have no record of there being any Canadian resident with the name DPR passed to redandwhite as the target of the solicited murder-for-hire. Nor do they have any record of a homicide occurring in White Rock, British Columbia on or about March 31, 2013."" \n \n Currently the most-discussed aspect of the case on the Darknet is speculation on how Ulbricht got caught. Silk Road was hosted using the privacy-protecting Tor Network, and its brazen customers believed their digital tracks were hidden. But it appears that Ulbricht was tripped up by some security mistakes while promoting Silk Road in the early days. Tarbell found that the two earliest mentions of Silk Road were forum posts by a user called Altoid on the drug forum Shroomery.org and the semi-official Bitcoin Forum. Both were obvious astroturfing efforts to promote the Silk Road: \n \n ""Has anyone seen Silk Road yet?"" goes one. ""It\'s kind of like an anonymous Amazon.com. I don\'t think they have heroin on there, but they are selling other stuff. Let me know what you guys think."" Altoid was easily connected to Ulbricht by a post on the Bitcoin forum in which Altoid solicits programming help for a ""venture backed bit coin startup"" using the email address: Rossulbricht@gmail.com. From there, agents surveilled Ulbricht in real life and were able to match up his locations to locations used to log into the DPR account. They noticed that both Ulbricht and DPR were fans of the Libertarian Ludwig Von Mises Institute. And a key used to log into Silk Road\'s administrator account was linked to another email address Ulbricht had used. \n \n The feds also managed to gain access to servers belonging to Silk Road. They spied on the traffic in real time, determining that from Feb 2011 to July 2013 there were 2013 1,229,465 transactions on the site, and 957,079 total registered users. This raises the question of exactly how much information they have on Silk Road\'s users, and whether more busts are to come. (Agents made over 100 undercover transactions throughout the investigation, according to the indictment.) \n \n Browsing Ulbricht\'s social media accounts show a pretty normal, nerdy guy. Ulbricht graduated from the University of Texas in 2006 with a degree in Physics and went to the University of Pennsylvania Pennsylvania State University for grad school, where he studied engineering and wrote a master\'s thesis on ""Growth of EuO Thin Films by Molecular Beam Epitaxy."" According to property records, he owned a home in State College, PA, which he sold in 2010 for $187,0000. Curiously, the indictment misidentifies his grad school as the University of Pennsylvania. \n \n He\'s got a Facebook page full of beer pong pics and, of course, was a vocal supporter of Ron Paul, donating $200 to his campaign in 2007. ""He doesn\'t compromise his integrity as a politician and he fights quite diligently to restore the principles that our country was founded on,"" Ulbricht told the Penn State student newspaper in 2008. \n \n Last year in a YouTube video for the storytelling project StoryCorps with his friend Rene Pinnell. Pinnell, speaking to the Verge, was adamant about his friend\'s innocence: ""I don\'t know how they messed it up and I don\'t know how they got Ross wrapped into this, but I\'m sure it\'s not him,"" he said.', 'Photograph by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images. \n \n On the rare occasions when the world talks to you in stereo, it’s a good idea to set aside your knitting and listen. This week, Americans got their first good look at what super PACs—political organizations that can receive unlimited corporate contributions and make unlimited expenditures for federal candidates—have wrought in Iowa. At the same time, the Montana Supreme Court issued a stunning opinion last Friday, upholding the state’s law limiting corporate election spending. Think of the two as a sort of woofer and tweeter for life in a post-Citizens United world. \n \n Dahlia Lithwick Dahlia Lithwick writes about the courts and the law for Slate and hosts the podcast Amicus. \n \n \n \n The impact of the so-called super PAC on the Iowa election has been profound. Just ask Newt Gingrich, who was clobbered by almost a third of the more than $14 million in super-PAC ad money spent in the weeks before the caucus. When the court handed down that decision in 2010, it assumed both that these expenditures would be independent of the candidate’s official campaigns (they’re not; one is financed by Jon Huntsman’s dad) and that disclosure rules would ensure that Americans knew who was buying and selling their elections (we don’t). \n \n Ruth Marcus has a great piece explaining all the ways in which the super PACs are both coordinating with campaigns and evading federal disclosure requirements. She notes that this was the inevitable consequence of both the Citizens United decision and subsequent lower-court rulings. Whether he meant to or not, she writes, Justice Anthony Kennedy, with his majority opinion in that case, managed to “clear the path for independent expenditure committees backing a particular candidate—and bankrolled by the candidate’s father or run by his former top aides.” \n \n Advertisement \n \n \n \n Democracy 21 issued a report today questioning whether these candidate-specific super PACs can possibly meet the legal requirements of “total independence” from the campaigns, as required by the language of Citizens United. That’s the problem when you give corporations the same First Amendment rights as citizens. It’s not just that the resulting citizens are louder and meaner than regular people. They also refuse to tell you who they are and how much a gently worn candidate is selling for these days. \n \n Prof. Richard L. Hasen explained all this back in October, pointing out that the fundamental flaw in Justice Kennedy’s majority opinion in Citizens United lay in his assertion that “independent expenditures, including those made by corporations, do not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption.” That sentence opened the door to super PACS and ignored the reality of everything we all know about the corrupting influence of unlimited money on a political campaign. \n \n Which brings us to the Montana Supreme Court, which more or less announced last week that it would similarly just ignore Justice Kennedy’s pronouncements about money and corruption. The Montana court more or less announced it would uphold that state’s corporate spending ban because they know a lot more about political corruption than Anthony Kennedy does. The Montana law was enacted in 1912 and provides that “a corporation may not make a contribution or an expenditure in connection with a candidate or a political committee that supports or opposes a candidate or a political party."" After the Supreme Court handed down the Citizens United decision in 2010, many similar state laws were struck down by the courts or repealed, and a lower court in Montana agreed that the Montana ban was unconstitutional as well, finding that “Citizens United is unequivocal: the government may not prohibit independent and indirect corporate expenditures on political speech.” \n \n But by a 5-2 margin, Montana’s high court determined that the state law survived “strict scrutiny” because Montana’s unique context and history justified the ban in ways not contemplated by Citizens United. In his majority opinion, Chief Justice Mike McGrath dove deep into that history, ranging back over the “tumultuous years … marked by rough contests for political and economic domination primarily in the mining center of Butte, between mining and industrial enterprises controlled by foreign trusts or corporations.” Noting that, back in the last Gilded Age, Montana\'s wealthy ""Copper Kings"" bought judges and senators, picked the location of the capital, and owned the media, McGrath pointed to Montana’s vast size, sparse population, low-cost elections, and long history of having its resources plundered by foreign corporate interests to emphasize that the state has a compelling interest in maintaining its ban. \n \n Advertisement \n \n \n \n McGrath lays it out this way: “The question then, is when in the last 99 years did Montana lose the power or interest sufficient to support the statute, if it ever did. If the statute has worked to preserve a degree of political and social autonomy is the State required to throw away its protections?” The majority went out of its way to note that unlimited campaign spending on judicial elections is also having a profoundly damaging effect on judicial integrity all around the country. \n \n Two justices dissented from this view, insisting that the court was bound to follow the decision in Citizens United. But one of the two dissents, Justice James C. Nelson, unloaded on that Supreme Court decision with Scalia-like levels of derision and scorn. “Corporations are not persons,” writes Nelson. “Human beings are persons, and it is an affront to the inviolable dignity of our species that courts have created a legal fiction which forces people—human beings—to share fundamental, natural rights with soulless creatures of government."" Just in case that wasn’t crystal clear, Nelson goes on to add that “while corporations and human beings share many of the same rights under the law, they clearly are not bound equally to the same codes of good conduct, decency, and morality, and they are not held equally accountable for their sins. Indeed, it is truly ironic that the death penalty and hell are reserved only to natural persons."" \n \n There’s a lot to love in both the majority opinion and Nelson’s heartfelt dissent. But as Eugene Volokh notes, the opinion practically begs to be overturned at the Supreme Court. (Dissenting Justice Nelson agrees and even says the court will summarily reverse it.) But whereas Justice Kennedy’s opinion in Citizens United seemed to be rooted in the thin vapors of his own aspirational First Amendment thinking, the Montana Supreme Court fixed its focus on the actual corrupting influence of the groups suing to overturn the ban. Thus Western Tradition Partnership, the lead plaintiff in the case, merits extra special scorn from the court for circulating a fundraising brochure that said, “If you decide to support this program, no politician, no bureaucrat, and no radical environmentalist will ever know you made this program possible.” The majority openly accuses WTP of being responsible for “a multi-front attack on both contribution restrictions and the transparency that accompanies campaign disclosure requirements.” The Montana majority, in other words, knows exactly what Justice Kennedy seems to have missed: That corruption is corruption regardless of its packaging, and that it rarely comes with a detailed disclosure label. \n \n More fundamentally, the majority and one dissenter seem to understand perfectly how much the American people resent being lied to about the burning need for courts to step in to protect the oppressed voices of powerless corporate interests. As Judge Nelson wrote in dissent, “the notion that corporations are disadvantaged in the political realm is unbelievable. Indeed, it has astounded most Americans. The truth is that corporations wield enormous power in Congress and in state legislatures. It is hard to tell where government ends and corporate America begins: the transition is seamless and overlapping.”']",2,"– Alleged Silk Road mastermind Ross Ulbricht was no ordinary drug boss—he paid $1,000 a month for a San Francisco apartment he shared with two roommates, used an alias from the Princess Bride, and was arrested in the sci-fi section of his public library.

237,"['NEW YORK (AP) — The newly appointed commissioner of New York City\'s jail system violated city law by sending as many as 47 mentally ill inmates into 23-hour confinement without first getting approval from mental health clinicians, a city oversight board said Tuesday. \n \n Commissioner Joseph Ponte, who took the helm of the country\'s second-largest jail system in March, insisted at a meeting of the New York City Board of Correction he was trying to quell rising levels of violence. \n \n Ponte, who had reduced the use of solitary confinement by two thirds in Maine\'s state prisons, said the June 13 move on Rikers Island was aimed at volatile inmates who have broken jailhouse rules and owe days in solitary. \n \n But board members rejected the argument, noting the move jeopardized the health of some inmates, particularly those on psychotropic medications who were taken from air-conditioned mental observation units and put into uncooled solitary cells. A federal judge has ordered that such inmates, deemed heat-sensitive because the exposure to heat while on such drugs can be fatal, shouldn\'t be placed in uncooled cells. \n \n Other inmates who were moved were denied medication and had seizure disorders, they said. At least one inmate suffered a seizure, Ponte said. \n \n ""I would just hope that you would review these issues and in the future instruct your staff to be consistent with the board standards and not to violate these rules which are not just rules but designed for the safety of the prisoners,"" said board member Dr. Robert Cohen. \n \n Nearly 40 percent of the roughly 11,500 daily inmates in city jails have a mental health diagnosis, according to the Department of Correction and about a third of them suffer from serious mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. The Associated Press has previously disclosed the deaths of two mentally ill inmates — one who essentially baked to death in a 101-degree cell in February — that have prompted calls for reform. \n \n During a City Council oversight hearing on violence and mental illness at Rikers the day before the inmate moves, Ponte was repeatedly asked about a list of hundreds of inmates who owe time in solitary confinement but are in general population because there\'s not enough space. Correction officials argue that those inmates, many of whom they say are gang members, drive the violence on Rikers. \n \n On Tuesday, Ponte told board members that figure is closer to 1,000 inmates. A number of them are high-risk for harming themselves and others and needed to be separated to stem surging violence, he said. \n \n ""What we don\'t have, and have not had for probably more than five years now, is a plan that\'s impacted the level of violence on Rikers Island,"" he told the board. \n \n There were 21 slashings in one recent six-week period and a total of 87 during fiscal year 2014, according to a letter sent by Ponte to board members Monday night and obtained by the AP. There were a total of 68 total such slashing the previous fiscal year and 55 in fiscal 2012, the letter said. \n \n ""Under such circumstances, I felt that it was imperative to take prompt action to prevent further violence,"" he wrote.', '“This will kill the Senate,” thundered Mitch McConnell, rising in opposition to Democratic plans to reform the filibuster. Would that it were true! The Senate exists because the Founding Fathers, who hated the idea of a Senate, gave in to threats from small-state senators demanding disproportionate representation. \n \n Sadly, Democrats are not about to kill the Senate. They’re not even going to kill the filibuster. What they’re threatening to do is to eliminate the newest and most abusive use of the filibuster. In addition to massively expanding the use of the filibuster to block legislation, Senate Republicans have started using it to block qualified executive branch nominees in order to block the execution of laws they find distasteful. \n \n Senate Republicans object to existing labor laws and the Dodd-Frank financial reform law. But they also lack the votes to pass changes to them. Instead, they have announced that they will block any nominee to vacant spots in those agencies — not just those deemed unfit or ideologically extreme — which has effectively paralyzed them from carrying out their work, unless Obama agrees to change the laws to suit the GOP. Senate Republicans have managed to largely paralyze labor law and financial reform this way. \n \n Congressional scholars Thomas Mann and Norman Ornstein have called this “the new nullification” — which is to say, a radical tactic to prevent the execution of duly passed laws. McConnell, unsurprisingly, loathes Ornstein, a consummate establishmentarian who has taken the unusual step of fingering Republicans in general and McConnell in particular as the primary agents of Washington dysfunction: \n \n Senate Democrats are threatening to change the rules of the Senate to allow executive branch nominees to be seated with a simple majority vote. They’re doing it now for several reasons: It’s taken years for the excesses of this tactic to wear down Senate Democrats\' inertia. The Senate just passed immigration reform and has no other pending bills that might be threatened if the place blows up. And Democrats are laying the groundwork for Obama to devote his term mainly to executing unilateral laws, not futilely trying to reason with Congress. Obama needs to staff his administration to do this. \n \n In a fiery speech, McConnell made a series of arguments against this change. One is that Democrats should worry about what will happen when Republicans want to nominate people they don’t like: “They’re not even interested in what this would mean down the road when Republicans are the ones making the nominations.” \n \n Well, yes, it would prevent Democrats from blocking a Republican president’s attempts to fill his own administration. Democrats did block numerous Bush administration executive branch appointments for various reasons, though never as leverage to force Bush to change the law. The next Republican president will be able to fill out his own administration with a simple majority Senate vote. Not so scary! \n \n McConnell’s other argument is insanely Orwellian. The issue, he says, is just a handful of “illegal” administration appointments. There’s a short backstory you need to know to understand what an insane argument McConnell is making here. Presidents often respond to blocked nominees by appointing them when Congress is in recess. Congress blocked Obama from doing this by holding pro forma sessions during its recess, which Democrats also used against Republicans. Obama tried to circumvent that tactic by declaring the pro forma sessions (when one Republican was around to gavel in and gavel out) a sham. The Republican-majority D.C. Circuit Court ruled against this tactic. \n \n Here is how McConnell puts it: ""So this isn’t really a fight over nominees at all. It’s a fight over these illegal, unconstitutional nominees."" \n \n But of course they’re only illegal nominees in the first place because McConnell insisted he wouldn’t seat them without changes to the laws they carry out. The attempt to seat them during a sham recess isn’t the cause of the conflict. The cause is McConnell’s blocking of otherwise acceptable nominees in order to force Obama to accept changes to the law he wouldn’t otherwise sign. \n \n The deeper subtext of McConnell’s argument is not one aimed at the public but at his fellow senators. It’s that the Senate is wonderful and unique, and any changes to its byways would threaten the character of the institution they all love so dearly. This is a deeply held belief by senators. In Washington, senators occupy a place of immense power and political security, catered to by sycophants at every turn, and basking across parties in their senatorial splendor and superiority to the common House. It is certainly true that, for the purposes of maintaining a dignified lifestyle for 100 senators, the Senate continues to function brilliantly. What’s very hard to defend is that the Senate functions perfectly as a vehicle for advancing the national interest.']",2,"– Guards at Rikers Island don't just neglect the mentally ill or let them bake to death, they also routinely brutally beat them, often without suffering any repercussions, a New York Times investigation has discovered. The Times uncovered a secret report compiled by a city department this year that found that 129 Rikers inmates suffered ""serious injuries"" in altercations with staff members over an 11-month span last year; 77% of those inmates had a mental health diagnosis. In most cases, the inmates were beaten while handcuffed. The Times investigated the incidents individually, and offer some disturbing details: When guards found Jose Bautista trying to hang himself, they saved him, but then allegedly threw him to the ground and punched him with such force that they perforated his bowel. It was one of five beatings noted in the report that followed a suicide attempt. Bautista needed emergency surgery, but guards took nine hours to drive him to the hospital—which is only 15 minutes away. When Andre Lane threw water or urine at guards, they allegedly handcuffed him to a gurney, wheeled him to a clinic that wasn't monitored by security cameras, and beat him so violently that the walls and cabinets were covered with his blood. After Brian Mack complained that guards were stealing inmates' food, a guard captain allegedly hit him in the eye with his radio, while another officer punched him in the jaw. He came away with a broken eye socket and jaw. Correction officials said he'd been in a fight with another inmate, but investigators noted no such fight was logged in prison records. None of the guards involved in any of the cases have faced criminal charges—or even administrative ones. Rikers has been under pressure to reform its treatment of mentally ill inmates—in January, for example, it announced it would stop putting the ""seriously mentally ill"" in solitary, though the Times notes that classification applies to a small segment of the population. Last week an oversight board said the newly-appointed city jail commissioner had in June illegally sent as many as 47 mentally ill Rikers inmates to solitary without consulting clinicians, the AP reports."
238,"['His grandfather had lovingly given him his name, hoping that one day he would grow up into a ‘positive’ human being. Some 25 years later, the marine engineer from Jamshedpur in Jharkhand is despondent on being forced to bear the burden of his name. \n \n Two years after passing out as a marine engineer from Tamil Nadu’s Noorul Islam University, Saddam Hussain says he has failed to find a job because of his namesake: the former Iraqi ruler executed in 2006. Saddam Hussein was a dictator blamed for atrocities on his subjects until toppled by the US in 2003. \n \n “People are scared to hire me,” laments Jamshedpur’s Saddam. His job application has been rejected each of the 40-odd times he has appeared for interviews with multinational shipping companies. His batchmates around the world have secured employment, but Saddam remains unemployed despite ranking second in his batch of 2014. \n \n For the initial six months, Saddam was unable to decipher why he was being rejected. “I then inquired with the HR departments of the companies and some of them told me my name was the problem,” he recounts. He was told that having a crew member with a name that arouses instant suspicion could be an operational nightmare. \n \n A top executive of Delhi-based TeamLease Services, a leading recruitment consultant, agrees. “If the issue involves crossing the borders, then nothing can be done as border patrol and airport authorities are very process-driven and if there is a red flag, they will check out. If the person’s job involves frequent travel abroad, he might just keep getting stuck or the company has to pull him out of the sticky situation, making the hire cumbersome,” he points out. \n \n “Even Shah Rukh Khan gets detained at US airports. What is this Saddam in comparision?” he asks. \n \n Getting rid of the name is proving to be a bigger nightmare. \n \n Once it hit him that his name was the impediment, Saddam legally got his name changed into Sajid and procured all relevant documents, including passport, voter ID and driving licence, under the name. \n \n But his woes did not end there. \n \n Prospective employers ask for his educational certificates, but his university has refused to change the name until he got his Class 10 and 12 exam certificates changed first. He approached the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) for a name change, but the authorities have not acted yet. \n \n Driven to desperation, Saddam, now Sajid, moved the Jharkhand high court with a plea to direct the CBSE to change his name. But since unscrupulous people often abuse the system by frequently changing names, the court acted with caution. Last week, it set the date for a considered hearing on May 5. \n \n Saddam remains fond of his grandfather, though he feels he is paying for his folly. As one by one his batchmates set sail after securing jobs, Saddam is left to spend sleepless nights. “I am an innocent victim of somebody else’s crimes,” he says. \n \n First Published: Mar 21, 2017 07:52 IST', 'Image copyright AP Image caption Saddam may no longer be around, but many of his namesakes do not have an easy time \n \n More than 10 years after being executed, Saddam Hussein remains a huge presence in the life of one man. \n \n The marine engineer in India does not blame his grandfather for giving him the Iraqi dictator\'s name 25 years ago. \n \n But after being refused a job some 40-odd times, he has concluded employers are loath to hire him - even if his name is marginally different - spelt Hussain, not Hussein. \n \n So he went to court to become Sajid. But the wheels of bureaucracy are turning slowly - and so is his search for a job. \n \n It may never have opened many doors in India - and has raised eyebrows and grins elsewhere - but one thing was guaranteed: a name like Saddam Hussain was not likely to pass unnoticed. \n \n Two years after graduating from Tamil Nadu\'s Noorul Islam University, the man from Jamshedpur in Jharkhand is feeling the strain. \n \n He did well at college, and his classmates have already found jobs, but shipping companies turn him away. \n \n ""People are scared to hire me,"" Saddam-turned-Sajid is quoted by Hindustan Times as saying. \n \n He says they fear complications from an encounter with immigration officials across international borders. \n \n Saddam thought he might easily get around this obstacle, by getting a new passport, driving licence and more. \n \n But his job applications are still not proceeding smoothly as he cannot provide proof, under his new name, that he went to school - and this is proving to be a time-consuming exercise. \n \n Another court hearing beckons on 5 May, this time to force authorities to change the name on his secondary school certificates, after which his graduation papers will need amending. \n \n Sajid is not alone in his plight - but he may feel more aggrieved than the numerous Saddam Husseins of Iraq, who feel cursed with a name that was originally given in tribute to a leader whose legacy is one of a brutal dictator. \n \n Being Saddam in Iraq \n \n One Saddam, a journalist working in Ramadi, a Sunni city in the desert province of Anbar, said his father was fired from his government job because he could not convince his superiors he was not a member of the dictator\'s Ba\'ath party. \n \n He had named his son Saddam, after all - what greater allegiance could he have shown to the ousted president, they argued. \n \n Others had more terrifying stories - one said he was captured by a Shia militia, set down on his knees and had the barrel of a gun placed against the back of his head. Somehow, thanks to sheer luck, the weapon jammed, and the militia eventually released him. \n \n One friend told me how, as a Kurdish schoolchild in Baghdad, he had known a fellow classmate named Saddam Hussein. \n \n While playing football with the boy, they would often shout at him: ""It is not only us who hate you, the entire country hates you."" \n \n Read Prashant Rao\'s BBC article']",2,"– Saddam Hussain's name is making it difficult for him to get a job. ""People are scared to hire me,"" the 25-year-old Indian marine engineer tells the Hindustan Times. Hussain was, yes, named for that Saddam Hussein; the name was given to him by his grandfather. It turned out to be a poor choice, as the young man has been unable to find a job since graduating university two years ago, despite having done very well in school. And he's applied for dozens of positions. He says he's spoken with some of the HR departments of companies he's applied with, and they told him his name was the problem, because it could cause ""suspicion."" One recruitment expert points out that this would be a problem especially if a job requires travel abroad, during which he might get stopped by airport or border authorities: ""He might just keep getting stuck or the company has to pull him out of the sticky situation, making the hire cumbersome,"" the expert says. Hussain got his first name legally changed to Sajid, but though he got all his official documents changed to reflect his new name, his original name still poses a problem because it's listed on educational certificates, which prospective employers want to see. He's working on getting those certificates changed as well, but the process is moving slowly, the BBC reports. (Meanwhile, in America, a guy is trying to change his name to Hitler.)"
239,"[""SOCHI, RUSSIA -- Three points from Portugal and Spain's remarkable 3-3 draw at Fisht Stadium in which Cristiano Ronaldo scored a sublime hat-trick. \n \n 1. Ronaldo's three goals earn Portugal a point \n \n For a guy whose deeds are so often defined by numbers, whether it's the fact that he has more goals than games for Real Madrid or the fact that nobody has more Ballon d'Or awards stashed away in his trophy cabinet, there was one that seemed out of sync before this World Cup began: three, as in the number of goals that Cristiano Ronaldo had scored in the World Cup to date. \n \n Yet he remedied that perceived dearth against Spain Friday, nabbing a hat-trick in a 3-3 draw to open their World Cup campaign. The first was a penalty he won himself, his nifty stopover prompting Nacho to dangle a leg over which Ronaldo gleefully fell. The second was a gift from David De Gea, who pushed his edge-of-the-box snap shot over the goal line, though again, there's something to be said for Ronaldo's alertness on the break that he was there to capitalize on Goncalo Guedes' layoff following Pepe's defensive clearance. The third was a magisterial free kick that disappeared into the top corner, leaving De Gea flat-footed. \n \n Ronaldo joins Miroslav Klose, Uwe Seeler and Pele as the only players who have scored in four World Cups. He also becomes the oldest player to score a hat-trick in World Cup history, at 33 years and 131 days. And he equals the legendary Ferenc Puskas, the most prolific European-born international goalscorer in history and the second most-prolific overall. (Iran's Ali Daei, at 109, may not be entirely out of his reach either.) \n \n He has broad shoulders, this one, which is a good thing, as a nation is riding on his back. \n \n Cristiano Ronaldo has a whole host of records for Real Madrid and Portugal. ADRIAN DENNIS/AFP/Getty Images) \n \n 2. Diego Costa's heroics stand out for Spain \n \n He has, at times, looked like a foreign object in a Spain shirt. Even as Julen Lopetegui's side romped through qualification to the World Cup, Diego Costa managed just nine appearances, lasting 90 minutes on just three occasions. But against Portugal he showed just how much value there is in him being so different. \n \n The first goal was vintage Costa: the angry forearm clear-out on Pepe, the deceptively quick legs to send Jose Fonte the wrong way, the threaded smash between two opponents. The second carried his hallmark too, as he used his physicality and hunger to get to the ball first and nudge it past Rui Patricio. The rest was selflessness, sacrifice and running battles with Pepe and Fonte, but always on the right side of VAR. \n \n Just what Spain needed. \n \n 3. A fair result for both teams \n \n The table shows Iran leading the group following their late 1-0 win against Morocco. But beyond the drama of a see-saw game -- one of the best group openers we've seen in a long time -- and the fact that they are two points off the top, there are positive takeaways for both teams. \n \n Spain ultimately controlled much of the game and can chalk up two of the goals conceded to uncharacteristic individual errors. There's some tweaking to be done but the post-Lopetegui meltdown simply didn't materialize. \n \n As for Portugal, it was always going to be a dog-fight of a group. But a point against Spain is a massive boost ahead of their next game, coming against a Morocco side already with their backs to the wall."", 'Media playback is not supported on this device World Cup 2018: Portugal 3-3 Spain - watch all six goals in under a minute \n \n ""The night was about Cristiano. He is relentless in his pursuit of greatness. What he is doing on the world stage is ridiculous."" \n \n Match of the Day pundit Rio Ferdinand said he ""couldn\'t breathe"" as former Manchester United team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo scored a hat-trick, including an 88th-minute equaliser, as Portugal drew 3-3 with Spain in a classic World Cup encounter. \n \n Ronaldo, as he so often does, had the last word in a match full of drama, as Spain came within minutes of securing a happy ending to a turbulent week in which they sacked their manager a day before the start of the tournament. \n \n So just how good was this Ronaldo display? Well, his was the star turn in a match that is sure to be remembered for years to come. \n \n ""I\'m going to get a flight back tomorrow because I won\'t see a better game,"" joked former England winger Chris Waddle. \n \n What did Ronaldo do? \n \n It took just over three minutes for Portugal\'s captain to make his mark on the game in Sochi, drawing Nacho into a foul in the area and converting the penalty with trademark cool. \n \n Diego Costa equalised brilliantly but Ronaldo struck a second time, David de Gea\'s uncharacteristic fumble into the net a gift to the Real Madrid man. \n \n Costa scored again to make it 2-2 before Nacho made amends with a sublime strike to put Spain 3-2 up. \n \n But then came that free-kick... \n \n A one-in-45 shot \n \n Media playback is not supported on this device Ronaldo scores \'sensational\' free-kick to complete hat-trick \n \n Standing over the ball as De Gea set his wall and with just two minutes remaining, there was no doubt it would be Ronaldo who would take the set piece. And yet history suggested a team-mate - any team-mate - might have been better placed.. \n \n This, remarkably, was Ronaldo\'s first goal from a direct free-kick in 45 attempts at major championships. \n \n ""One or two will ask why I said at half-time Ronaldo needs to work on free-kicks. Well it\'s because it took him 45 attempts, but he did it,"" said former England captain Alan Shearer. \n \n ""It\'s a brilliant free-kick and it is technically so difficult to do,"" added former England midfielder Danny Murphy. ""He went over and around the wall and it had all sorts of bend and dip on it."" \n \n Speaking on Russia Today, Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho offered a reminder that Ronaldo\'s free-kick record has worsened since his days at Old Trafford and early years at Real, but added that ""this one was the critical one"". \n \n ""There are players for some matches, there are players for every match and there are players for special matches. The players for special matches are the ones,"" the Portuguese added. \n \n Over to you, Lionel... \n \n Media playback is not supported on this device World Cup Catch-Up: Ronaldo the showman lights up biggest stage \n \n Lionel Messi is another of those ones. Ronaldo\'s pursuit of greatness has been inextricably linked with that of the Argentina forward, who starts his campaign against Iceland on Saturday. \n \n ""A little sub-plot to it is now the pressure is mounted on Messi\'s shoulders after watching Cristiano here,"" said Ferdinand. \n \n ""He\'ll deliver,"" came the reply from Cesc Fabregas on Match of the Day. Fabregas, of course, played with Messi at Barcelona between 2011 and 2014. \n \n Former Scotland winger Pat Nevin said Ronaldo would have ""hated"" the discussions before the tournament about whether this will be Messi\'s World Cup. \n \n ""Cristiano has raised the bar so Iceland could be in trouble,"" he added. \n \n Level with Puskas - greatness in numbers \n \n This was Ronaldo\'s 51st hat-trick for club and country, a ""personal best"" according to the man himself. \n \n It comprised his 82nd, 83rd and 84th international goals, putting him joint-second on the all-time list alongside Hungary legend Ferenc Puskas, now trailing only Iran\'s Ali Daei on 109. \n \n Will he surpass that mark? Or is it a case of when? \n \n Ronaldo also became the first man in history to score in eight consecutive major tournaments with his early penalty against Spain. Where will that streak end? \n \n ""Cristiano is the best in the world and I hope in Qatar once again he is going to score in a World Cup,"" said Portugal coach Fernando Santos, feeling his side\'s 33-year-old talisman can extend his international career until 2022. \n \n Despite the brilliance of his performance, Ronaldo was quick to try to make his team the focus at the full-time whistle. \n \n ""The most important thing is to highlight what the team has done,"" said Ronaldo. ""The game was about to end and we managed to equalise so we are happy. \n \n ""We are not the favourites so we will try to do our best. The team is doing very well and we are going to do well for sure."" \n \n Portugal\'s next Group B game is against Morocco on Wednesday at 13:00 BST, while Spain face Iran at 19:00, no doubt happy to see the back of Ronaldo, for now at least. \n \n ""When you are playing a player like Ronaldo these things can happen,"" said Spain coach Fernando Hierro. \n \n ""It is extremely fortunate for whichever team has him, but I certainly would not change him for any of the players in my squad."" \n \n Where does it rank? \n \n Ronaldo\'s hat-trick is likely to become one of the most memorable World Cup moments and this match one of the best in the competition\'s history. \n \n ""It was one of the best World Cup games I\'ve seen - especially in a group stage. It augurs well for the rest of the World Cup,"" said Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker. \n \n But where does Ronaldo\'s performance rank? Here are some of the best individual displays in World Cup history... \n \n Oleg Salenko - Russia 6-1 Cameroon (USA 1994) - Salenko remains the first and only player to score five goals in a single World Cup game.

Without a doubt, Spain is a better team than the Portuguese team collectively and individually. But there is no Cristiano Ronaldo. And that made all the difference in this match."" \n \n El Mundo (Spain): ""Spain survives Cristiano Ronaldo. When there is a huge player in front, the draw is not a bad solution.""', ""On Friday morning, meanwhile, only a few hours before the game, it emerged in Spanish news media reports that Ronaldo himself had agreed to pay the Spanish authorities $21.8 million in unpaid taxes. He has also been given a two-year suspended jail sentence, the papers said. It would be hard to believe that these developments did not faze him as the game approached. \n \n Still, it was Ronaldo who gave Portugal the lead, winning and converting a penalty after just four minutes of play. And it was Ronaldo who restored the lead, his shot squirming under David De Gea, the Spanish goalkeeper, as the first half drew to a close. And it was Ronaldo who, with just a few minutes remaining in the second half, lined up a free kick a little outside the Spanish penalty area with Portugal now trailing, 3-2. \n \n He had taken 44 free kicks in previous World Cups. He had scored on none of them. Still, you know what they say: the 45th time’s a charm. \n \n It is true that Ronaldo, at 33, is not the player he was. He is still perfectly sculpted, of course, a Men’s Health magazine cover made flesh, but the electric pace has fizzled a little; he does not cover quite as much ground (only one player, the Portuguese defender José Fonte, ran less than Ronaldo in a first half in which one of them scored twice). \n \n But it is equally true to say that Ronaldo, even in his twilight, shines brighter than almost any player with whom he comes into contact. He has not so much faded as a player as evolved into something different. It is misleading to suggest that he has transformed into a striker, a penalty- area predator, because he is not really restricted by such mortal concepts as geography. \n \n Instead, he has attained a level of such devastating efficiency that he now does not really require something so mundane as the ball. He does not need to be involved. He looks, often, like he is doing nothing, or something quite close to it — as if he is a mere passenger. It is an illusion. He is always in the cockpit. \n \n Isco, his Real Madrid teammate, was the dominant player on the field here, the one who was most involved, who prompted and probed and prodded, and he was wearing a Spain jersey. Ronaldo has moved beyond needing to dictate games. He concerns himself only with defining them. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n His free kick, needless to say, curled artfully, effortlessly, past De Gea and into the corner of Spain’s goal, as Ronaldo — despite all historical evidence to the contrary — must have known it would. \n \n Portugal, which is now best thought of as a nation established in 1128 so that it might one day produce Cristiano Ronaldo, would have its draw. More important, the 2018 World Cup had its spark. The afterglow of a game like this can last for a couple of weeks, at least; on this stage, it can resonate around the world. \n \n Spain would have been forgiven for feeling like a victim. It had been the better team in this game, had more of the ball, created more opportunities, played the slicker, smoother soccer. \n \n It had looked every inch a contender for a World Cup title and nothing like a side still reeling from Lopetegui’s departure, shaken to its core by a dispute between its players and their ultimate bosses at the country’s federation, having to adjust to life under a new coach who, until now, had only managed one second-division team. \n \n That Spain’s players did not let all this deter them on Friday only served to emphasize the scale of Ronaldo’s performance and the overall quality of the match. \n \n And when the final whistle blew, the stadium stood: not just the clusters of Portuguese fans, not just the neutrals and the Russians, but the Spanish fans, too, in those blood-red jerseys. They applauded their own team, of course; there was enough encouragement there to see the bigger picture, to believe that the tumult of the last few days may not be fatal to their hopes. \n \n But when Spain’s players had left the field, and Portugal’s stood in the center circle, the Spanish fans remained standing, and they kept clapping, as every single Portuguese player sought out Ronaldo, to clasp his hand, to ruffle his hair, as though just to touch him was to brush against something holy. \n \n They do not mind that he attracts — demands, really — all of the attention. They do not mind being in the supporting cast, just as those Spanish fans did not mind providing the audience for the three acts of his one-man show. Sometimes, it is a pleasure simply to be there; sometimes, it is a pleasure just to sit back and watch. And at the end, sometimes there is nothing to do but applaud. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n ■ Here’s how it happened: \n \n Full Time: Spain 3, Ronaldo 3 \n \n Ronaldo has produced one of the most remarkable individual performances you could possibly hope to see, and illuminated what will take some beating as the best game of the tournament. Portugal hasn’t been discussed much as a contender for the World Cup, despite being European champion. This may have been an oversight. \n \n 90 + 2’: Portugal Almost Pulls Away \n \n Quaresa almost wins it! He walks the ball through the Spanish defense, into the penalty area, around two defenders. But the third arrives in the nick of time to smother his shot. What a winner that might have been. I think we all — players, coaches, fans, viewers — need a whistle, a beer and a shower at this point. \n \n 88’: GOAL! Ronaldo Equalizes \n \n Oh woooooowwwwwwww! Ronaldo completes his hat trick with a stunning free kick, curled around the wall’s right edge. De Gea never had a chance. It’s 3-3. Message from the office in New York: “Can they just keep playing, please?” \n \n 86’: Sloppy Spain \n \n Now it’s Spain that gives away a silly free kick, as Piqué, who had Ronaldo corralled with his back to goal, shoves him down. \n \n 84’: A Clasico Moment \n \n A little Barcelona-Real Madrid spice as Ronaldo throws the ball to Jordi Alba, who was coming to take it for a throw-in. You can take the boys out of the Clasico, but you can’t take the Clasico out of the boys. \n \n 82’: Just When You Think Spain Is Sitting Back ... \n \n Isco adds some rare excitement at the other end, squeezing off a low shot that Rui Patricio handles with ease. \n \n 79’: Danger in the Area \n \n A long, bounding ball from Portugal’s end results in a collision of Ronaldo, De Gea and Piqué, who appears to take the brunt of a collision with a goalkeeper and a bronze statue in full sprint. The ball, most important if you’re Spanish, winds up cleared in the interaction, and a handball by Quaresma trying to collect it allows everyone to exhale. \n \n That ball seemed to catch everyone but Ronaldo by surprise, and he nearly made Spain pay for their momentary confusion. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n 76’: Spain Puts on the Clamps \n \n It’s easy to get lulled into this thriller, but Spain has quietly settled into two banks of four defensively. For a team that knows how to pick a lock on offense, they also know how to clamp down when it counts. \n \n 70’: Portugal Makes Changes \n \n Joao Mario and Ricardo Quaresma come on for Portugal, now seeking fresh legs and, most important, a goal with 20 minutes left. Spain brings on Bayern Munich’s Thiago Alcántara for Iniesta — young legs for aging ones. \n \n 64’: Spain-Portugal Delivers \n \n This would have been a super World Cup final: tense, dramatic, goal-filled. A terrific game. Though, to be fair, awarding the trophy tonight before 24 teams kicked a ball might cause problems at the next FIFA Congress. \n \n Photo \n \n 58’ GOAL! Nacho Gives Spain the Lead \n \n Nacho steps into a failed clearance, puts his laces into the ball and pings both posts with a shot through traffic. A rocket and, for the moment, a potential winner. \n \n 55’: GOAL! Diego Costa Makes Portugal Pay \n \n And that’s what happens when you give away free kicks easily. GOAL! Free kick is rolled into play, lofted to Busquets at the right post, and he nods it into the path of Costa. He’s got two now, just like Ronaldo, and we’ve got a game again. Spain: 2, Portugal: 2, All of us: happy. \n \n Rory Smith: Diego Costa has been Spain’s great conundrum in the last few years: he offers a threat the rest of the team simply doesn’t possess, but he’s always struggled to be himself in a context that is so alien, and a style so unfamiliar. If Fernando Hierro has solved that in two days, maybe he should have got the Real Madrid job. \n \n 53’: Spain’s Strategy ... \n \n Spain’s back to playing keepaway. Their possession can lull defenses to sleep and they know it. Enough of it, and an opponent without focus can be coaxed into bad positions, bad decisions, bad fouls out of frustration. That was one right there, and now, just like that, Spain has a dangerous free kick from 30 yards. \n \n 46’: More Entertainment on the Way? \n \n The teams are back and here we go. Let’s hope the second half is even half as good as that first 45 was. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Was just wondering how many goals Ronaldo would have by now if he’d been fined, say, $50 million this morning by the Spanish tax man. \n \n Photo \n \n Halftime: Two Ronaldo Goals Give Portugal the Lead \n \n Cristiano Ronaldo scores early — a fourth-minute penalty — and late — on a 44th-minute blunder by Spain’s goalkeeper — and Portugal leads the Iberian Derby in Sochi, 2-1 at the break. Spain was solid except for the two times it wasn’t, and Ronaldo — an assassin of a forward who seems to get better with age — was there each time to pounce. \n \n 44’: GOAL! Ronaldo Does it Again \n \n A howler from De Gea and Portugal leads 2-1. Ronaldo gets the ball near the top of the area, and wangles a hard low shot at De Gea. Eminently savable, he instead lets it skip off him and in. That’s a terrible mistake from an outstanding goalkeeper, and it’s cost his team badly here in the closing second of the half. \n \n Rory Smith: This will be no solace for David De Gea — who really does not make mistakes like that — but this is the game the World Cup needed. Spain has been breathtaking at times, but there’s a resilience to Portugal, a nous, that makes them a threat. And they have this guy upfront: tall, tan, who looks to have quite the career ahead of him. \n \n 42’: Pepe’s Not Really Sorry \n \n One of the eternal truths of world soccer is that when Pepe fouls a guy from behind and then helps him up and says “sorry,” he’s probably not. The same truism applies to Sergio Ramos and probably a dozen other players you can think of off the top of your head. \n \n Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But he’s got the angle fractionally wrong, and while Rui Patricio dives to make it look good in the photos, the ball was always going wide. \n \n The contrast in attacking styles tonight is remarkable: Spain attacks like a molasses spill — slowly and steadily creeping forward, ever forward, inch by inch — applying more and more pressure, hoping something finally cracks, and they’re in. Portugal, on the other hand, waits and waits and then breaks out like a stolen Ferrari on the counterattack. \n \n Photo \n \n 30’: VAR Does its Job \n \n They finally show the replay of the Spanish shot off the bar, and it wasn’t close to crossing the line when it came down. Goal line technology, introduced at the World Cup in 2014, does its job. I’ve never seen it fall to be honest. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Fernando Hierro, by the way, is prowling the Spain coaching box in shirt sleeves like he wants to check in to the game. Gesturing, clapping, stalking. \n \n 29’: Silva Hits the Wall \n \n Silva stands over the free kick with Koke as the referee sets the wall. Silva right, Koke left. But the shot finds the wall like a magnet. \n \n 26’: Spain Almost Scores Again \n \n Was that in?? We’ll review. A Spanish shot rockets off the crossbar and down off the line — Georff Hurst-style — but a second look says no, it didn’t go in. And again play moves on. \n \n 24’: GOAL! Diego Costa Levels for Spain \n \n Diego Costa gets behind the defense and dances around two defenders until he can get a look at the goal. Spotting it, he buries a shot past Rui Patricio. \n \n Rory Smith: Spain’s reputation for delicacy is well-earned, but occasionally a little bit of brute force is required: Diego Costa bulldozes (just about fairly) through Pepe, twists and turns until he sees a glimmer of goal, and then arrows a shot past Rui Patricio. This is better than Iran against Morocco. \n \n 21’: Spain Threatens, but Misses \n \n We’re spending a bit more time in Portugal’s end here as Spain probes the Portuguese defense at its leisure. Now Iniesta spots a crease and dashes into on the left. He takes the ball to the end line and cuts it back for Silva, but his shot goes wide. \n \n 17’: Free Kick for Ronaldo \n \n Sergio Busquets loses a ball on the left side and, compounding his mistake, picks up a yellow. Ronaldo stands over the free kick. \n \n Ronaldo slams it into the wall, half of Portugal’s team calls for a handball, but the referee, Italy’s Gianluca Rocchi, isn’t having it. He points the other way, and Spain is playing keepaway again. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n 16’: Spain Tries to Find Comfort Zone \n \n A little more possession for Spain here, which is their comfort zone. Quick one touch stuff: here you have it, oh no you take it back, no you, really, no you, OK, I’ll look over here, oh never mind here’s the ball back. But it might settle them a bit. \n \n 14’: Ronaldo in Charge \n \n The crowd roars audibly literally every time Ronaldo touches the ball. He’s the star here, a spotlight that as we all know he doesn’t like. (I’m totally kidding; he looooooooves it.) \n \n 11’: Clock Games \n \n Ruo Patricio almost seems like he’s time-wasting after collecting a deep ball, picking it up, dropping it, picking it up again. Which would be the funniest thing ever considering it’s THE ELEVENTH MINUTE. \n \n Spain is wearing white today, btw, and Portugal is in Spain’s traditional red shirts. It’s a little disconcerting. \n \n 10’: Spain Tries to Recover \n \n The ball falls to David Silva after a hopeful cross into the penalty area, and he slashes at it with his right foot and skies it over the bar. \n \n The look on his face after that miss surely matches all of Spain’s, a nation trying to figure out how such a hopeful summer could go so wrong so far. \n \n 3’: Goal! Ronaldo Makes Spain Pay \n \n Well, we said there would be drama, and that’s it from the start. A foul, a whistle and a penalty for Ronaldo! He converts, and just like that Spain’s World Cup somehow manages to get even worse. \n \n Photo \n \n Rory Smith: Four minutes in, Portugal leads, through what looked, at first glance, like something of a soft penalty. Cristiano Ronaldo’s dancing feet enticed Nacho — his Real Madrid teammate — into what was definitely a foolish tackle; the forward threw himself to the floor after what was probably fairly minimal contact, and then dusted himself down to convert the spot-kick. His celebration — stroking his chin — may have been a G.O.A.T. reference. More on that as we get it. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n The First Heavyweight Match of the World Cup \n \n There’s a buoyant atmosphere in Sochi ahead of the first really heavyweight meeting of the 2018 World Cup — an Iberian derby between Spain and Portugal. It’s been easy to miss the European fans in Russia so far — the Latin American contingents are more numerous and, if we’re honest, louder — but there are plenty from both countries in the baking heat of Sochi, on the lip of the Black Sea. The stadium is pretty much full, too, which is kind of a relief, after both of today’s other games were pockmarked by empty seats. — Rory Smith \n \n Spain’s New Coach Deals With Drama \n \n Spain’s new coach, Fernando Hierro, has stepped into a bit of a mess before this game, but he told reporters this week that Spain had no time to dwell on it. \n \n “We’ve come to fight for the World Cup,” he said. “We have a great opportunity and that should be the focus.” \n \n Hierro understands the stage; he made four World Cup teams and played in three for Spain. He said this week that he took over the team in its time of crisis out of a sense of duty. “When the president told me the possibility, I had three choices: to say no, another was to go and the third was to stay, to take a step forward for the Spanish federation and for Spanish soccer,” he said. “I couldn’t say no because I would not forgive myself.” \n \n Spain vs. Portugal Starting Lineups \n \n The lineups are out in Sochi, and both include household names: \n \n For Spain: De Gea; Nacho, Piqué, Ramos, Alba; Busquets, Koke, Iniesta; Isco, Silva; Diego Costa. \n \n One player who may have been lost in all the drama is Spain goalkeeper David De Gea. He’s among the best in the world at his position, and he just signed a new five-year deal to stay at Manchester United. So that should clear his head just in time to face Ronaldo. \n \n For Portugal: Patricio, Soares, Fonte, Pepe, Guerreiro, B Silva, Carvalho, Moutinho, Fernandes, Guedes, Ronaldo \n \n They’ll have a lot to live up to: the day’s first two games both ended with dramatic late winners. The soccer, however, should be a bit smoother from these two. For the sake of everyone, let’s hope it’s Ronaldo and Iniesta and David Silva and Bernardo Silva we’re talking about later, and not something Pepe or Sergio Ramos has done."", 'A weird new species of ancient predatory cockroach has been discovered preserved in amber. \n \n The cockroach is thought to have lived 100 million years ago, and it looks little like its modern relatives. \n \n After the first look I knew it was something new \n \n The tiny monster, measuring just under 1 cm, hosts a weird amalgam of unique features making it look like a chimera of a crane fly, a praying mantis and a cockroach. \n \n The discovery adds to the number of ferocious cockroaches known to have lived in prehistoric times. \n \n The new specimen Manipulator modificaputis belongs to an ancient family of cockroaches, called the Manipulatoridae. \n \n It has a triangular, manoeuvrable head, with large eyes, set upon a long neck, features that likely helped it hunt its prey. The cockroach also had a narrow body and wings, elongated legs and mouthparts, and an extra set of modified eyes located on the top of its head, which likely helped it spot predators, such as the feathered dinosaurs living at the time. \n \n This little monster was a solitary hunter \n \n The cockroach was found preserved in amber by German researcher Ziggi Ellenberger in modern day Myanmar. \n \n At first, scientists thought the cockroach might have been a mantis. \n \n But an examination by Dr Peter Vršanský, from the Geological Institute of Bratislava and the Slovak Academy of Sciences revealed it to be something different. “After the first look I knew it was something new,” he told BBC Earth. “Nothing similar runs on Earth today.” \n \n Vršanský made the discovery, reported in the journal Geologica Carpathica along with Günter Bechly, from the State Museum of Natural History in Stuttgart, Germany. \n \n They believe the cockroach hunted at night. \n \n “This little monster was a solitary hunter, able to run very fast, with a body unlike the vast majority of cockroaches living today, it posed high above ground, frequently taking flight when necessary, and seizing its prey with strong short spines developed on its extremely long feet,” he adds. \n \n Not all scientists agree on the cockroach’s hunting skills though. Manipulator had long and weak legs, and was unlikely to run fast, says Dr Alexandr Rasnitsyn, a professor from the Palaeontological Institute, at the Russian Academy of Sciences. \n \n He thinks it was more likely to surprise rather than chase its prey, using its long limbs to traverse gaps between forest leaves. \n \n The new discovery in among a number of ancient cockroaches found in Myanmar. \n \n Many were predatory insects that evolved to rule the night. “Especially drastic and brutal were top predatory Raphidiomimidae. Cockroaches with a wingspan up to 20cm and eyes divided into two parts, with gut containing large pieces of demolished insects,” says Vršanský. \n \n Most of these ferocious lineages went extinct, however, with only one lineage surviving today: the praying mantis, which belongs to the same superorder of the cockroaches.', 'Image copyright Samsung Image caption Samsung acknowledges that it uses software that has an impact on its energy efficiency scores \n \n The European Commission says it is ""following up"" two reports that raise concerns that software used in TVs may be skewing their energy rating scores. \n \n One study indicates that some Samsung TVs nearly halve their power consumption when a standardised test is carried out. \n \n Another accuses a different unnamed manufacturer of adjusting the brightness of its sets when they ""recognise"" the test film involved. \n \n Samsung has denied any wrongdoing. \n \n It acknowledged that it used software that altered its televisions\' performance during tests, but said this was the effect of a general energy efficiency feature that came into effect during normal use and had nothing to do with the testing process. \n \n However, one environmental campaign group has likened the accusations to the Volkswagen diesel scandal, in which the German car firm admitted to programming its cars to deliberately cheat emissions tests. \n \n Power drop \n \n Televisions\' energy efficiency ratings are based on the power they use while screening a 10-minute video, which contains a mix of fast and slow-moving content shown at different brightness levels. \n \n Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Manufacturers must carry out a standardised energy efficiency test before they can put their screens on sale \n \n Manufacturers run the test themselves and then file the results.

He scored three times, including one with about 2 minutes left in regulation, to lift Portugal into a 3-3 tie with Spain in their World Cup opener. The feat makes him, at age 33 years and 131 days, the oldest player to notch a World Cup hat trick, notes ESPN. He's also only the fourth player ever to score in four World Cups. Ronaldo's first two goals weren't perhaps of the write-home-about-it variety, including one that went in with help from Spain's goalie, but the third one was incredible, per the BBC.

241,"['Last Updated, Wednesday, 11:07 a.m. The year before his seventh and final Tour de France victory, Lance Armstrong offered to donate “in excess of $150,000″ to the antidoping agency in charge of keeping American athletes from using performance-enhancing drugs, according to the organization’s chief executive. \n \n The latest accusation against Armstrong, the disgraced former cyclist, was made by the current head of the United States Anti-Doping Agency, Travis Tygart, in an interview with CBS News posted online on Tuesday. In October, Usada stripped Armstrong of all of his titles and barred him from competition for life following the release of a 202-page report into what the agency called “the most sophisticated, professionalized and successful doping program that sport has ever seen.” \n \n As my colleague Juliet Macur reported, Armstrong, who has so far denied all allegations of cheating, “has told associates and antidoping officials that he is considering publicly admitting that he used banned performance-enhancing drugs and blood transfusions during his cycling career.” Late Tuesday, Oprah Winfrey announced that she “will speak exclusively with Lance Armstrong in his first no-holds-barred interview,” to be broadcast next week on her network. \n \n BREAKING NEWS: Looking forward to this conversation with @lancearmstrong: http://t.co/GwSmBhdW #NextChapter — Oprah Winfrey (@Oprah) 9 Jan 13 \n \n As the cycling journalist Lionel Birnie notes, the Oprah Winfrey Network is a joint venture with Discovery Communications, the broadcaster that sponsored Armstrong’s team in 2005. \n \n Lance is going on Oprah, partly-produced by Discovery Channel, sponsors of Lance’s 7th and final fraudulent Tour win. Somehow fitting. — Lionel Birnie (@lioneljbirnie) 9 Jan 13 \n \n Samantha Lane, a reporter for The Age in Australia, pointed out on Twitter that Winfrey and Armstrong looked comfortable together in a photograph published in the May 2004 issue of O, The Oprah Magazine with an interview of the cyclist before that year’s Tour de France. \n \n Oprah & Lance, in happier times (pic from her website). http://t.co/TMpMfYfk — Sam Lane (@SamJaneLane) 9 Jan 13 \n \n The photograph showed Armstrong in his Discovery Channel uniform and Winfrey, leaning on his shoulder, wearing a yellow, Livestrong bracelet. \n \n The network’s logo was emblazoned across the victor’s yellow jersey Armstrong wore on the top step of the podium in Paris that year, as he lectured “the people that don’t believe in cycling, the cynics and the skeptics.” \n \n Directly addressing those who accused him of doping that day, Armstrong said, “I’m sorry for you, I’m sorry you can’t dream big and I’m sorry you don’t believe in miracles, but this is one hell of a race, this is a great sporting event and you should stand around and believe. You should believe in these athletes and you should believe in these people. I’m a fan of the Tour de France for as long as I live and there’s no secrets — this is a hard sporting event and hard work wins it.” \n \n The notion of Armstrong confessing on Oprah was pre-mocked nearly two years ago by the bike racers and cartoonists Andy Shen and Dan Schmalz in their cult comic strip about the soap-operatic world of professional cycling, “As the Toto Turns,” for nyvelocity.com. \n \n Andy Shen and Dan Schmalz, nyvelocity.com \n \n Another journalist who writes about cycling, Shane Stokes, suggested that Armstrong might expect Winfrey to go easy on him, since she let another disgraced athlete, Marion Jones, claim during a 2008 interview that she had used performance-enhancing drugs unintentionally. \n \n Just after news of the interview broke, Kathy LeMond, whose husband, Greg, is now the only American to win the Tour de France, offered to put Winfrey in touch with people who could give her a crash course on the culture of professional cycling. \n \n .@Oprah I hope you get educated before the interview.

He then revealed that someone representing Armstrong had offered to give the American antidoping agency more than $150,000 at some point in 2004. “It was a clear conflict of interest for Usada,” Tygart said. “We had no hesitation in rejecting that offer.” Pressed further about the amount of the proposed donation, Tygart said that it was about $250,000. \n \n In another portion of the interview, broadcast on the CBS Evening News on Tuesday, Tygart said that Armstrong had tried to intimidate former teammates who had testified to a federal grand jury about his doping.

243,"['Getting to know someone usually requires at least a little conversation. But a new study suggests you can get a hint of an individual\'s personality through his or her scent alone. \n \n Participants in the study assessed, with some degree of accuracy, how outgoing, anxious or dominant people were after only taking a whiff of their clothes. The study is the first to test whether personality traits can be discerned through body odor. \n \n While the match-up between responses by the judges and the judged were not perfect, they do suggest that, when forming a first impression, we take into account a person\'s smell, as well as visual and audible cues to their personality traits, the researchers said. \n \n We not only express ourselves through our looks, ""we also express ourselves with how we smell,"" said study researcher Agnieszka Sorokowska, a doctoral candidate at the University of Wroclaw, in Poland. \n \n The study will be published in an upcoming issue of the European Journal of Personality. \n \n Personality smells \n \n Sorokowska and colleagues asked 30 men and 30 women to don white cotton t-shirts for three consecutive nights. Participants could not use fragrances, deodorants or soaps, and could not smoke or drink or eat odorous foods during the study. Participants also took a personality test. \n \n Shirts from the ""odor donors"" were collected and rated by 100 men and 100 women. Raters were asked to smell the shirts (placed in non-transparent plastic bags) and evaluate five personality traits of the donors, on a scale of one to 10. Each rater assessed six shirts, and each shirt was assessed by 20 raters. \n \n The judges\' ratings matched up with the self-assessments of the donors for three personality traits: extroversion (the tendency to be outgoing and sociable) neuroticism (the tendency to feel anxious and moody) and dominance (the urge to be a leader). \n \n The matches were far from perfect. But the raters predicted the donor\'s level of extroversion and neuroticism through smell about as accurately as participants in a different study predicted personality traits based on a video depicting a person\'s behavior, Sorokowska said. \n \n Judgments of dominance were most accurate in the case where an individual rater was assessing the odor of someone who was the opposite sex, suggesting such judgments are especially important when it comes to choosing a mate, the researchers said. \n \n Odor and emotions \n \n Extroversion, neuroticism and dominance are all traits that may, to some extent, be expressed physiologically, including through our emotions. \n \n For instance, people who are neurotic may sweat more when they experience stress, which would modify the bacteria in their underarms and make them smell different, the researchers said. \n \n Personality traits may also be linked with the secretion of hormones that could alter a persons\' scent. People who are high in dominance may have higher levels of testosterone, which in turn may modify their sweat glands, the researchers said. \n \n The findings are preliminary and more studies need to be done to confirm the results, Sorokowska said. It\'s not clear whether the same link would be found in other cultures known to have weaker body odors, Sorokowska said. \n \n Pass it on: Some traits of an individual\'s personality can be assessed through smell, preliminary research suggests. \n \n Follow MyHealthNewsDaily staff writer Rachael Rettner on Twitter @RachaelRettner.

Many PFLP-GC fighters defected to the rebel side and their leader Ahmed Jibril left the camp two days ago, rebel sources said. \n \n “All of the camp is under the control of the (rebel) Free Syrian Army,” said a Palestinian activist in Yarmouk. He said clashes had stopped and the remaining PFLP fighters retreated to join Assad’s forces massed on the northern edge of the camp. \n \n The battle in Yarmouk is one of a series of conflicts on the southern fringes of Assad’s capital, as rebels try to choke the power of the 47-year-old leader after a 21-month-old uprising in which 40,000 people have been killed. \n \n Government forces have used jets and artillery to try to dislodge the fighters but the violence has crept into the heart of the city and activists say rebels overran three army stations in a new offensive in the central province of Hama on Monday. \n \n On the border with Lebanon, hundreds of Palestinian families fled across the frontier following the weekend violence in Yarmouk, a Reuters witness said. \n \n Syria hosts half a million Palestinian refugees, most living in Yarmouk, descendants of those admitted after the creation of Israel in 1948, and has always cast itself as a champion of the Palestinian struggle, sponsoring several guerrilla factions. \n \n Both Assad’s government and the mainly Sunni Muslim Syrian rebels have enlisted and armed divided Palestinian factions as the uprising has developed into a civil war. \n \n “NEITHER SIDE CAN WIN” \n \n Syrian Vice President Farouq al-Sharaa said in a newspaper interview published on Monday that neither Assad’s forces nor rebels seeking to overthrow him can win the war. \n \n Sharaa, a Sunni Muslim in a power structure dominated by Assad’s Alawite minority, has rarely been seen since the revolt erupted in March 2011 and is not part of the president’s inner circle directing the fight against Sunni rebels. But he is the most prominent figure to say in public that Assad will not win. \n \n Sharaa said the situation in Syria was deteriorating and a “historic settlement” was needed to end the conflict, involving regional powers and the U.N. Security Council and the formation of a national unity government “with broad powers”. \n \n A torn poster of Syria's President Bashar al-Assad is seen at the entrance of a factory in Ouwayjah village in Aleppo December 17, 2012. REUTERS/Zain Karam \n \n “With every passing day the political and military solutions are becoming more distant. We should be in a position defending the existence of Syria. We are not in a battle for an individual or a regime,” Sharaa was quoted as telling Al-Akhbar newspaper. \n \n “The opposition cannot decisively settle the battle and what the security forces and army units are doing will not achieve a decisive settlement,” he said, adding that insurgents fighting to topple Syria’s leadership could plunge it into “anarchy and an unending spiral of violence”. \n \n Sources close to the Syrian government say Sharaa had pushed for dialogue with the opposition and objected to the military response to an uprising that began peacefully. \n \n In a veiled criticism of the crackdown, he said there was a difference between the state’s duty to provide security to its citizens, and “pursuing a security solution to the crisis”. \n \n He said even Assad could not be certain where events in Syria were leading, but that anyone who met him would hear that “this is a long struggle...and he does not hide his desire to settle matters militarily to reach a final solution.” \n \n In Hama province, rebels and the army clashed in a new campaign launched on Sunday by rebels to block off the country’s north, activists said. \n \n The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition-linked violence monitor, said fighting raged through the provincial towns of Karnaz, Kafar Weeta, Halfayeh and Mahardeh. \n \n Slideshow (23 Images) \n \n It said there were no clashes reported in Hama city, which lies on the main north-south highway connecting the capital with Aleppo, Syria’s second city. \n \n Qassem Saadeddine, a member of the newly established rebel military command, said on Sunday fighters had been ordered to surround and attack army positions across the province. He said Assad’s forces were given 48 hours to surrender or be killed. \n \n In 1982 Hafez al-Assad, father of the current ruler, crushed an uprising in Hama city, killing up to 30,000 civilians. \n \n Qatiba al-Naasan, a rebel from Hama, said the offensive would bring retaliatory air strikes from the government but that the situation is “already getting miserable”.""]",3,"– You are what you reek?

Sixty people in Poland wore the same T-shirt for three nights, and did not use soap, smoke, drink, or ""eat odorous foods"" during the study. Those shirts were then sniffed by 200 lucky volunteers, who were asked to judge the smells based on five personality traits, such as extroversion, neuroticism, and dominance.

244,"['Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Four things you should know about Antarctica \n \n Antarctica is shedding ice at an accelerating rate. \n \n Satellites monitoring the state of the White Continent indicate some 200 billion tonnes a year are now being lost to the ocean as a result of melting. \n \n This is pushing up global sea levels by 0.6mm annually - a three-fold increase since 2012 when the last such assessment was undertaken. \n \n Scientists report the new numbers in the journal Nature. \n \n Governments will need to take account of the information and its accelerating trend as they plan future defences to protect low-lying coastal communities. \n \n The researchers say the losses are occurring predominantly in the West of the continent, where warm waters are getting under and melting the fronts of glaciers that terminate in the ocean. \n \n ""We can\'t say when it started - we didn\'t collect measurements in the sea back then,"" explained Prof Andrew Shepherd, who leads the Ice sheet Mass Balance Inter-comparison Exercise (Imbie). \n \n ""But what we can say is that it\'s too warm for Antarctica today. It\'s about half a degree Celsius warmer than the continent can withstand and it\'s melting about five metres of ice from its base each year, and that\'s what\'s triggering the sea-level contribution that we\'re seeing,"" he told BBC News. \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Andrew Shepherd: ""The study incorporates 24 independent satellite assessments"" \n \n Space agencies have been flying satellites over Antarctica since the early 1990s. Europe, in particular, has an unbroken observation record going back to 1992. \n \n These spacecraft can tell how much ice is present by measuring changes in the height of the ice sheet and the speed at which it moves towards the sea. Specific missions also have the ability to weigh the ice sheet by sensing changes in the pull of gravity as they pass overhead. \n \n Imbie\'s job has been to condense all this information into a single narrative that best describes what is happening on the White Continent. \n \n Glaciologists usually talk of three distinct regions because they behave slightly differently from each other. In West Antarctica, which is dominated by those marine-terminating glaciers, the assessed losses have climbed from 53 billion to 159 billion tonnes per year over the full period from 1992 to 2017. \n \n On the Antarctic Peninsula, the finger of land that points up to South America, the losses have risen from seven billion to 33 billion tonnes annually. This is largely, say scientists, because the floating ice platforms sitting in front of some glaciers have collapsed, allowing the ice behind to flow faster. \n \n East Antarctica, the greater part of the continent, is the only region to have shown some growth. Much of this region essentially sits out of the ocean and collects its snows over time and is not subject to the same melting forces seen elsewhere. But the gains are likely quite small, running at about five billion tonnes per year. \n \n And the Imbie team stresses that the growth cannot counterbalance what is happening in the West and on the Peninsula. Indeed, it is probable that an unusually big dump of snow in the East just before the last assessment in 2012 made Antarctica as a whole look less negative than the reality. \n \n Globally, sea levels are rising by about 3mm a year. This figure is driven by several factors, including the expansion of the oceans as they warm. But what is clear from the latest Imbie assessment is that Antarctica is becoming a significant player. \n \n ""A three-fold increase now puts Antarctica in the frame as one of the largest contributors to sea-level rise,"" said Prof Shepherd, who is affiliated to Leeds University, UK. \n \n ""The last time we looked at the polar ice sheets, Greenland was the dominant contributor. That\'s no longer the case."" \n \n In total, Antarctica has shed some 2.7 trillion tonnes of ice since 1992, corresponding to an increase in global sea level of more than 7.5mm. \n \n Image copyright ESA Image caption Artwork: European satellites in particular have an unbroken record going back to 1992 \n \n The latest edition of the journal Nature has a number of studies looking at the state of the continent and how it might change in a warming world. \n \n One of these papers, led by US and German scientists, examines the possible reaction of the bedrock as the great mass of ice above it thins. It should lift up - something scientists call isostatic readjustment. \n \n New evidence suggests where this process has occurred in the past, it can actually constrain ice losses - as the land rises, it snags on the floating fronts of marine-terminating glaciers. \n \n ""It\'s like applying the brakes on a bike,"" said Dr Pippa Whitehouse from Durham University. ""Friction on the bottom of the ice, which was floating but has now grounded again, slows everything and changes the whole dynamic upstream. We do think the rebound (in the future) will be fast, but not fast enough to stop the retreat we\'ve kicked off with today\'s warming. \n \n ""Ocean warming is going to make the ice too thin for this process to help."" \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Pippa Whitehouse: ""Push a balloon filled with honey - it rebounds when you remove your hand"" \n \n In Imbie\'s last assessment, the contribution of Antarctica to global sea-levels was considered to be tracking at the lower end of the projections that computer simulations had made of the possible height of the oceans at the end of the century. The new assessment sees the contribution track the upper end of these projections. \n \n ""At the moment, we have projections going through to 2100, which is sort of on a lifetime of what we can envisage, and actually the sea-level rise we will see is 50/60cm,"" said Dr Whitehouse. ""And that is not only going to impact people who live close to the coast, but actually when we have storms - the repeat time of major storms and flooding events is going to be exacerbated,"" she told BBC News. \n \n Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos', 'In New Mexico, a photographer declined to take pictures of a lesbian couple’s commitment ceremony. In Washington State, a florist would not provide flowers for a same-sex wedding. And in Colorado, a baker refused to make a cake for a party celebrating the wedding of two men. \n \n The business owners cited religious beliefs in declining to provide services celebrating same-sex relationships. And in each case, they were sued. \n \n Now, as states around the nation weigh how to balance the rights of same-sex couples with those of conservative religious business owners, Gov. Jan Brewer of Arizona must decide whether to sign legislation that would allow business owners to cite religious beliefs as a legal justification for denying service to same-sex couples. \n \n Related Coverage Bill Viewed as Anti-Gay Is Passed in Arizona \n \n The legislation, approved by lawmakers on Thursday, immediately attracted national attention, with conservative religious groups welcoming it as a necessary form of protection for objectors to same-sex marriage, and gay rights groups denouncing it as a license for discrimination. The measure comes at a time when the courts are grappling with how to define the religious rights of private businesses: The Supreme Court is to hear two cases next month in which businesses are seeking exemptions from providing insurance coverage for contraception to their employees, citing the religious beliefs of the companies’ owners. \n \n “In America, people should be free to live and work according to their faith, and the government shouldn’t be able to tell us we can’t do that,” said Joseph E. La Rue, the legal counsel at Alliance Defending Freedom, a Christian legal organization based in Scottsdale, Ariz., that advocates religious liberty and supports the measure passed by the State Legislature. “Faith shouldn’t be something we have to leave inside our house.” \n \n But civil libertarians and gay rights advocates say there is a difference between protections for clergy and houses of worship that do not want to participate in same-sex marriage and the obligations of business owners that serve the general public. \n \n “Religious freedom is a fundamental right, but it’s not a blank check to harm others or impose our faith on our neighbors,” said Daniel Mach, who directs a program on freedom of religion and belief for the American Civil Liberties Union, which opposes the Arizona legislation. “Over the years, we as a nation have rejected efforts to invoke religion to justify discrimination in the marketplace, and there’s no reason to turn back the clock now.” \n \n Ms. Brewer, who has taken no public position on the legislation that will reach her desk next week, is a Republican whose tenure has been punctuated by controversy and political discord over a tough measure on illegal immigrants, which was denounced from the left, and a Medicaid expansion, which was criticized by the right. \n \n Last year she vetoed a similar religious freedom bill, arguing that it was a distraction from priorities lawmakers had yet to address, including the state budget. And there are similar circumstances this year, as legislators have yet to act on a package of proposed changes to the state’s child welfare system, which has been plagued by a slow response to complaints of abuse and neglect. \n \n Chuck Coughlin, a public affairs consultant who led Ms. Brewer’s transition team after she was elected governor in 2009 and has remained a close ally, said he was doubtful that she would sign the bill into law, saying, “We already have laws to sufficiently protect people’s religion freedoms in this country, and this bill could actually empower people to discriminate.” \n \n The bill comes at an awkward time for Ms. Brewer, who has been eager to move beyond controversy in her last year in office (term limits prevent her from running for re-election.) \n \n She has tried to focus on revitalizing the state’s economy, which is struggling in spite of a rebound of the housing market. The state, which was boycotted by some over the immigration measure, is preparing to host next year’s Super Bowl, and some residents worry that the religious freedom measure could again spur a backlash. \n \n In a letter to Ms. Brewer on Friday, Gonzalo A. de la Melena Jr., president and chief executive of the Arizona Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, said the bill, if it becomes law, would “ultimately have the effect of casting Arizona in a negative light that stands to damage our reputation nationwide and globally, and significantly harm our fiscal future.” \n \n It was just one in a chorus of pleas that the governor to veto the legislation. \n \n “It sounds like it’s opening the door to hate and bigotry of all stripes,” said Rocco DiGrazia, a Tucson pizzeria owner, who on Friday attracted national attention via social media because he had posted signs on the restaurant’s doors declaring, “We Reserve the Right to Refuse Service to Arizona Legislators.” \n \n “I make dinner for a living — I’m not a social activist,” Mr. DiGrazia said in a telephone interview. “But I do have a lot of gay customers and employees, and why are you trying to alienate these people?” \n \n But supporters of the legislation said they would also work hard to persuade Ms. Brewer to sign the measure, in part by disputing much of the criticism it has faced. \n \n Most states where same-sex marriage is legal have exemptions for religious organizations, but not for private businesses or individuals, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. The Arizona measure comes as multiple states are considering such exemptions, with considerable controversy. In Tennessee, the legislature is considering an exemption for wedding vendors; in Kansas, a similar measure was set aside when conservative senators raised concerns about discrimination. In Oregon, opponents of same-sex marriage are seeking to place an initiative on this year’s ballot that would allow individuals or businesses to opt out of participating in same-sex wedding ceremonies. \n \n Supporters and opponents of the Arizona legislation do not agree on its potential impact. The supporters say it would simply tweak an existing religious freedom law in Arizona to make it clear that private individuals can use religious freedom as a defense in civil litigation; the opponents say it would allow business owners to discriminate against anyone they do not like, citing religious freedom. \n \n “There is significant fear it will undermine local nondiscrimination laws,” said Sarah Warbelow, the state legislative director for the Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights advocacy organization. “This is not about the freedom of individuals to practice their religion, this is about a license to discriminate against individuals.” \n \n But Josh Kredit, legal counsel of the Center for Arizona Policy, a conservative group that supported the bill, said that Arizona has for years had a religious freedom law that has not been used to justify discrimination, and that the changes to that law made by the new measure are “vitally needed to ensure that in America people are free to live and work according to their faith.” \n \n “Arizona should be known as a state that welcomes people of faith and protects them,” he said. “These are intentional, purposeful distractions to try to kill this bill.”']",2,"– Faced with a 12-year-old girl hanging by an arm from an 80-foot-high bridge, threatening to end her young life, a rookie cop started talking, reports CBS Los Angeles.

Will Connors reports on digits. Photo: AP. \n \n At Research In Motion Ltd., however, that was complicated. The BlackBerry maker had two chief executives. Moreover, their offices were about a 10-minute drive apart. Meetings with both of them present were rare, say former RIM executives and people who dealt with the company. \n \n Many forces have combined to bring RIM to the point of reporting a quarterly operating loss, as is expected on Thursday, but one of them was a split personality in the executive suite, former executives say. As investor pressure mounted at the company recently, one CEO, company founder Mike Lazaridis, was focused on a make-or-break push to launch a next-generation BlackBerry with a new operating system. His co-CEO, Jim Balsillie, started pursuing a separate strategy that envisioned licensing out some of the company\'s proprietary technologies. \n \n Both men are gone from the CEO suite now, replaced in January by former Lazaridis lieutenant Thorsten Heins. He is slashing costs. RIM says it is committed to seeing through the rollout later this year of its next BlackBerry. But Mr. Heins has hired investment bankers to explore options and hasn\'t ruled out a sale of a company, whose stock has tanked nearly 70% in 12 months and pushed its market value, at under $5 billion, to less than one-fifteenth of its peak. \n \n RIM still has a comfortable cash cushion of more than $2 billion, which it said last month is likely to have grown in its fiscal first quarter ended June 2. It also is debt-free, giving it more breathing room to get out its new phone, with an operating system called BlackBerry 10 that RIM says ""sets the standard for reliable, secure mobile computing."" RIM has told its bankers it is focused on that rollout, said a person familiar with the matter. If the phone is a hit, the company will recover some of its lost value, and the new technology will be a boon to any possible sale or partnership in the future, this person said. \n \n According to interviews with more than a dozen former RIM executives and industry executives who worked closely with the company, it was a blinding confidence in the basic BlackBerry product that was at the root of RIM\'s current troubles. Compounding that, as they describe the events, were a drawn-out internal debate over who their core customer was; a series of catch-up products that didn\'t really catch the company up; and tensions within parts of the company. \n \n The bet long made by RIM was that both corporate and individual customers would continue to favor the BlackBerry\'s easy-to-use mobile email over the multiplying features and apps on Apple Inc.\'s iPhone and devices running on Google Inc.\'s Android operating system. When it saw consumers starting to gravitate away from BlackBerrys, RIM moved tentatively. \n \n At one point, RIM worked to challenge the iPhone with telecom carriers that were fearful of Apple\'s dominance. The new models that came out of these collaborations, however, failed to generate iPhone-like buzz. \n \n RIM isn\'t alone in failing to adapt quickly to the transformation of smartphones from devices to talk and email into pocket-size computers. Once-dominant Nokia Corp. has been forced into a partnership with Microsoft Corp. to equip its phones to compete, and is slashing thousands of jobs as its share of the global smartphone market erodes. \n \n At RIM, executives eventually brought in outside talent, but that raised tensions inside the ranks of a company that already harbored separate Lazaridis and Balsillie fiefs, some former RIM executives and executives who have worked with RIM say. According to them, the separate teams sometimes clashed, especially as the onetime smartphone leader slipped further behind. \n \n RIM, in a statement, said the split-personality characterization wasn\'t accurate. ""As with any innovative company there were times when various people within the organization disagreed, but this was not the norm,"" it said. \n \n ""The CEO structure worked well for many years and allowed each of the co-CEOs to focus on their areas of strength,"" RIM added. It said the co-CEOs started out sharing an office, had offices next to each other, and then, ""as RIM grew, they each took offices closest to those areas each supervised in order to stay close to their teams. At all times, they had an efficient, professional working relationship and were in close communication."" \n \n Read More Investors Brace for RIM\'s Results \n \n Mr. Heins, soon after taking over as CEO early this year, put an end to the strategy pursued by one CEO: Mr. Balsillie\'s licensing initiative. RIM said it doesn\'t discuss nonpublic internal deliberations. \n \n Mr. Balsillie has given up his board seat. Mr. Lazaridis remains nonexecutive vice chairman. \n \n ""Successful companies take what they can learn from every situation and use that to push forward,"" Mr. Lazaridis said, noting that he and Mr. Balsillie ""felt it was the right time in RIM\'s life cycle to turn the leadership of the company over to someone else."" Mr. Balsillie didn\'t respond to requests for comment. \n \n RIM didn\'t make Mr. Heins available, citing a quiet period before the earnings release. \n \n RIM essentially invented email on the go. Founded by Mr. Lazaridis in 1984 with a $15,000 loan from his parents, the company grew to a stock-market value of more than $80 billion at its zenith in 2008, controlling about half the U.S. smartphone market. \n \n Enlarge Image Close David Manning/Reuters RRIM CEO Thorsten Heins \n \n RIM hosted lavish banquets for its inventors. To mark milestones, it treated employees to concerts by bands such as U2 and Van Halen. At the company\'s campus of low-slung gray buildings 70 miles from Toronto, employees got free ice cream on ""Frosty Fridays."" \n \n Amid its cost-cutting, RIM isn\'t giving up entirely on ice cream days. ""Ice cream is a relatively low-cost way to build stronger bonds within our team,"" RIM said. \n \n Mr. Balsillie, who came aboard in 1992 after having explored a takeover bid for the company, and Mr. Lazaridis became Canada\'s best-known billionaires, each funneling chunks of wealth to pet projects. Mr. Lazaridis built a theoretical-physics institute. Mr. Balsillie started a school for global governance and tried unsuccessfully to buy three professional hockey teams. \n \n Behind the success was Mr. Lazaridis\'s unrelenting vision for robust engineering and innovation and Mr. Balsillie\'s push for market expansion. But former executives say there was also an aversion at the company to innovations that didn\'t buttress its core strengths: its proprietary network and reputation for security. \n \n At an investor meeting about a decade ago, analysts asked Mr. Lazaridis whether RIM was moving to a color screen, a feature popping up on devices in Asia. ""Do I need to read my email in color?"" he replied, according to Brian Blair, then an analyst with Banc of America Securities. \n \n Enlarge Image Close Mike Cassese/Reuters Former co-CEOs Mike Lazaridis and Jim Balsillie in January \n \n RIM says that at the time, color screens were impractical, with high costs and high battery drain. It says it was among the first to adopt color displays just a few years later. \n \n RIM\'s customers then were overwhelmingly companies, which gave their employees BlackBerrys for email. But a growing number were individuals, often eager for features such as cameras, games and Internet browsing. RIM brought out devices with cameras and MP3 players including the Pearl in 2006 and the Curve in 2007—the year the iPhone came out. \n \n Still, RIM\'s carrier partners worried that the wild popularity of the iPhone could give Apple outsize influence in the market. Executives at Verizon Communications Inc. and Vodafone Group PLC approached RIM to work together on a phone that could compete with the iPhone, say people familiar with the matter. The collaboration resulted in RIM\'s first touch-screen device, the Storm. \n \n ""Vodafone started really rushing around saying, \'Helps us build an innovative competitor to the iPhone,\' "" said Pieter Knook, a Vodafone executive at the time. He said Mr. Lazaridis came up with the Storm\'s marquee innovation, a touch screen that physically clicked. \n \n The Storm ""sold very well,"" but wasn\'t a strong competitor to the iPhone, said Denny Strigl, at the time president of Verizon. \n \n In 2010, AT&T Inc., then Apple\'s exclusive carrier partner, approached RIM about a plan to develop a touch-screen rival to the iPhone, said two former RIM executives. The chief of AT&T\'s mobile division visited RIM\'s research and development team in Waterloo to stress how important it was for AT&T to have a successful BlackBerry product to sell, according to people familiar with the visit. RIM said the objective of the visit was to develop ""a differentiated, unique BlackBerry experience for AT&T customers."" \n \n ""We work with all device makers to bring the best products to market for our customers,"" AT&T said. \n \n A RIM-AT&T collaboration resulted in the BlackBerry Torch, say people familiar with the effort, but it was hobbled by hardware and software shortcomings. \n \n RIM executives also missed some internal warnings. The sales division produced a research report in 2010 on the future of tactile keyboards, the thumb-friendly feature that was a favorite in the early days of the BlackBerry. The report warned that in the era of Apple\'s touch-only devices, keyboards would make up a diminishing share of the market, according to a person familiar with it, who said the warning was ignored. \n \n During a meeting the same year, Mr. Balsillie asked if RIM should be worried about a new trend: consumers bringing their own smartphones to work and asking their employer to let them work on the devices. Some executives said the trend was a threat; a few said they weren\'t worried. Mr. Balsillie went with the latter view, said a person close to the company. RIM said it doesn\'t discuss nonpublic ""internal company deliberations."" \n \n As Apple and Android devices ate into BlackBerry\'s market share, Mr. Lazaridis started looking outside for innovation, bringing in a new marketing team and other top executives. In April 2010 RIM bought QNX Software Systems, a maker of operating systems for cars and medical devices. RIM was readying a tablet to compete with the iPad, and executives decided that they would use QNX to power the device, called the PlayBook. \n \n According to people close to the company, the acquisition stoked tensions between the teams led by Mr. Lazaridis, who was in charge of product development, manufacturing and R&D, and Mr. Balsillie, who ran carrier partnerships, sales and marketing. \n \n The two CEOs met in person fairly regularly, and would send instant messages or call each other to bounce ideas around or get progress reports when they weren\'t in the same room. But as RIM hit trouble, they were more often than not toiling in very different worlds, according to these people, who say the teams reporting up to the two didn\'t communicate effectively if at all. Some projects would go astray before either co-CEO noticed, these people say, and disagreements between the two sides sometimes devolved into shouting matches. \n \n The QNX leadership team reported directly to Mr. Lazaridis, bypassing Mr. Balsillie and other top RIM officers, rankling them, according to people familiar with the situation. \n \n Meanwhile, by late 2011, Mr. Balsillie was deep into his own project, an effort aimed at licensing some of RIM\'s proprietary technology, such as its security network and its popular BBM messaging tool, to outside companies. Some analysts had long suggested such a move to boost revenue and buy the company more time as it readied its new phone. \n \n Mr. Balsillie and a team under him struck licensing agreements with several partners, including carriers, according to people familiar with the effort. The deals would have allowed other smartphone makers and the carriers to use RIM\'s network for a fee. \n \n But by the end of last year, RIM shares were hitting eight-year lows. On Jan. 22, the board, led by Messrs. Lazaridis and Balsillie as co-chairmen, said the two would step aside. They remained big shareholders and each kept a board seat. \n \n Within a week of becoming CEO, Mr. Heins, a Lazaridis lieutenant, scuttled the licensing plan, people familiar with it said. He said he would focus a slimmed-down RIM on rolling out its new BlackBerry phones. \n \n —Anton Troianovski, Jessica E.

That amounts to each of the 52 cheerleaders getting $2,500 per season worked and $400 per photo shoot. The settlement covers the 2012-13 and 2013-14 seasons. New York State Sen. Diane Savino, per the New York Post, cheered the settlement, calling on the NFL to ""develop uniform rules … to ensure that all cheerleaders in every state received the employee pay and protections they deserve."" NFL teams have sought to justify low pay for cheerleaders by saying they're independent contractors, CNN notes. In the case of the Flight Crew, Krystal C.'s suit claimed that cheerleaders were compensated $150 per game and $100 for special appearances. But, when you factor in practices and rehearsals, that pans out to $3.77 per hour. Throw in hair, makeup, and transportation expenses and ""the hourly rate goes below $1.50 an hour,"" says the cheerleaders' attorney.

247,"['Wolff on Media \n \n At home in Beverly Hills, the candidate talks Murdoch, what he\'s reading, how he\'ll redo electoral math and Ari Emanuel\'s offer to script his convention. \n \n The long day is ending for Donald Trump with a pint of vanilla Haagen-Dazs ice cream. We\'re settling in for a late-night chat at his Beverly Hills house, a 5,395-square-foot Colonial mansion directly across from the Beverly Hills Hotel. He\'s here for the final presidential primary, a California coronation of sorts, after rallies in Orange County (where violence broke out and seven people were arrested). He is, as he has been for much of our conversation — and perhaps much of the last year — marveling at his own campaign. ""You looked outside before, you see what\'s going on,"" he boasts about the police surrounding his house, and the Secret Service detail cramming his garage and snaking around the pool at the center of the front drive. And he\'s just returned from a big donor fundraiser in Brentwood for the Republican Party at the home of Tom Barrack, the investor and former Miramax co-owner. ""There had to be over a thousand policeman. They had a neighborhood roped off, four or five blocks away from this beautiful house. Machine guns all over the place."" \n \n One thing to understand about Trump is that, rather unexpectedly, he\'s neither angry nor combative. He may be the most threatening and frightening and menacing presidential candidate in modern life, and yet, in person he\'s almost soothing. His extreme self-satisfaction rubs off. He\'s a New Yorker who actually might be more at home in California (in fact, he says he usually comes to his home here — two buildings on Rodeo Drive — only once a year). Life is sunny. Trump is an optimist — at least about himself. He\'s in easy and relaxed form campaigning here in these final days before the June 7 California primary, even with Hillary Clinton\'s biggest backers and a city that is about half Latino surrounding him. \n \n Earlier in the day, I\'d met with Trump at a taping of ABC\'s Jimmy Kimmel Live! at the El Capitan Theatre on Hollywood Boulevard, where he was the single guest for the evening (musicians The Weeknd and Belly canceled upon learning of his appearance). ""Have you ever seen anything like this?"" he asked. He meant this, the Trump phenomenon. Circumventing any chance that I might dampen the sentiment, he quickly answered his own question: ""No one ever has."" \n \n His son-in-law, New York Observer owner Jared Kushner, married to his daughter Ivanka and also a real estate scion — but clearly a more modest and tempered fellow, a wisp next to his beefsteak father-in-law — offered that they may have reached 100 percent name recognition. In other words, Trump could be the most famous man in the world right now. ""I may be,"" says Trump, almost philosophically, and referencing the many people who have told him they\'ve never seen anything like this. ""Bill O\'Reilly said in his lifetime this is the greatest phenomenon he\'s ever seen."" \n \n That notion is what\'s at the center of this improbable campaign, its own brilliant success. It\'s its main subject — the one you can\'t argue with. You can argue about issues, but you can\'t argue with success. Hence, to Trump, you\'re really foolish to argue with the Trump campaign. ""I\'ve spent $50 million of my own money to go through the primaries. Other people spent $230 million and they came in last. You know what I\'m saying?"" And this provides him the reason to talk endlessly and repetitively about the phenomenon of the campaign. That phenomenon is, of course, Trump himself, about whom Trump spends a lot of time talking in the third person. \n \n You can try, but it\'s hard to resist this admiration for himself. The certainty of it, the enthusiasm for it and the lack of not just doubt, but of any negativity. It\'s all upbeat and positive. The dark, scary, virulent heart of American politics is having the best time anyone has ever had. \n \n Trump at a May 25 rally in Anaheim. Violent clashes between protesters and police followed him through California. \n \n If onstage he calls people names, more privately he has only good, embracing things to say about almost everybody. (For most public people I know, it is the opposite.) He loves everybody. Genuinely seems to love everybody — at least everybody who\'s rich and successful (he doesn\'t really talk about anyone who isn\'t). Expressing love for everybody, for most of us, would clearly seem to be an act. But with Trump, it\'s the name-calling and bluster that might be the act. \n \n I offer that there are quite a number of people in New York, some we know in common, who are puzzled that the generous, eager-to-be-liked and liking-everyone-in-return Donald has morphed into a snarling and reactionary public enemy, at least a liberal enemy. This, I suggest, might be a source of the continuing dialectic — or to some, wishful thinking — that he does not necessarily believe what he says. \n \n I might detect the most mild sort of annoyance here. Trump says it\'s that he just never talked about his beliefs in the past — after all, he wasn\'t a politician. ""Who thought this was going to happen?"" But his larger point seems to be that such a topic — what he says — is a silly thing to focus on. The point is not about politics, or policies, but about how people, about how many people, have responded to him. It\'s too big to ignore the bigness. ""You heard Jimmy announce tonight that I have the most votes in the history of the Republican Party,"" he says by way of explanation for the larger issues at hand — i.e., him. \n \n In a way, what this evening\'s Kimmel show was about was treating Trump\'s positions as though they are, well, Trump\'s positions, qualitatively different than other politicians\' positions. In fact, you might logically see the Kimmel show as a devastating attack on Trump\'s views and claims. Kimmel flat out doesn\'t believe him. That recording of the PR person alleged to be Trump sounding like a PR person? Trump: ""It didn\'t sound like me."" Kimmel: ""No. Sounded like you."" (An exchange repeated similarly several times, with no rancor from either Trump or Kimmel.) ""And oh,"" says Kimmel, ""remember when you liked Hillary?"" Trump: ""I just said I like her. I say I like everybody."" And there was Kimmel, at every opportunity, happily mocking Trump, the overexposed media whore. \n \n The effect is not only not damaging, it\'s fun-loving, comic, even joyous. Kimmel is tickled to have such a good sport to poke fun at, and Trump is tickled that Kimmel is tickled. Everybody\'s in on it. There are no phonies here. Or everybody here is honest about being a phony. Nobody is taking anyone very seriously — forget what might be at stake in a presidential election. If Trump is the subject of the conversation, then Trump is happy. If Kimmel has Trump as a guest, he\'s happy. Everybody\'s happy. (Trump has a staffer take a picture of another picture of Trump when he was previously on the Kimmel show that\'s now hanging on the studio wall.) \n \n It is this media frisson that, with countless other professional and amateur analyzers, I\'m trying to plumb. Surely a big part of the answer lies in the nature of Trump\'s performance, an unself-consciousness so extreme that he has passed through hurdles of humiliation that would have destroyed nearly all others to emerge as though free of a private self. Trump is only fully alive in public. But another aspect is that, differentiating himself from every other candidate, he has a long, intimate relationship with nearly every significant player in the media and, indeed, lavishes copious praise on almost all of them. He may know few people in Washington, and care about them less, but he knows his moguls and where they rank on the modern suck-up-to list. \n \n On Murdoch: ""Rupert is a tremendous guy. I think Rupert [who for several years lived in the Trump building on 59th and Park Avenue in Manhattan] is one of the people I really respect and like. And I think Rupert respects what I\'ve done."" But what about Murdoch\'s grumpy Trump tweets? ""When I got into the world of politics, that was a different realm for me and maybe he felt differently. But I think he respects what I\'ve done and he\'s a tremendous guy and I think we have a very good relationship."" \n \n On Redstone: ""Sumner, well, he\'s had a good run. Good run. Terrible it comes to this, but a good run. He\'d give me anything. Loved me."" \n \n On Leslie Moonves: ""Great guy. The greatest. We\'re on the same page. We think alike."" \n \n These are the bulls of his real party. \n \n The party whips, to strain this metaphor, are the news heads: Roger Ailes at Fox News, Jeff Zucker at CNN (who previously at NBC bought The Apprentice and launched Trump as a national TV star) and Andy Lack, now the head of NBC News. Despite his tweets about the ""dishonest media,"" Trump is lavish in his praise of all of them. I ask him to rate them. ""That\'s an unfair question,"" he says, making a rare grab for politesse. ""I know Jeff very well. I know Roger very well. And, less well, but I think Andy has done a very good job."" \n \n Among his frequent media and now political confidants is WME co-CEO Ari Emanuel — whose brother, Rahm, the mayor of Chicago, was once Obama\'s chief of staff — whom Trump says has offered to take charge of the Trump celebratory convention film. Emanuel and Trump, while at seeming odds politically, might in fact be even better united in a kind of hyper salesmanship. ""He\'s a very good friend of mine,"" says Trump. ""He calls me a lot. I call him a lot and we talk. He\'s very political. Even though he\'s not political, he\'s political. He gets it. You\'re shocked to hear that, right? [About the movie.] But yeah, I might do something with Ari. Does he represent you?"" \n \n Sanders called a Trump win a ""real danger to the entire world"" on May 27. \n \n Trump will turn 70 on June 14, but he shows no sign of fatigue even as our conversation drifts toward 11 p.m. He\'s been at this since either 4 a.m. or 6 a.m. (he offers different times at different moments). ""Today, I\'m up at six in the morning, I\'m meeting some of the biggest people in the world. I then had to give a speech to a big group, then I had to give a speech at 12 to [Dole Food mogul] David Murdock, [real estate magnate] Donald Bren, tremendous guys. Then I had to drive to Anaheim and give a speech in front of thousands of people. Then I came back and did more meetings, then I did a fundraiser tonight, then I did Kimmel. And now you. You\'re not a two-minute interview guy."" \n \n He hands me a water bottle from the refrigerator (it only contains water and about a dozen pints of ice cream), and we walk through the dark house decorated with hotel-like furniture (a four-star rather than a five-star hotel lobby). He reclines, still in his standard boxy suit, tie slightly loosened, with his Haagen-Dazs on an overstuffed couch in the living room (he asks me not to put my water bottle on the fabric-covered ottoman). \n \n If there\'s any pattern to his conversation, it\'s that he\'s vague on all subjects outside himself, his campaign and the media. Everything else is mere distraction. But I press him about Peter Thiel, the Silicon Valley billionaire who, earlier in the day, has admitted to funding the $140 million Hulk Hogan lawsuit against Gawker. Thiel also is his most prominent Silicon Valley backer and will go to the convention in July as a pledged delegate. But Trump needs reminding who he is, and then concludes he must be a friend of his son-in-law Jared. (""Wow, I love him! So he funded it for Hulk Hogan? You think Hulk Hogan would have enough money, but he probably doesn\'t."") Indeed, Trump doesn\'t appear to be interested in Silicon Valley, except to roll off his numbers on each social media platform. (""On Facebook, I have close to 8 million people. On Twitter, I have 8.5 million. On Instagram, I have over a million people. I\'m inching on 20 million people. I have friends, somebody that\'s a great writer, where they write a book and call me up and say, \'Can you do me a favor, can you tweet it?\' "" ""Can you,"" I interject, ""tweet my book, please?"" ""I will!"") \n \n Finishing his pint, he reflects again on the remarkableness of the campaign, asking his traveling staffers, Corey Lewandowski and press secretary Hope Hicks, as well as his son-in-law, to confirm again how remarkable it is. Lewandowski recites the latest polls (as of press time, they show Trump inching to within a few percentage points of Clinton in a head-to-head matchup), and Trump, with something beyond confidence, seems to declare de facto victory. \n \n I broach his problems with women and Hispanics and the common wisdom that he\'ll have to do at least as well with these groups as Mitt Romney did in 2012. The ""pivot"" is the word more politico pros are using to refer to his expected turn to the center. ""Unless,"" I offer, ""you think you can remake the electoral math."" He says he absolutely can. So no pivot. ""It\'ll be different math than they\'ve ever seen."" He is, he says, bigger than anything anyone has ever seen. ""I have a much bigger base than Romney. Romney was a stiff!"" And he\'ll be bigger with the people he\'s bigger with, but also he\'ll be bigger with women and Hispanics and blacks, too. He believes, no matter what positions he holds or slurs he has made, that he is irresistible. \n \n I ask if he sees himself as having similarities with leaders of the growing anti-immigrant (some would say outright racist) European nativist movements, like Marine Le Pen in France and Matteo Salvini in Italy, whom The Wall Street Journal reported Trump had met with and endorsed in Philadelphia. (""Matteo, I wish you become the next Italian premier soon,"" Trump was quoted as saying.) In fact, he insists he didn\'t meet Salvini. ""I didn\'t want to meet him."" And, in sum, he doesn\'t particularly see similarities — or at least isn\'t interested in them — between those movements and the anti-immigrant nationalism he is promoting in this country. \n \n ""And Brexit? Your position?"" I ask. \n \n ""Huh?"" \n \n ""Brexit."" \n \n ""Hmm."" \n \n ""The Brits leaving the EU,"" I prompt, realizing that his lack of familiarity with one of the most pressing issues in Europe is for him no concern nor liability at all. \n \n ""Oh yeah, I think they should leave."" \n \n It is hard not to feel that Trump understands himself, and that we\'re all in on this kind of spectacular joke. His shamelessness is just so … shameless. So how much, I ask — quite thinking he will get the nuance here — is the Trump brand based on exaggeration? He responds, with perfect literalness, none at all. I try again. He must understand. How could he not? ""You\'ve talked about negotiation, which is about compromise and about establishing positions that you can walk back from. How much about being a successful person involves … well, bullshitting? How much of success is playing games?"" \n \n If he does understand, he\'s definitely not taking this bait. I try again: ""How much are you a salesman?"" \n \n Salesman, in the Trump worldview, is hardly a bad word, and he is quite willing to accept it, although, curiously, he doesn\'t want to be thought of that way when it comes to real estate. But as a politician, he\'s OK as a salesman. \n \n Trump says he\'s reading Edward Klein\'s book Unlikeable: The Problem With Hillary. \n \n In this, he sees himself — and becomes almost eloquent in talking about himself — as a sort of performer and voter whisperer. He is, he takes obvious pride in saying, the only politician who doesn\'t regularly use a teleprompter. With a prompter, he says, you can\'t work the crowd. You can\'t feel it. ""You got to look at them in the eye. Have you ever seen me speak in front of a large group of people? Have you ever watched?"" He reflects on the lack of self-consciousness that\'s necessary to make spontaneous utterances before a crowd. He cites a well-known actor (whose name he asks me not to use, ""I don\'t want to hurt anybody""), who had wanted to run for office but, without a script, was a blithering idiot. Trump was never fed lines on The Apprentice, he says. It was all him: ""You have to have a natural ability."" \n \n I ask if he\'ll use a teleprompter for his acceptance speech at the convention and, almost sorrowfully, he says he probably will. I find myself urging him not to, precisely for the theater of it all. The spontaneity. Who would want to miss that? Let Trump be Trump. \n \n ""Very interesting. What he\'s saying is very interesting,"" he notes to Lewandowski. \n \n He\'s punted on Hillary as a topic since we started our conversation, as though to talk about her was not to talk about him. If in public he needs to treat her as his cause, in private he doesn\'t want her taking up his time. But I sneak it back. \n \n ""Did you ever vote for Bill?"" I ask, thinking that both men have as much in common as they have that separates them. \n \n ""Let\'s see … did I ever? Eh, I don\'t want to say who I voted for."" \n \n Indeed. These two \'80s guys were undoubtedly once quite in sync. \n \n The anti-Christ Trump, the Trump of bizarre, outre, impractical and reactionary policies that most reasonable people yet believe will lead to an astounding defeat in November, is really hard to summon from Trump in person. He deflects that person, or, even, dissembles about what that person might have said (as much, he dissembles for conservatives about what the more liberal Trump might have said), and is impatient that anyone might want to focus on that version of Trump. It does then feel that the policies, such as they are, and the slurs, are not him. They are just a means to the end — to the phenomenon. To the center of attention. The biggest thing that has ever happened in politics. In America. The biggest thing is the theme. It\'s what he always wants to come back to. Bigness is unavoidable and inevitable. Bigness always wins. \n \n Before Trump trundles off to bed — actually, before that, never too tired, he plans to watch himself on Kimmel — I ask that de rigeur presidential question, which does not seem yet to have been asked of him. ""What books are you reading?"" \n \n He knows he\'s caught (it\'s a question that all politicians are prepped on, but who among his not-bookish coterie would have prepped him even with the standard GOP politician answer: the Bible?). But he goes for it. \n \n ""I\'m reading the Ed Klein book on Hillary Clinton"" — a particular hatchet job, which at the very least has certainly been digested for him. ""And I\'m reading the book on Richard Nixon that was, well, I\'ll get you the exact information on it. I\'m reading a book that I\'ve read before, it\'s one of my favorite books, All Quiet on the Western Front, which is one of the greatest books of all time."" And one I suspect he\'s suddenly remembering from high school. But what the hell. \n \n Donald Trump simply believes he is a unique individual, one whose singular conviction that he is special makes him appealing. And pay no attention to everything else. \n \n A version of this story first appeared in the June 10 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.

But a State Department official said that the fact the money wasn\'t transferred on Jan. 1 doesn\'t mean it was frozen. ""There are still deliberations taking place, and we have until mid January to decide what we are going to do,” the official said. \n \n The Trump administration has frozen $125 million in funding for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, which provides aid to Palestinian refugees, according to three Western diplomats who were informed of the move. They said the funding, one third of the annual U.S. donations to the agency, was supposed to be transferred by Jan. 1 but was withheld. \n \n The details: The diplomats, who asked to speak on conditions of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter, said the funding was frozen until the Trump administration finishes its review of U.S. aid to the Palestinian Authority. \n \n The move comes after the Palestinian Authority suspended their contacts with the Trump administration in response to its decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. A senior White House official said no decision have been made yet, but confirmed that a review of the U.S. assistance to the Palestinians is underway ""in light of the Palestinians\' recent conduct."" \n \n The diplomats added that U.S. officials told U.N. officials in the last two days that President Trump is considering totally cutting the part of the funding which was frozen, and is even considering cutting up to $180 million, which amounts to half of the U.S. funding to UNRWA. \n \n The impact: The Western diplomats said freezing or cutting of such a big part of the U.S. funding would be catastrophic for the organization, would hamper its work and might lead to negative consequences for the Palestinian refugee camps in Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan and Lebanon. \n \n U.N. secretary general António Guterres has spoken with senior U.S. official about the UNRWA funding and also consulted with foreign ministers from other donor countries, according to the diplomats. \n \n The Israeli security establishment and the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories — the Israeli organization that oversees government activities in the West Bank and Gaza — are concerned about possible freezing or cutting of U.S. funding to UNRWA, fearing the escalation of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. \n \n “The humanitarian situation in Gaza is complicated enough and harming UNRWA funding will only make it more complicated,"" a senior Israeli security official told me. \n \n What we\'re hearing: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is not enthusiastic about the cutting of U.S. funding to UNRWA, but is politically pressed by conservative ministers in his cabinet and by the fact he can\'t be more dovish on the Palestinian issue than President Trump. \n \n Officials in the prime minister\'s office told diplomats from several western countries that Israel does not object to the cutting of U.S. funding to the Palestinian Authority, but prefers that the U.S. doesn\'t cut funding to UNRWA due to the fact it also serves Israeli security interests. \n \n A senior Israeli official told me Netanyahu is in touch with the White House on the UNRWA funding issue, and conveyed the message that Israel prefers “gradual disengagement"" with UNRWA by the U.S. and not a big funding cut. \n \n The prime minister\'s office said in a statement: ""Netanyahu supports President Trump\'s critical attitude towards UNRWA and believes practical steps need to be taken in order to change the fact that UNRWA is being used to entrench the Palestinian refugee problem instead of solving it.""', 'Author and columnist Michael Wolff was given extraordinary access to the Trump administration and now details the feuds, the fights and the alarming chaos he witnessed while reporting what turned into a new book. \n \n Editor’s Note: Author and Hollywood Reporter columnist Michael Wolff’s new book, Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House (Henry Holt & Co.), is a detailed account of the 45th president’s election and first year in office based on extensive access to the White House and more than 200 interviews with Trump and senior staff over a period of 18 months. In advance of the Jan. 9 publication of the book, which Trump is already attacking, Wolff has written this extracted column about his time in the White House based on the reporting included in Fire and Fury. \n \n I interviewed Donald Trump for The Hollywood Reporter in June 2016, and he seemed to have liked — or not disliked — the piece I wrote. ""Great cover!"" his press assistant, Hope Hicks, emailed me after it came out (it was a picture of a belligerent Trump in mirrored sunglasses). After the election, I proposed to him that I come to the White House and report an inside story for later publication — journalistically, as a fly on the wall — which he seemed to misconstrue as a request for a job. No, I said. I\'d like to just watch and write a book. ""A book?"" he responded, losing interest. ""I hear a lot of people want to write books,"" he added, clearly not understanding why anybody would. ""Do you know Ed Klein?""— author of several virulently anti-Hillary books. ""Great guy. I think he should write a book about me."" But sure, Trump seemed to say, knock yourself out. \n \n Since the new White House was often uncertain about what the president meant or did not mean in any given utterance, his non-disapproval became a kind of passport for me to hang around — checking in each week at the Hay-Adams hotel, making appointments with various senior staffers who put my name in the ""system,"" and then wandering across the street to the White House and plunking myself down, day after day, on a West Wing couch. \n \n The West Wing is configured in such a way that the anteroom is quite a thoroughfare — everybody passes by. Assistants — young women in the Trump uniform of short skirts, high boots, long and loose hair — as well as, in situation-comedy proximity, all the new stars of the show: Steve Bannon, Kellyanne Conway, Reince Priebus, Sean Spicer, Jared Kushner, Mike Pence, Gary Cohn, Michael Flynn (and after Flynn\'s abrupt departure less than a month into the job for his involvement in the Russia affair, his replacement, H.R. McMaster), all neatly accessible. \n \n The nature of the comedy, it was soon clear, was that here was a group of ambitious men and women who had reached the pinnacle of power, a high-ranking White House appointment — with the punchline that Donald Trump was president. Their estimable accomplishment of getting to the West Wing risked at any moment becoming farce. \n \n A new president typically surrounds himself with a small group of committed insiders and loyalists. But few on the Trump team knew him very well — most of his advisors had been with him only since the fall. Even his family, now closely gathered around him, seemed nonplussed. ""You know, we never saw that much of him until he got the nomination,"" Eric Trump\'s wife, Lara, told one senior staffer. If much of the country was incredulous, his staff, trying to cement their poker faces, were at least as confused. \n \n Their initial response was to hawkishly defend him — he demanded it — and by defending him they seemed to be defending themselves. Politics is a game, of course, of determined role-playing, but the difficulties of staying in character in the Trump White House became evident almost from the first day. \n \n ""You can\'t make this shit up,"" Sean Spicer, soon to be portrayed as the most hapless man in America, muttered to himself after his tortured press briefing on the first day of the new administration, when he was called to justify the president\'s inaugural crowd numbers — and soon enough, he adopted this as a personal mantra. Reince Priebus, the new chief of staff, had, shortly after the announcement of his appointment in November, started to think he would not last until the inauguration. Then, making it to the White House, he hoped he could last a respectable year, but he quickly scaled back his goal to six months. Kellyanne Conway, who would put a finger-gun to her head in private about Trump\'s public comments, continued to mount an implacable defense on cable television, until she was pulled off the air by others in the White House who, however much the president enjoyed her, found her militancy idiotic. (Even Ivanka and Jared regarded Conway\'s fulsome defenses as cringeworthy.) \n \n Steve Bannon tried to gamely suggest that Trump was mere front man and that he, with plan and purpose and intellect, was, more reasonably, running the show — commanding a whiteboard of policies and initiatives that he claimed to have assembled from Trump\'s off-the-cuff ramblings and utterances. His adoption of the Saturday Night Live sobriquet ""President Bannon"" was less than entirely humorous. Within the first few weeks, even rote conversations with senior staff trying to explain the new White House\'s policies and positions would turn into a body-language ballet of eye-rolling and shrugs and pantomime of jaws dropping. Leaking became the political manifestation of the don\'t-blame-me eye roll. \n \n The surreal sense of the Trump presidency was being lived as intensely inside the White House as out. Trump was, for the people closest to him, the ultimate enigma. He had been elected president, that through-the-eye-of-the-needle feat, but obviously, he was yet … Trump. Indeed, he seemed as confused as anyone to find himself in the White House, even attempting to barricade himself into his bedroom with his own lock over the protests of the Secret Service. \n \n There was some effort to ascribe to Trump magical powers. In an early conversation — half comic, half desperate — Bannon tried to explain him as having a particular kind of Jungian brilliance. Trump, obviously without having read Jung, somehow had access to the collective unconscious of the other half of the country, and, too, a gift for inventing archetypes: Little Marco … Low-Energy Jeb … the Failing New York Times. Everybody in the West Wing tried, with some panic, to explain him, and, sheepishly, their own reason for being here. He\'s intuitive, he gets it, he has a mind-meld with his base. But there was palpable relief, of an Emperor\'s New Clothes sort, when longtime Trump staffer Sam Nunberg — fired by Trump during the campaign but credited with knowing him better than anyone else — came back into the fold and said, widely, ""He\'s just a fucking fool."" \n \n Part of that foolishness was his inability to deal with his own family. In a way, this gave him a human dimension. Even Donald Trump couldn\'t say no to his kids. ""It\'s a littleee, littleee complicated …"" he explained to Priebus about why he needed to give his daughter and son-in-law official jobs. But the effect of their leadership roles was to compound his own boundless inexperience in Washington, creating from the outset frustration and then disbelief and then rage on the part of the professionals in his employ. \n \n The men and women of the West Wing, for all that the media was ridiculing them, actually felt they had a responsibility to the country. ""Trump,"" said one senior Republican, ""turned selfish careerists into patriots."" Their job was to maintain the pretense of relative sanity, even as each individually came to the conclusion that, in generous terms, it was insane to think you could run a White House without experience, organizational structure or a real purpose. \n \n On March 30, after the collapse of the health care bill, 32-year-old Katie Walsh, the deputy chief of staff, the effective administration chief of the West Wing, a stalwart political pro and stellar example of governing craft, walked out. Little more than two months in, she quit. Couldn\'t take it anymore. Nutso. To lose your deputy chief of staff at the get-go would be a sign of crisis in any other administration, but inside an obviously exploding one it was hardly noticed. \n \n While there might be a scary national movement of Trumpers, the reality in the White House was stranger still: There was Jared and Ivanka, Democrats; there was Priebus, a mainstream Republican; and there was Bannon, whose reasonable claim to be the one person actually representing Trumpism so infuriated Trump that Bannon was hopelessly sidelined by April. ""How much influence do you think Steve Bannon has over me? Zero! Zero!"" Trump muttered and stormed. To say that no one was in charge, that there were no guiding principles, not even a working org chart, would again be an understatement. ""What do these people do?"" asked everyone pretty much of everyone else. \n \n The competition to take charge, which, because each side represented an inimical position to the other, became not so much a struggle for leadership, but a near-violent factional war. Jared and Ivanka were against Priebus and Bannon, trying to push both men out. Bannon was against Jared and Ivanka and Priebus, practicing what everybody thought were dark arts against them. Priebus, everybody\'s punching bag, just tried to survive another day. By late spring, the larger political landscape seemed to become almost irrelevant, with everyone focused on the more lethal battles within the White House itself. This included screaming fights in the halls and in front of a bemused Trump in the Oval Office (when he was not the one screaming himself), together with leaks about what Russians your opponents might have been talking to. \n \n Reigning over all of this was Trump, enigma, cipher and disruptor. How to get along with Trump — who veered between a kind of blissed-out pleasure of being in the Oval Office and a deep, childish frustration that he couldn\'t have what he wanted? Here was a man singularly focused on his own needs for instant gratification, be that a hamburger, a segment on Fox & Friends or an Oval Office photo opp. ""I want a win. I want a win. Where\'s my win?"" he would regularly declaim. He was, in words used by almost every member of the senior staff on repeated occasions, ""like a child."" A chronic naysayer, Trump himself stoked constant discord with his daily after-dinner phone calls to his billionaire friends about the disloyalty and incompetence around him. His billionaire friends then shared this with their billionaire friends, creating the endless leaks which the president so furiously railed against. \n \n One of these frequent callers was Rupert Murdoch, who before the election had only ever expressed contempt for Trump. Now Murdoch constantly sought him out, but to his own colleagues, friends and family, continued to derisively ridicule Trump: ""What a fucking moron,"" said Murdoch after one call. \n \n With the Comey firing, the Mueller appointment and murderous White House infighting, by early summer Bannon was engaged in an uninterrupted monologue directed to almost anyone who would listen. It was so caustic, so scabrous and so hilarious that it might form one of the great underground political treatises. \n \n By July, Jared and Ivanka, who had, in less than six months, traversed from socialite couple to royal family to the most powerful people in the world, were now engaged in a desperate dance to save themselves, which mostly involved blaming Trump himself. It was all his idea to fire Comey! ""The daughter,"" Bannon declared, ""will bring down the father."" \n \n Priebus and Spicer were merely counting down to the day — and every day seemed to promise it would be the next day — when they would be out. \n \n And, indeed, suddenly there were the 11 days of Anthony Scaramucci. \n \n Scaramucci, a minor figure in the New York financial world, and quite a ridiculous one, had overnight become Jared and Ivanka\'s solution to all of the White House\'s management and messaging problems. After all, explained the couple, he was good on television and he was from New York — he knew their world. In effect, the couple had hired Scaramucci — as preposterous a hire in West Wing annals as any — to replace Priebus and Bannon and take over running the White House. \n \n There was, after the abrupt Scaramucci meltdown, hardly any effort inside the West Wing to disguise the sense of ludicrousness and anger felt by every member of the senior staff toward Trump\'s family and Trump himself. It became almost a kind of competition to demystify Trump. For Rex Tillerson, he was a moron. For Gary Cohn, he was dumb as shit. For H.R. McMaster, he was a hopeless idiot. For Steve Bannon, he had lost his mind. \n \n Most succinctly, no one expected him to survive Mueller. Whatever the substance of the Russia ""collusion,"" Trump, in the estimation of his senior staff, did not have the discipline to navigate a tough investigation, nor the credibility to attract the caliber of lawyers he would need to help him. (At least nine major law firms had turned down an invitation to represent the president.) \n \n There was more: Everybody was painfully aware of the increasing pace of his repetitions. It used to be inside of 30 minutes he\'d repeat, word-for-word and expression-for-expression, the same three stories — now it was within 10 minutes. Indeed, many of his tweets were the product of his repetitions — he just couldn\'t stop saying something. \n \n By summer\'s end, in something of a historic sweep — more usual for the end of a president\'s first term than the end of his first six months — almost the entire senior staff, save Trump\'s family, had been washed out: Michael Flynn, Katie Walsh, Sean Spicer, Reince Priebus, Steve Bannon. Even Trump\'s loyal, longtime body guard Keith Schiller — for reasons darkly whispered about in the West Wing — was out. Gary Cohn, Dina Powell, Rick Dearborn, all on their way out. The president, on the spur of the moment, appointed John Kelly, a former Marine Corps general and head of homeland security, chief of staff — without Kelly having been informed of his own appointment beforehand. Grim and stoic, accepting that he could not control the president, Kelly seemed compelled by a sense of duty to be, in case of disaster, the adult in the room who might, if needed, stand up to the president … if that is comfort. \n \n As telling, with his daughter and son-in-law sidelined by their legal problems, Hope Hicks, Trump\'s 29-year-old personal aide and confidant, became, practically speaking, his most powerful White House advisor. (With Melania a nonpresence, the staff referred to Ivanka as the ""real wife"" and Hicks as the ""real daughter."") Hicks\' primary function was to tend to the Trump ego, to reassure him, to protect him, to buffer him, to soothe him. It was Hicks who, attentive to his lapses and repetitions, urged him to forgo an interview that was set to open the 60 Minutes fall season. Instead, the interview went to Fox News\' Sean Hannity who, White House insiders happily explained, was willing to supply the questions beforehand. Indeed, the plan was to have all interviewers going forward provide the questions. \n \n As the first year wound down, Trump finally got a bill to sign. The tax bill, his singular accomplishment, was, arguably, quite a reversal of his populist promises, and confirmation of what Mitch McConnell had seen early on as the silver Trump lining: ""He\'ll sign anything we put in front of him."" With new bravado, he was encouraging partisans like Fox News to pursue an anti-Mueller campaign on his behalf. Insiders believed that the only thing saving Mueller from being fired, and the government of the United States from unfathomable implosion, is Trump\'s inability to grasp how much Mueller had on him and his family. \n \n Steve Bannon was openly handicapping a 33.3 percent chance of impeachment, a 33.3 percent chance of resignation in the shadow of the 25th amendment and a 33.3 percent chance that he might limp to the finish line on the strength of liberal arrogance and weakness. \n \n Donald Trump\'s small staff of factotums, advisors and family began, on Jan. 20, 2017, an experience that none of them, by any right or logic, thought they would — or, in many cases, should — have, being part of a Trump presidency. Hoping for the best, with their personal futures as well as the country\'s future depending on it, my indelible impression of talking to them and observing them through much of the first year of his presidency, is that they all — 100 percent — came to believe he was incapable of functioning in his job. \n \n At Mar-a-Lago, just before the new year, a heavily made-up Trump failed to recognize a succession of old friends. \n \n Happy first anniversary of the Trump administration.', ""Amanda Holden leads campaign to stop NHS hospitals secretly burning miscarried foetuses without parents’ knowledge \n \n \n \n Investigation finds thousands of miscarried babies have been incinerated \n \n Uncovered as part of Channel 4 Dispatches programme hosted by actress \n \n Britain's Got Talent host leads campaign after suffering miscarriage in 2010 \n \n Addenbrooke’s Hospital burned 797 foetuses at its 'waste to energy' plant \n \n Actress Amanda Holden, who suffered a miscarriage herself in 2010, and delivered a stillborn son in 2011, is hosting Channel 4's Ending Hospital Heartache \n \n Thousands of miscarried and aborted babies have been incinerated by NHS hospitals without their mothers’ knowledge, an investigation has found. \n \n \n \n The government was forced to ban the practice after it emerged that 15,500 foetal remains have been incinerated by 27 trusts over the last two years alone. \n \n \n \n The bodies are being burned as ‘clinical waste’, while at two trusts they were put into ‘waste-to-energy’ furnaces which generate power for hospitals. \n \n \n \n One devastated mother who suffered a miscarriage was told her child would be ‘incinerated with the rest of the day’s waste’. \n \n \n \n The scandal of how the NHS treats parents who lose a child in early pregnancy was uncovered as part of a Channel 4 Dispatches programme to be broadcast tonight. \n \n \n \n Last night health minister Dan Poulter stepped in to order an immediate ban on incinerating foetal remains. \n \n \n \n ‘This practice is totally unacceptable,’ he said. ‘That is why I have asked Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, NHS medical director, to write to all NHS hospital trusts, to make it clear that it must stop now. \n \n ‘The Chief Medical Officer has also written to the Human Tissue Authority to ask them to make sure that there is clear guidance on this issue. \n \n ‘While the vast majority of hospitals are acting in the appropriate way, that must be the case for all hospitals and the Human Tissue Authority has now been asked to ensure that it acts on this issue without delay.’ \n \n Cathryn Hurley, 35, found out during a 13-week pregnancy scan that her baby had died at eight weeks, and later underwent a medical procedure to remove the foetus. \n \n \n \n She said: ‘I was hysterical.

It\'s massive, it\'s a new system we haven\'t seen before - we need to understand it more completely if we are to predict sea level rise."" \n \n The scientists say the water is prevented from freezing by the large amounts of snow that fall on the surface of the ice sheet late in the summer. \n \n This insulates the water from the air temperatures which are below freezing, allowing the water to persist as liquid all year long. \n \n Other researchers believe this discovery may help explain disparities between projections of mass loss by climate models and observations from satellites. \n \n ""The large mass of liquid water in firn also represents a heat sink that could be playing a role in Greenland\'s interaction with the climate system,"" wrote Dr Joel Harper from the University of Montana, in a comment piece published alongside the study. \n \n ""As the intensity of surface melt in Greenland increases and expands upwards to the higher elevations that are covered by firn, liquid water storage may play an expanding role in the ice sheet\'s future response to climate change."" \n \n Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc.']",5,"– The quotes are so incendiary that some are questioning their veracity. But Axios reports Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House author Michael Wolff has ""dozens of hours"" of tapes to back up statements that appear in the book. And in an excerpt running in the Hollywood Reporter, Wolff (who is the co-founder of Newser) explains just how he got access to them. A June 2016 Hollywood Reporter article may have helped grease things: Hope Hicks emailed Wolff to say Trump was pleased with the cover. Post-election, Wolff says he floated the idea of him coming to the White House ""journalistically, as a fly on the wall"" to gather information for a future book. Trump seemed disinterested in the idea of a book, but ""his non-disapproval became a kind of passport for me to hang around,"" writes Wolff. And so Wolff writes he spent each week at the Hay-Adams hotel, scheduled appointments with senior staffers, and ""plunk[ed] myself down, day after day, on a West Wing couch."" The excerpt shares other tidbits—how the Secret Service protested the president's attempts to lock himself in his bedroom; how Trump's post-dinner calls to billionaire pals spurred leaks; how Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump thought Anthony Scaramucci would be the White House's saving grace—which Trump's lawyer is now trying to block from release. The Washington Post reports Wolff and his publisher, Henry Holt and Co., have been sent a letter that demands they ""immediately cease and desist from any further publication, release, or dissemination of the book"" or any excerpts; the lawyer also wants a copy and says a libel suit is being considered."

She was 99. \n \n Von Trapp died at her home in Vermont on Tuesday, according to her brother Johannes von Trapp. \n \n ""She was a lovely woman who was one of the few truly good people,"" he said. ""There wasn\'t a mean or miserable bone in her body.

She was portrayed as Louisa in the 1959 Broadway musical and a 1965 film, which won the Oscar for best picture. \n \n She was the third child and second-oldest daughter of Austrian Naval Capt. Georg von Trapp and his first wife, Agathe Whitehead von Trapp. Their seven children were the basis for the singing family in the musical and film. \n \n ""The Sound of Music"" was based loosely on a 1949 book by von Trapp\'s second wife, also Maria von Trapp, who died in 1987. It tells the story of an Austrian woman who married a widower with seven children and teaches them music. \n \n In 1938, the family escaped from Nazi-occupied Austria and performed concert tours throughout Europe and then a three-month tour in America. The family settled in Vermont in the early 1940s and opened a ski lodge in Stowe. \n \n Von Trapp played accordion and taught Austrian dance with sister Rosmarie at the lodge. \n \n She wrote in a biography posted on the Trapp Family\'s website that she was born in the Austrian Alps after her family fled fighting from World War I and that she was surrounded by music growing up. \n \n ""Father played the violin, accordion and mandolin. Mother played piano and violin,"" she wrote. ""I have fond memories of our grandmother playing the piano for us after meals."" \n \n Her biography on the website also said that she worked as a lay missionary in Papua, New Guinea. \n \n Rosmarie von Trapp, Johannes von Trapp and Eleonore Von Trapp Campbell were born to Georg von Trapp and Maria von Trapp.', 'Austrian-Inspired Lodging in Beautiful Stowe, VT \n \n A Little of Austria...A Lot of Vermont®!

Maria von Trapp was the third of seven children of Georg von Trapp and his first wife; she was the inspiration for Louisa in the famous musical and film. ""She was a lovely woman who was one of the few truly good people,"" said brother Johannes von Trapp, a son born later to Georg von Trapp and his second wife, also named Maria. ""There wasn't a mean or miserable bone in her body. I think everyone who knew her would agree with that."" After escaping Austria, the von Trapps settled in Stowe, eventually opening a ski lodge, where Maria von Trapp played accordion and taught Austrian dance with a younger sister.

Mother played piano and violin,"" she wrote. ""I have fond memories of our grandmother playing the piano for us after meals."" She also served as a missionary in Papua, New Guinea. The family was fairly long-lived: Maria's older sister, Agathe, died three years ago at age 97."

Lies have oozed out of the White House for more than two centuries and out of politicians’ mouths — out of all people’s mouths — likely as long as there has been human speech. \n \n But amid all those lies, told to ourselves and to one another in order to amass power, woo lovers, hurt enemies and shield ourselves against the often glaring discomfort of reality, humanity has always had an abiding respect for truth. \n \n Support our journalism Become a subscriber today to support editorial writing like this.

Our civilization is premised on the conviction that such a thing as truth exists, that it is knowable, that it is verifiable, that it exists independently of authority or popularity and that at some point — and preferably sooner rather than later — it will prevail. \n \n Even American leaders who lie generally know the difference between their statements and the truth. Richard Nixon said “I am not a crook” but by that point must have seen that he was. Bill Clinton said “I did not have sexual relations with that woman” but knew that he did. \n \n “ He targets the darkness, anger and insecurity that hide in each of us and harnesses them for his own purposes. ” Share this quote \n \n The insult that Donald Trump brings to the equation is an apparent disregard for fact so profound as to suggest that he may not see much practical distinction between lies, if he believes they serve him, and the truth. \n \n His approach succeeds because of his preternaturally deft grasp of his audience. Though he is neither terribly articulate nor a seasoned politician, he has a remarkable instinct for discerning which conspiracy theories in which quasi-news source, or which of his own inner musings, will turn into ratings gold. He targets the darkness, anger and insecurity that hide in each of us and harnesses them for his own purposes. If one of his lies doesn’t work — well, then he lies about that. \n \n If we harbor latent racism or if we fear terror attacks by Muslim extremists, then he elevates a rumor into a public debate: Was Barack Obama born in Kenya, and is he therefore not really president? \n \n An ‘extremely credible source’ has called my office and told me that @BarackObama's birth certificate is a fraud. — Donald J.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 31, 2011 \n \n If his own ego is threatened — if broadcast footage and photos show a smaller-sized crowd at his inauguration than he wanted — then he targets the news media, falsely charging outlets with disseminating “fake news” and insisting, against all evidence, that he has proved his case (“We caught them in a beauty,” he said). \n \n If his attempt to limit the number of Muslim visitors to the U.S. degenerates into an absolute fiasco and a display of his administration’s incompetence, then he falsely asserts that terrorist attacks are underreported. (One case in point offered by the White House was the 2015 attack in San Bernardino, which in fact received intensive worldwide news coverage. The Los Angeles Times won a Pulitzer Prize for its reporting on the subject). \n \n If he detects that his audience may be wearying of his act, or if he worries about a probe into Russian meddling into the election that put him in office, he tweets in the middle of the night the astonishingly absurd claim that President Obama tapped his phones. And when evidence fails to support him he dispatches his aides to explain that by “phone tapping” he obviously didn’t mean phone tapping. Instead of backing down when confronted with reality, he insists that his rebutted assertions will be vindicated as true at some point in the future. \n \n Trump’s easy embrace of untruth can sometimes be entertaining, in the vein of a Moammar Kadafi speech to the United Nations or the self-serving blathering of a 6-year-old. \n \n “ He gives every indication that he is as much the gullible tool of liars as he is the liar in chief. ” Share this quote \n \n But he is not merely amusing. He is dangerous. His choice of falsehoods and his method of spewing them — often in tweets, as if he spent his days and nights glued to his bedside radio and was periodically set off by some drivel uttered by a talk show host who repeated something he’d read on some fringe blog — are a clue to Trump’s thought processes and perhaps his lack of agency. He gives every indication that he is as much the gullible tool of liars as he is the liar in chief. \n \n He has made himself the stooge, the mark, for every crazy blogger, political quack, racial theorist, foreign leader or nutcase peddling a story that he might repackage to his benefit as a tweet, an appointment, an executive order or a policy. He is a stranger to the concept of verification, the insistence on evidence and the standards of proof that apply in a courtroom or a medical lab — and that ought to prevail in the White House. \n \n There have always been those who accept the intellectually bankrupt notion that people are entitled to invent their own facts — consider the “9/11 was an inside job” trope — but Trump’s ascent marks the first time that the culture of alternative reality has made its home at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. \n \n If Americans are unsure which Trump they have — the Machiavellian negotiator who lies to manipulate simpler minds, or one of those simpler minds himself — does it really matter? In either case he puts the nation in danger by undermining the role of truth in public discourse and policymaking, as well as the notion of truth being verifiable and mutually intelligible. \n \n In the months ahead, Trump will bring his embrace of alternative facts on the nation’s behalf into talks with China, North Korea or any number of powers with interests counter to ours and that constitute an existential threat. At home, Trump now becomes the embodiment of the populist notion (with roots planted at least as deeply in the Left as the Right) that verifiable truth is merely a concept invented by fusty intellectuals, and that popular leaders can provide some equally valid substitute. We’ve seen people like that before, and we have a name for them: demagogues. \n \n Our civilization is defined in part by the disciplines — science, law, journalism — that have developed systematic methods to arrive at the truth.

The Times called him unprepared and unsuited for the job he was seeking, and said his election would be a “catastrophe.” \n \n Still, nothing prepared us for the magnitude of this train wreck. Like millions of other Americans, we clung to a slim hope that the new president would turn out to be all noise and bluster, or that the people around him in the White House would act as a check on his worst instincts, or that he would be sobered and transformed by the awesome responsibilities of office. \n \n Instead, seventy-some days in — and with about 1,400 to go before his term is completed — it is increasingly clear that those hopes were misplaced. \n \n Support our journalism Become a subscriber today to support editorial writing like this. Start getting full access to our signature journalism for just 99 cents for the first four weeks. \n \n In a matter of weeks, President Trump has taken dozens of real-life steps that, if they are not reversed, will rip families apart, foul rivers and pollute the air, intensify the calamitous effects of climate change and profoundly weaken the system of American public education for all. \n \n His attempt to de-insure millions of people who had finally received healthcare coverage and, along the way, enact a massive transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich has been put on hold for the moment. But he is proceeding with his efforts to defang the government’s regulatory agencies and bloat the Pentagon’s budget even as he supposedly retreats from the global stage. \n \n “ It is impossible to know where his presidency will lead or how much damage he will do to our nation. ” Share this quote \n \n These are immensely dangerous developments which threaten to weaken this country’s moral standing in the world, imperil the planet and reverse years of slow but steady gains by marginalized or impoverished Americans. But, chilling as they are, these radically wrongheaded policy choices are not, in fact, the most frightening aspect of the Trump presidency. \n \n What is most worrisome about Trump is Trump himself. He is a man so unpredictable, so reckless, so petulant, so full of blind self-regard, so untethered to reality that it is impossible to know where his presidency will lead or how much damage he will do to our nation. His obsession with his own fame, wealth and success, his determination to vanquish enemies real and imagined, his craving for adulation — these traits were, of course, at the very heart of his scorched-earth outsider campaign; indeed, some of them helped get him elected. But in a real presidency in which he wields unimaginable power, they are nothing short of disastrous. \n \n Although his policies are, for the most part, variations on classic Republican positions (many of which would have been undertaken by a President Ted Cruz or a President Marco Rubio), they become far more dangerous in the hands of this imprudent and erratic man. Many Republicans, for instance, support tighter border security and a tougher response to illegal immigration, but Trump’s cockamamie border wall, his impracticable campaign promise to deport all 11 million people living in the country illegally and his blithe disregard for the effect of such proposals on the U.S. relationship with Mexico turn a very bad policy into an appalling one. \n \n In the days ahead, The Times editorial board will look more closely at the new president, with a special attention to three troubling traits: \n \n 1Trump’s shocking lack of respect for those fundamental rules and institutions on which our government is based. Since Jan. 20, he has repeatedly disparaged and challenged those entities that have threatened his agenda, stoking public distrust of essential institutions in a way that undermines faith in American democracy. He has questioned the qualifications of judges and the integrity of their decisions, rather than acknowledging that even the president must submit to the rule of law. He has clashed with his own intelligence agencies, demeaned government workers and questioned the credibility of the electoral system and the Federal Reserve. He has lashed out at journalists, declaring them “enemies of the people,” rather than defending the importance of a critical, independent free press. His contempt for the rule of law and the norms of government are palpable. \n \n 2His utter lack of regard for truth. Whether it is the easily disprovable boasts about the size of his inauguration crowd or his unsubstantiated assertion that Barack Obama bugged Trump Tower, the new president regularly muddies the waters of fact and fiction. It’s difficult to know whether he actually can’t distinguish the real from the unreal — or whether he intentionally conflates the two to befuddle voters, deflect criticism and undermine the very idea of objective truth. Whatever the explanation, he is encouraging Americans to reject facts, to disrespect science, documents, nonpartisanship and the mainstream media — and instead to simply take positions on the basis of ideology and preconceived notions. This is a recipe for a divided country in which differences grow deeper and rational compromise becomes impossible. \n \n 3His scary willingness to repeat alt-right conspiracy theories, racist memes and crackpot, out-of-the-mainstream ideas. Again, it is not clear whether he believes them or merely uses them. But to cling to disproven “alternative” facts; to retweet racists; to make unverifiable or false statements about rigged elections and fraudulent voters; to buy into discredited conspiracy theories first floated on fringe websites and in supermarket tabloids — these are all of a piece with the Barack Obama birther claptrap that Trump was peddling years ago and which brought him to political prominence. It is deeply alarming that a president would lend the credibility of his office to ideas that have been rightly rejected by politicians from both major political parties. \n \n Where will this end? Will Trump moderate his crazier campaign positions as time passes? Or will he provoke confrontation with Iran, North Korea or China, or disobey a judge’s order or order a soldier to violate the Constitution? Or, alternately, will the system itself — the Constitution, the courts, the permanent bureaucracy, the Congress, the Democrats, the marchers in the streets — protect us from him as he alienates more and more allies at home and abroad, steps on his own message and creates chaos at the expense of his ability to accomplish his goals? Already, Trump’s job approval rating has been hovering in the mid-30s, according to Gallup, a shockingly low level of support for a new president. And that was before his former national security advisor, Michael Flynn, offered to cooperate last week with congressional investigators looking into the connection between the Russian government and the Trump campaign. \n \n “ Those who oppose the new president’s reckless and heartless agenda must make their voices heard. ” Share this quote \n \n On Inauguration Day, we wrote on this page that it was not yet time to declare a state of “wholesale panic” or to call for blanket “non-cooperation” with the Trump administration. Despite plenty of dispiriting signals, that is still our view. The role of the rational opposition is to stand up for the rule of law, the electoral process, the peaceful transfer of power and the role of institutions; we should not underestimate the resiliency of a system in which laws are greater than individuals and voters are as powerful as presidents. This nation survived Andrew Jackson and Richard Nixon. It survived slavery. It survived devastating wars. Most likely, it will survive again. \n \n But if it is to do so, those who oppose the new president’s reckless and heartless agenda must make their voices heard. Protesters must raise their banners. Voters must turn out for elections. Members of Congress — including and especially Republicans — must find the political courage to stand up to Trump. Courts must safeguard the Constitution. State legislators must pass laws to protect their citizens and their policies from federal meddling. All of us who are in the business of holding leaders accountable must redouble our efforts to defend the truth from his cynical assaults. \n \n The United States is not a perfect country, and it has a great distance to go before it fully achieves its goals of liberty and equality. But preserving what works and defending the rules and values on which democracy depends are a shared responsibility. Everybody has a role to play in this drama. \n \n This is the first in a series.', ""OUT OF THIS WORLD | What's Up In Space - a weekly look at the biggest news coming down to Earth from space \n \n Bright solar flare brings promise of auroras across Canada \n \n Find Your Forecast Search for a location \n \n Scott Sutherland \n \n Meteorologist/Science Writer \n \n Sunday, July 16, 2017, 2:16 PM - A bright solar flare has exploded on the Sun, throwing out an immense cloud of solar particles into space. With part of this cloud having reached us Sunday morning, aurora watchers are anticipating a great show on Sunday night! \n \n This story has been updated. \n \n \n \n The Sun has continued its quiet progress towards solar minimum - the point in its 11 year cycle where it exhibits the lowest levels of sunspot activity - but on the way there, it can still produce a few surprises. \n \n On Thursday night (early Friday morning, UTC), the larger of two sunspots currently visible on the Earthward side of the Sun blasted out a bright M2-class solar flare. \n \n \n \n Three views of sunspot AR2665, from around 5:00 UTC Friday, July 14, 2017, during the peak of the solar flare. The top frame shows the sunspot itself, while the bottom frames show off the coronal loops surrounding the sunspot (in gold, on the left) and the intense release of energy (in green, on the right). Credit: NASA/SDO/Scott Sutherland \n \n At the same time as the solar flare was blasting out X-rays, which caused a minor radio blackout over parts of Asia, it also released a massive cloud of solar particles - what's known as a coronal mass ejection. \n \n This coronal mass ejection is mostly aimed ahead of Earth's orbital path, and thus the vast majority of it will miss us. As the cloud expands out into space, however, one end of it is projected to sweep past Earth. \n \n \n \n \n \n Even as this swath of solar particles washes past us, much of it will simply be diverted around the planet, due to the protective effects of Earth's magnetic field. A significant portion of them, though, will become snagged within the field lines, and then funneled down into the upper atmosphere near the planet's poles, to produce bright auroras. \n \n RELATED: What is Light Pollution and how does it affect Canadians? \n \n Currently, NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is reporting that the Earth-directed portion of the coronal mass ejection arrived earlier than expected. By their observations, we were already seeing G2 (moderate) geomagnetic storm levels as of mid-morning Sunday, and these are expected to persist throughout the afternoon. \n \n \n \n This evening, storm levels are predicted to diminish slightly - to G1 (minor) geomagnetic storm levels - and then jump back up to G2 storm strength between 8 p.m. to 2 a.m. EDT. Afterwards, activity is expected to ramp down to sub-storm levels by Monday morning. \n \n Based on all of this activity, auroras are expected to stretch down over most of Canada and the northern United States tonight, and likely visible as far south as between the Kp=5 (green) and Kp=7 (yellow) lines on the map below. \n \n There is also a chance, during all of this G2 geomagnetic storm activity, that levels could briefly jump as high as G3 (strong), which would push visibility down over the Kp=7 line. \n \n \n \n Remember that it takes reasonably clear and dark skies to see the auroras, far from the light pollution cast by urban environments. Auroras are also notorious for being random and flighty. Sometimes they can appear faint, only to be seen with long-exposure photography, while other times they can be bright and vibrant to the naked eye, and they can appear and disappear quite suddenly. \n \n \n \n If you plan on getting out to watch, choose your location carefully and be safe. In most regions of the country, simply getting outside of your local community is typically good enough. For those living in southwestern Ontario and the GTA, areas north of Stratford, Guelph and Orangeville tend to be good for viewing, as are those areas to the east of Lake Simcoe and north of Peterborough (the shores of Georgian Bay usually provide excellent viewing!). \n \n \n \n Provincial parks are an excellent resource for skywatching, even if you have to stick to the parking lot at night. \n \n As always with these events, give your eyes some time to adjust to the dark - 30-40 minutes typically - or you will likely miss out on it. Avoid all bright sources of light - streetlights, car headlights, cellphone screens & camera flashes, etc - during that time, then look up and to the north to potentially see the auroras. \n \n \n \n Sources: NOAA | spaceweather.com | teaser image courtesy Team Tanner \n \n \n \n Watch Below: Theresa and Darlene Tanner relate their experiences with the Northern Lights and how they take such amazing photographs""]",3,"– It's not unusual for newspaper editorials to criticize a president's policies. But the editorial board at the Los Angeles Times is taking the concept to a new level with a multi-part series called ""Our Dishonest President."" Part one on Sunday issued a warning that President Trump is ""so unpredictable, so reckless, so petulant, so full of blind self-regard, so untethered to reality that it is impossible to know where his presidency will lead or how much damage he will do to our nation."" Those traits may have helped him get elected as an ""outsider,"" but hopes that they would be reined in once he entered the White House are fading. The editorial ends with a plea for voters, protesters, members of Congress, state legislators, the courts, the media, etc., to be vigilant about protecting America from its own president. On Monday, part two focuses on Trump's capacity to lie. Plenty of politicians lie, of course, but what Trump ""brings to the equation is an apparent disregard for fact so profound as to suggest that he may not see much practical distinction between lies, if he believes they serve him, and the truth."" What makes this especially dangerous is that Trump repeats the lies of others, even crackpots. ""He gives every indication that he is as much the gullible tool of liars as he is the liar in chief."" Verification seems to be a foreign concept to Trump, but it can't be for everyone else, write the editors, who close with advice: ""Investigate. Read. Write. Listen. Speak. Think. ... Be suspicious of those who confuse reality with reality TV, and those who repeat falsehoods while insisting, against all evidence, that they are true. To defend freedom, demand fact."" Read part one and part two."
