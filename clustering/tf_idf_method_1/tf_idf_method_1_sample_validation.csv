It is intended “to mitigate risks of unauthorized disclosures of intelligence-related matters that may result from such contacts.” See Intelligence Community Directive 119, Media Contacts, March 20, 2014. \n \n Significantly, however, the new prohibition does not distinguish between classified and unclassified intelligence information. The “covered matters” that require prior authorization before an employee may discuss them with a reporter extend to any topic that is “related” to intelligence, irrespective of its classification status. \n \n The Directive prohibits unauthorized “contact with the media about intelligence-related information, including intelligence sources, methods, activities, and judgments (hereafter, ‘covered matters’).” \n \n If an employee’s contact with the media involves an unauthorized disclosure of classified information, then he could be subject to criminal prosecution. But even if classified information were not communicated to the reporter, the Directive indicates, violation of the new policy “at a minimum… will be handled in the same manner as a security violation.” \n \n “IC employees who are found to be in violation of this IC policy may be subject to administrative actions that may include revocation of security clearance or termination of employment,” the Directive states. \n \n The new Directive creates an anomalous situation in which routine interactions that are permissible between an intelligence employee and an ordinary member of the public are now to be prohibited if that member of the public qualifies as “media.” \n \n So under most circumstances, an intelligence community employee is at liberty to discuss unclassified “intelligence-related information” with his or her next-door neighbor. But if the neighbor happened to be a member of the media, then the contact would be prohibited altogether without prior authorization. \n \n Meanwhile, the Directive defines membership in “the media” expansively. It is not necessary to be a credentialed reporter for an established news organization. It is sufficient to be “any person… engaged in the collection, production, or dissemination to the public of information in any form related to topics of national security….” \n \n Moreover, even approved contacts are to be formally documented for future review. “IC elements should ensure their records on media contacts are sufficient to support executive and legislative branch oversight requirements.” \n \n Essentially, the Directive seeks to ensure that the only contacts that occur between intelligence community employees and the press are those that have been approved in advance. Henceforward, the only news about intelligence is to be authorized news. \n \n The IC policy bears some resemblance to a proposal that was advanced by the Senate Intelligence Committee in 2012, and then withdrawn in response to widespread criticism. \n \n The Senate’s initial version of the FY2012 intelligence authorization act (Section 506) would have required that only specifically designated officials would be permitted to provide “background or off-the-record information regarding intelligence activities to the media.” \n \n That provision would “lead to a less-informed debate on national security issues, by prohibiting nearly all intelligence agency employees from providing briefings to the press, unless those employees give their names and provide the briefing on the record,” said Sen. Ron Wyden at the time. \n \n “I haven’t seen any evidence that prohibiting the intelligence agencies from providing these briefings would benefit national security in any way, so I see no reason to limit the flow of information in this manner,” he said then. \n \n Likewise, there is no particular reason to think that routine interactions between intelligence agency employees and reporters — especially on unclassified matters — pose any kind of threat to national security, or that limiting them will offer any benefit. However, the new policy is likely to be effective in reducing the quality, independence and critical content of intelligence-related information that is available to the press and the public. \n \n “I think we are going to make headway over the next few weeks on media leaks,” said outgoing National Security Agency Director Gen. Keith Alexander at an event on March 4. At the time, it was unclear what he was referring to, but he might have had the March 20 Intelligence Community Directive 119 in mind.']",3,"– The Colorado Rockies love their All-Star shortstop Troy Tulowitzki so much that at last night's game the team gave out 15,000 replica jerseys—emblazoned with his name spelled as Tulowizki.

2,"['A CAR park in a Highland town has been confirmed by archaeologists as the meeting place of a medieval Norse parliament. \n \n Excavations at the Cromartie Memorial car park in Dingwall uncovered evidence of a mound that archaeologists believe was established in the 11th century as a gathering spot for a Viking parliament, known as a “Thing”. \n \n Picture: Contributed \n \n When it was constructed the “Thing” would have been on a man-made islet in the estuary of the River Pefferey, historians claimed. They believe the mound was built on the instructions of Thorfinn the Mighty, a powerful Viking earl who died in 1065. \n \n He is thought to have laid the foundations of what would later become the royal burgh of Dingwall in Ross-shire. \n \n It is only the second time a “Thing” site has been uncovered in the UK. Yesterday historians said the discovery would help them learn more about the Norse Vikings, who battled for control of land across the north of Scotland. \n \n David MacDonald, of Dingwall History Society, which was part of the dig partnership, said that a road, a ditch and an aqueduct, known as the Water of Dyke, that drew water from hillside springs, were also constructed when Thorfinn was in control of Ross-shire. \n \n He said Thorfinn’s rise to power was aided by his victory in a battle at Torfnes on the south side of the Cromarty Firth, possibly against MacBeth’s troops. At the height of his power, Thorfinn became Lord of Caithness, Shetland and Orkney. \n \n The origins of the town of Dingwall as a Viking Thing-site had long puzzled historians and archaeologists alike, with many believing it was elsewhere on the Black Isle in Ross-shire. \n \n But now the results of the archaeological dig, the culmination of Highland Council’s participation as a partner in the EU Northern Periphery International Thing Project, has come up with real answers. \n \n Mr MacDonald said: “You can call this the official confirmation of the car park being the location of a ‘Thing’. \n \n “It has been very exciting over the years, but all the historical research points in this direction.” \n \n In recent times historical investigation identified the Cromartie car park – which contains the burial place and memorial monument of George, first earl of Cromartie, who died in 1714 – as the site of the long lost Moothill of Dingwall, the town’s medieval meeting place. This has now been confirmed as deriving from the Viking Thing-mound. \n \n A trial trench excavation in the car park in 2012 showed significant radio-carbon datings. \n \n According to archaeologist Dr Oliver O’Grady, a leading authority on the assembly mounds of Scotland, who was part of the dig : “The excavations have confirmed the presence of important archaeological remains and indicated that the mound was man-made and probably created during the 11th century. \n \n “The radio-carbon datings provide strong scientific evidence to support the interpretation that the mound was created during the period of late Norwegian political influence in Ross-shire and wider North-east Scotland. \n \n “The lack of substantial occupation remains or burial activity is also further circumstantial evidence that the mound was created for an assembly site or Thing. \n \n “The substantial manpower and effort required to create a monument on the scale of the Dingwall mound would also seem in keeping with the establishment of a major regional judicial and administrative centre.” \n \n Dingwall, which lies at the head of the Cromarty Firth, is a location on a European tourist trail of Thing sites. Funded by the EU, the Thing Sites GeoTour involves Scotland, Norway, Iceland, the Faroes and Isle of Man.', 'A parking lot in Scotland was once the site of a Viking parliament, new research suggests \n \n A Viking parliamentary site that dates to the 11th century has been found beneath a parking lot in Scotland. \n \n The site, located in the town of Dingwall, Scotland, was dubbed a ""Thing"" site, referring to its name in antiquity. Like other Thing sites, this one was likely a place where ancient Norsemen gathered to settle legal disputes, uphold laws and make key political decisions. \n \n ""It\'s a fantastic find, really,"" said Oliver J. T. O\'Grady, the director of the site\'s excavations and an archaeologist who runs an archaeological consulting firm called OJT Heritage. ""No one\'s had dating [information] from a Thing site in Scotland."" \n \n The Thing \n \n Historians had long wondered whether Dingwall was a site of a Viking parliamentary gathering known as the Thing because the word Dingwall probably originated from the word thingvellir, which means ""the field of the assembly."" [Fierce Fighters: 7 Secrets of Viking Culture] \n \n Such Thing sites are scattered from Iceland to Norway to the Shetland Islands, and Norsemen traveled from far and wide to get to the seasonal gatherings, often to settle disputes that would otherwise end in bloodshed. But Things were held mostly at open-air fields, and people only stayed temporarily, leaving relatively few archaeological traces of their presence. \n \n ""Many archaeologists have said, \'How do you find the archaeology of a bunch of people gathering together?\'"" O\'Grady told LiveScience. \n \n O\'Grady and his colleagues at The Thing Project, which works on similar sites around Europe, were not deterred, because traces of temporary dwelling booths had turned up at other Thing sites. \n \n Digging up democracy \n \n Using historical records, the team found a mound near the inlet of an estuary in Dingwall that was called the moothill, or assembly mound, in the 13th century. Later on, Scottish earls were buried there. In 1947, local authorities bulldozed the top of the mound and turned the area into a parking lot. (Parking lots seem to be rich sources of history in the U.K. — Richard III\'s skeleton was found underneath a parking lot, as was a medieval knight in Scotland.) \n \n The team dug a small trench across the mound and used radioactive carbon isotopes, or atoms of carbon with different molecular weights, to date the charcoal found in the soil. (These radioactive isotopes decay at different rates and can be used to date soils and objects.) \n \n The team found that some of the upper layers of the soil date to the medieval period, likely when it was called the moothill, and contain shards of pottery and fragments of an iron vessel. \n \n A site in Dingwall, Scotland, revealed traces of a 13th century iron vessel underneath a parking lot. Credit: Dr. Oliver J. T. O\'Grady \n \n But below that, the team found the first layers that were used to construct the mound, with soil dating to around the 11th century. \n \n By this period of history, the Vikings were no longer feared marauders sailing the seas and raiding Europe. Instead, the people who gathered at Dingwall were more likely subjects of Norse kings who ruled from the Orkney and Shetland Islands. \n \n No one knows yet who built the site, though the sheer size of the mound suggests it was a fairly significant undertaking that required a lot of political power and resources. \n \n No historical documents mention a Thing gathering site near the region, but Earl Thorfinn the Mighty came down from the Orkney Islands at the time and fought a battle in the general region. \n \n ""He would certainly have had a political reason to make a statement,"" O\'Grady said. \n \n Follow Tia Ghose on Twitter and Google+.

Original article on LiveScience.', 'The candidates at presidential debates come and go, but there are a handful of stock expressions and phrases that persist. These range from classic dodges to \'tried and true ways to help yourself get out of a hole.\' Keep score. \n \n Presidential debates can be interesting and informative. But the language of the debates, and the media/political world’s reaction to them, leans on a surprisingly small handful of stock expressions and phrases. \n \n With the long-awaited first Republican debate on Thursday, we thought we’d explain what we’ll almost certainly hear during and after this debate, as well as in future debates. \n \n One maxim for politicians – especially in debates – is that you don’t always answer the question that you were asked; you respond to the one that you want asked. So get ready to hear “The question we should be asking…,” in the manner of Democrat John Edwards in 2007, when he was queried about whether he considered Russia a friend or a foe. After a perfunctory nonanswer, he honed in on what he wanted to talk about: “I think the question we should be asking ourselves is, how does American change the underlying dynamic of what’s happening in the world? … I think for that to occur, the world has to see America as a force for good again, which is why I talked about leading an effort to make primary-school education available to 100 million children in the world who don’t have it.” \n \n This pivot happens so often in debates that there’s a name for it: the “clubhouse turn.” Northeastern University journalism professor Alan Schroeder, author of several books on presidential debates, traces the phrase’s origin to Michael Sheehan, a debate coach for Bill Clinton and other Democrats. “ ‘Clubhouse turn’ strikes me as a particularly appropriate metaphor to apply to debates, since this is a genre with other parallels to horse racing,” Schroeder said. \n \n Another debate maxim is to trivialize unwanted topics by seeking to regain the rhetorical high ground. Hence the popularity of the term “distraction from the real issues.” Lobbyist Jim Manley, a former spokesman for Democratic Sens. Ted Kennedy and Harry Reid, calls it “a tried-and-true way to help yourselves get out of the hole and on the offensive.” \n \n Debaters may despise their opponents, but the trick is to avoid seeming petty. That means invoking “with all due respect …” as a preface to leveling criticism, with the perfunctory pretense of appearing fair-minded. It’s the political version of the Southern phrase “bless your heart.” As humorist Dave Barry once wrote in his mock language column: “It is correctly used to “soften the blow” when you wish to criticize someone in a diplomatic and nonjudgmental manner, as in: ‘With all due respect, you are much worse than Hitler,’ or ‘No disrespect intended, but you have the intelligence of a macaroon.’ ’’ \n \n Debates are mostly remembered for their ""zingers,"" the supposedly spontaneous clever one-liners that can shift momentum toward the candidates who utter them. Former Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas is probably best remembered for telling Republican Dan Quayle in the 1988 vice-presidential debate, “You’re no Jack Kennedy.” In the Internet age, though, it can be difficult to get in a well-executed zinger, as journalists are constantly watching for scripted talking points. \n \n Also a typical part of any debate is the ""hypothetical,"" the common reporters’ tactic for trying to get politicians to say something newsworthy. Most politicians, in general, duck legitimate questions by dismissing them as hypothetical. “They even seem to want credit for maintaining high standards by keeping this virus from corrupting the political discussion,” political journalist Michael Kinsley once wrote. But in debates, they’re often inescapable. The last round of GOP gatherings is still noteworthy for the 2011 question that asked candidates whether they would reject a hypothetical deal that cut $10 from the budget deficit for every $1 in tax increases; every candidate raised their hands. \n \n Of course, debate observers will obsess over whether any candidate’s performance is so momentous that it’s a ""game-changer."" That phrase’s now-common usage irks some academics looking for less simplistic explanations of how elections are decided. \n \n “When it’s used to label events, it’s used very freely, generally with no empirical basis,” said Bethany Albertson, a University of Texas political scientist who studies political attitudes and persuasion. “I guess pundits are incentivized to use the language because it makes whatever happened sound hugely important, but there’s no check on its use.” \n \n Chuck McCutcheon and David Mark write their ""Speaking Politics"" blog exclusively for Politics Voices.']",3,"– Archaeologists have uncovered another parking lot find, only this time it's in Scotland, and what they discovered is best described as a ""Thing."" Yep, that's the technical term for a Viking parliamentary gathering site, one of which has been unearthed in the town of Dingwall. That name had long clued archaeologists into the potential for such a find: Dingwall is likely derived from the word thingvellir, or ""the field of the assembly,"" LiveScience reports. But finding a ""Thing"" site is no small task, in part because the gatherings usually occurred in open fields, and the temporary nature of them meant only modest traces of human life were left behind. Indeed, this is only the second ""Thing"" found in the UK, the Scotsman reports. It was uncovered after the team used historical records to identify a mound that had once been called the ""assembly mound""; a parking lot now covers it. Excavations ""indicated that the mound was man-made,"" likely in the 11th century, says site director Oliver JT O'Grady, and ""radio-carbon datings provide strong scientific evidence to support the interpretation that the mound was created during the period of late Norwegian political influence in Ross-shire and wider."" He and his team aren't exactly sure who built the site, but based on its size, that creator would have needed both ""political power and resources,"" explains LiveScience. One guess: Thorfinn the Mighty, who fought a battle in the area around that time. (In less positive Viking news, ancient jewels were stolen this week.)"

Schumer of New York into his office with news that would stun Washington the next morning: Mr. Reid planned to retire at the end of his term. \n \n Mr. Reid’s decision to contact Mr. Schumer first, before even President Obama, was another powerful reminder of what Senate Democrats have long known: Mr. Schumer — the flip-phone using, rumpled, relentless son of a Brooklyn exterminator — is the presumptive front-runner to lead the Senate Democrats when Mr. Reid is gone. \n \n In that moment, Mr. Schumer’s possibilities finally caught up with his ambition. \n \n Just hours after Mr. Reid announced his retirement, throwing the future of his caucus into flux, at least one thing was clear: The Democratic leader post that Mr. Schumer has long coveted is his to lose. \n \n Mr. Reid, demonstrating the steely will with which he has ruled his conference, worked aggressively to anoint Mr. Schumer, the No. 3 Democrat, as his successor shortly after beginning to tell people that he would not seek re-election, effectively edging out Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat. Mr. Durbin later said that he, too, would back Mr. Schumer. \n \n “He will be elected to replace me in 22 months,” Mr. Reid told Nevada Public Radio. “I think one reason that will happen is because I want him to be my replacement.” \n \n Mr. Schumer spent most of the day calling lawmakers to lock down their support for his leadership bid, which he officially announced Friday afternoon, saying in statement, “I am honored and humbled to have the support of so many of my colleagues and look forward to our Senate Democratic caucus continuing to fight for the middle class.” \n \n After more than three decades in Congress, Mr. Schumer, 64, has a reputation nationally as an institutional presence in the baroque Senate chamber and the green rooms of the Sunday talk shows. But his potential ascent to the top Democratic post also represents a boon for New York, where Mr. Schumer cut his teeth with his rapacious attention to local issues, one Sunday morning news conference at a time. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n New York has never produced a leader of the Senate, and it has been more than a century since a New Yorker was speaker of the House. \n \n “New York is very fortunate that we will have someone with his abilities and talents to help our state,” said former Senator Alfonse M. D’Amato, a Republican whom Mr. Schumer unseated in a contentious 1998 battle, but who now describes him as “a tiger” on Capitol Hill. “He will do exactly that — use that power and that clout.” \n \n Unlike the frequently endangered Mr. Reid — and the previous Democratic Senate leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota — Mr. Schumer, who was first elected to the House in 1980, has proved seemingly unbeatable on his home turf. He has not faced a competitive campaign since his first election to the Senate, as he has kept the state’s Democratic community united around him. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n That same indefatigable relationship building has also helped him in the Senate. Mr. Durbin and Mr. Schumer, who were once longtime roommates in Washington, have jockeyed for years behind the scenes, at times tensely, over who would replace Mr. Reid. Mr. Durbin plans to run again for the No. 2 position, and has Mr. Reid’s endorsement. \n \n Mr. Schumer, a master tactician and inveterate deal maker, ran the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee in 2006, when Democrats retook control of the Senate, and again in 2008, when they increased their majority. Mr. Schumer also earned the respect and trust of more moderate Democrats, who view him as someone eager to get things done and often call him when they have a concern or problem. \n \n Shortly after the 2014 midterm elections, when Democrats lost their majority, some Democrats who had chafed under Mr. Reid’s leadership urged Mr. Schumer to challenge Mr. Reid for minority leader. But Mr. Schumer quickly quashed the plan, out of “loyalty and friendship” to Mr. Reid, said someone close to Mr. Schumer, speaking anonymously to discuss a sensitive topic. \n \n Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the No. 4 Democrat, is also interested in remaining in her party’s leadership, though she is not actively campaigning for a specific post. \n \n While some progressive groups called for Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts to consider running, Democrats have mentioned Ms. Murray as the most likely senator to pose a possible challenge for Mr. Schumer. She ran the party’s Senate Campaign Committee in 2012, is well liked and respected by her colleagues, and has a natural base of support among her party’s 14 female members. \n \n Though the official vote is nearly two years away, after the 2016 elections, the Democratic leadership was eager for a smooth transition, and at least a tacit understanding of who will replace Mr. Reid. \n \n In New York, where Mr. Schumer’s prowess as a retail politician is often on display, his possible elevation was cause for instant celebration. \n \n “I don’t know when the last time was when we had someone in such a position,” said Representative Joseph Crowley of Queens, adding, “He’s going to be at the head of the table, and I think that’s something that we haven’t necessarily had.” \n \n In contrast with other prominent New York officials, including Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York, Mr. Schumer has never become a divisive figure, focusing insistently on the state’s economic interests and local concerns, rather than on ideological crusades. \n \n Mr. Crowley said Mr. Schumer has attended nearly every meeting of the state’s delegation, both in Washington and back home. When Mr. Crowley sought a House leadership post in 2012, he said he sought advice from Mr. Schumer, who helped rally the delegation behind him. \n \n Mr. Schumer has continued to work the state’s circuit of local parades and association dinners even as he has climbed the ranks of national leadership, making frequent visits to upstate cities, including Syracuse, Rochester and Buffalo. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n “When I get together with him, I can get through a list of 10 issues in 45 seconds,” said Mayor Stephanie A. Miner of Syracuse. “Between talking fast and talking on two or three flip-phones at any one time, he’s always extraordinarily responsive.” \n \n New York City politicians called Mr. Schumer an omnipresent force, regularly seen riding his bike around the city and showing up at swearing-in ceremonies for all manner of state and local officeholders. \n \n “He’s everywhere in the state and has been for a long time now,” said State Senator Daniel L.

That may seem like a lot, but consider their movie peers: Just the top three women in movies earned almost as much combined ($88 million). \n \n So yes, women make a lot less in TV than they do if they are big movie stars, but there are advantages. Working mothers with TV roles usually get to stay in L.A. (or New York) instead of having to jet around the world to film locations. There's a steady paycheck and no worrying about Angelina Jolie beating you out for the part in the next big film. \n \n And usually the roles are better. None of the women on our list play the doting girlfriend or the damsel in distress.

And while the show hasn't been a massive rating success for Comcast's NBC network, it has developed the kind of loyal following that laps up DVDs and watches the shows again and again. 30 Rock is now in syndication on Fox and Comedy Central. Fey's unique take on the work-place comedy is a big part of the reason the show draws such loyal fans. Who else but Fey could coin a term like lizzing? \n \n The women on Desperate Housewives aren't pushovers either. Longoria leads the pack with $13 million thanks to lucrative endorsement deals with L'Oreal and LG, but all three of her co-stars are also on our list. Marcia Cross ranks third with $10 million and Felicity Huffman and Terry Hatchertie for fifth with $9 million each. \n \n The adventures of the four suburban housewives have been a boon for Disney's ABC. When the show hit the air in 2004 (along with Lost), it transformed ABC from a has-been to the hottest network almost overnight. The show has had a massive run but its current season (the eighth) will be the show's last. The season's recent premiere was the show's lowest rated. \n \n But don't cry for the ladies.

They also stopped using cell phones and used encrypted e-mail while on the road to avoid detection by law enforcement, according to the indictment. \n \n To publicize their crimes, court documents allege, the pair used publicly available computers to post what the FBI called “communiques” to extreme animal rights websites. \n \n Buddenberg was the target of federal agents at least once before when, in 2009, he was charged with threatening researchers at UC Berkeley and UC Santa Cruz. Those charges were eventually thrown out by a judge who said prosecutors filed a vague indictment that failed to specify any illegal acts. \n \n If convicted, Buddenberg and Kissane could face up to 10 years in prison and $250,000 in fines.

6,"['Hunger is assumed to motivate eating, which satisfies the caloric needs underlying the motivation. However, hunger’s influence extends beyond food consumption to the acquisition of nonfood items that cannot satisfy the underlying need (e.g., binder clips), suggesting that domain-specific motives can influence behavior in unrelated domains that are irrelevant to the motive. This is likely to occur when the domain-specific response includes concepts and behaviors that can also guide decisions in other domains. \n \n Abstract \n \n Hunger motivates people to consume food, for which finding and acquiring food is a prerequisite. We test whether the acquisition component spills over to nonfood objects: Are hungry people more likely to acquire objects that cannot satisfy their hunger? Five laboratory and field studies show that hunger increases the accessibility of acquisition-related concepts and the intention to acquire not only food but also nonfood objects. Moreover, people act on this intention and acquire more nonfood objects (e.g., binder clips) when they are hungry, both when these items are freely available and when they must be paid for. However, hunger does not influence how much they like nonfood objects. We conclude that a basic biologically based motivation can affect substantively unrelated behaviors that cannot satisfy the motivation. This presumably occurs because hunger renders acquisition-related concepts and behaviors more accessible, which influences decisions in situations to which they can be applied.', 'Shopping when hungry could be a bad idea (Image: UpperCut Images/Getty) \n \n Shopping on an empty stomach? Go and eat something quick! People buy far more stuff and spend more money when they\'re hungry than when they\'re full, and that extends to non-edible goods, too, according to a study of the association between our bellies and our belongings. \n \n One day in 2007, Alison Jing Xu, who studies decision-making at the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, sat down at a mall restaurant and suddenly regretted everything she had just bought. ""I wondered why half an hour ago it had seemed like a good idea to buy 10 pairs of tights, not just the two I needed,"" she says. \n \n ""As a researcher interested in human behaviour, I wanted to understand this. We already know that when we are hungry in a supermarket, we buy more food – I wondered whether hunger might have also increased my desire to purchase non-food items."" \n \n To find out, she and her colleagues conducted five different experiments. \n \n In one experiment, 77 volunteers going in or out of a cafe were asked to rate how hungry they were, and then asked to rate a set of 10 items for how likeable they were and a different set for their desire to have them. \n \n The sets always included a variety of five food items such as a sandwich or a cookie, and five non-food items such as a wireless mouse or a spa visit. On average, hunger had increased how much the participants liked food items and had no effect on non-food items, but it significantly increased their desire to acquire both food and non-food items. \n \n Gimme those clips! \n \n In another experiment, 63 people came to the lab with an empty stomach. Half were then fed some cake. All the volunteers were asked to examine a binder clip and decide how many they would like to try out. They were also asked how much they liked the clips and how hungry they were from one to 10. \n \n Once again, hunger had no effect on how much people liked the clips. However, hungry participants – who had an average score of 7.72 on the hunger scale – asked to take away 70 per cent more free clips than those who had just eaten and had an average rating of 2.91 on the hunger scale. \n \n To find out if the same association held true for real purchases, the team hung around outside a large department store that mainly carried non-food goods. \n \n They asked 81 customers leaving the store whether they could have a peek at their receipt. They also asked them to rate their hunger and their mood, and to say how long they had been in the store. Customers who were hungry – whose hunger score was above the median score for the whole group - spent 64 per cent more money than those who were less hungry – even when the team allowed for mood and time spent shopping. \n \n Spill-over effect \n \n So what\'s going on? When we are hungry, our stomach releases a hormone called ghrelin. This acts on an area of the brain called the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, which is involved in reward and motivation, making people want to seek out and consume calories. \n \n Jing Xu suggests that ghrelin\'s effect also spills over into non-food domains – prompting you to acquire more of everything when you are hungry. ""We\'d like to make consumers aware of the possibility that if they go shopping on an empty stomach, they might spend more money that they intend to – so better feed themselves before they go out,"" she says. \n \n She adds: ""We\'re now going to look at how hunger might influence other behaviours, like how people communicate with others."" \n \n Journal reference: PNAS, DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1417712112 \n \n If you would like to reuse any content from New Scientist, either in print or online, please contact the syndication department first for permission.

Now a new study suggests walking into a mall while hungry is just as bad—at least for your wallet. The study's title sums up the finding: ""Hunger promotes acquisition of nonfood objects."" Reporting in the journal PNAS, researchers at the University of Minnesota say they conducted five experiments whose results consistently showed an increase in the desire to acquire things when people reported being hungry. In one experiment where the items (in this case, binder clips) were free, the hungry cohort left with 70% more than satiated participants. And even when people had to pay (this time for department store items), the hungry ones spent 64% more. ""It's probably better to feed yourself before any type of shopping, whether you're going on an actual shopping trip or shopping online,"" researcher Alison Jing Xu tells Smithsonian. ""And if you're really hungry, you'd better think twice before purchasing any items at all or you might regret those purchases later.""

7,"[""April 10th, 2016 \n \n April is here and this is the time that many trekking and climbing expeditions come to Nepal and venture into the high valleys of the Himalaya. We are one year out from the devastating earthquakes that shook Nepal last April and recovery is ongoing. \n \n \n \n On behalf of our ALCF Board, I would like to thank all of you who donated for earthquake relief in the last year. We responded to need immediately and were able to disburse over 100 thousand dollars in emergency and long term aid to six regions within three months of the quakes. Your donations purchased food, clothing, temporary and permanent shelter, first aid and porter wages to deliver aid. In addition, we helped to reestablish power and water to the community of Phortse where our work with the Khumbu Climbing Center is focused and ongoing. \n \n \n \n Phortse village is home to a approximately 350 people, mostly Sherpa and of those living here, there are 80 living Everest summiters. This tiny community has more Everest summiters than anywhere on Earth with several generations of climbers in some families. Thus it is a fitting place for the Khumbu Climbing Center which has been educating indigenous climbers now for fourteen years. \n \n \n \n With a crippled economy after the quakes and fuel embargoes to make things worse, the vocation of a climbing Sherpa is still a sought after position and one that bolsters the economy of many mountain communities in Nepal. \n \n The technical education provided by the Khumbu Climbing Center is vital to the safety of high altitude workers. In fourteen years we have educated over 1000 students with technical climbing, mountain rescue and safety. \n \n \n \n We are now in full construction mode to finish an earthquake safe, passive solar building to house the KCC and serve as a community center and library for the village of Phortse. With no overhead, our funds go directly into the economy of Nepal. Please help us to provide a permanent and enduring home for the high altitude Indigenous climbers. \n \n \n \n Donate today! With gratitude, Jenni \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n June 4th, 2015 \n \n \n \n Dear friends of Alex Lowe Charitable Foundation, On behalf of our ALCF board, I want to take a moment to thank you for your generous donation for earthquake relief in Nepal. The situation there is dire since the second quake that devastated many remote villages, killing people and precious livestock and damaging roads and trails that are vital for food supply. There will be many ongoing negative impacts with the arrival of the monsoons this month. Since the first earthquake rocked Nepal on April 25th , ALCF was able to mobilize immediately with the infrastructure of our Khumbu Climbing School and Magic Yeti teams. We have sent forty thousand dollars in emergency aid to remote districts of Nepal that were hard hit by the quakes. The money was used to purchase food, shelter, medical supplies and to pay for porters to carry donated supplies to remote roadless areas. We have also delivered nine large duffels of tents, rain gear and warm clothes essential to survival during the monsoon. Our ALCF team has helped to organize donation transport and allocation for many more donated goods. With donations that they helped raise, Mike Auldridge and Parker Webb volunteered to travel to Nepal for ALCF on the 15th of May and were able to trek into the Khumbu and provide assistance to many people there including helping the village of Phortse to restore their water and electricity. Mike is now helping to rebuild a school and Parker is helping to rebuild homes in lower regions that were heavily damaged. This week we will send another twenty thousand dollars and eight more duffels of clothes and tents with board member Steve Mock and his wife Jan who have volunteered their time and resources to travel to Nepal. In the coming weeks, Pete Athans and Liesl Clark directors of the Magic Yeti Library will also travel to Nepal for documentary work and will assist in delivering much needed aid. Thanks once again for helping to bring hope and care to those in need in Nepal. With Gratitude, Jenni Lowe-Anker \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n April 13, 2015 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Dear Friends of Nepal, \n \n The disheartening news of yesterday's quake left us reeling with the magnitude of this disaster. We heard from some of our ALCF team in Nepal as they continue to respond to the crisis in the capacity that we can, helping to fund emergency aid to remote regions. It is of utmost importance that you spread the word to colleagues and friends to dig deep with compassion and donate to the ORG or your choice to support Nepal. The quake yesterday added magnitudes of damage to high mountain villages so the relief effort and rebuilding process will take years. Our immediate response has been to allocate emergency funds to four badly affected regions, including Manang, Langtang, Ghorka and Solukhumbu and we are organizing a large building crew including skilled carpenters and masons to visit the Solukhumbu region in the autumn and help rebuild. Our volunteers will donate their time, travel expenses and efforts and funds will go to aid, supplies and salaries for indigenous people. In the months to come, plan a trip to Nepal and spread the wealth of our own lives to those who are less fortunate. It is still a beautiful country with magnificent mountains, valleys with extraordinary people and rich culture. Your heart will fill if you can travel and see first hand that your dollars are reviving the economy. Thanks to all who have already given! \n \n With Kind Regards, Jenni \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n April 11, 2015 \n \n \n \n \n \n Dear Friends, \n \n \n \n \n \n It has been two weeks since the earthquake shook Nepal exactly one week and a year after last years Everest disaster, dwarfing the magnitude of tragedy that we felt then. The aftershocks continued to frighten people for nearly a week causing many to sleep outside for fear of returning to their homes. This was dangerous at altitude for the elderly and very young who may have been injured. Although the Khumbu fared pretty well aside from some damaged structures, Thame is mostly flattened with 90 percent of houses there destroyed but only 2 casualties. \n \n \n \n \n \n 18 died at basecamp which included 12 Nepali. \n \n \n \n \n \n I have had a bit of communication with Dr. Luanne Freer of Everest ER who worked three seasons as the KCC medical instructor. She returned to Nepal as soon as she heard the news and has worked the front lines of rescue teams, tending to injured. Her HRA team at basecamp tended to some seventy injuries immediately after the avalanche. The news from Langtang and Manaslu was grim as rescue workers and aid finally reached those areas. Tsering, our KCC building project manager, sent us a dispatch from Langtang where he was on a rescue team and Ang - a seasoned KCC instructor, spearheaded rescue efforts as well. I was pleased to realize that the KCC students who have gone through our ranks were using their mountain rescue and first aid skills as well as their leadership skills to help their own and other communities. \n \n \n \n \n \n We have also been in communication with Dave Morton of Juniper Fund who was in Thame during the quake. ALCF will continue our relationship with Juniper Fund to support those who lost family members on Everest. \n \n \n \n \n \n Board member and KCC Director Pete Athans and Liesl Clark, Magic Yeti Libraries Director, jumped in with communicating and helping to assess loss and organize aid. Our Magic Yeti libraries suffered some damage and the Thame one was destroyed. Pete and Liesl are heading over to do a documentary within the next month or so and will be able to help organize the repairs and rebuilds. \n \n \n \n \n \n Conrad and I spoke to Willy Benegas, Everest guide and longtime supporter of KCC, who was there during the quake. He left Nepal briefly to organize some aid for those remote areas which were being overlooked. He is returning this week to organize and pay surviving villagers in Manaslu to carry loads of food and aid supplies that were left at the end of the road or far down valley from where they are needed. This is a good way to infuse money into the economy. ALCF has committed to support this project and will also support aid to Langtang. \n \n \n \n \n \n Mike Auldridge, a professional builder who has worked on the earthquake safe KCC building, is headed over to Nepal for us on May 15th. Parker Webb, who interned at KCC two years ago and lived for a year in Nepal will join him. They will take stock of the KCC building project in Phortse and assess other damage to structures there. They will also transport emergency supplies. \n \n \n \n \n \n Board member and KCC Director Steve Mock and his wife Jan are headed over to Phortse on June 5th and will also carry emergency supplies for those areas most in need. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Thanks for your continued support. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n May 1st, 2015 \n \n \n \n \n \n The April 25th, 2015 mega earthquake in Nepal has affected every one of the villages where we have children’s libraries. Our hearts are with our friends and colleagues all over Nepal. One of our libraries has been flattened, while the others have suffered much damage. The buildings will need to be rebuilt and repaired. In the immediate term, we’ve put together a team of Nepali and foreign volunteers from all over the world to address the needs of the people in the most hardest hit communities in Nepal. This team is working with Kathmandu Living Labs to get the most reliable local information about the remote communities that need basic shelter for their people. We are moving tarps, tents and blankets from India, Hong Kong and the USA to Nepal through the help of aid organizations and volunteers around the world willing to bring these supplies into the country as part of the checked baggage. We’ve created a person-to-person giving network to get these urgently-needed supplies to Nepal and out to the remote villages that are currently blank spots on the aid map. \n \n \n \n \n \n We’re also raising money for our longer-term mission of helping to rebuild the community centers and schools where our Magic Yeti Children’s libraries are housed. As soon as our immediate mission of getting tarps and tents out to the tens of thousands of homeless people left to sleep out in the open in the oncoming monsoon, we will turn our attention back to the villages where we are committed to help bring increased literacy to families and loved-ones. Any help you can provide will be appreciated and we thank you for all of your support during these heartbreaking times. \n \n Liesl Clark \n \n Director, Magic Yeti Children’s Libraries \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Visit the Magic Yeti Children’s Libraries section to learn more. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n April 26, 2015 \n \n \n \n \n \n It is with a heavy heart that I write on behalf of The Alex Lowe Charitable Foundation today. We are deeply saddened to hear the news of a devastating earthquake in Nepal that has destroyed structures and taken many lives throughout the country. The quake caused a catastrophic avalanche from Pumori to sweep into Everest base camp resulting in many injured and dead. We send our prayers and condolences to Nepal and especially to those who have lost family members and homes. \n \n \n \n \n \n The news from Mount Everest is grim as the earthquake triggered an enormous avalanche that swept down into camp. The aftershocks continue to send smaller avalanches into and near base camp and the icefall. Right now, it appears that at least 18 have died in or near base camp. That toll may very well rise as many are still unaccounted for. Also, there were many climbers and guides at camps 1 and 2 above the ice fall when the avalanche occurred. Earthquake-induced movement within the ice fall has damaged or destroyed much of this already tenuous route through the treacherous terrain, the site of last year's major disaster. Everest Base Camp is frightening as every aftershock or loud sound leads to fear of another avalanche. \n \n \n \n \n \n We also have some very sparse reports that Phortse, the home to Khumbu Climbing Center, as well as some other nearby villages were badly damaged.We have no direct reports, though, as the quake apparently destroyed many cellular towers, and presently phone communication throughout much of the Khumbu region is impossible. \n \n \n \n \n \n The Alex Lowe Charitable Foundation (ALCF) is accepting relief donations that will be disbursed to the indigenous climbing communities of Nepal to help mitigate loss of life, livelihood or homes.

REUTERS/Navesh Chitrakar \n \n Alex Lowe and David Bridges were swept away in 1999 by an avalanche during their attempt to scale the world’s 14th highest peak, Shishapangma. \n \n Ueli Steck of Switzerland and David Goettler of Germany, who were attempting the same South Face route to the 26,291-foot (8,013 m) peak, stumbled upon the bodies of the pair, encased in ice, at an altitude of 19,356 feet (5,900 m). \n \n “The bodies were two meters (six feet) apart,” Steck told Reuters after returning to the Nepali capital of Kathmandu from neighboring Tibet. \n \n A charity run by Lowe’s widow, Jenni Lowe-Anker, announced the find on May 2. \n \n Steck and Goettler, who had heard about the disappearance of the legendary climbers on the same route 16 years ago, descended to their advanced base camp, set up at 18,700 feet (5,700 m). \n \n Goettler called Conrad Anker, who was part of the 1999 expedition and survived the avalanche, describing their findings. \n \n “We did not know them and we could not recognize them,” Steck said, outside his hotel in Kathmandu. \n \n Based on the description, Anker had little doubt of the identities of the two bodies, as their clothing, boots and backpacks matched the gear Lowe and Bridges had when they disappeared. \n \n “We did not touch them out of respect and left the bodies on the mountain in the same position as we had discovered (them),” said the 40-year-old mountaineer from Interlaken, Switzerland. \n \n Bodies of climbers who perish in the Himalayas remain buried under the snow and emerge as the ice melts or glaciers move. \n \n Lowe, who was 40 at the time of his death, was regarded as the best American mountaineer of his generation when he and Bridges were swept away during an expedition that aimed to ski down Shishapangma. \n \n Lowe’s accomplishments included two climbs to the top of Mount Everest, the world’s highest peak, several first ascents in Antarctica and dozens of less prominent but highly technical ascents. \n \n Steck and Goettler made two attempts to reach the summit of Shishapangma this month, but failed because of bad weather.', 'And so here is the Burj Dubai\'s real symbolic importance: It is mostly empty, and is likely to stay that way for the foreseeable future. Though most of its 900 apartments have been sold, virtually all were bought three years ago -- near the top of the market -- and primarily as investments, not as places to live. (""A lot of those purchases were speculative,"" Smith, in something of an understatement, told me in a phone interview.) And there\'s virtually no demand in Dubai at the moment for office space. The Burj Dubai has 37 floors of office space. \n \n Monday\'s ribbon-cutting, though, could hardly come at a more awkward time. Dubai, the most populous member of the United Arab Emirates, continues to deal with a massive real estate collapse that has sent shock waves through financial markets around the world and forced the ambitious city-state, in a significant blow to its pride, to seek repeated billion-dollar bailouts from neighboring Abu Dhabi. Conceived at the height of local optimism about Dubai\'s place in the region and the world, this seemingly endless bean-stock tower, which holds an Armani Hotel on its lower floors with apartments and offices above, has flooded Dubai with a good deal more residential and commercial space than the market can possibly bear. \n \n Designed by Adrian Smith , a former partner in the Chicago office of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, the Burj Dubai is an impossible-to-miss sign of the degree to which architectural ambition -- at least the kind that can be measured in feet or number of stories -- has migrated in recent years from North America and Europe to Asia and the Middle East. It is roughly as tall as the World Trade Center towers piled one atop the other. Its closest competition is Toronto\'s CN Tower, which is not really a building at all, holding only satellites and observation decks, and is in any case nearly 900 feet shorter. \n \n One of the odder, more complicated moments in the history of architectural symbolism will arrive Monday with the formal opening of the Burj Dubai skyscraper . At about 2,600 feet high -- the official figure is still being kept secret by developer Emaar Properties -- and 160 stories, the tower, set back half a mile or so from Dubai\'s busy Sheikh Zayed Road , will officially take its place as the tallest building in the world. \n \n Though Emaar is understandably reluctant to disclose how much of the tower is or will be occupied -- it did not reply to e-mails sent this week on that score -- it\'s fair to assume that like many of Dubai\'s new skyscrapers it is a long, long way from being full. In that sense the building is a powerful iconic presence in ways that have little directly to do with its record-breaking height. To a remarkable degree, the metaphors and symbols of the built environment have been dominated in recent months by images of unneeded, sealed-off, ruined, forlorn or forsaken buildings and cityscapes. The Burj Dubai is just the latest -- and biggest -- in this string of monuments to architectural vacancy. \n \n The combination of overbuilding during the boom years, thanks to easy credit, and the sudden paralysis of the financial markets in the fall of 2008 has created an unprecedented supply of unwanted or under-occupied real estate around the world. At the same time, rising cultural worry about environmental disaster or some other end-of-days scenario has produced a recent stream of books, movies and photography imagining cities and pieces of architecture emptied of nearly all signs of human presence. \n \n And so in the same week that you could read the news that the Sahara Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas has entirely sealed off two of its three towers (and its buffet!) for the holiday season, citing slow demand, you could head to the multiplex to watch the movie version of Cormac McCarthy\'s novel ""The Road,"" in which a father and son wander through a post-apocalyptic landscape where buildings for the most part have been reduced to burned-out shells. \n \n And it\'s not just ""The Road"": The Roland Emmerich destruction-fest ""2012"" and the upcoming Denzel Washington vehicle ""The Book of Eli"" are full of similar images; Jason Reitman\'s ""Up in the Air"" moves its characters through a series of downsized companies where abandoned desk chairs swim in empty space. \n \n Or you might discover online a group of photographs called ""Empty L.A.,"" part of a series completed recently by Matt Logue, showing a number of recognizable intersections and stretches of freeway in and around the city where people, cars and other signs of life have been scrubbed away, presumably through digital manipulation -- and in the same trip around the Internet find a Q&A in Entrepreneur magazine with a man named Mike Enos, who runs a firm that encloses foreclosed houses, half-built hotels and other objects in plastic wrap and reports a surge in business since the economic collapse last year. \n \n This movement in the direction of emptiness is profoundly difficult for contemporary culture -- and particularly American culture -- to grapple with. Occasional recessions and other setbacks aside, we assume that our national trajectory always moves toward fullness, that our cultural progress can be measured by how much new square footage we\'ve created and occupied. \n \n But that process has completely reversed itself in many of cities hardest hit by economic crisis. Detroit, as Rebecca Solnit put it in Harper\'s Magazine, ""is now so depopulated that some stretches resemble the outlying farmland and others are altogether wild."" And as P.J. Huffstutter reported recently in The Times, Hantz Farms is planning to buy and plant as many as 5,000 acres of land within the Detroit city limits. \n \n In Los Angeles, there are parking lots where great towers, planned during the exuberant middle of the last decade, were supposed to be. At Rick Caruso\'s Americana at Brand complex in Glendale, every one of the development\'s 100 condominiums sat empty during 2009, even as shoppers browsed in the stores below. Occupancy wasn\'t allowed until more than half of the units had been sold, a mark that was finally reached in December. \n \n As super-tall buildings go, the Burj Dubai is elegant. Smith is an unusually talented shaper of skyscraper form, as he proved at Shanghai\'s 88-story Jin Mao Tower, which he designed before leaving SOM in 2006. The Burj Dubai\'s profile, which Smith says is inspired by a range of local influences including sand dunes and minarets, grows more slender as it rises, like a plant whose upper stalks have been peeled away. \n \n But the extent to which the building had to battle worries about the wisdom of its construction even before it was finished -- the way it seemed doomed, at least in financial terms, while it was still going up -- may be unique in the history of skyscraper design. In that sense it seems impossible to write about the Burj Dubai without at least mentioning the Tower of Babel, which also, if the biblical story and various historical sketches are to be believed, combined a tapering, corkscrew design with heaps of overconfidence. \n \n Dubai\'s economy will recover, at least in some chastened form. But the hyper-confident Dubai that Smith\'s tower was designed to mark and call global attention to is already dead, as is the broader notion, which the emirate came to symbolize over the last decade, that growth can operate as its own economic engine, feeding endlessly and ravenously on itself. \n \n If the Burj Dubai is too shiny, confidently designed and expertly engineered to be a ruin itself, it is surely the marker -- the tombstone -- for some ruined ideas. \n \n -- Christopher Hawthorne \n \n Top photo: The Burj Dubai.

Swiss mountaineer Ueli Steck tells Reuters that he was on the way up Mount Shishapangma with German climber David Goettler when they found the bodies encased in ice at 19,356 feet. The men, who perished in an October 1999 avalanche, were just 6 feet apart. ""We did not touch them out of respect and left the bodies on the mountain in the same position as we had discovered [them],"" says Steck, considered one of the world's best mountaineers—just as Lowe was at the time of his death, notes the Guardian. ""We didn't realize this could be Alex and David. But when we were back in base camp we were talking about this and were like—oh, these two bodies could be,"" Steck tells the AP. Goettler called Conrad Anker, who survived the 1999 avalanche. Based on the description of the men's clothing and gear, Anker said he was sure that the bodies were those of Lowe, considered the best American climber of his generation, and renowned cameraman Bridges. Steck and Goettler were the only climbers to attempt the difficult southern route of Shishapangma this year, but they were unable to reach the summit in two attempts because of bad weather. Anker married Lowe's widow, Jennifer, in 2001 and adopted his three sons. ""Conrad, the boys, and I will make our pilgrimage to Shishapangma,"" Jennifer Lowe-Anker said in a statement after the bodies were found. ""It is time to put Alex to rest.""

8,"['STORRS, Conn. (WTNH) — Eight people have been arrested in Connecticut State Police‘s investigation into the death of UConn student Jeffny Pally. \n \n On October 16, police were called to the UConn Fire Department after a student was hit by a fire truck responding to a call. Jeffny Pally, 19, was sitting on the ground with her back against the outside of the fire station door. When the door went up for officials to respond to the call, Pally fell back and was hit by a UConn Fire vehicle. \n \n State Police say on January 31, they applied for arrest warrants for six students that had hosted an off-campus fraternity party that Pally had attended that night. According to the affidavit, Pally had three times the legal limit in her system. \n \n On Friday, police arrested the following: \n \n Patrick Callahan, 21, Mansfield, CT. Charged with eight counts of permitting a minor to illegally possess alcohol. \n \n Matthew Moll, 21, Mansfield, CT. Charged with eight counts of permitting a minor to illegally possess alcohol. \n \n Austin Custodio, 21, Pine Bush, NY. Charged with sale/delivery to minors. \n \n Dominic Godi, 21, Bolton, CT. Charged with possession of alcohol by a minor. \n \n Dylan Morose, 22, Mansfield, CT. Charged with eight counts of permitting a minor to illegally possess alcohol. \n \n Jonathan Polansky, 22, Beverly, MA. Charged with eight counts permitting a minor to illegally possess alcohol. \n \n The fraternity that the men were members of, Kappa Sigma, has recently lost its recognition on campus for sanctions unrelated to Pally’s death. \n \n All of the men are due in court on March 8. \n \n UConn sent News 8 the following statement: \n \n Jeffny Pally was a talented, ambitious, promising young woman and her death was a terrible tragedy. The entire university community joins her family and friends in continuing to mourn her loss. The University appreciates the thoroughness of the Connecticut State Police investigation. Questions about that criminal investigation and the arrests announced today should be directed to the Connecticut State Police. Federal student privacy law prevents UConn from discussing whether individual students face discipline cases. Generally speaking, any UConn student found to have violated the provisions of The Student Code may face penalties that range from probation to expulsion. The University has the authority to apply the requirements of the Code to students even when their conduct takes place off campus. The fraternity referenced in the arrest warrant affidavit, Kappa Sigma, recently lost its UConn recognition and housing based on off-campus incidents in September and October. Those incidents, which are referenced in the attached sanctions letter, were unrelated to Jeffny’s death. Kappa Sigma’s national office also has revoked the local group’s charter. \n \n The call that the fire department was responding to when Pally was killed turned out to be a false alarm. UConn police says that two students were involved in setting off a fire alarm that night. According to police, 20-year-old Jacob San-Juan and 19-year-old Michael Vaz stole a fire extinguisher from the Gant Science Building and set it off on the fourth floor of Russell Hall, a dormitory within the Northwest Residence Halls. \n \n Vaz and San-Juan are each charged with two counts of fourth-degree criminal mischief and sixth-degree larceny. They are due in court on March 6.', 'State police have charged six University of Connecticut students with alcohol-related offenses in connection with the October death of student Jeffny Pally, who was killed when she was run over by a UConn Fire Department vehicle. \n \n State police said the students charged were involved in hosting an off-campus party at a house affiliated with Kappa Sigma fraternity that Pally, 19, of West Hartford attended prior to the fatal incident. People gathered at the party to build a float for UConn\'s homecoming parade, which was scheduled for later in the day. The six students charged were Kappa Sigma members. \n \n Kappa Sigma fraternity was suspended by UConn on Feb. 1 after an investigation found that the organization violated UConn\'s student code by providing alcohol to minors and engaging in disruptive and endangering behavior, according to university records. \n \n Pally\'s blood alcohol content was more than three times what is considered legally drunk in Connecticut, according to the arrest warrant. \n \n Those charged were: \n \n Patrick Callahan, 21, Matthew Moll, 21, and Dylan Morose, 22, all of 51 Baxter Road, Mansfield; each charged with eight counts of permitting a minor to illegally possess alcohol. They were the hosts of the party where Pally was seen consuming alcohol prior to her death, according to the arrest warrant. \n \n Austin Custodio, 21, of Boyce Road, Pine Bush, N.Y.; sale or delivery of alcohol to minors. Custodio is accused of buying the beer and vodka consumed at the party at 51 Baxter Road. \n \n Dominic Godi, 21, of Meadow Road, Bolton; charged with conspiracy to commit sale or delivery of alcohol to minor. Godi was social chairman of the Kappa Sigma fraternity and after Custodio purchased the alcohol Godi transported it to 51 Baxter Road, according to the warrant. \n \n Jonathan Polansky, 22, of Sherman Street, Beverly, Mass., charged with eight counts of permitting a minor to illegal possess alcohol. At the time of the party, Polansky was on the lease at 51 Baxter Road and attended the party, according to the warrant. \n \n All were released from custody without having to post bail and are to be arraigned March 8 at Superior Court in Rockville. \n \n In addition, in October UConn police charged two students with larceny and two counts of criminal mischief in connection with the alarm that firefighters responded to when Pally was killed. \n \n Jacob San-Juan, 20, and Michael Vaz, 19, are accused of stealing a fire extinguisher from the Gant Science Building and then discharging it on the fourth floor of Russell Hall. Their cases are pending. \n \n State police said Pally was struck and killed by the fire department vehicle as it responded to an alarm at 1:13 a.m. on Oct. 16. Pally was seated with her back against the exterior door of one of the fire station\'s bays. When the door opened so that the fire vehicle could respond, Pally fell back. She was then struck by the Chevy Tahoe driven by the shift commander, Dana E. Barrow Jr., 60. \n \n A state police review of surveillance cameras showed that Pally was leaning against the garage door for at least 20 minutes before she was struck. After she was struck, her body was not found until about 30 minutes later when firefighters returned from the call. By that point she had no pulse and was not breathing, according to court records. \n \n Barrow told state police that he felt a bump as he drove from the garage bay, but thought he\'d driven over some firefighting equipment. When he looked in the rear view mirror, he told investigators, he saw something on the ground but thought it was gear. \n \n According to court records, witnesses told state police that Pally had been drinking before the incident. Toxicology testing revealed that Pally\'s blood alcohol content was .25, more than three times what is considered legally drunk in Connecticut. \n \n Barrow will not be charged, Tolland State\'s Attorney Matthew Gedansky said Friday. \n \n ""The accident reconstruction investigation determined that the firefighter could not see Ms. Pally in the position she was in,"" Gedansky said. ""We measured the line of sight, we recreated the incident and there\'s no possible way he could have seen her."" \n \n Pally was a member of Delta Gamma sorority. Sorority members were working with Kappa Sigma members to build a homecoming float. Pally, state police determined, arrived at the party about 10:30 p.m. on Oct. 15 and remained at the party until about 12:30 a.m. \n \n While there, she consumed one to five beers, witnesses told state police, according to the warrant. She had also been drinking before arriving at the party, according to the warrant. \n \n Pally and several other girls got a ride via Uber from 51 Baxter Road. The Uber driver told state police that he thought most of the girls who got into his minivan were drunk. He told state police he dropped Pally and another girl near their dorm, which is near the UConn fire station. \n \n ""After being dropped off at her dorm, [Pally], for an unknown reason, walked behind the University of Connecticut Public Safety Complex, sat in front of bay #7, and fell asleep,"" the warrant states. When ""the fire department responded to a fire service call, and as the door to bay #7 opened, the victim fell backwards, still remaining asleep."" The fire vehicle then ran over Pally. \n \n ""Jeffny Pally was a talented, ambitious, promising young woman and her death was a terrible tragedy,"" UConn spokesperson Stephanie Reitz said. ""The entire university community joins her family and friends in continuing to mourn her loss."" \n \n All six students charged on Friday are currently enrolled at UConn, Reitz said, but she noted that students who have violated provisions of the student code may face penalties ranging from probation to expulsion. \n \n She said the time frame for when a penalty might be decided and imposed depends on a variety of factors ranging from the availability of the students for interviews to what facts need to be obtained. \n \n Kappa Sigma lost its UConn recognition and housing based on different off-campus incidents in September and October, said Reitz. Kappa Sigma\'s national office also has revoked the local group\'s charter, she said. \n \n Pally\'s family could not be reached for comment Friday evening. \n \n Courant reporter Kathleen Megan contributed to this story.']",2,"– A freak accident left the University of Connecticut reeling in October; now, six arrests may have it reeling once more. Jeffny Pally was sitting up against a garage bay door at a fire station near her dorm on the Storrs campus around 1:15am when the door opened as fire crews responded to a call. The 19-year-old sophomore fell back and was struck by a Chevy Tahoe leaving the firehouse. Why she chose to sit in front of the bay remains unknown, but police say they've pieced together what allegedly happened in the hours beforehand. On the evening of Oct. 15, Pally attended a party at the Kappa Sigma fraternity that revolved around building a homecoming parade float; now six frat members have been charged with alcohol-related offenses related to Pally's death, reports the Hartford Courant. Pally arrived around 10:30pm and stayed about two hours, during which witnesses say she had one to five beers; she reportedly drank prior to the party, and her blood alcohol content was .25. Patrick Callahan, Matthew Moll, Austin Custodio, and Dominic Godi, all 21, and Dylan Morose and Jonathan Polansky, 22, face varied charges tied to allegedly purchasing and transporting the booze and permitting a minor to illegally possess alcohol. Their arraignment is set for March 8. The 60-year-old shift commander who drove the Tahoe told police he did feel a bump as he exited, but assumed what he saw in his rearview mirror was fire equipment. Pally's body was discovered upon the fire crew's return to the station for what WTNH reports was a false alarm sparked after two students allegedly set off a stolen fire extinguisher in a dorm. They face criminal mischief and larceny charges. (Last year, a court ruled that parents could be held responsible for underage drinking.)"
9,"['For Republicans on Capitol Hill, Donald Trump may finally have gone too far. \n \n Tuesday’s report that Trump asked former FBI Director James Comey to end the criminal investigation into ex-national security adviser Michael Flynn was more than just another embarrassing revelation for a president used to a near-daily barrage of scandal and staff intrigue. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n Republicans are privately beginning to worry that they may one day have to sit in judgment of Trump, or that more damaging information from Comey could force the president to step down. Within hours of Tuesday\'s report by The New York Times, there was a distinct shift among congressional Republicans, who until now have mostly resisted criticizing Trump, let alone demanding the president be held to account for all he says or does. \n \n House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) immediately said he’s prepared to subpoena the memos that Comey reportedly wrote contemporaneously to document his interactions with Trump. Chaffetz sent a letter to the FBI on Tuesday night asking for any notes, documents or records of Trump and Comey’s conversations to be turned over to his panel by May 24. \n \n His request was echoed by AshLee Strong, spokeswoman for House Speaker Paul Ryan: ""We need to have all the facts, and it is appropriate for the House Oversight Committee to request this memo."" \n \n Comey has also been invited by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) to testify publicly at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing to “tell his side of the story” about his dealings with Trump, Graham said Tuesday, even before this latest story broke. \n \n More Republicans have openly discussed the possibility of a select committee or the appointment of a special prosecutor to look into the Trump-Russia connection. It\'s still a minority of GOP lawmakers, but Republican leaders are watching closely. \n \n The White House vehemently denied the New York Times report, and Trump has defended his firing of Comey and reported disclosure of classified information to Russian officials. \n \n Not since October’s “Access Hollywood” moment — when many Republicans believed Trump would have to drop out of the race over his hugely offensive comments about women — has the president faced such a serious political threat. Even conservatives from districts that Trump won overwhelmingly in November want to find out what occurred between the president and Comey, no matter how damaging it may be to Trump. This is a dramatic turn for the party that\'s been whiplashed by Trump’s drama since his first day as a candidate in June 2015 yet has still stuck with him. \n \n “It is important to get to the bottom of it,” said Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), chairman of the Freedom Caucus. Meadows was last seen celebrating passage of the House GOP health care bill in the Rose Garden with Trump and dozens of his Republican colleagues. “We\'ve got one standard, and we need to make sure that applies to everybody.” \n \n Top Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway met with the Freedom Caucus on Tuesday night and would not say afterward what they discussed. Meadows insisted the Comey matter did not come up, but he told reporters that he intends, through his role on the Oversight Committee, to help get to the bottom of what happened. And he expects cooperation from the White House. \n \n “If this is legitimately something that there was some kind of influence or pressure from Comey doing his work, I’m going to be very disappointed,"" added Rep. Mark Walker (R-N.C.), chairman of the conservative Republican Study Committee. \n \n In private, top Republicans fear that this latest Trump controversy — coming just a week after he fired Comey, and only one day after it was revealed that the president revealed highly classified intelligence information during a meeting with Russian officials — will overwhelm everything they are trying to do legislatively. Health care, tax reform, building up the Pentagon — all of it is potentially threatened by the latest furor. \n \n And if Republicans are paralyzed and can’t pass anything despite control of the White House and Congress, how can they justify their majorities when they go before voters next year? \n \n Sen. Lindsay Graham listens as Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse holds up a copy of ""The Kremlin Playbook"" at a hearing of the Senate Judicary Committee\'s Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism on Capitol Hill on May 8. | Getty \n \n “I don’t think we can just shrug our shoulders and walk away from this one,” said a top House Republican, who asked not to be named. “I don’t know where this goes.” \n \n What is most worrying for congressional Republicans is how easy this latest episode is to explain to the public — Trump reportedly tried to interfere with a criminal investigation by the FBI but was rebuffed, then fired Comey — and thus fodder for endless cable TV coverage. That could spur moderate Republicans in swing districts, already nervous about 2018, to openly break with Trump. \n \n “If these allegations are true, it’s deeply troubling and it certainly opens up a new chapter that all of us have to consider very carefully,” said Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.) outside the House chamber Tuesday night. ""We need to get to the truth as soon as possible. This weekly scandal, this weekly controversy is unhealthy for the country. It’s a major distraction for the country and it’s just bad for the psyche of every American.” \n \n “I hope Director Comey testifies before Congress as soon as possible,” said Rep. Leonard Lance (R-N.J.), who earlier broke with Trump and his own leadership over health care reform legislation. \n \n Sign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) tweeted late Tuesday night. \n \n Rep. Pat Meehan (R-Pa.), a former federal prosecutor, suggested Trump’s interactions with Comey threatened the public perception of the Justice Department as an autonomous entity. \n \n “This whole process is very difficult because we are seeing the central institution — the Justice Department, and the independence of the Justice Department — stretched. And people want to have confidence in the independence of [DOJ’s] activities,” Meehan said. “I’m hoping that throughout this long process, it can get back into a place where there could be confidence in the ability of the institutions to do their work.” \n \n Kyle Cheney contributed to this report.', '“He really needs a lawyer,” Ms. O’Sullivan said of Mr. Trump. “He is building a beautiful case against himself.” \n \n Did Trump have lawful authority to fire Comey? \n \n Yes. But courts have ruled that otherwise lawful acts can constitute obstruction of justice if done with corrupt intentions. In a 1998 case, for example, a federal appeals court upheld the conviction of a lawyer who had filed legal complaints and related motions against a government agent who was investigating an illegal gambling operation. The court ruled that the defendant’s “nominally litigation-related conduct” was unlawful because his real motive was “to safeguard his personal financial interests” in the corrupt enterprise. \n \n What would such a case entail, in theory? \n \n Obstruction of justice cases often come down to whether prosecutors can prove defendants’ mental state when they committed the act, legal specialists said. It is not enough to show that a defendant knew the act would have a side consequence of impeding an investigation; achieving that obstruction has to have been the specific intention. \n \n Samuel Buell, a former federal prosecutor who led the Justice Department’s Enron task force and now teaches criminal law at Duke University, was initially skeptical about whether the mere firing of Mr. Comey could prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Trump had an improper mental state. But he said on Tuesday that subsequent revelations have made the evidence much more robust. \n \n “The evidence of improper purpose has gotten much stronger since the day of Comey’s firing,” Mr. Buell said. “Trump has made admissions about that. And we now have evidence that he may have indicated an improper purpose previously in his communications with Comey about the Russia investigation.” \n \n What impediments would there be to charging Mr. Trump? \n \n Ms. O’Sullivan said it was not realistic to expect the Trump administration’s Justice Department to charge the sitting president. And Mr. Buell argued that the developments had strengthened the case for Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein, who is overseeing the investigation because Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself, to appoint a special counsel to handle it. \n \n “The issue right now is whether there needs to be a serious impartial investigation, and there can be no doubt about that at this point,” said Mr. Buell, who said the developments showed that Mr. Comey needed to be interviewed as a witness. “This kind of drip, drip, drip — we keep addressing this scenario as ‘here is the evidence, what is the result,’ but that’s only good until tomorrow when something else comes out. It is not at all clear that this is the end. If anything, it has become clearer that there is more to know.” \n \n What about impeachment? \n \n “Asking FBI to drop an investigation is obstruction of justice,” Representative Ted Deutch, Democrat of Florida, wrote on Twitter on Tuesday. “Obstruction of justice is an impeachable offense.”', 'A theatrical showdown is now looming between the President with a hazy relationship with the truth and the FBI director he fired, whose finely tuned sense of his own integrity has often steered him into rocky political waters. \n \n The epic head-to-head was set up by stunning allegations that in February Trump pressured Comey to shut down the FBI\'s Russia probe that was, among other avenues of inquiry, investigating former national security adviser Michael Flynn. \n \n Furthermore, in a sensational development, sources told The New York Times and then CNN on Tuesday night that Comey wrote down his account of Trump\'s request over the probe in a memo that is about to become one of Washington\'s most famed artifacts. \n \n The coming confrontation between Comey and Trump is more than just an opportunity to air grievances that appear to have quickly grown between the two men during their short working relationship and over the FBI director\'s humiliating dismissal -- news of which he learned on cable television just one week ago. \n \n It promises to have grave implications for the longevity of an administration that appears to slip deeper into utter disarray by the hour. There doesn\'t seem to be a way that both men could survive the contest with their reputations intact. \n \n JUST WATCHED Cummings: Trump has stepped over the line Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Cummings: Trump has stepped over the line 00:47 \n \n Compelling evidence \n \n Comey is the kind of adversary that no White House would relish. \n \n If the claims in his memo are correct, they would appear to offer the most compelling evidence yet that Trump\'s attempt to shut down the probe could amount to an obstruction of justice that imperils his presidency. \n \n ""It looks like he was trying to impede the investigation,"" said CNN senior political analyst David Gergen. ""He was using his power to do that, and when James Comey didn\'t go along with him, when he wasn\'t his boy, he fired him."" \n \n Gergen suggested the situation was so serious following Tuesday\'s revelations that America could be on the cusp of a new impeachment drama. \n \n The White House has dismissed Comey\'s version of events revealed by a memo that was described to CNN. \n \n ""While the President has repeatedly expressed his view that General Flynn is a decent man who served and protected our country, the President has never asked Mr. Comey or anyone else to end any investigation, including any investigation involving General Flynn,"" a White House official said in a statement. \n \n The prospect of a new arm\'s length confrontation with Comey might also be causing Trump to second guess himself after suddenly firing the former director last week, then admitting on television that he did so because he was frustrated about a Russia probe he has called a waste of taxpayer money. \n \n Given the stakes, it now appears certain that Comey will be called out of his premature retirement to testify before Congress about the memo. He would be grilled on what Trump actually said in their Oval Office meeting on February 14 that is now at the center of the political hurricane. Comey would also face scrutiny over why he decided to keep a log of his conversations with the President that was then leaked at a moment of maximum embarrassment for the White House. \n \n JUST WATCHED Chaffetz: I\'m ready to subpoena for Comey memo Replay More Videos ...

""We\'re not going to try somebody on a piece of paper."" \n \n So far in the Trump presidency, the most important Republican leaders, House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell, have tried to keep the focus of their troops on implementing a conservative agenda rather than holding an unpredictable President to account. \n \n But Ohio Republican Gov. John Kasich said in a CNN town hall event Tuesday that needs to change. \n \n ""I saw that Speaker (Paul) Ryan said some things tonight about getting to the bottom line,"" Kasich said. ""Frankly, I think he should be more aggressive.

MUST WATCH Comey: We follow where the evidence takes us 02:04 \n \n Comey hearing? \n \n A Comey hearing would instantly become one of the most significant congressional appearances of modern times. \n \n The practiced, analytical note-taking of a former FBI director who knows how to leave a paper trail would amount to a compelling piece of evidence in the court of public opinion and pit Comey\'s word against Trump\'s. \n \n After all, a Comey memo could approach ""smoking gun"" significance if it appears to prove that the President could conceivably be accused of obstructing justice -- potentially grounds for impeachment. \n \n A Comey appearance before a high wattage, televised hearing would mark another extraordinary dimension in a career in which the former FBI chief has found himself at the center of gripping episodes of Beltway drama. \n \n Ten years ago, Comey, then acting attorney general, rushed to a Washington hospital to thwart an attempt by White House counsel Alberto Gonzales and White House chief of staff Andy Card to get a seriously ill Attorney General John Ashcroft to reauthorize a surveillance program. \n \n That intervention made him a hero for Democrats. But they came to despise Comey for his leading man role in a later drama, the probe into Hillary Clinton\'s email server. \n \n Clinton\'s campaign blames Comey for her defeat last November. He intervented late in the campaign over a new batch of emails found on the laptop of Anthony Weiner, the husband of the Democratic nominee\'s aide Huma Abedin. \n \n Trump lauded Comey for his conduct. But he soon came to loggerheads with Comey in his own administration, when the FBI director reportedly refused to offer him a vow of loyalty. Tuesday\'s reports that the President tried to get him to shelve the Flynn probe only thicken the plot. \n \n Comey\'s political misadventures may offer Republicans a chance to question his motives should he testify, and the GOP is in a mood to defend its president, whose antics in recent days have sorely tested the patience of his supporters. \n \n JUST WATCHED The wiretapping saga in 2 minutes Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH The wiretapping saga in 2 minutes 02:23 \n \n Falsehoods, exaggerations and blatant untruths \n \n But it is also possible that given his administration\'s history of repeated falsehoods, exaggerations and blatant untruths, on issues from the size of the inauguration crowds to claims that President Barack Obama wiretapped Trump Tower, the President may not come across as a particularly credible witness in the court of public opinion. \n \n And there\'s no guarantee that the White House can get its story straight. In recent days, Trump has repeatedly contradicted his own press team as they work to defuse multiple firestorms in Washington. \n \n Since Comey would testify from Congress, and Trump can command the bully pulpit, both men, in effect would be vying for victory in the court of public opinion. \n \n Comey, in the very act of taking notes about his conversations with Trump, seems to have indicated that at the very least he considered the President a problematic character who could embroil him in future controversies. \n \n Trump has already made clear his deep antipathy to Comey. After firing him, Trump told NBC News that the FBI director was a ""showboat"" and a ""grandstander"" whom he had been planning to jettison for months. \n \n Those unflattering impressions are not likely to be improved if Trump, ever the showman himself, tunes in on cable television to watch Comey starring in a hearing that keeps the rest of the country on tenterhooks. \n \n But the result of their public duel may go a long way to dictating the fate of Trump presidency. If Trump allies fail to paint Comey as a discredited figure, he could impose deep political damage on the President. \n \n It was already immediately noticeable in the wake of Tuesday\'s disclosures that Republicans on Capitol Hill were more reticent about coming out in strong support of the President than they had been on previous occasions. \n \n A damning performance by Comey could further add to their doubts and leave Trump in deep political peril if his alleged missteps persuade even a Republican Congress to contemplate impeachment proceedings.', 'We don’t actually know if Richard Nixon ordered the break-in to the Democratic National Committee headquarters in the Watergate complex on June 17, 1972. \n \n That, to me, is still the most remarkable feature of the Watergate crisis. A president was forced out of office for the first time in American history by a scandal centering on a single crime, and we still don’t know if he actually ordered it. \n \n In his memoirs, Nixon denies it, though he smugly adds, ""I could not muster much moral outrage over a political bugging."" Jeb Magruder, a dirty tricks operative for Nixon, revealed three decades later that he had overheard Nixon and his reelection chair John Mitchell planning the burglary. But as historian David Greenberg notes, “Mr. Magruder had [previously] discussed that same meeting without noting Nixon\'s participation.” Dirty tricks operatives aren’t the most reliable of sources. \n \n We don’t even know why it happened — if the burglars were looking for evidence that the DNC was receiving money from the North Vietnamese or Cuban governments (as conspirator Howard Hunt insisted), or information embarrassing to White House counsel John Dean (as G. Gordon Liddy, who planned the break-in with Hunt, claimed), or, as another popular theory has it, trying to find out how much DNC chair Larry O\'Brien knew about Nixon’s financial dealings with billionaire tycoon Howard Hughes. \n \n But what we do know, the “smoking gun” that eventually forced Nixon out of office, was that Nixon ordered his chief of staff to get the CIA to force the FBI to abandon its investigation into the break-in. \n \n That was enough. \n \n Some Republicans had stood by Nixon through his firing of the independent counsel investigating the matter, through multiple aides and Cabinet officials resigning, through the White House’s effort to resist subpoenas for documents and tapes. But when the “smoking gun” White House tape was released on August 5, 1974, Nixon’s remaining support from Republicans evaporated. Two days later, Senate Minority Leader Hugh Scott (R-PA), House Minority Leader John Jacob Rhodes (R-AZ), and former presidential candidate Sen. Barry Goldwater (R-AZ) went to the White House and informed the president that he had no support left in Congress. \n \n They were shocked and horrified that Nixon had personally participated in the cover-up; before then there was still a sliver of a chance that the president himself wasn’t part of the conspiracy. They told Nixon that, now that his role in the cover-up was known, the votes were there to impeach him and remove him from office. The day after that, the president announced his resignation. \n \n Similarly, there’s a lot we don’t know about Trump and his campaign’s ties to Russia. We know that the FBI and other agencies have been looking into any contact Trump\'s campaign advisers Paul Manafort, Carter Page, and Roger Stone might have had with the Russian government during the election, as well as into White House senior adviser and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner’s post-election contacts. We know that intelligence agencies suspect those three might have worked the Russian officials to coordinate the release of hacked emails. We know that disgraced former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, Kushner, and Attorney General Jeff Sessions all lied about or failed to disclose communications with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. \n \n We don’t know how all these pieces fit together. We don’t know exactly what Donald Trump Sr.’s direct involvement is, or how aware he was of his advisers’ efforts, or the nature of his business relationship with Russia. That’s provoked a lot of very valuable investigative journalism, as well as a lot of outright conspiracy theorizing. \n \n But focusing too granularly on the details of Trump’s personal involvement risks setting the bar too low for him. It risks suggesting that unless we find undeniable proof of collusion between Trump and the Russian government, he’s in the clear. \n \n The fact of the matter is that without any more information than we already have, we already know Trump’s conduct is at least as outrageous as what Nixon acknowledged in the smoking gun tape. \n \n In Nixon’s case, what crossed the line, moving top leaders from his own party to go to the White House and tell Nixon that his presidency was over, was Nixon’s attempt to hamper the FBI’s investigation into Watergate. \n \n And we now know that before Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, he asked Comey to stop investigating former National Security Adviser Flynn; Comey confirms as much in his testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee, and further indicates that Trump asked him to “lift the cloud” of the Russia investigation more broadly. This is exactly the same kind of FBI investigation interference that forced Nixon out of the White House and shocked his Republican allies out of defending him. \n \n We also know that Trump asked the Director of National Intelligence and the director of the National Security Agency to publicly deny the existence of collusion between his campaign and Russia — an attempt at interference in the intelligence community that calls directly to mind Nixon\'s attempt to use the CIA to scuttle an FBI probe. \n \n This is not a “where there’s smoke there’s fire” situation. We don’t need to know much more to know that the president has committed conduct that was once thought sufficient to warrant removal from office. \n \n The Comey firing isn’t smoke. It’s fire.', '""There is no cover story or obvious response to soft-pedal what Trump meant,"" said one law professor. | AP Photo Trump\'s alleged plea to Comey stirs obstruction talk Many lawyers say impeachment is only viable penalty for a president\'s actions in office. \n \n The revelation that Donald Trump allegedly urged former FBI Director James Comey to drop a probe into former adviser Michael Flynn fueled speculation the president may have obstructed justice, but any penalty would likely come from Congress and not the criminal justice system, lawyers said Tuesday. \n \n ""When someone at the White House is telling someone at DOJ or the FBI to soft-pedal or abandon an investigation, that\'s when people start talking about obstruction,"" said University of Texas law professor Stephen Vladeck. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n While Trump and other officials have offered a panoply of reasons for Comey\'s firing last week, the ongoing FBI probe into Russian influence on the 2016 election was cited as part of the reason for Trump\'s dissatisfaction with the FBI director\'s performance. \n \n The disclosure by the New York Times Tuesday, which was confirmed by POLITICO, that an FBI memo indicated that Trump asked Comey at a February White House meeting if he could let go of the probe into Flynn, a former campaign adviser and national security adviser, only intensified allegations the president was trying to rein in the ongoing inquiries into his associates. \n \n ""There is no cover story or obvious response to soft-pedal what Trump meant,"" Vladeck said. \n \n ""I\'m hard-pressed to think of another time that someone has put his finger on the scale as brazenly as President Trump has. If this were anyone other the president, it is classic, vanilla obstruction,"" said Jeff Cramer, a Chicago-based former federal prosecutor now with Berkeley Research Group. \n \n Trump aides dispute Comey\'s reported account of that conversation. White House officials insisted Tuesday that Trump had made no request to end the investigation. \n \n ""While the president has repeatedly expressed his view that General Flynn is a decent man who served and protected our country, the president has never asked Mr. Comey or anyone else to end any investigation, including any investigation involving General Flynn,” the White House said in a statement. Even if Comey\'s version of events proves accurate, not everyone agrees Trump\'s actions would amount to obstruction. \n \n Regardless, it would likely be up to Congress to act. While other officials alleged to have sought to stymie investigations would have to worry about criminal charges, there\'s broad consensus a president can\'t be charged criminally while he\'s in office. \n \n ""It\'s the longstanding position of the executive branch that the president cannot be indicted while in office,"" said Harvard law professor Jack Goldsmith, a top Justice Department official under President George W. Bush. ""The remedy for a criminal violation would be impeachment."" \n \n As the Monica Lewinsky controversy swirled around former President Bill Clinton, a Senate panel held a hearing on whether the president could be indicted. Most in Congress, including many Republicans, seemed to hold the view that the Constitution sets up impeachment as the mechanism for punishing presidential misconduct. \n \n When Independent Counsel Ken Starr believed he had ""substantial and credible"" evidence against Clinton, Starr did not seek an indictment but delivered reams of material to the House of Representatives instead. One of the articles of impeachment on which the House voted against Clinton was for obstruction of justice. The Senate acquitted Clinton on all the charges. \n \n Breaking News Alerts Get breaking news when it happens — in your inbox.

Some argued that his broad constitutional authority to direct the executive branch provides a defense against such charges. They also saw ambiguities in Trump\'s reported language. \n \n ""If it was a polite request saying, \'Oh, you know, he\'s a good guy, Flynn, I wish you\'d back off this thing,\' that\'s not an obstruction of justice,"" Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz said on MSNBC Tuesday. ""If it was a command, it would raise stronger problems...I just think it\'s a very, very high bar to get over obstruction of justice for a president who, in fact, is the head of the unitary executive branch that includes the FBI and the Justice Department."" \n \n Another prominent defense attorney who advised a client facing obstruction of justice allegations said the evidence to make such a case against Trump was still lacking. \n \n ""Did Trump talk like this because he was actually trying to pressure Comey or was he just blowing off steam? ....If you look at the obstruction cases that are brought, they involve coercion, threats and bribes. I don\'t think we\'re there yet,"" said the lawyer, who asked not to be named. \n \n Still, the lawyer, a veteran of several Washington scandals, said Trump\'s alleged comments to Comey were unwise. \n \n ""It\'s just bad judgment. Of course, if you\'re trying to give him counsel, it\'s not anything you would want him to do or say,"" the attorney said. ""Since Watergate, the most surefire way to blow yourself up is to attempt to pressure someone lower-down in the chain....It Just doesn\'t work.""', 'Multiple news outlets are now reporting that James Comey wrote in a memo that Donald Trump asked him to drop the FBI’s investigation of former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Here’s the New York Times story that started it all: \n \n President Trump asked the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, to shut down the federal investigation into Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, in an Oval Office meeting in February, according to a memo Mr. Comey wrote shortly after the meeting. “I hope you can let this go,” the president told Mr. Comey, according to the memo. \n \n The Times does not have a copy of the memo and claims instead that a Comey associate read excerpts to a reporter: \n \n Mr. Comey shared the existence of the memo with senior F.B.I. officials and close associates. The New York Times has not viewed a copy of the memo, which is unclassified, but one of Mr. Comey’s associates read parts of the memo to a Times reporter. \n \n The Trump administration is denying Trump made the request, writing in an unsigned statement: \n \n “The president has never asked Mr. Comey or anyone else to end an investigation, including any investigation involving General Flynn. . . . This is not a truthful or accurate portrayal of the conversation between the president and Mr. Comey.’’ \n \n The analysis here is pretty simple. If the memo exists, then there is compelling evidence that the president committed a potentially impeachable offense. Here is the alleged chain of events: First, Trump asked Comey to drop an investigation of a close former associate and a former senior official in his administration. Second, Comey refused. Third, weeks later Trump fired Comey. Fourth, Trump then misled the American people regarding the reason for the dismissal. Each prong is important, but it’s worth noting that the fourth prong — Trump’s deception regarding the reason for Comey’s termination — is particularly problematic in context. Deception is classic evidence of malign intent. \n \n If true, this is a serious abuse of power, and a Republican Congress would certainly impeach a Democrat if the roles were reversed. But — and this is vitally important to everyone at DEFCON 1 on Twitter — we don’t know yet if the New York Times account is true. Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr raised reasonable objections: \n \n “I actually believe the director might have told us that there’d been a request like that and it was never mentioned by him,” the North Carolina Republican told reporters. “So somebody’s going to have to do more than have anonymous sources on this one for me to believe that there’s something there.” \n \n Lindsay Graham — no fan of Trump — also raised a legitimate point: \n \n “If this happened, the FBI director should have done something about it or quit,” Graham said. “If the president asked the FBI director to do something inappropriate, the FBI director should have said no and quit.” \n \n The bottom line is that Americans need to see the memo, if it exists. The gravity of the accusation demands immediate Congressional action. Burr’s committee should subpoena that memo and every memo or other document reflecting the content of conversations between Comey and President Trump. Do it today. Burr told reporters that the “burden is on the New York Times” to produce the memo, but that’s absurd. The Times doesn’t have the ability to compel its production. House and Senate committees do, and they need to do their job. \n \n There is no good outcome here. Either there is now compelling evidence that the president committed a serious abuse of power, or the nation’s leading press outlets are dupes for a vindictive, misleading story. Either outcome violates the public trust in vital American institutions. Either outcome results in a degree of political chaos. If the memo is real and as damaging as the Times claims, the chaos is likely greater, but don’t underestimate the cultural and political damage if our nation’s most prestigious press outlets run a story of this magnitude based on a malicious fiction. It’s time for facts and documents, not anonymity and allegations. It’s time for the truth.']",6,"– President Trump is no stranger to scandal, but reports that he asked former FBI director James Comey to halt the investigation of Michael Flynn may have taken things to the next level. The report may have been the last straw for congressional Republicans, who appeared to be shifting against Trump on Tuesday night, Politico reports. House Oversight Committee Rep. Jason Chaffetz says he has asked the FBI for Comey's memos on the Trump request and other interactions with the president and he is ready to issue subpoenas if necessary. Some legal analysts say there could now be an obstruction of justice case against Trump, though it could be tough to prove. The latest: Obstruction of justice. The New York Times describes obstruction of justice as a ""murky"" charge, the exact definition of which was being hotly debated on Capitol Hill Tuesday night. Experts say it could certainly cover asking the FBI director to drop its investigation and then firing him. Any criminal case would probably have to prove that Trump had ""corrupt intentions,"" though if Trump is tried, it will be by Congress, not the courts. ""If this were anyone other than the president, it is classic, vanilla obstruction,"" former federal prosecutor Jeff Cramer tells Politico. The showdown. It now appears certain that a ""theatrical showdown"" between Trump and Comey looms, with Americans having to decide whose word they trust more, CNN reports. Comey is expected to be called to testify before Congress about the Feb. 14 meeting with Trump. Reasons for Trump to worry. The Times' sources say Comey kept detailed memos about his meetings with Trump, which ""should strike fear into the White House,"" according to the Washington Post. The notes may describe other times Trump allegedly crossed the line—and courts in previous cases have considered memos from FBI directors to be credible evidence. ""Reasonable objections."" The National Review notes that while there is ""no good outcome"" here, it is premature to say Trump is doomed to face impeachment proceedings: The allegation has not been proven, and the ""reasonable objections"" include Sen. Lindsey Graham's observation: ""If this happened, the FBI director should have done something about it or quit."" GOP reaction. Republican lawmakers including House Freedom Caucus chairman Rep. Frank Meadows are calling for an investigation of the ""disturbing"" allegation. Some have signaled that their patience is wearing out. ""This weekly scandal, this weekly controversy is unhealthy for the country. It’s a major distraction for the country and it’s just bad for the psyche of every American,"" said Florida Republican Rep. Carlos Curbelo, per Politico. Nixon comparisons. There are many comparisons to the Watergate scandal being made. Vox notes that what ended Richard Nixon's presidency wasn't the Watergate break-in itself—his involvement was never proven—but his attempt to force the FBI to abandon its investigation. Prison for the press. CNBC notes that amid the Flynn uproar, another allegation has been overlooked: Trump also allegedly asked Comey to consider imprisoning members of the press for publishing classified allegations that had been leaked."

The company is bragging that it is the first national supermarket chain to have a Ramadan marketing campaign, complete with social media. And the folks at HAMAS financier and unindicted co-conspirator, CAIR Action Network, are have allahgasms about it. I’m not surprised by this development. As longtime readers know, I haven’t set foot in Whole Paycheck a/k/a Whole Foods since I discovered (and reported to you) that the company was not only selling–but pimping and promoting–“Canaan Fair Trade” and “Palestinian Fair Trade” Olive Oil, olive oil that funds Palestinian Islamic terrorism and its supporters, including, among other things, scholarships at HAMAS terrorism universities. (More here.) \n \n Whole Foods Wishes Vegan Jihadists a Happy Ramadan \n \n After I wrote about this, Whole Foods PR hacks sent out press releases and e-mails lying and denying. But none of what the company said was true and since I wrote about this, I received many reports from Whole Foods customers that Israeli olive oil and other products had been removed from the shelves of many Whole Foods, replaced by the Palestinian terrorism olive oil. My reports didn’t stop ignoramuses like Michelle Malkin Fraudkin from blindly urging people to buy goods at jihadist-enabling Whole Foods, merely because its CEO was under fire for opposing Obamacare. Only morons–and that includes Fraudkin, bigtime–believe that the enemy of my enemy is my friend, even when they enable and financially support Islamic terrorism. \n \n And, now, there is the Ramadan crap, solely for monetary reasons. Yes, like ALL other American corporations, Whole Foods is whoring itself out to Islam for profits. And as more and more Muslims populate America through immigration and high birth rates, more and more corporations will shill for jihadist interests. It’s that simple. We’ve already seen it with Wal-Mart, Best Buy, and others. And now this from Whole Jihad Foods. The question is, how long ’til Whole Foods no longer carries pork and other non-halal products? Answer: Not long. \n \n Even scarier, the Whole Foods’ Whole Planet Foundation acknowledges “an ongoing charitable relationship” with halal foods maker Saffron Road. What exactly does that mean? Where is that Whole Foods charity money made from your Whole Foods purchases going? Is it going to hateful mosques that openly support Hezbollah and HAMAS (which is pretty much every mosque in America)? Is it going to support extremist Muslim schools? Why take the chance and continue to buy at Whole Foods? You don’t know where your money is going. But, for certain, it’s going for Ramadan promotions and giveaways. \n \n Check out this blatant Islamo-pandering from Whole Foods’ “Whole Story” blog: \n \n More: \n \n Whole Foods has become the first prominent supermarket chain to run a Ramadan marketing campaign–and they’re hoping Muslim customers will return the favor as they break fast. Even though Muslims traditionally forego meals during the day, lavish evening Ramadan meals could mean big bucks for the natural foods giant … as well as brand loyalty from a demographic not traditionally courted by megastore advertising. Whole Foods is teaming up with Halal frozen entree brand Saffron Road (who sell a variety of Indian-, Thai-, and Moroccan-flavored dinners) to host several promoted blog items on Whole Foods’ website along with sponsored giveaways of Saffron Road food and supermarket gift certificates. Additional content for the campaign is being added by Yvonne Maffei of the My Halal Kitchen blog. While it is a relatively small promotion, it also marks a new benchmark for the Muslim-American community: the first coordinated Ramadan promotion by a national supermarket chain. . . . The “campaign focuses on reaching Muslim consumers online where they are already having conversations about halal foods, grocery shopping, and preparing for Ramadan,” Saffron Road spokesperson Lisa Mabe tells Fast Company. Saffron Road maintains a heavy social media presence and an ongoing charitable relationship with Whole Foods’ Whole Planet foundation, and hopes the promotion will further strengthen their brand awareness. . . . With Whole Foods’ self-consciously granola self-presentation and liberal-, cosmopolitan-skewing customer base, they are the ideal chain to attempt a marketing project aimed squarely at Muslim-American consumers. \n \n Here’s a tip, Whole Foods: there is NOTHING “cosmopolitan” about Islam. In fact, Islam is the antonym to cosmopolitan. Retro is in. Retro back to the year 622 and the values of savages will NEVER be in. \n \n Whole Foods . . . For the Organically Conscious Jihadist.

He moves slowly, and his hearing and sight are not what they used to be. Over the years, ’60′s’ resident curmudgeon has been criticized frequently for being out of touch with contemporary culture. \n \n Rooney could not be reached for comment. CBS News is expected to confirm the move soon. \n \n In a June 2010 interview with TVNewser, Rooney said that he intended to work at ‘60’ until he “dropped dead.” He added: “Until somebody tells me different, I’m not going to quit.” \n \n No word on who will take over Rooney’s two-minute slot. Regardless, he’s expected to keep his CBS office, where he shows up six days a week, sometimes seven. An accomplished author, Rooney will likely concentrate on his writing. \n \n Rooney joined CBS in 1949 as a writer for “Arthur Godfrey’s Talent Scouts.” Until a few years ago, he wrote his pieces on a manual typewriter from his days as a London correspondent for Stars and Stripes during World War II. \n \n Longevity at ’60′ is nothing new. Original correspondent Mike Wallace, 93, worked full-time until 2006, then popped up occasionally until ’08. \n \n The late Don Hewitt, ’60′ creator and long-time executive producer, was 81 when he was nudged from the throne in 2004. He died five years later. \n \n > Update: CBS press release after the jump. “There’s nobody like Andy and there never will be. He’ll hate hearing this, but he’s an American original,” said Jeff Fager, chairman CBS News and the executive producer of “60 Minutes.” \n \n ANDY ROONEY TO STEP DOWN FROM HIS “60 MINUTES” ROLE \n \n Andy Rooney will announce on this Sunday’s 60 MINUTES that it will be his last regular appearance on the broadcast. Rooney, 92, has been featured on 60 MINUTES since 1978. \n \n He will make the announcement in his regular essay at the end of the program, his 1097th original essay for 60 MINUTES. It will be preceded by a segment in which Rooney looks back on his career in an interview with Morley Safer. \n \n “There’s nobody like Andy and there never will be. He’ll hate hearing this, but he’s an American original,” said Jeff Fager, chairman CBS News and the executive producer of 60 MINUTES. “His contributions to 60 MINUTES are immeasurable; he’s also a great friend. It’s harder for him to do it every week, but he will always have the ability to speak his mind on 60 MINUTES when the urge hits him.” \n \n Rooney began his run on 60 MINUTES in July 1978 with an essay about the reporting of automobile fatalities on the Independence Day weekend. He became a regular feature that fall, alternating weeks with the dueling James J. Kilpatrick and Shana Alexander before getting the end slot all to himself in the fall of 1979. In Rooney’s first full season as the 60 MINUTES commentator, the broadcast was the number one program for the first time. \n \n He had been a contributor to 60 MINUTES since the program’s inception. During the first season of the broadcast in 1968 he appeared a few times in silhouette with Palmer Williams, 60 MINUTES’ senior producer, in a short-lived segment called “Ipso and Facto.” It was one of many experiments the program’s creator, Don Hewitt, tried as an end for the program. Hewitt settled with the Point/Counterpoint segment that Kilpatrick and Alexander appeared in for a few years before finding the perfect coda for 60 MINUTES in Andy Rooney. \n \n Rooney also produced 60 MINUTES segments for Harry Reasoner during the broadcast’s first few seasons. \n \n He wrote his first television essay, a longer precursor of the type he does on 60 MINUTES, in 1964, “An Essay on Doors.” From 1962 to 1968, he collaborated with Reasoner, with Rooney writing and producing and Reasoner narrating, on such notable CBS News specials as “An Essay on Bridges” (1965), “An Essay on Hotels” (1966), “An Essay on Women” (1967), “An Essay on Chairs” (1968) and “The Strange Case of the English Language” (1968). That same year, he wrote two CBS News specials in the series “Of Black America.” His script for “Black History: Lost, Stolen or Strayed” won him the first of four Emmy awards. \n \n “An Essay on War” (1971), done for PBS, was his first appearance on television as himself and won Rooney his third Writers Guild Award. \n \n Later, he wrote, produced and narrated a series of broadcasts for CBS News on various aspects of American life, including “Mr. Rooney Goes to Washington,” for which he won a Peabody Award, “Andy Rooney Takes Off,” “Mr. Rooney Goes to Work” and “Mr. Rooney Goes to Dinner.” Beginning in 1979, he wrote a weekly syndicated newspaper column that was recognized by the National Society of Newspaper Columnists when he was presented with its Ernie Pyle Lifetime Achievement Award in June 2003. That September, he was honored with a Lifetime Achievement Emmy. The Overseas Press Club gave him its President’s Award in 2010 for his reporting in World War II for The Stars and Stripes. \n \n Rooney joined CBS in 1949 as a writer for “Arthur Godfrey’s Talent Scouts,” a Top 10 hit that was number one in 1952.

Barbara Morgan, an officer with the Lehigh County Humane Society, says she expects to file charges against the owner of the home near Allentown where the dogs were discovered, the AP reports. Many of the dogs, which Morgan says range from weeks old to senior-aged, were sickly and underweight. Staffers were called to the home over noise complaints, and they were shocked by what they found. ""When we first got the complaint, we were told it was 25 dogs, so when we first got out there, we were not prepared for what we saw,"" the humane society's executive director, Mary Shafer, tells WFMZ. ""I never saw so many dogs [in] one little space in my life,"" Morgan adds. She notes that it's believed the dogs had been inherited from another person, and that the new owner simply became overwhelmed with their care. The Lehigh County Humane Society says in a Facebook post the dogs are being evaluated, and that information on adoption will be available in coming days. Until then, the organization is in need of donations to help care for them, including wet food, towels, sheets, and leashes. Officials say the owner may get hit with animal cruelty charges."
14,"['This was the plan to move George Zimmerman out of the Seminole County Jail and make him disappear: He would be outfitted in concealed body armor and driven away by an armed guard in a rental vehicle that had been checked to make sure no one had secretly placed a GPS tracking device on it. \n \n He would be whisked away to a tourist resort, according to a recently-released “jail escort plan,” where he would then go into the handicapped stall of the men’s bathroom and change into a new shirt, hat and glasses. \n \n Zimmerman, facing second-degree murder charges for the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, would then walk to a different vehicle and be driven to a safe house. All the while, bodyguards would watch for paparazzi, “aerial” and “negative counter surveillance” and be on the lookout for people wanting to harm or humiliate their client. \n \n The plan was put together by an Orlando private detective whose company, Associated Investigative Services Inc., last week filed suit against Zimmerman and his attorney, Mark O’Mara, claiming they owe $27,000 for security services. \n \n The company’s invoices, attached to the suit, show that it billed Zimmerman and O’Mara $66,000 for 21 days of protection — an average of more than $3,100 a day — even though Zimmerman was still in the Seminole County Jail during seven of those days. \n \n During one five-day period, the agency billed Zimmerman and O’Mara more than $5,100 a day, the invoices show. \n \n O’Mara said last week that he paid the company $40,000, that the charges appeared to be exorbitant and that he never signed a contract. Zimmerman is now being protected under a plan that costs $700 a week, O’Mara said. \n \n Stephen Milbrath, the Orlando attorney who filed suit, said O’Mara was bound by an oral contract. The bodyguards took on a challenging assignment: to make a high-profile, widely hated man invisible and safe. \n \n Zimmerman, a 29-year-old Neighborhood Watch volunteer, has said he acted in self-defense, but the killing ignited racial tensions and sent thousands of people to the streets at rallies across the country. It prompted hate mail and death threats — and not just to Zimmerman but also to his parents, who abandoned their Lake Mary home and went into hiding. \n \n Zimmerman is now free on $1 million bail, living with his wife and a different bodyguard at a secret location in Seminole County, his whereabouts tracked by a GPS device. It’s not a happy life, according to O’Mara. Zimmerman is jobless, isolated and mostly stays indoors. His weight has ballooned. \n \n The bodyguards’ lawsuit, filed Dec. 21 in state circuit court in Orange County, shows the lengths to which Zimmerman has gone to stay out of sight. \n \n On June 28, according to the suit, O’Mara phoned Chris M. Rumbaugh, an Orlando private detective and former Orange County deputy, undercover drug agent and SWAT team member. \n \n Zimmerman was likely to be released from jail soon and needed a way to safely disappear then receive around-the-clock protection. \n \n Rumbaugh’s company put together the plan, according to the court documents. It’s not clear whether it was fully carried out. He did not return a phone call Thursday; neither did O’Mara. But the plan called for Zimmerman, his wife Shellie, other family members and at times, O’Mara to be protected by a seven-member team of bodyguards. \n \n The guards would take eight- or 12-hour shifts and live in a room next to the Zimmermans, at a tourist-area hotel equipped with a kitchenette, records show. The agency billed Zimmerman and O’Mara for around-the-clock protection from June 29 to July 18, the invoices show.', 'George Zimmerman, the neighborhood watch volunteer facing second-degree murder charges for the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, is being sued by an Orlando private company claiming they are owed $27,000 for private security services. \n \n The Miami Herald reports that Associated Investigative Services Inc. filed suit against Zimmerman and his attorney, Mark O\'Mara, for failing to pay in full a $66,000 security bill for 21 days of protection —about $3,100 dollars a day— even though Zimmerman was still in Seminole County Jail during seven of those days. \n \n The security team helped plan Zimmerman\'s exit of the Seminole County Jail, outfitting the defendant with concealed body armor while protecting him with an armed guard.

Mall traffic in North America has declined sharply, while shoppers who have traditionally been loyal to the so-called middle market have gravitated toward brands at extremes of the style and price spectrum. \n \n The trends have played well for e-commerce giants like Amazon, fast-fashion brands like H&M and Zara, and luxury houses like Gucci. But it has left companies like Michael Kors — once the runaway leader of the “accessible luxury market” — exposed. \n \n \n \n Jimmy Choo, which shot to prominence thanks to celebrity patrons like Princess Diana and the “Sex and the City” star Sarah Jessica Parker, could give Michael Kors a new avenue for growth.', 'These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

Kering houses brands including Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent and Alexander McQueen. \n \n Jimmy Choo put itself up for sale in April after its majority-owner JAB, the investment vehicle of Germany’s billionaire Reimann family, signaled its intention to focus on consumer goods instead. \n \n Jimmy Choo will continue to be led by the same management team, including Creative Director Sandra Choi who joined the company at its inception. \n \n Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan acted for Michael Kors on the deal, while Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, Liberum and RBC Europe acted for Jimmy Choo.']",3,"– Shoes and handbags go together like … well, Jimmy Choo and Michael Kors, now that the latter has agreed to purchase the former for $1.2 billion, the Wall Street Journal reports.

Reuters notes that Michael Kors has lost 65% of its market value since 2014. Michael Kors' sales may have taken a hit by the company permitting its product to be sold at a discount in outlets and department stores, making it harder to command full price in its own.

The new executive order that Obama signed separately authorizes the Treasury, if Obama so decides in the future, to impose sanctions against additional Russian entities — which he described as constituting key sectors of the economy — in the event that Russia takes further action such as invading the rest of Ukraine. \n \n In Crimea, Ukrainian troops continued to face threats Thursday, as a group of armed men boarded a Ukrainian ship in the Black Sea port of Sevastopol. \n \n Vladislav Seleznyov, a Ukrainian Defense Ministry spokesman, said about 20 gunmen boarded the anti-submarine corvette Ternopol shortly after sunset Thursday and seized it, using flash grenades. There were no reported injuries. \n \n Among those on the new sanctions list are government and business leaders who have been close to Russian President Vladimir Putin, some for many years. They include some of the richest men in Russia, as well as one Russian who is in the oil-trade business in Switzerland. \n \n Connections to St. Petersburg, Putin’s home town, abound. The list targets several of the business leaders who have profited the most during Putin’s years in power through their connections to him. \n \n The list includes key officials such as Sergei Naryshkin, speaker of the lower house of parliament, and Sergei Ivanov, head of the presidential administration, as well as influential Russians in the banking and business communities. Among them is Yuri Kovalchuk, an old Putin friend from St. Petersburg who is known as “Putin’s banker.” \n \n Kovalchuk and another person on the list, Putin aide Andrei Fursenko, are owners of Bank Rossiya, the sanctioned bank. \n \n Bank Rossiya was described as having $10 billion in assets and as handling financial transactions for many senior Russian officials. \n \n Long-time Putin associates Arkady and Boris Rotenberg also were named. A senior U.S. official pointed out that the St. Petersburg-based brothers were close to the center of power, receiving $7 billion in contracts connected to the Sochi Olympics. \n \n The senior Obama administration official described the targets as “senior government officials, cronies and a crony bank.” \n \n Briefing reporters Thursday after Obama’s speech, the official took a stern tone. “We saw some bluster earlier in the week that sanctions would have no impact. I would suggest if they have any interest in doing business outside the U.S., they will have difficulty doing so.” \n \n The bank will be frozen out of the dollar, and correspondent accounts with U.S. banks will be terminated, the official said, adding that sanctioned individuals “will be prevented from operating around the world to the greatest extent possible.” \n \n The other Americans banned from entering Russia are Caroline Atkinson, deputy national security adviser for international economic affairs; presidential aides Daniel Pfeiffer and Benjamin Rhodes; Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee; Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.) and Sen. Daniel Coats (R-Ind.). \n \n “We have warned repeatedly that using sanctions is a double-edged sword and will hit the United States back,” the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement posted on its Web site. \n \n “Washington has been repeatedly assured that it is unacceptable and counterproductive to talk with our country in such a way,” it said. “However, the U.S. seems to continue believing blindly in the efficiency of such methods, taken from the arsenal of the past, and does not want to admit the obvious — in complete accordance with international laws and the U.N. charter, Crimean residents voted democratically for rejoining Russia. This decision can be liked or not, but it concerns reality, which has to be taken into account.” \n \n The statement added: “There should be no doubts — we will respond adequately to every hostile attack.” \n \n Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Secretary of State John F. Kerry spoke again by phone Thursday about Ukraine, and Lavrov said the United States must stop “condoning” the activities of the right-wing Ukrainian group Right Sector and the Svoboda party, the ministry said in a separate statement. \n \n “Lavrov stressed that the decision on Crimea’s reunification with Russia reflected the expression of the will of the absolute majority of its people, that it may not be reviewed and must be respected,” the statement said. Lavrov, it said, complained about “ongoing violence” by “ultranationalist and extremist forces,” who he claimed were targeting businessmen, journalists, dissenters, Russian speakers and “our compatriots.” \n \n Responding to his inclusion in the ban, McCain said in a statement: “I guess this means my spring break in Siberia is off, my Gazprom stock is lost, and my secret bank account in Moscow is frozen. Nonetheless, I will never cease my efforts on behalf of the freedom, independence, and territorial integrity of Ukraine, including Crimea.” \n \n Menendez said in a statement: “President Putin’s military invasion and annexation of Crimea is brutal, totally unacceptable, and sadly returns us to a period of Cold War aggression and hostility. It doesn’t have to be this way, but if standing up for the Ukrainian people, their freedom, their hard earned democracy, and sovereignty means I’m sanctioned by Putin, so be it.” \n \n The vote in Russia’s lower house, the State Duma, to annex Crimea was 443 to 1. The measure needed 300 votes to pass. \n \n The lone Duma dissenter, Ilya Ponomaryov, later tweeted, “The best intentions have led us to a big political mistake: I vote against the war.” \n \n [Meet the one Russian lawmaker who voted against annexing Crimea.] \n \n The bill is scheduled to be taken up Friday by the upper house, the Federation Council, where expected approval will make Crimea officially part of the country under Russian law — despite the insistence of the United States, Europe and others that it remain part of Ukraine. \n \n In Crimea on Thursday, Ukraine’s influence over the disputed region seemed visibly on the wane, with military bases now under the Russian flag and Ukrainian banks closed for the time being. The Ukrainian Defense Ministry said it was preparing a plan to withdraw its remaining troops and officials. \n \n Still, there were hints of a potentially durable conflict, as both Europe and the United States pledged further financial sanctions against Russia, and officials in Kiev and Moscow talked of trade, visa and other penalties they might impose against each other. \n \n Lavrov, testifying Thursday in favor of the bill in the Duma, warned Ukraine not to seize property located within its borders of the Russian state-owned energy giant, Gazprom. He said such a move would have negative consequences for Ukraine. \n \n “I think that it is in no one’s interests to begin this battle,” he said. “This could lead to a quite complex chain reaction, from which I suppose Ukraine will not benefit.” \n \n Lavrov said that he thought Ukraine’s threat to leave the Commonwealth of Independent States, a post-Soviet grouping, is essentially a “propaganda” ploy, but he added that Russia will do nothing to stop it if that’s what Ukraine wishes. \n \n However, Russia’s sanitary service almost simultaneously announced that Ukrainian livestock will be barred from Russia if the country leaves the CIS. \n \n The Foreign Ministry said in a statement posted on its Web site that it regrets Ukraine’s intention to require Russian visitors to obtain visas. \n \n United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon visited Putin in the Kremlin on Thursday and said he was deeply concerned about the Crimean crisis. \n \n “We highly appreciate your efforts,” Putin said, before they began private talks. \n \n European leaders on Thursday weighed additional sanctions against Russia, a day after Ukrainian troops were forced to abandon their bases in Crimea and prepared to evacuate the peninsula. \n \n German Chancellor Angela Merkel told her parliament that Europe would expand the number of individuals punished with travel bans and asset freezes for their role in the Russian takeover of Crimea. But as European Union leaders prepared to meet in Brussels, there was little sign they would impose the sort of broader financial penalties that many analysts see as necessary to change Russian behavior. \n \n U.S. officials have repeatedly emphasized their close consultation with Europe, and the announcement of initial sanctions early this week was coordinated with the allies. \n \n The European Union on Monday imposed sanctions on 21 Russian and Ukrainian officials, and the United States announced sanctions the same day against 11 people — seven top Russian government officials and politicians and four Ukrainians, including ousted president Viktor Yanukovych and two Crimean separatist leaders. \n \n Speaking from Brussels, interim Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk said Thursday that he did not believe Russia would stop at Crimea. “It’s crystal clear for us that Russian authorities will try to move further and escalate the situation in southern and eastern Ukraine,” Yatsenyuk told Bloomberg News. \n \n In Crimea, meanwhile, the Ukrainian presence continued to ebb. Ukrainian banks were closed Thursday, with signs taped to the doors saying they no longer have authority to operate in Crimea because they are on foreign territory. They said they are making arrangements to reopen and that depositors will not lose their savings. \n \n Leonid Polyakov, Ukraine’s deputy minister of defense, said a plan has been prepared to evacuate military families from Crimea, but the troops themselves have not yet been given orders. \n \n Ukraine said Wednesday it would seek U.N. support in declaring Crimea a demilitarized zone so that its troops could be relocated to Ukraine proper, effectively acknowledging that it had lost the region despite vows it would never cede to Russia. \n \n In the announcement, the secretary of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, Andriy Parubiy, said his country would hold joint military exercises with the United States and Britain. He did not provide details, but a Pentagon spokesman in Washington said the annual multinational exercises were previously planned and will be held in the summer. \n \n Parubiy also said Ukraine would leave the Commonwealth of Independent States, an alliance of 11 nations that were part of the Soviet Union before it broke up \n \n in 1991. It is led by Russia, and Ukraine’s departure echoes steps taken by Georgia after two of its territories broke away in 2008 with the support of Moscow. \n \n Russia’s storming of the Ukrainian military facilities in Crimea, and the positioning of forces outside another base, served as a tense reminder of how unresolved the situation remains in Crimea even as Russia declares its absorption of the region an established fact. Ukrainian troops largely gave way without resistance Wednesday, though tension may be building as they face an apparent choice of becoming Russian soldiers and sailors, or moving from Crimea and maintaining their allegiance to Kiev. \n \n Russia is also unlikely to agree to the terms of a demilitarized zone, which would require it to withdraw troops from the region while Ukraine pulls its forces out. \n \n Russia moved swiftly to step up its occupation of Crimea after Putin on Tuesday signed a treaty annexing the peninsula. Its most significant action was the takeover of the Ukrainian navy headquarters in Sevastopol, where pro-Russia militias and Russian regular troops stormed the base and checked Ukrainians at the gate as they left toting bags of personal belongings. \n \n The Ukrainian rear admiral in command, Serhiy Haiduk, was taken out of the compound in a car, and Ukrainian officials charged that the Russians had taken him hostage. \n \n Ukrainian President Oleksandr Turchynov on Wednesday gave Crimean authorities three hours to release Haiduk and stop harassing the Ukrainian military or face “appropriate measures.” The deadline passed without apparent action. \n \n However, Haiduk was released Thursday morning, according to Turchynov’s office. Several pro-Ukrainian activists also were set free. \n \n Branigin reported from Washington.

Police say baby Areej Ali's mother was waiting for the elevator in the Brooklyn building Thursday morning when the doors opened, only for her and the stroller to plunge down the shaft, the AP reports. The baby girl's mother, who was injured in the fall, told investigators that she had stepped forward without realizing that there was no elevator behind the doors. The New York Daily News reports that mother and baby fell several feet onto the roof of an elevator, which then plummeted around eight stories. The baby was pronounced dead at Coney Island Hospital. The Daily News reports that there have been at least 20 complaints about the 23-story building's elevators in the last two years alone, and a mechanic was working on them at the time of the accident. Residents say they are shocked by the little girl's death—but not overly surprised to learn that the building's elevators were involved. ""My heart is really bleeding for them,"" a resident and mother of four tells the New York Post. ""This always happens in this building. They come in to fix the elevator and a week later it's broken again. I have a 2-year-old. I have to look out for him."""

In its eighth report, the wedding site reveals in a press release that when it came to the 16,000 brides and grooms married in 2014 and then surveyed, most couples split that bill evenly with the bride's parents: On average, each footed 43% of the bill, with the groom's parents chipping in 12%. In fact, only 12% of couples paid for their weddings themselves. And sticking to the budget is apparently tough: 45% of couples didn't manage to do so (another 23% didn't even make a budget). As for the dress, brides spent an average $1,357. The survey also found that the most expensive place to wed was Manhattan, where the average price tag was $76,328 (which is actually down almost $10,000 from the previous year), while the least expensive was Utah, where weddings cost less than half the national average at $15,257. Couples are spending more per head, too, as the average guest list shrunk from 149 in 2009 to 136 in 2014. On the subject of marriage and money, according to a February Redfin survey, 38% of millennials say they have or intend to put off marrying so they can afford to buy a home, reports Bloomberg Business. MarketWatch notes the average wedding price happens to be $92 less than a 15% down payment on a $208,700 home—the country's median price last quarter.

""The President\'s tax cuts and regulatory reforms will further enhance the U.S. economy and continue to increase prosperity for the American people."" \n \n Analysts have pointed to a slew of reasons for the sell-off, including increasing wage pressures and high valuations. \n \n President Donald Trump has long cited stock market gains as evidence of the positive effect of his presidency on the economy, even going as far as to call the stock market a good report card for his job performance. \n \n In an interview with CNN, Hogan Gidley, another White House deputy press secretary, said that despite Trump\'s taking credit for the rise, the drop should not be pinned on the president. \n \n ""It\'s still in a very strong place,"" Gidley said. ""It\'s still exorbitantly higher than it was when he took office."" \n \n The Dow closed at 18,589.69 on November 9, 2016, meaning the index is still up roughly 30% since Trump won the presidency and just over 23% since he took office in January 2017. \n \n ""On Friday, where you referenced, we also saw some really good news in the economy, which is wage growth rising at the fastest pace than it has in any point in eight years, since 2009,"" Shah said on Monday. ""Unemployment, nationally, is at 4.1%. That\'s the lowest level in almost two decades."" \n \n Shah said the recent positive economic news was directly tied to Trump\'s policies, touting wage boosts by major companies since the new tax law was enacted. \n \n The law ""is leading to hundreds of billions of dollars of investment in the United States,"" Shah said. ""Hundreds of companies giving additional raises, bonuses, benefits, and everything else to employees. We\'re very excited about the strength of the economy."" \n \n For the latest updates on the sell-off, check Markets Insider»', 'NEW YORK — President Donald Trump is learning a basic and painful lesson of Wall Street: Stocks also go down. \n \n A global market sell-off accelerated Monday with the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunging nearly 1,600 points at one point in roller-coaster afternoon trading. After a volatile session, the Dow ended down 1,175 points, or 4.6%, at 24,346. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n It was the largest ever single-day point drop for the Dow and it rattled both Wall Street and Washington, abruptly ending a remarkable period of placid markets where it often seemed the only direction was up. A young generation of Wall Street traders has never seen the kind of whipsaw action that seized markets Monday. \n \n While the point drop was the largest, Monday’s decline did not rival some of the bloodiest days in Wall Street history given how fast the Dow has raced ahead in recent years. On Oct. 19, 1987, the notorious “Black Monday,” the blue chip average gave up nearly 23 percent of its value. On Sept. 29, 2008, in the depths of the financial crisis, the Dow sank nearly 7 percent. \n \n But it was still a large and shocking decline. It arrived amid growing concern that an economy juiced by a massive corporate tax cut, and already at full employment, could overheat and require forceful action from a new and untested Federal Reserve chairman — installed by Trump — to cool things down. \n \n On top of concerns about rising inflation, the tax cuts are already increasing the federal government’s need to borrow and accelerating the date by which Congress must raise the federal debt limit. And as of Monday, there was still no plan in Washington to raise the limit and avoid a catastrophic default. \n \n The result is that a president who tossed aside traditional presidential caution in cheerleading the stock market now stands poised to take the blame for any correction. \n \n “This is a risk that the president clearly set himself up for,” said Charles Gabriel of Capital Alpha Partners, a Washington research firm. “Until now, Trump’s had kind of a free ride in this market and taken so much credit for it, even though so much of it was due to easy-money policies from Janet Yellen and the Fed. Now she’s out the door and volatility is back.” \n \n Morning Money Political intelligence on Washington and Wall Street — weekday mornings, in your inbox.

But he is a lesser-known figure on Wall Street. \n \n And if the recent jump in hourly wages gets pushed up even more by corporations handing out bonuses and pay bumps in the wake of the tax bill, the Fed may be forced to move faster to fight inflation — offsetting the economic benefits of the tax cuts. \n \n Interest rates are already rising as the government discloses it will have to ramp up borrowing in 2018 to make up for revenue lost to the tax-cut bill. Higher rates on government bonds make stocks look less appealing. They also can make it harder for businesses and consumers to borrow and spend, possibly slowing the economy. \n \n On top of all this, stocks blew past traditional valuations as they raced ahead in 2017 and early 2018. A widely followed ratio designed by economists Robert Shiller and John Campbell that compares stock prices to corporate earnings hit 34 this year. The historic median for the ratio is 16. \n \n This could have served as a warning to Trump not to associate himself too closely with a rally that looked tenuous to many Wall Street analysts. Instead, Trump bragged about the gains at every opportunity on Twitter and even in his State of the Union address. \n \n “The stock market has smashed one record after another, gaining $8 trillion in value,” Trump said in his address to Congress. \n \n Last week’s decline alone wiped out nearly $1 trillion in that value, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. \n \n Trump has regularly boasted on Twitter that the stock market rise, which actually began in 2009 at the end of the last recession, is the direct result of his policies on taxes and regulation. \n \n “Business is looking better than ever with business enthusiasm at record levels. Stock Market at an all-time high. That doesn\'t just happen!” he tweeted last August. \n \n Other senior administration officials such as Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn have also tied the market’s gains directly to Trump policy moves. \n \n The latest declines left a White House that has basked in the glow of the market rally scrambling to explain away the massive decline and calm frayed investor nerves. \n \n “The President’s focus is on our long-term economic fundamentals, which remain exceptionally strong, with strengthening U.S. economic growth, historically low unemployment, and increasing wages for American workers,"" White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement. ""The President’s tax cuts and regulatory reforms will further enhance the U.S. economy and continue to increase prosperity for the American people.” \n \n Stocks are still far higher than they were when Trump took office, but the return of sharp volatility — and the possibility of further declines — has now put Trump in the uncomfortable position of being directly associated with daily market moves. \n \n “Presidents historically haven’t commented on the stock market anywhere near as much as President Trump has,” said Ed Yardeni, market analyst at Yardeni Research Inc. “I think Barack Obama said something in 2009 about how he thought stock prices seemed low, and that was about it. So he obviously likes to take credit for the positives. Now what does he say when the market suddenly goes down?” \n \n Dow Jones erases its gains for the year in the largest single-day point drop \n \n So far, Trump has not weighed in publicly on the market declines. A White House official sent a statement to CNBC on Monday expressing concern over the drop. “We\'re always concerned when the market loses any value, but we\'re also confident in the economy\'s fundamentals,” the statement said. \n \n Both the U.S. and global economies are in fact on stronger ground than they have been in years, leading many Wall Street analysts to suggest that the current bout of selling represents something of a healthy correction to stock market valuations and not the beginning of a bear market. \n \n Unemployment in the U.S. is low, corporate profits are strong, and growth in the first quarter is currently running as fast as 5.2 percent, according to the most recent estimate from the Atlanta Fed. Europe and Japan are also growing, a kind of synchronized global expansion not seen in recent years. \n \n “Corrections of 5% to 15% occur on average once a calendar year,” Jason Pride, director of investment strategy at Glenmede, wrote in a client note Monday. “Further, history has shown the market capable of making it through such corrections and going on to positive returns for the full year period, particularly in cases of ongoing expansions.” \n \n The market may indeed quickly reverse course in the coming days and go on to move higher over the course of the year, allowing to Trump to start bragging again and possibly aiding Republicans in their efforts to tout the tax-cut bill and limit potential losses in the midterm elections. \n \n But significant risks lie ahead in Washington. The biggest is whether Powell and the Fed can navigate a difficult path between allowing the economy to thrive and wages to rise without letting potentially crushing inflation take hold. And if Powell and his colleagues decide they need to pump the brakes hard, that could leave them in direct conflict with a president not shy about criticizing people he himself put into office. \n \n And it could leave Trump with regret about jettisoning a Fed chair whom Wall Street came to love. “For the past four years, Yellen was the fairy godmother of the bull market,” said Yardeni. “And now that she’s gone, maybe we don’t get the fairy dust anymore.”', 'Late in 2007, a year into his tenure as George W. Bush\'s secretary of defense and just over a year before the end of Bush\'s second term as president, I asked Robert Gates if he\'d thought of staying on in the next administration. Many Republicans and Democrats were hoping he would, seeing him as a moderate professional sweeping away the shambles left by his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld. But Gates seemed uninterested, even hostile to the notion. ""The circumstances under which I would do that,"" he replied, ""are inconceivable to me."" \n \n Over the next several months, he repeated the line to other inquiring journalists. He carried around a key chain with an electronic screen that counted down the number of days until he could leave Washington (a city he clearly disliked) and retire with his wife to their lakeside home in the Pacific Northwest. \n \n And yet, when President-elect Barack Obama asked him to remain at the Defense Department\'s helm, Gates instantly agreed. \n \n This summer, sitting in his spacious third-floor office in the Pentagon\'s E Ring, I asked him why. How was he persuaded to commit an ""inconceivable"" act? Gates confessed (and ""confess"" is the word he used) that his sighs of longing to leave in the months leading up to the 2008 election were part of a ""covert action"" to convince everyone that he didn\'t want to stay, in the hopes that nobody would ask him to. ""I really didn\'t want to be asked,"" he said. But, he added, that was because all along he knew ""that if I were asked, I would say, \'Yes.\' In the middle of two wars, kids out there getting hurt and dying, there was no way that I was going to say, \'No.\'"" \n \n It\'s a revealing story about Gates: the old-school statesman who believes that party politics should stop at the water\'s edge and that it\'s unseemly to turn down a president, any president (he has worked for seven now, all of them since Richard Nixon except Bill Clinton); but also the canny inside player and career intelligence officer who knows how to manage perceptions. Although he\'s the only Bush holdover in Obama\'s cabinet (for that matter, the only defense secretary ever to keep the job after a party switch in the White House), Gates now has extraordinary influence on Obama. Rahm Emanuel, Obama\'s chief of staff, said in a phone interview that Gates is ""an essential part of the team,"" adding, ""The president trusts him implicitly."" \n \n Gates is a paradox in another sense: A self-described protector of institutions, he has also, in less than four years on the job, changed the way the Pentagon does business and the military fights wars more than any defense secretary since Robert McNamara. \n \n But there\'s a haunting dimension to this comparison. In his first two-and-a-half years running the Pentagon for President John F. Kennedy, McNamara brought rational analysis to weapons procurement and shifted military planning from ""massive retaliation"" (with an emphasis on nuclear bombs) to ""flexible response"" (and a buildup of conventional defenses in Europe). Yet this side of his tenure is completely overshadowed by the disaster in Vietnam. \n \n Only somewhat less dramatically, Gates has heralded a shift in military planning from the ""major combat operations"" anticipated in the Cold War to the ""asymmetrical conflicts"" against insurgents and rogue states that plague the 21st-century world. Yet Gates, too, understands that his legacy will be shaped much more by the outcome of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq -- wars that he did not initiate, and occasionally had doubts about continuing, but which he now undoubtedly and unhesitantly owns. \n \n When Gates accepted Bush\'s plea to replace Rumsfeld after the 2006 midterm elections, he did so with two aims: to improve security in Iraq, which seemed to be spiraling out of control, and to restore ruptured relations with the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Congress. \n \n Gates had spent most of his life in the classified cloisters of the government as a Russia specialist in the CIA, rising from junior analyst to director in some of the darkest days of the Cold War, with a stint as deputy national security advisor in the White House of Bush\'s father. But he\'d never worked at the Pentagon. Because he arrived with little time and a narrow mission, he felt no need or obligation to play the role of steward. He looked around as an inside-outsider, and he was appalled by what he saw. \n \n U.S. troops were fighting and dying in two foreign wars, but the Pentagon bureaucracy was shuffling through its peacetime paces. The Army and the Marines, for example, had a new armored vehicle, the MRAP, which could provide greater protection against Iraqi roadside bombs and save many troops\' lives. But the brass were doing nothing to accelerate production. Similarly, the Air Force had a new generation of unmanned aerial vehicles, ""drones"" equipped with real-time video cameras and remote-control-fired missiles; troops in the field were clamoring for more, but Air Force leaders were not stepping up deployment. \n \n Gates quickly intervened, taking both programs outside normal channels. He added $16 billion to build more MRAPs on a crash schedule. And he fired the Air Force\'s chief of staff, Gen T. Michael Moseley, in part for negligence with the nuclear command, but mainly, according to knowledgeable officials, for his sluggishness on the drones. Gates replaced him with Gen. Norton Schwartz, head of the Air Force\'s unglamorous Transportation Command. He picked Schwartz because he had tirelessly worked out a way, at Gates\'s request, to speed the air delivery of MRAPs to Iraq; that is, he\'d acted as if a war was going on. (Schwartz\'s promotion made him the first Air Force chief of staff to come up through the ranks as neither a bomber pilot nor a fighter pilot; the move marked the beginning of a huge cultural shift in that branch of the military.) \n \n Gates also noticed that the Army\'s most innovative colonels -- brigade commanders who not only understood counterinsurgency theory but practiced it in Iraqi cities and villages -- were getting stalled in their careers by generals with much less battlefield experience and who were wedded to Cold War precepts of combat. So, near the end of 2007, Gates called on Gen. David Petraeus, then the U.S. commander in Iraq and the architect of the counterinsurgency strategy there, to chair that year\'s Army promotion board, which would advance 40 colonels to the rank of brigadier general. More than a dozen of the Army\'s promising colonels, at least one of whom had been passed over twice, got their stars. With this single stroke, the Army\'s culture -- the signals sent to the troops of what kind of soldiers get promoted and what kind don\'t -- changed dramatically. \n \n There was much more to do but too little time before Bush\'s presidency expired. So Gates began giving a series of public speeches. Their main theme was that the military needed to embrace the 21st century in its deployments, training, operations, and weapons buying. It needed, specifically, to shift away from what he described as ""baroque"" single-purpose weapons designed for Cold War scenarios (or big wars against big powers in a distant future that wasn\'t likely ever to happen) toward cheaper, more versatile weapons better suited to the low-intensity conflicts the United States was actually fighting. In an almost unprecedented move, Gates also called repeatedly for more funding for the Pentagon\'s traditional bureaucratic rivals in the State Department, warning of the ""creeping militarization"" of U.S. foreign policy. \n \n Gates was explicitly laying out an agenda for the next defense secretary. Then he became him. Or, as he now puts it, ""I punted all these balls to my successor and discovered I was the receiver."" In the first half of Obama\'s term, he has followed through, catching the punts and running with them farther and faster than anyone expected. (One exception is the notion of transferring money to the State Department; that hasn\'t happened.) \n \n Even before Obama\'s term formally began, Gates launched a three-month review of every major line item in the half-trillion-dollar defense budget, drawing the entire building -- the highest-level civilian analysts and military officers -- into the process. By April 2009, his teams had compiled a list of 50 programs primed for change. Gates decided to kill, slash, or restructure 33 of them, including some of the services\' most cherished weapons systems. (Rumsfeld talked about ""transforming"" the military, but in fact canceled just two weapons: the Crusader artillery gun and the Comanche helicopter, the latter of which the Army didn\'t want anyway.) \n \n Gates stopped the Air Force\'s F-22 Raptor stealth fighter plane, killed whole sections of the Army\'s multiplatform Future Combat Systems, and sank the Navy\'s DDG-1000 destroyer, to name a few. The F-22 was the great white whale. Many Air Force officers saw it as their dream weapon, the most sophisticated fighter plane in the world. Gates saw it as a Cold War relic at a time when no enemies had fleets of advanced fighter planes and decades after any American pilot had fought an air-to-air duel. The United States already had 187 of these planes (none of which had taken part in any of the wars the United States was fighting), at a cost of $65 billion. The Air Force wanted 381 in all or, as a last-ditch compromise, 247. Gates and his analysts calculated that 187 were enough. After a drawn-out debate, the Senate agreed, defeating an amendment to restore production. \n \n All told, Congress approved 31 of Gates\'s 33 cuts. The other two -- the C-17 cargo plane and an alternative engine for the F-35 fighter -- Gates has vowed to kill this year. Gates\'s office calculates that his cuts will have saved $330 billion over the lifetime of those 31 programs, though such estimates, especially when drawn over not just years but decades, are very speculative. \n \n Gates won these fights for several reasons. The first was that he is Gates: a Republican hawk (albeit a relatively moderate one) and therefore immune to charges that he\'s ""soft on defense."" \n \n Second, he had the Joint Chiefs behind him, and that was because he fully consulted them at every step of the review. This is where Gates differs not only from Rumsfeld but from McNamara, the systems analyst who stormed into a Pentagon where no general had ever had to make a reasoned argument on behalf of a weapons system (""it\'s a military requirement"" usually sufficed) and imposed massive changes. Gates knew that, to make change stick, the officers carrying it out had to feel they had a stake in the decision. By contrast, when President Jimmy Carter and his defense secretary, Harold Brown, killed the B-1 bomber, the Air Force program managers, who hadn\'t been consulted, didn\'t really kill it; they tacked on some cosmetic changes and called it the ""cruise missile carrier aircraft."" When Ronald Reagan won the next election, they dropped the pretense, and the B-1 resumed as if Carter had never made the decision. \n \n Finally, Gates won because he had Obama\'s support. When Gates submitted his budget to Congress, the president attached a message that he would -- not ""might,"" but ""would"" -- veto the bill if it contained money for even one more F-22. It was the only veto threat in the president\'s first budget, and it worked. \n \n By then, it was clear -- to the surprise of many -- that the two men had hit it off. Their biographies were very different, but their executive sensibilities were nearly identical: pragmatic, problem-solving, averse to ideological formula and cliché, inclined to give everyone involved a say and then make a crisp decision. Several officials said that Obama had asked Gates to stay on as defense secretary mainly to provide continuity in the management of the wars -- and cover for any resulting controversies, owing to his credibility with the Joint Chiefs and with both sides of the aisle on Capitol Hill. But it was soon evident that Gates had become, as one official put it, ""a core player on the team."" Obama meets with Gates once a week at the White House, something he does with only two other cabinet officers, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. ""There are a few cabinet secretaries who give advice outside their lane,"" a senior administration official said. ""Gates is one of them."" \n \n Gates\'s most fateful influence may have come in the deliberations over the war in Afghanistan. Early in Obama\'s presidency, in hearings before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Gates endorsed the commanders\' request for 21,000 more troops to shore up security for the upcoming Afghan election but stressed that he\'d be ""deeply skeptical"" of requests for more down the road. One of his most searing experiences was as the CIA\'s deputy director during the Reagan years, watching the Soviet empire collapse in the Afghan quagmire. If the Afghan people see the war as an American war, Gates told the senators, ""we will go the way of other imperial occupiers."" \n \n Yet late in the summer of 2009, Gates changed his mind. He was reading a lot of articles on Afghanistan, and one had particular resonance: a piece by Frederick Kagan, a military analyst and vocal war supporter at the American Enterprise Institute, called ""We\'re Not the Soviets in Afghanistan,"" published that August by the Weekly Standard. Gates said the article reminded him of some facts about the earlier war that he\'d forgotten -- that the Soviets had killed 1 million Afghans, displaced 5 million more, and set out basically to destroy the country. ""Clearly,"" Gates said in our interview, ""none of that is what we were about in Afghanistan."" \n \n At the same time, the new Afghan war commander, Gen. Stanley McChrystal, was briefing Gates on a new strategy, similar to Petraeus\'s counterinsurgency strategy in post-2006 Iraq, that would focus on protecting the Afghan population and taking explicit steps to minimize civilian casualties. McChrystal, who was eventually fired this summer for making impolitic comments to a Rolling Stone reporter, had been on the job less than two months at that point. Gates had fired his predecessor, Gen. David McKiernan, in May 2009 and strongly recommended McChrystal to replace him. McKiernan had asked for more troops but offered no new strategy, no coherent war plan at all; Gates, who had placed McKiernan on the job a year earlier, saw no point in adding more forces if all they\'d do was keep grinding the wheels. \n \n ""The basis of my previous view was that once the Afghans come to see you as an occupier, you\'re toast,"" Gates recalled in our interview, which took place soon after McChrystal was sacked. ""McChrystal\'s whole approach was avoiding that. How do you demonstrate to the Afghans that you\'re there as their partner and their liberator rather than as their oppressor? His strategy for doing that seemed to be really compelling."" \n \n By Sept. 13, 2009, when Obama held the first of what turned out to be 10 senior-level national security meetings to formulate a U.S. strategy in Afghanistan, Gates had come to support the idea of sending more troops -- tens of thousands more. \n \n Emanuel recalled that Gates played ""a key role"" in the ensuing debates over whether to go in heavy with an expansive counterinsurgency strategy or go lighter with a strategy focused more strictly on going after terrorists (or something in between). Another official who attended the meetings referred to Gates as ""a center of gravity in the review,"" noting, ""If someone was 30 degrees in one direction and someone else was 30 degrees in the other direction, he would balance their views toward a consensus, bringing in elements of both."" \n \n In the end, Obama decided to send 30,000 extra troops (McChrystal had recommended 40,000) and adopt a somewhat scaled-down version of a counterinsurgency strategy, while also beginning to withdraw some of those troops by July 2011. What-if games are dubious enterprises, but it\'s not unreasonable to infer that, had Gates come into those meetings as skeptical as he\'d been before his summertime conversion, the emerging consensus -- and Obama\'s decision -- might have tilted toward a smaller deployment and a less ambitious strategy. \n \n Today, as the last 10,000 of the ""surge"" troops arrive in Afghanistan amid growing doubts in Washington and elsewhere about the war, Gates is optimistic that the strategy for Afghanistan will work. McChrystal\'s firing did little to change the overall approach because Obama replaced him with Petraeus, who knew the plan and terrain well. ""I see the process of transition in Afghanistan being similar to Iraq,"" Gates said in our interview, ""in which we\'re in the lead, then we\'re partners [with Afghan security forces], then they\'re in the lead, then we\'re in tactical overwatch, and then strategic overwatch. And that will take some time."" \n \n Two elements are key here. First, Gates\'s idea of an endgame is not the Bushian notion that Afghanistan becomes a democracy or even necessarily a stable country, but rather that its security forces can fight the war for the most part by themselves. Second, some U.S. armed forces will end up staying in Afghanistan -- just as some (between 30,000 and 50,000) are due to stay in Iraq -- for a long while. \n \n ""But by the same token,"" Gates added, ""the one thing that I\'ve made clear to everybody is that I\'m not going to support a strategy that leads to a stalemate."" In December, Obama\'s national security team will conduct an assessment of whether the strategy is working. ""If we\'re not making any headway,"" Gates said, ""then I think we have to look at making adjustments."" What kinds of adjustments, he doesn\'t know. ""But we\'re not just going to plunge ahead with exactly the same strategy if it\'s clear it\'s not working."" \n \n Will Gates still be there to help Obama plunge ahead or change course? \n \n With the fall elections looming, the defense secretary\'s plans are already the subject of intense Washington speculation. When he agreed to join Obama\'s team, Gates thought he might stay for a year. Then came the budget review, in which he was given the leeway to implement many ideas that he\'d only talked about under Bush. Then came the Afghanistan review, the results of which would take a while to play out. This summer, he was pushing the budget agenda further, including reforms in weapons contracting (especially the way contractors calculate ""overhead,"" a vaguely defined money magnet that Pentagon gadfly A. Ernest Fitzgerald once called ""the dark side of the moon"") and drastic cuts in the number of military commands around the world (another Cold War relic), which entail similarly drastic cuts in the number of senior officers commanding and staffing them. Gates\'s goal is to cut $100 billion over the next five years through these sorts of economies. Aides say that he\'s ""passionate,"" ""revved-up,"" and ""stoked"" about the project. \n \n Others, in and out of the Pentagon, are skeptical. Some doubt that renegotiating contracts and scrapping superfluous headquarters will save that much money. They also wonder whether Gates might be going, in one sense, a bridge too far and, in another sense, not far enough. \n \n In the realm of Pentagon politics, it\'s one thing to slash a few cherished weapons programs. But it\'s another thing entirely to slash the number of colonels and generals -- which, besides the obvious immediate threat to officers\' careers, means fewer promotions for majors and captains, who thus end their service at a lower rank and with less retirement pay. This is the sort of thing that could spark an old-fashioned officers\' revolt. \n \n Yet, for all the commotion it might cause, the savings from such a move -- even if they do amount to $20 billion a year -- are small change in a half-trillion-dollar military budget (not counting the cost of the wars). Much bigger savings would come from asking more basic questions: Does the Navy really need 11 aircraft carriers, and does each carrier need the same number of planes and escort ships? Do the Air Force and Navy really need 2,000 F-35 Joint Strike Fighter planes, as Gates plans to give them (in part as compensation for stopping the F-22)? Does the Army really need 73 brigade combat teams, with all the weapons, support, and personnel that go with them? \n \n To a remarkable degree, the U.S. military still has a Cold War force structure, built around fighter planes, aircraft-carrier task forces, attack submarines, and a large nuclear arsenal. Yet, contrary to some critics in the officer corps, who accuse Gates of shifting the focus entirely away from preparation for big wars to fighting today\'s small wars, that\'s one Cold War legacy that Gates does not want to change. He favors substantial increases in the military budget. He favors spending tens of billions of dollars to maintain, and somewhat upgrade, the nuclear arsenal. He opposes any slacking off in America\'s global military presence. \n \n In this sense, too, Gates is both expressing his genuine views and reflecting the political consensus. He is the secretary of defense; he has to pick his fights. At one point in our interview, he noted that he\'s not proposing to cut the number of aircraft carriers. When I asked why not, he replied, ""I may be bold, but I\'m not crazy."" \n \n Gates, who turns 67 in September, says he wants to leave the job and retire, this time for good, sometime in 2011. ""I think that it would be a mistake to wait until January 2012,"" he said. It might be hard to find a good person to take the job so late, with just one year to go in the president\'s current term. And, he added, ""This is not the kind of job you want to fill in the spring of an election year."" \n \n He pointed out that he\'s the 22nd U.S. defense secretary since the position was created in 1947. ""If I stay until January 2011,"" he said, ""I will have been in the job longer than all but four of my predecessors. And those four are Robert McNamara, Don Rumsfeld, Cap Weinberger, and Charles E. Wilson."" He laughed. All four are famous for having stayed long past their welcome. Two of them, McNamara and Rumsfeld, started out energetic and celebrated before tumbling into the traps of ill-considered wars. \n \n Then again, Gates said much the same thing about not wanting to stick around after 2008. Is his new countdown ticker, set to go off in 2011, another ""covert action,"" as he put it, to discourage Obama from asking him to stay? He certainly doesn\'t say so. But if the president does ask, Robert Gates has always been the type to say, ""Yes."" \n \n Jim Watson-Pool/Getty Images']",3,"– President Trump himself hasn't addressed Monday's miserable day for the stock market, but two White House officials made a point to downplay the trouble and emphasize perspective. ""Look markets do fluctuate,"" said deputy White House press secretary Raj Shah. ""But the fundamentals of this economy are very strong."" Press chief Sarah Huckabee Sanders said similarly that the ""president's focus is on our long-term economic fundamentals, which remain exceptionally strong."" As many outlets are now pointing out, Trump has repeatedly boasted of the booming stock market. In his recent State of the Union address, for example, he spoke of it smashing ""one record after the other,"" notes USA Today, which rounds up several tweets from Trump with a similar sentiment. Despite Monday's 1,175-point loss, the Dow is still up 23% since Trump took office, reports Business Insider. But the rough day illustrates the danger of the president taking too much credit for the market's performance, notes Politico. “This is a risk that the president clearly set himself up for,” Charles Gabriel of Capital Alpha Partners tells the news site. “Until now, Trump’s had kind of a free ride in this market and taken so much credit for it, even though so much of it was due to easy-money policies from Janet Yellen and the Fed."" Monday may have seen the biggest single-day point loss in the Dow's history, but in terms of percentage, the 4.46% loss is well below the 7% single-day drop of Sept. 29, 2008."
20,"['For fans of Led Zeppelin, there’s no such thing as too many remasterings and reswizzlings of those classic albums, and when a new series of reissues comes with the added bonus of previously unheard songs, it’s time to celebrate in an appropriately enormous fashion. \n \n BBC News has clips of two of the songs that will accompany the release of the band’s first three albums, this June. There’s the blues standard “Keys to the Highway” from 1970, and a not-quite-finished run through “Whole Lotta Love,” both of which should serve as appetizers for the gigantic pile of songs—a rarities disc with each album—ranging from alternate takes and live performances, including an entire Paris gig from 1969, to work-in-progress ideas and the occasional lost gem. \n \n Jimmy Page has spent the last couple of years putting the releases together from the band’s vault of recordings. And he told BBC News that the unvarnished version of a song like “Whole Lotta Love” made him aware of how much work the band put into the fine polish and extra guitars and vocals to really make it fly: “You realize just how important all of those additional layers and the filigree work is. \n \n “There’s all manner of bells and whistles to make it the song ‘Whole Lotta Love’ as we all know it.” \n \n That said, it’s not as if laying the songs bare has exposed an essential weakness in their sound: “It’s undeniable that we’re good,” he said. “The band was the real deal.” \n \n For Robert Plant, it has been a slightly different experience, in that there are a lot of things he rather wishes he had done differently: “My enthusiasm sometimes got in the way of finesse. I listen to it and go, wow, why didn’t I shut up a bit? I kind of overcooked it.” \n \n But his enthusiasm for the work still shines through: “It was a particularly prolific time, where we were learning about each other’s capabilities. \n \n “Jimmy and I were just fooling around with the stuff that we would play at home. We were just trying things out. Nothing was premeditated.” \n \n And he offers firm advice for any would-be listeners: “These things aren’t to study. They’re to turn up very loud and say, hey, once upon at time, everything was just as easy as this.” \n \n See more: \n \n RIP Storm Thorgerson: 10 Of His Best Album Covers \n \n 10 Great British Bands Get Shredded \n \n Make Your Minds Up, Led Zeppelin! \n \n Five Great British Nerdy Pop Stars', 'Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The band broke up in 1980 following the death of drummer John Bonham (second from right) \n \n Legendary rock group Led Zeppelin have unveiled two previously unheard recordings ahead of the reissue of the band\'s first three albums in June. \n \n The two tracks - blues classic Keys to the Highway, recorded in 1970, and an early version of the famous song Whole Lotta Love - are among dozens of tracks which the band will officially release alongside the reissues. \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Listen to an excerpt of the new Whole Lotta Love \n \n The companion discs will feature alternative versions of songs, works in progress and live performances, all recorded at the time of the original albums. \n \n The tracks, like hundreds of others, had been carefully catalogued but then locked away in the the band\'s archive for decades. \n \n Guitarist Jimmy Page, 70, has spent two-and-a-half years combing through the vaults, listening to hundreds of quarter-inch tapes before choosing the best material. \n \n Image caption Plant says the band will not reunite again \n \n ""I don\'t want to die and have somebody else do it,"" he says. ""I\'m authoritative about what was done in the first place."" \n \n Page says the new material ""deserves to be heard"" because ""it\'s performance art"". \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Robert Plant says the tracks are ""of the time"" \n \n It will give fans the first chance to eavesdrop on some of the band\'s key recording sessions. \n \n Keys to the Highway/Trouble in Mind, to appear on Led Zeppelin III, was recorded in 1970 at the Olympic Studios in Barnes in south-west London, about half an hour after Hats Off to (Roy) Harper. But it was never released. \n \n ""It was a particularly prolific time,"" says singer Robert Plant, ""where we were learning about each other\'s capabilities. \n \n ""Jimmy and I were just fooling around with the stuff that we would play at home. We were just trying things out. Nothing was premeditated."" \n \n My enthusiasm sometimes got in the way of finesse Robert Plant on his early recordings \n \n Led Zeppelin II features an early version of Whole Lotta Love, which many consider to be one of the greatest rock \'n\' roll songs of all time. \n \n There are significant differences between the two tracks. The original is missing the first chorus and middle section. New vocals appear on the finished version, as well as a slide guitar. \n \n ""You realise just how important all of those additional layers and the filigree work is,"" says Page. \n \n ""There\'s all manner of bells and whistles to make it the song Whole Lotta Love as we all know it."" \n \n Page says it\'s ""reassuring"" revisiting the songs after all this time. \n \n ""It\'s undeniable that we\'re good,"" he adds. ""The band was the real deal."" \n \n But the inevitable passage of time has given Plant, who is now 65, a different perspective. \n \n ""My enthusiasm sometimes got in the way of finesse. I listen to it and go, wow, why didn\'t I shut up a bit?"" he laughs. ""I kind of overcooked it."" \n \n \'Very loud\' \n \n Page promises ""lots of surprises"" on the three reissues, which are part of a plan to reissue all nine of the band\'s studio albums in chronological order. \n \n But he has scotched rumours that there will be versions of songs featuring bass and keyboard player John Paul Jones on vocals. \n \n For a band that broke up in 1980, following the death of the drummer John Bonham, interest in Led Zeppelin remains intense. \n \n The surviving members reunited seven years ago for a concert at London\'s O2. But fans will be disappointed if they are hoping there will be another one. \n \n Page says: ""I\'m sure people would love to hear it. I\'m not the one to be asking, I don\'t sing."" \n \n Plant, however, is unequivocal. The chances of the band performing live again are, he says rolling his eyes, ""zero"". \n \n So fans will have to content themselves with the reissued albums. And Robert Plant has one piece of advice for them. \n \n ""These things aren\'t to study. They\'re to turn up very loud and say, hey, once upon at time, everything was just as easy as this.""', 'The prospect of a North Korean missile launch is ""considerably high,"" South Korea\'s foreign minister told lawmakers Wednesday as Pyongyang prepared to mark the April 15 birthday of its founder, historically a time when it seeks to draw the world\'s attention with dramatic displays of military power. \n \n The missile is expected to be a medium-range Musudan missile with a range of 3,500 kilometers (2,180 miles) capable of flying over Japan, Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se told lawmakers in Seoul. Earlier a Defense Ministry official said preparations appeared to be complete, and that the launch could take place at any time. \n \n North Korean officials have not announced plans to launch a missile, but have told foreign diplomats in Pyongyang that it will not be able to guarantee their safety starting Wednesday. It has also urged tourists in South Korea to take cover, warning a nuclear war was imminent. Still, most diplomats and foreign residents appeared to be staying put. \n \n Such threats are seen as rhetoric and an attempt by North Korea to scare foreigners into pressing their governments to pressure Washington and Seoul to change their policies toward Pyongyang, and to boost the military credentials of its young leader, Kim Jong Un. \n \n On the streets of Pyongyang the focus was less on preparing for war and more on beautifying the city ahead of the nation\'s biggest holiday. Soldiers hammered away on construction projects, gardeners got down on their knees to plant flowers and trees, and students marched off to school, belying the high tensions. \n \n Last year, the days surrounding the centennial of the birth of Kim Il Sung, grandfather of the current ruler, was marked by parades of tanks, goose-stepping soldiers and missiles, as well as the failed launch of a satellite-carrying rocket widely believed by the U.S. and its allies in the West to be a test of ballistic missile technology. A subsequent test in December went off successfully, and that was followed by the country\'s third underground nuclear test on Feb. 12 this year, possibly taking the regime closer to mastering the technology for mounting an atomic bomb on a missile. \n \n The resulting U.N. sanctions and this spring\'s annual U.S.-South Korean military drills have been met with an unending string of threats and provocations from the North. \n \n Adm. Samuel Locklear, commander of U.S. Pacific Command, told the Senate Armed Services Committee in Washington on Tuesday that North Korea\'s persistent nuclear and missile programs and threats have created ""an environment marked by the potential for miscalculation."" \n \n He said the U.S. military and its allies would be ready if North Korea tries to strike. \n \n The Musadan is a ballistic missile, and South Korea says its launch would violate a U.N. Security Council resolution banning any ballistic activity by North Korea. \n \n Despite such tidings of war, the people of Pyongyang went about their daily lives. \n \n Associated Press journalists in the North Korean capital saw soldiers wearing hard hats rumbling past in the back of a truck as they prepared for another day\'s work doing construction. In recent years, military personnel have been pressed into helping build the many urban renewal projects that have been prioritized since Kim Jong Un came to power in December 2011. \n \n In a sign they have been diverted away from preparing for conventional warfare, they are commonly referred to as ""soldier-builders,"" and are also called upon to help plant and harvest rice and other crops in a nation that suffers from chronic food shortages. \n \n North Korea sporadically holds civil air raid drills during which citizens practice blacking out their windows and seeking shelter. But no such drills have been held in recent months, local residents said. \n \n ""I\'m not at all worried. We have confidence in our young marshal"" Kim Jong Un, a cleaning lady at the Koryo Hotel said as she made up a guest\'s bed. ""The rest of the world can just squawk all they want but we have confidence in his leadership. \n \n ""We are resolved to stay and defend him until the end,"" she said. ""It may be hard for the rest of the world to understand, and those who are worried are welcome to leave,"" she said in typically nationalistic language. \n \n But there was no sign of an exodus of foreigners from Seoul or Pyongyang. Britain and other governments with embassies in Pyongyang said they had no immediate plans to withdraw but would continue assessing the situation. \n \n North Korea has been escalating tensions with the U.S. and South Korea, its wartime foes, for months. The tightened U.N. sanctions that followed the nuclear test drew the ire of North Korea, which accused Washington and Seoul of leading the campaign against it. Annual U.S.-South Korean military drills south of the border have further incensed Pyongyang, which sees them as practice for an invasion. \n \n Last week, Kim Jong Un enshrined the pursuit of nuclear weapons _ which the North characterizes as a defense against the U.S. _ as a national goal, along with improving the economy. North Korea also declared it would restart a mothballed nuclear complex. \n \n Citing the tensions with Seoul, North Korea on Monday pulled more than 50,000 workers from the Kaesong industrial park, which combines South Korean technology and know-how with cheap North Korean labor. It was the first time that production was stopped at the decade-old factory park, the only remaining symbol of economic cooperation between the Koreas. \n \n Pyongyang also has moved to its eastern seaboard what is believed by U.S. and South Korean intelligence to be a mid-range missile capable of hitting targets in Japan, such as the U.S. military installations on that country\'s main island, as well as the U.S. territory of Guam. South Korean officials say North Korea will likely test-fire the missile into the sea as a display of its military prowess. \n \n The United States and South Korea have raised their defense postures, as has Japan, which deployed PAC-3 missile interceptors in key locations around Tokyo. And Locklear said the U.S. military would be ready to strike back if provoked. \n \n One historian, James Person, noted that it isn\'t the first time North Korea has warned foreign embassies to prepare for a U.S. attack. \n \n He said that in 1968, following North Korea\'s seizure of an American ship, the USS Pueblo, Pyongyang persistently advised foreign diplomats to prepare for a U.S. counterattack. Cables from the Romanian mission in Pyongyang showed embassies were instructed to build anti-air bunkers ""to protect foreigners against air attacks,"" he said. \n \n The cables were obtained and posted online by the Wilson Center\'s North Korea International Documentation Project. \n \n Person called it one of North Korea\'s first forays into what he dubs ""military adventurism."" \n \n ""In 1968, there was some concern there would be an attack, but (the North Koreans) certainly were building it up to be more than it was in hopes of getting more assistance from their allies at the time,"" Person said by phone from Alexandria, Virginia. \n \n ""I think much of it was hot air then. Today, I think again it\'s more hot air,"" he said. ""The idea is to scare people into pressuring the United States to return to negotiations with North Korea. That\'s the bottom line."" \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writers Hyung-jin Kim in Seoul, South Korea, Nicole Winfield in Rome and Matthew Pennington, Donna Cassata and Richard Lardner in Washington contributed to this report. \n \n ___ \n \n Follow AP\'s Korea bureau chief on Twitter at twitter.com/newsjean.']",3,"– Led Zeppelin is reissuing its first three albums in June, but ahead of that comes a little more love for fans. Actually, it's a ""Whole Lotta Love"" and ""Keys to the Highway""—previously unreleased versions that Jimmy Page culled from the band's vault in a two-year labor of love. ""I don't want to die and have somebody else do it,"" he tells the BBC, which has clips of the songs. ""I'm authoritative about what was done in the first place,"" and the new music ""deserves to be heard."" ""Keys to the Highway"" was recorded in 1970, in what Robert Plant calls ""a particularly prolific time where we were learning about each other's capabilities. Jimmy and I were just fooling around."" The ""Whole Lotta Love"" track is an early version—missing some vocals, slide guitar, the middle section, and first chorus—which makes one ""realize just how important all of those additional layers and the filigree work is"" in the final track, Plant says. He adds a pretty frank assessment of his own skills at the time: ""My enthusiasm sometimes got in the way of finesse. I listen to it and go, wow, why didn't I shut up a bit? I kind of overcooked it."" He's equally blunt about any chance of a reunion: ""Zero"" chance, says he. Still, the new tracks alone are cause for celebration, writes Fraser McAlpine at the Anglophenia blog. ""For fans of Led Zeppelin, there’s no such thing as too many remasterings and reswizzlings of those classic albums."""
21,"[""Mobb Deep Songs Remixed: Listen to 7 of the Best \n \n The rap world is reeling from the shocking news that Prodigy, iconic rapper and one-half of Mobb Deep, died Tuesday (June 20) at age 42. He had been admitted to the hospital days earlier due to complications caused by a sickle cell anemia, a condition he'd struggled with from birth. \n \n As the music world mourns across genres and generations, we at Billboard Dance take a moment to honor his legacy with a list of remixes that best reinterpret a few of Mobb Deep's most beloved songs. No one can ever replace Prodigy, a man who inspired many young MCs to first pick up the mic, but we can continue his life by enjoying the fruits of his lifelong labor. \n \n Mobb Deep – “Shook Ones” (Spaveech Remix) \n \n Take the ride from New York to New Jersey with Spaveech, as he puts a dance music spin on the Infamous anthem. The classic piano melody keeps things eerie, even as the house vibe gets booties moving on the dance floor. \n \n Mobb Deep – “Shook Ones” (Izzamuzzic Remix) \n \n The influence extends to Kazakhstan as Izzamuzzic turns “Shook Ones” into a beautiful, dark modern trap anthem. Havoc and Prodigy's words up the rhythm on the slowed beat, while the hook is catchy as ever. \n \n Mobb Deep – “Shook Ones” (DJ Premier Remix) \n \n DJ Premier is a legend in his own right. One-half of Gang Starr and a gifted producer on the solo tip, he takes a classical eye to this, one of Mobb Deep's biggest hits. It adds a flair of the cinematic, but the hip-hop drums keep this all New York hip-hop. \n \n Mobb Deep – “Survival of the Fittest” (Wonderboy Remix) \n \n Don't let the West Coast sound of this beat fool you. The Mobb Deep boys cross oceans to inspire this U.K.-based producer to cut and scratch all over this classic cut from the duo's second album, The Infamous, for an extra funky take. \n \n Mobb Deep – “Survival of the Fittest” (Benitoloco Remix) \n \n Flutes and strings up the ante on this emotive remix from the U.K.'s Benitoloco. He thrives on the classic New York hip-hop sound, twisting it with some worldly influence that has us coming back for more. \n \n Mobb Deep – “Hell on Earth” (Aesthetic Remix) \n \n This title track from Mobb Deep's third album gets a jazzy face lift, full of laid-back drums and off-center horn, string and piano notes that give the classic tune a cool new sting. There's something sinister about it, like the underlying darkness that made Mobb Deep so compelling in the first place. \n \n Mobb Deep – “Hell on Earth” (Baghiri Remix) \n \n Spanish producer Baghiri went diggin' in the crates for this classic hip-hop-style rework of “Hell on Earth.” Rain falls in the background and sets a scene of introspection as a repetitive standing bass keeps the pace. Definitely worth a few listens."", 'Mobb Deep\'s Prodigy Mourned by Nas, Just Blaze & More Hip-Hop Peers \n \n Prodigy, one-half of the legendary \'90s rap group Mobb Deep, died Tuesday (June 20) at age 42.

The statement goes on to say that the rapper, born Albert Johnson, was hospitalized ""a few days ago in Vegas after a Mobb Deep performance for complications caused by sickle cell anemia crisis."" Johnson battled the disease throughout his lifetime. He was 42 years old. No cause of death is known at this time. \n \n The emcee was best known for crafting narratives of struggle and survival, depicting New York in the depths of the crack era, but he had music flowing through his veins from the beginning. \n \n Prodigy\'s mother, Fatima Johnson, was a member of the \'60s R&B; group The Crystals, and also served as Mobb Deep\'s first manager. When she passed, on Christmas Eve, 2016, Prodigy publicly eulogized her on Instagram: ""I want to take a moment and salute this beautiful soul. Fatima Johnson, may u Rest In Peace,"" he wrote. ""There wouldn\'t be a Mobb Deep without you literally!! Our first manager, our first support team and believed in us when no one else did! You\'ll always always be remembered."" \n \n Prodigy co-founded the Queens-based Mobb Deep in the early \'90s, alongside partner Havoc (Kejuan Muchita). The two became synonymous with a brand of East Coast gangsta rap that represented the ill street blues, grit and grime of pre-gentrified New York City, debuting with Juvenile Hell in 1993. But it was their 1995 follow-up, The Infamous, that cemented their image and legacy. The music was dark, with eerie undertones that reflected the environmental hazards and criminal exploits of day-to-day living in the hood. \n \n ""New York got a n**** depressed / so I wear a slug-proof underneath my Guess,"" Prodigy rapped on 1995\'s ""Survival of the Fittest."" \n \n The Queensbridge Houses from which they hailed and represented on record are the same, storied projects that nurtured hip-hop legends Marley Marl, MC Shan, Roxanne Shante, and Mobb Deep contemporaries Nas, Cormega, Nature, Tragedy Khadafi, and more. Like the projects, Mobb Deep\'s discography stands as a testament to the socioeconomic conditions into which they were born and bred. \n \n ""I got you stuck off the realness / we be the infamous / you heard of us / official Queensbridge murderers,"" Prodigy raps in their most memorable song, ""Shook Ones Pt. II."" Other classics among Mobb Deep\'s eight-album discography include ""Quiet Storm,"" the duo\'s 1999 collaboration with Lil\' Kim. \n \n In recent years, Prodigy had parlayed a prison sentence into a solo career, an autobiography (My Infamous Life) — even a cookbook. Released in 2016, Commissary Kitchen: My Infamous Prison Cookbook highlighted the ingenuity he exercised to eat healthy while serving a three-and-a-half year sentence for gun possession. \n \n YouTube \n \n Prodigy had been in Las Vegas, where Mobb Deep performed over the weekend as part of the Art of Rap tour, featuring other legendary acts Onyx, Ghostface Killah, KRS-One, and Ice-T.', 'Prodigy, one-half of the seminal New York City hip-hop outfit Mobb Deep, died Tuesday at the age of 42.

""When I say Loud was a family, Loud was a family,"" he said. ""We might have yelled and screamed at each other, but we always wanted what was best for the act … Mobb Deep was the second group to go platinum right after Wu. We not only talked music we talked about everything but all I can say right now is RIP."" \n \n Prodigy and his Mobb Deep cohort, Havoc, grew up together in Queens, New York City and broke into hip-hop with a raw, vivid and vicious distillation of East Coast gangsta rap. The pair released their first demo together in 1992 under the name Poetical Prophets, which they followed up a year later with their Mobb Deep debut, Juvenile Hell. While that record wasn\'t well received, their 1995 follow-up The Infamous, remains a hardcore NYC classic and features one of the group\'s signature songs, ""Shook Ones Pt. II."" \n \n Rest In Paradise young Blood @PRODIGYMOBBDEEP can\'t believe you gone lord we was just chilling !! Hold ya head @mobbdeephavoc pic.twitter.com/tXjogmHIfH — Ghostface Killah (@GhostfaceKillah) June 20, 2017 \n \n Prodigy and Havoc would release eight records together as Mobb Deep, with their last, The Infamous Mobb Deep, arriving in 2014. \n \n In 2000, Prodigy launched his solo career with H.N.I.C. and would go on to release an array of solo records and mixtapes, as well as collaborations with producers such as the Alchemist and Big Twins and Un Pacino. In January, Prodigy released his last solo record, Hegelian Dialectic (The Book of Revelation). \n \n Albert Johnson was born in 1974 to a family filled with musicians. His mother, Fatima Johnson – then known as Francis Collins – was once a member of the Sixties girl group the Crystals, while his grandfather, Budd Johnson was an acclaimed bebop saxophonist. Throughout his childhood, however, Johnson struggled with sickle cell and a father who was both a heroin addict and a petty thief. In his 2011 autobiography, My Infamous Life, Johnson recalled the time his father left him in the car while he robbed a jewelry store. \n \n \n \n Growing up in New York City during hip-hop\'s Golden Age, Johnson eventually found his way to the mic in high school. Under the moniker Lord-T (the Golden Child), Johnson managed to score a demo deal at Jive records and earned himself a debut feature on Hi-Five\'s ""Too Young,"" which appeared on the Boyz N the Hood soundtrack. Not long after, Johnson united with Kejuan ""Havoc"" Muchita, but when Jive wouldn\'t re-sign them as a duo, the pair struck out on their own. \n \n By the time Mobb Deep released The Infamous, they\'d signed to RCA and Rifkind and Rich Isaacson\'s formative hip-hop label, Loud, whose roster also included NYC stalwarts the Wu-Tang Clan, Big Pun and Dead Prez. Following the success of The Infamous, Mobb Deep continued to hone their hardcore hip-hop sound on a string of highly successful records, 1996\'s Hell On Earth, 1999\'s Murda Muzik, and 2001\'s Infamy. \n \n During the Nineties, Mobb Deep also became embroiled in hip-hop\'s East Coast vs West Coast feud. Havoc and Prodigy guested on Capone-N-Noreaga\'s 1995 track, ""L.A., L.A.,"" a response to Snoop Dogg and Tha Dogg Pound\'s ""New York, New York,"" while the pair later became a frequent target for Tupac, who even called out Prodigy\'s sickle cell on anemia on ""When We Ride On Our Enemies."" \n \n Mobb Deep\'s hot streak continued into the 2000s. The group eventually split from Loud and created their own label, Infamous, partnering with Jive for 2004\'s Amerikaz Nightmare and 50 Cent\'s G-Unit for 2006\'s Blood Money. However, the group\'s tear was cut short in October 2006 when Prodigy was arrested and charged with criminal possession of a weapon. Facing a mandatory sentence of 15 years, the rapper pleaded guilty and received three-and-a-half years in prison. He was released after three in March 2011 and remained on parole until 2014. \n \n \n \n Photofest \n \n Upon his release, Prodigy published his autobiography and reunited with Havoc for a new Mobb Deep song, ""Dog Shit,"" featuring Nas. But within a year, a rift between the longtime partners appeared when Havoc posted a series derogatory and homophobic messages about Prodigy on Twitter. While Havoc initially claimed that his account had been hacked, he ultimately admitted to sending the tweets during an interview with AllHipHop.com, where he also said Mobb Deep was going on ""an indefinite hiatus."" \n \n While Havoc continued to call out Prodigy, even releasing the diss track ""Separated (Real From the Fake),"" Prodigy maintained that Mobb Deep would eventually reconcile their differences. And in 2013 they did, embarking on a tour to celebrate their 20th anniversary together. A year later, they released The Infamous Mobb Deep, which featured one disc of new material and another filled with unreleased tracks from their original Infamous sessions. \n \n ""Me and Hav got a different type of relationship man,"" Prodigy told MTV in 2013. ""We been through a lot of stuff growing up, just personal stuff. When you dealing with somebody for that long every day, you\'re gonna have your little squabbles or whatever, it\'s nothing."" He added: ""The bottom line is we\'re smarter than all the BS. Way smarter than that. Trust me, we\'re still here for a reason, we ain\'t stupid."" \n \n ""Survival of the Fittest"" \n \n ""Quiet Storm"" \n \n ""Keep It Thoro"" \n \n This story is developing', 'This is a set of web collections curated by Mark Graham using the Archive-IT service of the Internet Archive.

Born Albert Johnson, the rapper was hospitalized after a weekend performance ""for complications caused by sickle cell anemia,"" a disease he'd battled since birth, his publicist says in a statement. An official cause of death is not known, reports NPR. More: The Washington Post looks at how sickle cell anemia influenced Prodigy's rap music, and in particular, what ""might be the most paralyzing rap lyric ever written"": ""I'm only 19, but my mind is old."" Variety notes the same lyric ended up in Broadway's Hamilton. At Rolling Stone, Jon Blistein describes how Prodigy and his rap partner Havoc burst onto the rap scene in 1992 and continued making music together, despite solo careers, for more than two decades. Variety mentions Mobb Deep's feuds with Tupac Shakur and Jay-Z. Even Prodigy and Havoc feuded for a time, though they eventually reunited. Havoc has posted a series of photos of the pair on Instagram. Other members of the hip hop community are paying tribute on social media. Carl Lamarre at Billboard rounds up posts from Nas, Lil Wayne, Method Man, Wiz Khalifa, and more. Meanwhile, Billboard compiles seven remixes ""that best reinterpret a few of Mobb Deep's most beloved songs."""
22,"['Talk about too many cooks in the kitchen: Mitt Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign near the end of the race needed upwards of 22 people to sign off on a social media post before it could go live. \n \n That’s one of the findings in a new paper released Friday by University of North Carolina journalism professor Daniel Kreiss, who studied how both Romney and President Barack Obama used Twitter, Facebook and other online tools to shape their campaign messages. \n \n “So whether it was a tweet, Facebook post, blog post, photo—anything you could imagine—it had to be sent around to everyone for approval. Towards the end of the campaign that was 22 individuals who had to approve it,” Caitlin Checkett, the Romney campaign digital integration director, told Kreiss. “The digital team unfortunately did not have the opportunity to think of things on their own and post them. ... The downfall of that of course is as fast as we are moving it can take a little bit of time to get that approval to happen.” \n \n By contrast, Kreiss writes that Obama digital director Teddy Goff and his team of four social media staffers “had significantly more autonomy” to quickly respond to fast-breaking campaign events. For example, Obama’s campaign quickly responded to Clint Eastwood’s empty chair speech at the Republican National Convention by posting on Twitter a picture of Obama seated in the White House, with the message “This Seat’s Taken.” The post got almost 60,000 retweets, more than 23,800 favorites and was cited in a variety of media reports. \n \n Both the Obama and Romney campaigns also obsessed over their scripted social media attacks and rebuttals in trying to use a bit of psychology on the reporters covering the campaign, Kreiss found. \n \n Prepping for over a month ahead of their first debate, Romney’s campaign did Saturday dry runs and created 200 pre-made info-graphics. Obama’s digital team didn’t do extensive planning ahead of the first debate, but Kreiss writes that the president’s campaign was ready for the second debate by pre-writing hundreds of tweets to go up under handles for Obama, campaign manager Jim Messina or senior strategist David Axelrod. \n \n Goff told Kreiss that the Obama digital team’s job was to “make sure that no matter what was going on, frankly whether or not the president did his job, you know, there would be very loud voices talking about how we were doing well so that if we were doing well that would be perfectly clear to reporters and if we weren’t doing that well they would look at Twitter and see that it was a lot more mixed than they expected and sort of second guess their own perception that maybe the president wasn’t doing that well.” \n \n Goff also said that while the campaign probably didn’t persuade any voters through Twitter, its use of the platform still made a difference by hitting ""the somewhat elite core of supporters and then very importantly reached reporters as well.” \n \n ""So for Twitter we spent a lot of time thinking about how we could sort of manipulate the sort of national dialogue, the dialogue around politics,” he told the professor. \n \n Read more about: Mitt Romney', 'When Mitt Romney\'s digital team wanted to send out a tweet during the 2012 campaign, it wasn\'t easy for them. A new paper by Daniel Kreiss, an assistant professor at UNC Chapel Hill (and flagged by Brendan Nyhan on Twitter), finds that, late in the campaign, as many as 22 people had to sign off on the language of each tweet from the @MittRomney feed. That\'s according to Romney\'s digital integration director Caitlin Checkett, who said: \n \n CHECKETT: ""So whether it was a tweet, Facebook post, blog post, photo — anything you could imagine — it had to be sent around to everyone for approval. Towards the end of the campaign that was 22 individuals who had to approve it. ... The digital team unfortunately did not have the opportunity to think of things on their own and post them."" \n \n Romney\'s digital director Zac Moffatt concurred, telling Kreiss the campaign had ""the best tweets ever written by 17 people ... It was the best they all could agree on every single time."" \n \n In contrast, Kreiss finds that Obama\'s digital team had ""more autonomy,"" which made it easier for staffers ""to respond to political events in the moment and in a communicative style that accords with the norms and expectations of networked publics on Twitter."" He cites a humorous tweet from the @BarackObama feed responding to Clint Eastwood\'s ""empty chair"" Republican convention speech earlier that night. \n \n Politicians and their staffers are generally very cautious with official tweets, and that\'s understandable. There\'s little upside from most campaign tweets, and potentially a lot of downside from a Twitter blunder dominating the headlines. Still, having 17 to 22 people vet each tweet seems like a bit of an overcorrection, and makes one wonder what Romney\'s management style would have been like in the White House.', '34.0K Shares Share \n \n Recently, I was gossiping with my neighbor about a mutual friend whose wife had moved out, making him the primary parent to their two- and four-year-old children. \n \n “He’s been pretty amazing,” I said. “She even took the car, so he brings the kids to daycare on the bus. Then he takes the train to work. He’s lucky if he even gets to play basketball once a week. And you know how much he loves his league.” \n \n Later, I reflected on the conversation. \n \n Despite also being a car-less, transit-using single parent who can’t remember the last time I had a regular weekly recreational activity not related to the eight-and-under set, I found myself marveling at this friend’s sacrifices. Then I found myself annoyed that I had slipped into such a typical line of thought. \n \n And if the research is to be believed, it’s not only typical to assume that single dads are doing something heroic, but it’s just as typical to think that single moms are doing just the opposite. \n \n What the Research Says \n \n Two separate 2012 studies published in the Journal of Feminist Family Therapy confirmed that many people put single dads on a pedestal while hyper-policing single moms. \n \n In the first study, Negative Perceptions of Never-Married Custodial Single Mothers and Fathers: Applications of a Gender Analysis for Family Therapists, authors Amanda Haire and Christi McGeorge determined that many of the beliefs about single parents stem from the view that single fathers have admirably risen to the challenge of parenting by choice, while single mothers are assumed to be parenting out of a necessity resulting from bad judgment, accidental pregnancy, or the failure to maintain a relationship. \n \n The researchers also determined that negative views about single motherhood tend to stem from a conviction that there is something inherently wrong or damaged about a single mother as a person. \n \n Notably, descriptions of single moms given by the study’s respondents included the beliefs that this group of parents was neglectful, irresponsible, immature, stressed out, depressed, prone to making bad choices, promiscuous, hopeless, and / or insecure. \n \n Single fathers, on the other hand, were perceived by those surveyed as individuals in a challenging situation who had to worry about complications of solo parenting like paying child support, ﬁnding child-care, and balancing their dating life with raising kids. Not exactly the personal character flaws attributed to the moms! \n \n In the second paper, Attitudes Toward Never-Married Single Mothers and Fathers: Does Gender Matter?, researcher Sarah DeJean and colleagues found that when given a fictional narrative about single parents, identical, save for the gender of the subject, study participants were more judgemental of the mothers in the story than they were of the fathers. \n \n Indeed, subjects rated mothers as “less secure, less fortunate, less responsible, less satisﬁed with life, less moral, less reputable, less of a good parent, and less economically advantaged” when compared to the ratings of the single father, despite the fact the only difference in the vignettes were names and pronouns. \n \n Negative Views Lead to Real-Life Risks for Moms \n \n The effects of such beliefs don’t just mean we fawn over single dads and tut-tut over single moms. What we have seen all too often is cases where single moms have either been arrested, faced criminal child endangerment charges, or lost custody of their children for what has been termed child neglect. \n \n In the last few months alone, there has been coverage of a number of moms in these situations. \n \n One example was Shanesha Taylor, a single mom in Arizona who lost custody of her toddler and six-month-old after babysitting fell through and she was forced to leave them in a car for 45 minutes while she had a much-needed job interview. \n \n There was also Debra Harrell, a working mom who spent the night in jail, lost custody of her daughter for over two weeks, and could face ten years in prison after it was discovered that she had let her nine-year-old play in a local park with other children while she worked her shift at McDonalds. \n \n And, of course, in one of the most horrifying cases from the last few years, a Georgia single mom, Raquel Nelson, spent years fighting charges in the tragic death of her son. The boy was killed by a drunk driver after the mom of three jaywalked with her kids since the closest cross-walk was one-third of a mile away from where a city bus dropped the family off after grocery shopping. \n \n Each of these cases — and they are just the tip of the iceberg — involved economically disadvantaged, black single moms trying to take care of their kids with very limited means. \n \n While not all moms in these situations are Black (see the most recent case of this type in Florida), a disproportionate number are. In part, that is because if there are negative stereotypes about single moms in general, the promiscuous-Black-single-mom-welfare-queen myth makes things exponentially harder for single moms of color, who may be judged through an even narrower lens than are their white single mom counterparts. That’s what we call “intersectional oppression.” \n \n The Poverty Disparity \n \n So why don’t we hear more about desperate single dads putting their kids in these sorts of situations? \n \n It’s not that single dads don’t get into trouble with the law, but Google “single dad child neglect charges” and what you get is a staggering number of stories of physical child abuse, not situations involving lost custody or criminal charges for what are often very questionable definitions of neglect. \n \n As many have argued, when charges arise under these circumstances, the real demon is poverty. And poverty is far more likely to affect single moms than dads. \n \n As a 2013 Pew survey found, almost twice as many single moms are living in poverty than are single dads: 24% of single dads versus 43% of single moms. Combine this with the fact that there are simply fewer single dads out there (another 2013 Pew survey found that 76% of single parent households are headed by women), and that those who do head families often get a free pass based on our intrinsic belief in the valor of the single dad, and what you get is far more moms being forced into impossible situations than dads. What We Can Do A lot of us still hold tight to deeply gendered beliefs about men’s and women’s roles when it comes to child-rearing. Understanding that these are socially created views and not biologically determined truths can help us tackle the stigma and dangers single moms face and can help create an environment where more men feel competent at parenting and supported as single dads. Here are a few other things we can do: 1. Strive for Gender Parity in Our General Parenting Expectations As a society, we continue to have overall lower expectations for fathers than for mothers. The result is that mothers continue to be viewed more critically than fathers, who are often given credit for simply showing up. Speak up when you notice people commenting on how awesome it is that a dad is at a playground on a Sunday morning and not sleeping in! Call people out when they talk about a dad “babysitting” his own kid. Neither of those things are anything out of the norm. They are just part of parenting. Remind women that just as attachment parenting, nursing a child until three and co-sleeping are valid options, so too are the tools of modernity like bottle feeding, EZ Mac’n Cheese, disposable diapers, and cribs and toddler beds, that can help give moms freedom from their kids and can help dads co-parent equally. 2. As Moms, Allow Dads to Thrive When an opposite gender couple splits, women often correctly fear that relegating the role of primary parent to the father will find them harshly judged, even if the father would be better equipped for the job. Don’t assume that there is some horrifying backstory if a dad is the primary parent. Unless given real reason to think otherwise, assume that he is competent in his role. Similarly, stop yourself from critiquing a dad’s parenting style if you wouldn’t do the same to a mom. 3. Demonize Poverty, Not Single Moms Blaming single moms and not the severe financial disadvantage so many face can have disastrous consequences and has resulted in the recent arrests and the loss of children for a number of mothers. Work to fight poverty and support programs for parents like parental leave, universal pre-K, and subsidized daycare. Back the fight to increase the minimum wage to something livable and get political, for example, by urging Congress to pass the Healthy Families Act, which would provide a national paid leave program, since a lack of paid leave can be devastating to a working single mom. 4. Acknowledge Inherent Biases about Single Parents Single fatherhood is often seen as something done as a choice by honorable men, and single motherhood as something done by women who have made bad decisions and have no other option. When we accept this view, we perpetuate harmful myths. If you would offer to babysit for a single dad because he needs a night out, do the same for a single mom. 5. Admit When Mainstream Thinking Affects Us As feminists, we need to acknowledge and challenge our own gender biases when it comes to parenting. Despite knowing it’s not true, many of us still secretly think parenting comes more naturally to women than to men. Work Still to Be Done When my great-grandmother got divorced in France in 1912, her actions were beyond scandalous. The fact that she became a single mother after the dissolution of her marriage and not as a result of widowhood was almost unheard of, and both she and my grandmother felt the sting of stigma their entire lives. Luckily, we have moved forward and divorce and the single motherhood that often results are both much more commonplace and also much more accepted than they were a century ago. But as plenty of single moms can attest, simply being more common and more accepted, doesn’t quite cut it. And really, if we want families to thrive we have to accept that they come in all sorts of configurations and we have to work to support not only those which we think are deserving or noble, but also those whose choices and configuration may look vastly different from our own. 34.0K Shares Share Ellen Kate is a Contributing Writer at Everyday Feminism.

Photograph: Brook Lapping/Kessler Prod/BBC \n \n Israel has made public a decades-old handwritten plea for clemency from Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann for his role in the Holocaust, dated two days before he was executed. \n \n In the request, written after he was brought to Israel in 1960, then tried, convicted and sentenced to death, Eichmann says the Israeli court overstated his role in organising the logistics of Hitler’s Final Solution, which involved the extermination of 6 million Jews. \n \n \n \n President Reuven Rivlin presented the previously unreleased letter, which was written to then president Yitzhak Ben-Zvi, at a ceremony to mark International Holocaust Remembrance Day. \n \n Hitler’s world may not be so far away | Timothy Snyder Read more \n \n “There is a need to draw a line between the leaders responsible and the people like me forced to serve as mere instruments in the hands of the leaders,” the presidency quoted Eichmann’s letter as saying. \n \n “I was not a responsible leader, and as such do not feel myself guilty,” the German wrote. \n \n “I am not able to recognise the court’s ruling as just, and I ask, Your Honour Mr President, to exercise your right to grant pardons, and order that the death penalty not be carried out.” \n \n The letter was signed and dated: “Adolf Eichmann Jerusalem, May 29, 1962.” \n \n He was hanged at about midnight on 31 May. \n \n Eichmann, one of the main organisers of the Holocaust, escaped from a prisoner-of-war camp after the second world war and fled to Argentina in 1950, where he lived under a pseudonym until he was snatched by Mossad agents in Buenos Aires in May 1960 and smuggled into Israel. \n \n The ability of the security services to bring him to justice was a source of pride for the Jewish state, and Rivlin referred to the trial as a momentous moment in Israel’s history. \n \n “In the first years after the Holocaust, the people in Israel were busy rebuilding and founding an independent state,” he said. “The renewed Israeli society was not in the mindset to, or able to, remember. \n \n “The Eichmann trial broke the dam of silence. The ability of the young Jewish state to capture the Nazi murderer afforded a basic sense of security to the survivors of the Holocaust.” \n \n Dismissing Eichmann’s claims to be just a bureaucrat, Rivlin said: “The people who suffered from Eichmann’s weakness were not given a moment of grace.” \n \n Israel and its allies have continued to use their resources across the globe to pursue those responsible for carrying out the Holocaust, even though the majority of perpetrators are now close to death. \n \n On Tuesday, the Simon Wiesenthal Center – named after the famous Nazi hunter – produced a list of 10 alleged Nazis who could be prosecuted in 2016.

Old age should not afford protection to people that committed such heinous crimes,” he told AFP. “The trials send a powerful message about the significance of the Holocaust.” \n \n As the number of second world war Nazis alive diminishes, Zuroff said his centre was also seeking to focus on historical accuracy – with strands of different societies in Europe keen to play down their role in the killings. \n \n The Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, in a statement on Tuesday, warned that antisemitism was again growing in Europe. \n \n “Even respected western opinion leaders have become afflicted with hatred for the Jewish people and the Jewish state,” Netanyahu said, without giving names. “The obsession with the Jews – the fixation on the Jewish state – defies any other rational explanation.” \n \n Other documents presented at Wednesday’s commemoration, in the presence of Holocaust survivors, included requests for clemency from Eichmann’s wife Vera and his five brothers, along with Ben-Zvi’s letter to his justice minister rejecting the appeals. \n \n Also in the collection, recently digitised by the presidential archives, are a transcript of Eichmann’s defence counsel’s supreme court appeal, the handwritten opinion of justice minister Dov Yosef, and a note by prosecutor Gideon Hausner for his opening address. \n \n Israel marks its own Holocaust remembrance day, which this year will be held on 4-5 May."", ""President Reuven Rivlin was making public on Wednesday previously unreleased documents, including a handwritten request for clemency from Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann. \n \n Rivlin’s office said in a statement that the request to then president Yitzhak Ben-Zvi would be presented at a ceremony at Rivlin’s official Jerusalem residence to mark International Holocaust Remembrance Day. \n \n Although found not guilty of personally murdering anyone, Eichmann was convicted of playing a key role in the genocide of the Jewish people and sentenced to death on December 15, 1961. \n \n Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Free Sign Up \n \n In the petition, written after he was brought to Israel in 1960, then tried, convicted and sentenced to death the following year, Eichmann says that the Israeli court overstated his role in organizing the logistics of Hitler’s “Final Solution,” which involved the extermination of six million Jews. \n \n “There is a need to draw a line between the leaders responsible and the people like me forced to serve as mere instruments in the hands of the leaders,” Rivlin’s office quotes the letter as saying. \n \n “I was not a responsible leader, and as such do not feel myself guilty,” he adds. \n \n “I am not able to recognize the court’s ruling as just, and I ask, Your Honour Mr President, to exercise your right to grant pardons, and order that the death penalty not be carried out.” \n \n The letter was signed and dated: “Adolf Eichmann Jerusalem, May 29, 1962.” \n \n He was hanged overnight May 31 and cremated hours later.

The mistake was caused by the fact that at the time of my judgement, I was presented with a number of documents which without being seen in connection with the general material of the orders, must give an incorrect picture. \n \n It is not true that I was personally of such a high rank as to be able to persecute, or that I myself was a persecutor in the pursuit of the Jews, in the face of such an abundant rule it is clear the judges in their ruling ignored the fact that I never served in such a high position as required to be involved independently in such decisive responsibilities. Nor did I give any order in my own name, but only ever acted ‘by order of’. \n \n Even had I been as the judges assessed the driving, zealous, force in the persecution of the Jews, such a thing would have been evident in my promotion and other awards. Yet I received no such advantages. \n \n It is also incorrect that I was never influenced by human emotions. \n \n Specifically under the impression of the unspeakable horrors which I witnessed, I immediately requested a transfer to a different post. Similarly, I revealed of my own will during the police investigation, horrors which had been till then unknown in order to help establish the undisputable truth. \n \n I declare once again, as I did in the presence of the court: I detest as the greatest of crimes the horrors which were perpetrated against the Jews and think it right that the initiators of these terrible deeds will stand trial before the law now and in the future. \n \n Notwithstanding there is a need to draw a line between the leaders responsible and the people like me forced to serve as mere instruments in the hands of the leaders. I was not a responsible leader, and as such do not feel myself guilty. \n \n I am not able to recognise the court’s ruling as just, and I ask, Your Honour Mr. President, to exercise your right to grant pardons, and order that the death penalty not be carried out. \n \n Adolf Eichmann \n \n Jerusalem, 29.5.62"", 'High-ranking Nazi Adolf Eichmann requested a pardon from Israel\'s president Yitzhak Ben-Zvi two days before was hanged to death, rare documents released in honor of International Holocaust Remembrance Day showed on Wednesday. \n \n Eichmann made the request after being found guilty of 15 charges, including crimes against the Jewish people, crimes against humanity and war crimes. \n \n Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter \n \n \n \n The document is one of several released ahead of an event scheduled for Wednesday at the President\'s Residence.

""It is untrue that I was such an important personage that I could oversee or would independently oversee the persecution of the Jews."" Eichmann argued that the judges ignored his claim that he ""never served in such a high-ranking position that would have involved such decisive and independent authorities."" \n \n \n \n \n \n The war criminal, who was among those most involved in carrying out the Holocaust, further wrote: ""I also never gave any orders in my name, but always operated according to orders. Had I been, as the judges assume, the fanatical driving force in the persecution of the Jews, this should have been reflected in a promotion and other rewards, but I was never granted any benefit. A line must be drawn between the leaders who are responsible and people like me, who were forced to be tools by the leadership.

Their blood cries out, but their voice is stilled. Therefore will I be their spokesman. In their name will I unfold this terrible indictment.""', 'By Erin McPike - July 10, 2012 \n \n Early this spring, as the new electoral map began to take shape, an intriguing scenario began circulating in political circles: the very real possibility that the 2012 presidential election could result in an Electoral College tie. \n \n The most likely combination that would produce such a result requires Mitt Romney to carry all the states John McCain won in 2008, which after the redistricting process account for 180 electoral votes. Add to Romney\'s column Indiana (11), Virginia (13), North Carolina (15), Florida (29), Ohio (18), and New Hampshire (4). That would yield 270 electoral votes for Romney to 268 for President Obama, the narrowest possible win for the challenger. \n \n But then subtract from the Republican ticket the single electoral vote Obama won in Nebraska due to the anomalous way the Cornhusker State allocates its five electoral votes, and there would be a rare electoral tie that would send the election to the House of Representatives. \n \n There are other avenues to an electoral tie, as well, and given shifting dynamics and poll numbers, they aren\'t as unlikely as one might think. \n \n For the sake of projections, consider Indiana lost for the president and give it to Romney (191). Add to his column North Carolina (15), Florida (29) and Ohio (18), getting the GOP challenger to 253. Then throw in Iowa (6), where Romney has been campaigning vigorously and where poll numbers are tight, getting him to 259. Add in Wisconsin (10), where Republicans are newly energized, and -- presto! -- Romney gets to 269. \n \n Such a scenario assumes that the president will hang on to Virginia’s 13 electoral votes, where he leads in the RCP Average. Indeed, Public Policy Polling is releasing a new survey of Virginia voters Tuesday that will show Obama leading Mitt Romney comfortably. PPP pollster Tom Jensen wrote on Twitter Monday afternoon, “Another very good poll for Obama in Virginia. Going to be pretty surprised if he doesn\'t win it again.” \n \n To be sure, there are only two states not won by McCain in which Romney isn’t trailing the president in the RCP Average. They are Indiana, where the last survey taken was in March, and North Carolina, where Romney leads the president in the RCP Average, 47.3 percent to 45.3 percent. \n \n In Ohio, Obama beats Romney in the average by 2.6 percentage points, and in Virginia it’s 2.4 points. The president is ahead in Iowa by 2.5 points and leads by 1.7 points in Florida. \n \n Out West, the president is doing even better: He leads Romney by a 5.3-point margin in Nevada -- a state Republicans believe is automatically in play due to its dubious distinction of having the highest unemployment rate of any state in the country at 11.2 percent. In Colorado -- where Romney will visit Tuesday -- Obama leads by 3 points. \n \n In half of the states Romney hit along his six-state bus tour in June (which also featured Iowa and Ohio, mentioned above), the president is comfortably ahead. Obama enjoys an 8-point lead over his challenger in the RCP Average in Pennsylvania and a 5.7-point lead in New Hampshire, where Romney owns a vacation home and spent the last week. Obama has a 3-point advantage in the RCP Average in Wisconsin. Michigan, however, is closer. Obama has a lead of only 1.8 points there. \n \n Let’s assume, then, that Romney is able to pull ahead of the president in the following states where the margin is closest. Starting with 191 (McCain victories plus Indiana), give Romney North Carolina, where he’s leading (15), Florida, which boasts the president’s narrowest polling lead in a state (29), Michigan, which is the next closest in the RCP Average (16), Virginia (13) and Iowa (6) -- and Romney is back to 270. But subtract that single Nebraska vote, and they both get 269. \n \n Given the current polling data, that may be the likeliest of the electoral tie combinations. Right now, if the concept of “tossup states” are rejected, President Obama beats Mitt Romney on the RCP ""no toss up"" map, 332 electoral votes to 206, with just Indiana and North Carolina flipping to the challenger after going for Obama in 2008.']",4,"– In all of Israeli history, only one man has been sentenced to death by a civilian court and then executed: Adolf Eichmann. On Wednesday, the country released the Nazi's handwritten plea for clemency, penned two days before he was hanged. The AFP reports the release coincides with International Holocaust Remembrance Day, and quotes, along with the BBC and Ynetnews, from the May 29, 1962, letter, in which Eichmann tries to make the case that he was merely following orders when he implemented the ""Final Solution"": ""[The judges] made a fundamental mistake in that they are not able to empathize with the time and situation in which I found myself during the war years. There is a need to draw a line between the leaders responsible and the people like me forced to serve as mere instruments in the hands of the leaders. Had I been, as the judges assume, the fanatical driving force in the persecution of the Jews, this should have been reflected in a promotion and other rewards, but I was never granted any benefit. I am not able to recognize the court’s ruling as just, and I ask, Your Honor Mr. President, to exercise your right to grant pardons, and order that the death penalty not be carried out."" The Times of Israel reports that Eichmann—who fled a POW camp after the war, made his way to Argentina, and was kidnapped by Israeli intelligence agents in 1960—was cremated hours after his May 31 hanging; his ashes were spread in the Mediterranean Sea. Wednesday's release includes related documents, including President Yitzhak Ben-Zvi's rejection of the request; the letter Eichmann’s wife, Vera, wrote to Ben-Zvi; and chief prosecutor Gideon Hausner's moving handwritten opening statement that referenced the ""six million accusers"" with him who ""are now only ashes.""

24,"['Some family members of victims killed in the Sept. 11 terror attacks said Wednesday that they are outraged by the Transportation Security Administration\'s decision to let passengers carry pocketknives on planes. \n \n FILE - In this Sept. 26, 2006, file photo, knives of all sizes and types are piled in a box at the State of Georgia Surplus Property Division store in Tucker, Ga., and are just a few of the hundreds of... (Associated Press) \n \n TSA Administrator John Pistole announced Tuesday that airline passengers will be able to carry pocketknives with blades less than 2.36 inches long and less than half an inch wide. Souvenir baseball bats, golf clubs and other sports equipment also will be permitted starting next month. \n \n The agency said the policy aligns the U.S. with international standards and allows the TSA to concentrate on more serious safety threats. \n \n Unions representing flight attendants and other airline workers decried the change, and several relatives of people killed when terrorists hijacked four U.S. airliners on Sept. 11, 2001, criticized the move as well. \n \n ""I\'m flabbergasted,"" said Sally Regenhard, whose firefighter son was killed at the World Trade Center. ""I\'m really disgusted by this latest news."" \n \n Regenhard said she recently had a container of yogurt confiscated by the TSA because it was a gel. ""I\'m just wondering why a yogurt is more dangerous than a penknife or a golf club,"" she said. \n \n Debra Burlingame, whose brother Charles was the pilot of the plane that crashed into the Pentagon, said a pocketknife can be just as deadly as a box cutter, like the ones the hijackers used. Box cutters will still be banned under the new rules. \n \n ""When you\'re drawing a blade against someone\'s neck, they\'re quite lethal,"" Burlingame said. ""This is bad news."" \n \n Burlingame said Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed told interrogators that the hijackers each used ""a Swiss knife,"" a brand of pocketknife, to butcher a sheep and a camel as part of their training. The transcript of the 2003 interrogation was part of the 9/11 Commission Report. \n \n Burlingame suspects the TSA decided to allow folding knives because they are hard to spot. She said the agency\'s employees ""have a difficult time seeing these knives on X-ray screening, which lowers their performance testing rates."" \n \n Asked to respond, a TSA spokesman reiterated that ""the decision to permit these items as carry-on was made as part of TSA\'s overall risk-based security approach and aligns TSA with international standards."" \n \n Several relatives of those who died on United Flight 93, whose passengers tried to wrest control of the plane before it crashed in Shanksville, Pa., questioned the policy change. \n \n ""What\'s the difference between a pocketknife and a box cutter, for crying out loud?"" asked David Beamer, whose son Todd led the Flight 93 revolt with the words, ""Let\'s roll."" ""I cannot see the upside to this."" \n \n Alice Hoagland, whose son Mark Bingham was another leader of the attempt to take back Flight 93, called it ""a dreadful mistake to loosen the rules."" \n \n ""We are increasing the chances of flight attendants and passengers being attacked while in the air,"" said Hoagland, a retired flight attendant. ""This decision was made in order to make the TSA look a little better, to ease up on the standard so they won\'t have egg on their face."" \n \n Hamilton Peterson, who lost his father and stepmother on Fight 93, said, ""I have enormous respect for the great work of the TSA; however, I am concerned this may undermine overall counterterrorism vigilance and may well prove to be dangerous to future passengers and crew who will inherit the danger resulting from this decision.""', 'ATLANTA — With a decisive victory in Georgia, Newt Gingrich saved a campaign that seemed teetering on the precipice of disaster two weeks ago. Polling then suggested that he might achieve no better than a squeaker victory in his home state, an embarrassment that could have led him to withdraw. \n \n But after a single-minded focus on barnstorming around Georgia leading up to the Super Tuesday contests, Mr. Gingrich is poised to gain a substantial share of the state’s 76 delegates to the Republican convention. \n \n “In the morning, we are going on to Alabama,” Mr. Gingrich told an enthusiastic crowd here on Tuesday night, some waving “Newt-a-Mania” signs. “We’re going on to Mississippi. We’re going on to Kansas. And that’s just this week.” \n \n Alabama and Mississippi, which hold the next primaries on the calendar next Tuesday, both figure into Mr. Gingrich’s grand strategy for reanimating his candidacy by carrying Super Tuesday momentum into other victories in the South. So does Kansas, which holds its caucuses on Saturday. \n \n But Mr. Gingrich failed to gain a strong enough finish in Tennessee and Oklahoma to displace Rick Santorum as the leading alternative to Mitt Romney. \n \n In Oklahoma, Mr. Santorum won a commanding victory, with Mr. Romney second and Mr. Gingrich third. \n \n In Tennessee, where Mr. Gingrich seemed to have closed some of the gap with Mr. Santorum in recent days, he was on his way to a disappointing third-place finish, exit polling showed. \n \n Mr. Gingrich lumped Mr. Santorum with all the other candidates who had surged earlier in the campaign only to drop out: Tim Pawlenty, Michele Bachmann, Rick Perry and Herman Cain. \n \n “And now it’s Santorum,” Mr. Gingrich said on Tuesday night. “There’s lots of bunny rabbits that run through. I’m the tortoise.” \n \n As Mr. Gingrich visits Alabama and Mississippi in the next two days, he will be shadowed by Mr. Santorum, who is turning his own sights to the Deep South. \n \n Mr. Gingrich was feeling confident enough of his Georgia victory on Tuesday to risk another round of “Newt Skywalker” jokes by detouring to the U.S. Space and Rocket Center in Huntsville, Ala. \n \n But once out of Georgia, he will not be able to count on the “native son” sentiment that fueled no small part of his win. \n \n According to exit polls, more than a third of Georgia voters said Mr. Gingrich’s ties to the state, which he represented in the House for two decades, were important in their choice of candidate. Four out of five voters said the rise in gas prices (up 6 percent in the state in the past month) was an important factor in their choice. \n \n Mr. Gingrich has focused intensely on energy in the past few weeks, promising to lower the price of gasoline to $2.50 a gallon by aggressive drilling. Many energy economists said the claim was simplistic, and Mr. Romney called it “pandering.” \n \n Much of Mr. Gingrich’s speech on Tuesday night was spent on a recitation of how “Wall Street” money, meaning Mr. Romney’s wealthy supporters, had been dedicated to undermining his earlier surges with negative advertising. \n \n “I hope the analysts in Washington and New York, who spent June and July explaining our campaign was dead, will watch this tonight and learn a little bit from this crowd and from this place,” he said. \n \n Merle Black, a political scientist at Emory University in Atlanta, said Mr. Gingrich had most likely also won support by attacking a favorite target, the “elite” news media, which he took to task for creating a controversy over Rush Limbaugh’s verbal attacks against an advocate for contraception. \n \n Mr. Gingrich repeated the criticism on Tuesday, calling the issue over Mr. Limbaugh “the last desperate effort of the elite media to smother an uprising by diverting us into any possible fight.” \n \n Mr. Black said Mr. Gingrich could win all 14 of Georgia’s Congressional districts, giving him a vast majority of the state’s delegates. \n \n “It’s certainly a surprise from what he looked like a couple of weeks ago,” Mr. Black said. \n \n But even if Mr. Gingrich went on to win the states in play next week, his path to the nomination remains improbable. \n \n “He’s got to win something outside the South,” Mr. Black said. “Where’s he going to go? Where’s he going to show strength?”']",2,"– Just a week before the sequester kicked in, the TSA signed a deal to spend $50 million on new uniforms, reports Politico. The agency calls the uniforms a necessity, but for many on Capitol Hill it was just another sign of the TSA's cluelessness. ""When we’re losing essential services and they’re closing down or threatening to close down all sorts of important government activities, to have them cut the deal on $50 million for uniforms is absolutely outrageous,” complains a Florida Republican. The TSA's recent announcement that it will allow small knives on flights—but still not full size shampoos and toiletries—is also angering many, including the families of people killed on 9/11, reports the AP. ""I'm really disgusted by this latest news,"" said a woman whose firefighter son was killed at the World Trade Center. Given that the 9/11 hijacks used simple box cutters, others suspect the next rules were made more for TSA screeners' convenience than safety. The agency's employees ""have a difficult time seeing these knives on X-ray screening, which lowers their performance testing rates,"" said a woman whose brother was pilot on the plane that crashed into the Pentagon. Also upset, according to the Consumerist: Air marshals and flight attendants, who are both appealing the decision. ""Flight attendants are going to be sitting ducks,"" says a top air marshal."

Some key points from the manifesto: Facebook's next step. ""For the past decade, Facebook has focused on connecting friends and families,"" Zuckerberg writes.

""History has had many moments like today,"" Zuckerberg writes in conclusion. ""As we've made our great leaps from tribes to cities to nations, we have always had to build social infrastructure like communities, media and governments for us to thrive and reach the next level ...

27,"['A child looks at the floral tributes after a vigil for victims of Saturday\'s attack in London Bridge, at Potter\'s Field Park in London, Monday, June 5, 2017. Police arrested several people and are widening... (Associated Press) \n \n LONDON (AP) — British police have named the third London Bridge attacker as 22-year-old Youssef Zaghba, and said that he is believed to be an Italian national of Moroccan descent. \n \n Police said Tuesday he lived in east London and that his family has been notified, adding that he was not a ""subject of interest"" to police or the intelligence services. \n \n The other two attackers were named Monday as Khuram Shazad Butt and Rachid Redouane. \n \n The identity of the last attacker in Saturday\'s attack that left seven dead and dozens wounded came as a new search was underway in a neighborhood in east London near the home of two of the London Bridge attackers. The search in Ilford, just north of Barking, is seeking to determine whether the group had accomplices. \n \n London police have said all 12 people held since the attack late Saturday from the Barking neighborhood, have been freed. \n \n The attack, the third in Britain in three months, has raised questions over the government\'s ability to protect Britain following cuts to police numbers in recent years. The issue has become a key one in the run-up to Thursday\'s general election. \n \n Prime Minister Theresa May, who called the snap election in hopes of strengthening her mandate for discussions over Britain\'s exit from the European Union, has come under fire for the cuts to police numbers over recent years. A string of opinion polls over the past couple of weeks have pointed to a narrowing in the gap between her Conservative Party and the main opposition Labour Party. \n \n One of the attackers, Butt, had appeared in a documentary ""The Jihadis Next Door"" and was known to investigators but police said he was not believed to be plotting an attack. The second man, Rachid Redouane, had not aroused any suspicions. The three, who were wearing fake suicide vests, were shot dead during the attack. \n \n The Islamic gym where one of the London Bridge attackers trained says they saw nothing of concern during his time there. \n \n In a letter posted outside Tuesday, the Ummah Fitness Centre said staff would ""help the police in any way we can"" as investigators try to learn more about Khuram Shazad Butt, who was one of those who rammed a van into pedestrians on London Bridge and then slashed and stabbed people in nearby Borough Market. \n \n Neighbors described Butt as an avid weightlifter and Transport for London confirmed he worked for London Underground in customer service before leaving last October. \n \n London Mayor Sadiq Khan said questions would need to be asked about what the police knew about Butt. He has said cuts in the number of police officers have had an impact on the ability to prevent attacks. \n \n Much of the area around London Bridge remained cordoned off as commuters struggled to work in the driving rain. \n \n The area around Borough Market is not expected to reopen Tuesday. \n \n The nearby London Bridge station was operational though one of the exits that leads to the cordoned off area on Borough High Street remained closed. \n \n Transport for London, which oversees the capital\'s transport network, has advised commuters to make alternative journeys as the station will be busy. \n \n A minute\'s silence was observed in Britain at 11 a.m. local time (1000 GMT) in memory of those killed during the attack. \n \n Questions remain over whether investigators had the resources to look into complaints such as those leveled by Butt\'s neighbors about his attempts to radicalize children and whether crucial opportunities were missed that could have saved lives. \n \n Saturday\'s attack was the third in as many months involving suspects who had been on the radar of British authorities. All three have been claimed by the Islamic State group. \n \n The country\'s official terror threat level remains at ""severe,"" one notch down from the highest. \n \n It had been set at ""critical"" in the days after the Manchester concert bombing on May 22 that killed 22 people — reflecting a judgment that an attack might be imminent because accomplices with similar bombs might be on the loose. \n \n It was lowered once intelligence agencies were comfortable this wasn\'t the case. Authorities have said the London attack was apparently unconnected to the Manchester bombing.', 'WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Tuesday unanimously threw out a lawsuit against former Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft that had accused him of misusing his power to arrest suspects as ""material witnesses"" in terrorism cases.The decision continues the court\'s trend of shielding top Bush administration officials from lawsuits over their conduct in the ""war on terrorism.""By an 8-0 vote, the court said Ashcroft\'s use of the law was reasonable and did not clearly violate the 4th Amendment right against unreasonable searches and seizures.The decision tosses out a lawsuit by Abdullah al Kidd, a former University of Idaho football player who was arrested at Dulles Airport and held for two weeks, ostensibly so he could serve as a witness in a pending case. He was never called to testify. Critics had said Ashcroft had misused this authority as a means of seizing people even when the government had no reason to believe they had committed a crime.Two years ago, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals sided with Al Kidd\'s suit against Ashcroft and said the Constitution does not give government ""the power to arrest and detain American citizens for months on end … merely because the government wishes to investigate them for possible wrongdoing.""The Obama administration appealed on Ashcroft\'s behalf and won a reversal Tuesday.Justice Antonin Scalia said the officers who arrested Al Kidd had obtained an arrest warrant from a magistrate. The law permits taking a person into custody to hold him if his testimony ""is material in a criminal proceeding."" Initially, Al Kidd was seen as a likely witness in a terrorism trial in Idaho.Taking the two together, Scalia said Ashcroft acted reasonably in line with the current law. Chief Justice John G. Robert Jr. and Justices Anthony M. Kennedy Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr. joined him in full.Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg , Stephen G. Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor concurred in the judgment. They said the law in this area was not clear, so Ashcroft deserved to be shielded from a suit.

Khuram Shazad Butt, who may have had links to jihadist group Al-Muhajiroun, had been the subject of a Metropolitan Police investigation beginning in 2015. However, the investigation was ""prioritized in the lower echelons"" because ""there was no intelligence to suggest that this attack was being planned,"" a rep tells the BBC. A man and a woman living in east London had both contacted police about Butt, with the woman suggesting he had tried to radicalize her children. According to the Times, Butt had links to both radical Islamic preacher Anjem Choudary and Mohammad Sidique Khan, who planned the 2005 London bombings. Khan worked at an Ilford fitness center that Butt, a 27-year-old father of two, would frequent to try and radicalize youth, the Times reports. Butt also appeared in a 2016 Channel 4 documentary about Islamist extremists with ties to Choudary. He was seen arguing with police after carrying an Islamic State flag. Yet Butt still managed to get a job with the London Underground. The UK citizen born in Pakistan served as a trainee customer service assistant for almost six months in 2016, per the BBC.

Photo: iStock \n \n Exposure to brief flashes of light during the night before a trip could help people avoid jet lag, according to a new study by Stanford University researchers. \n \n The study, published online Monday in the Journal of Clinical Investigation, might have implications for more than just travelers. It also could point to help for people on sleep/wake schedules that don’t align with their circadian rhythms and people who suffer from seasonal affective disorder, a type of depression. The researchers also are investigating whether..."", 'Exposing people to short flashes of light while they’re sleeping could provide a fast and efficient method of preventing jet lag, according to a study by researchers at the Stanford University School of Medicine. \n \n “This could be a new way of adjusting much more quickly to time changes than other methods in use today,” said Jamie Zeitzer, PhD, assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences. \n \n Zeitzer is senior author of the study, which was published online Feb. 8 in the Journal of Clinical Investigation. The lead author is Raymond Najjar, PhD, a former postdoctoral scholar at Stanford now at the Singapore Eye Research Institute. \n \n Researchers led by Zeitzer have been working on developing an optimal technique for using light exposure to help people adjust more quickly to changes in their sleep cycles. Current light-therapy treatments for sleep disturbances include sitting in front of bright lights for hours at a time during the day, which allows you to transition your body clock to a new time zone in small steps prior to taking a trip. \n \n Night light \n \n In an earlier study, Zeitzer and his colleagues found that light therapy works best at night because the body’s circadian rhythms, which control sleep cycles, are more sensitive to light at night, even through closed eyelids. \n \n In the latest study, Zeitzer and Najjar found that short flashes of light at night are more effective than continuous light exposure and could further speed up the process of adjusting to a different time zone before a trip. \n \n The transfer of light through the eyes to the brain does more than provide sight; it also changes the biological clock. A person’s brain can be tricked into adjusting more quickly to disturbances in sleep cycles by increasing how long he or she is exposed to light prior to traveling to a new time zone. \n \n After arriving in a new time zone, the body will eventually adjust on its own, but at a slow pace of about one hour a day. Meanwhile, jet lag, which occurs because your body’s clock is still synced to your original time zone, can cause fatigue, lack of alertness, a general feeling of malaise and sometimes gastrointestinal problems. \n \n Biological ‘hacking’ \n \n Light therapy is designed to speed up the brain’s adjustment to time changes. By conducting light therapy at night, the brain’s biological clock gets tricked into adjusting to an awake cycle even when asleep. It’s a kind of “biological hacking” that fools the brain into thinking the day is longer while you get to sleep, Zeitzer said.', 'Uma Thurman is grateful for a lot of things in 2017—chief among them, the downfall of Harvey Weinstein. She\'s shared credits with the disgraced producer in seven movies, including her Academy Award-nominated role in Pulp Fiction and Quentin Tarantino\'s Kill Bill, Vols. 1 and 2, and after the first wave of sexual misconduct allegations against him came out in October, Access Hollywood asked Thurman how she felt about them. ""I don\'t have a tidy soundbite for you, because I have learned, I am not a child. And I have learned that when I\'ve spoken in anger, I usually regret the way I express myself,"" she said at the time, carefully choosing her words. ""So, I\'ve been waiting to feel less angry, and when I\'m ready, I\'ll say what I have to say."" \n \n Thursday was the day Thurman decided to say something. \n \n Sharing a still of herself as Beatrix Kiddo, a.k.a. The Bride, from Kill Bill, she wished her Instagram followers a happy Thanksgiving.

I said I was angry recently, and I have a few reasons, #metoo, in case you couldn\'t tell by the look on my face.

You don\'t deserve a bullet.""']",3,"– Researchers at Stanford University have discovered what a press release calls a ""fast and efficient"" way to stop jet lag before it starts: repeatedly flashing light into your eyes while you sleep. ""If you are flying to New York tomorrow, tonight you use the light therapy,"" Dr. Jamie Zeitzer says. ""If you normally wake up at 8am, you set the flashing light to go off at 5am. When you get to New York, your biological system is already in the process of shifting to East Coast time."" A flash every 10 seconds for one hour, used toward the end of the night, will push the body's circadian rhythm forward by about two hours, the Wall Street Journal explains. Using the flashes of light at the beginning of the night, on the other hand, will delay the circadian clock and could be helpful when the aforementioned traveler heads back to the West Coast. Current in-advance methods for dealing with jet lag and sleep-cycle issues involve continuous light administered while awake. Not only did the study find flashing lights to be more effective—they change the body's circadian rhythm up to three times faster than a steady light—they don't interrupt a person's life. ""Most people can sleep through the flashing light just fine,"" Zeitzer says in the press release. Researchers are hoping to have a light-flashing sleep mask available for consumers later this year. This same method could be used to help people who work the night shift or have seasonal affective disorder. And researchers are currently testing it on a group of teens to improve school performance. ""We’re basically looking to intentionally jet lag teens so that they can go to bed at a reasonable time,"" Zeitzer tells the Journal.

Researchers at Stanford University have discovered that a genetic variation made humans shorter and more compact as a means of protecting them against frostbite in the colder temperatures of northern climates, Newsweek reports. In addition, their limbs got shorter, making them less vulnerable to breaking if people should, say, slip on ice. The downside of this evolutionary adaptation was an increase in the likelihood of osteoarthritis. The Stanford study, published Monday in Nature Genetics, shows how a variation in the GDF5 gene became more prevalent in humans moving out of Africa into colder climates 50,000 to 100,000 years ago. This variation doubles the chances of developing painful joint problems while also reducing height by about 0.4 inches on average, the Telegraph reports. And since arthritis generally doesn't develop until after the age of reproduction, the gene mutation was passed on from generation to generation. The Stanford researchers discovered that the genetic variation causing this increase in arthritis is common among Europeans but rare in African populations.

But new video obtained by Fox 8 New Orleans and also aired by ABC News appears to show Smith's SUV rear-ending Hayes' Hummer after Hayes came to a sudden stop less than two blocks away from the eventual shooting scene. The video then shows the Hummer pulling over, the SUV driving away from the scene, and the Hummer following. ""Prior to the actions that led to Mr. Smith's death, my client was involved in a hit-and-run.

33,"['Photo: KUVP archives \n \n The Black Hills mountain range, which stretches from South Dakota to Wyoming, is known for its lush forests, scenic waterfalls, and dense, intricate cave systems. But 150 million years ago, humongous, long-necked dinosaurs called sauropods roamed there—and scientists just identified one of their colossal, fossilized feet. \n \n \n \n The nearly complete foot fossil, made up of 13 bones, was unearthed in 1998 from a body of rock spanning multiple states called the Morrison Formation. That area has produced a wealth of dinosaur fossils from the Late Jurassic Period, or between 155 million to 148 million years ago. Scientists there have dug up diplodocuses, allosauruses, stegosauruses—the list goes on. The staggering amount of fossils there, compared to the available scientists to examine them, is why it took two decades to identify this massive foot. \n \n Advertisement \n \n The foot seems to have belonged to some kind of brachiosaur that stretched 80 feet long, the researchers wrote in their paper published Tuesday in PeerJ. To figure that out, they used a 3D scanning technique to make computerized images of the foot bones, and compared them to other sauropod foot fossils. \n \n “It very likely is a type of brachiosaur, the kind that got famous in Jurassic Park (and then got horribly murdered in Fallen Kingdom),” Femke Holwerda, a study-author and paleontologist at the Bavarian State Collection of Paleontology and Geology, told Gizmodo via email. “The only problem is that feet can rarely be diagnostic down to species level, hence the assignment to brachiosaur and not to any specific species.” \n \n The same dig site where this foot was unearthed in northeastern Wyoming also contained a separate, smaller, nearly complete brachiosaur, and a handful of other long-necked dinosaurs like diplodocuses and camarasaurs. The research team was surprised to see a brachiosaur that far north, because the animals had been thought to occupy much smaller, more southern chunks of land. \n \n Advertisement \n \n “This brachiosaur showing up in Black Hills in Wyoming brings up some questions,” says David Burnham, a paleontologist at the University of Kansas who worked on the paper. “Is it a different species than the brachiosaurs down south? Or maybe they were migrating north to south? It’s several hundreds of miles from where we thought these guys were, so we have a lot of new questions. It’s great—I welcome the new questions and opportunities for further research.” \n \n Illustration: Nobu Tamura (Wikimedia Commons) \n \n Still, the huge brachiosaur foot is notable for more than just its surprising location. At just under a meter wide, the researchers said it is the largest sauropod foot ever discovered. Philip Mannion, a paleontologist at Imperial College London who wasn’t involved with this discovery, agreed with that assessment. \n \n \n \n Advertisement \n \n “The metatarsals do seem to be longer than those of any other known sauropod dinosaur, so in that regard this is probably the largest foot ever discovered,” Mannion told Gizmodo. “There are other species with feet that aren’t much smaller, though.” \n \n \n \n Plus, as Mannion and the study authors point out, we’ve never found the feet of the world’s largest sauropods, the titanosaur and argentinosaurus, who would surely surpass this brachiosaur in foot size. We haven’t seen those dinosaurs’ feet yet because foot fossils are notoriously elusive, according to study author Anthony Maltese, a paleontologist at the Rocky Mountain Dinosaur Resource Center in Colorado. Throughout history, they’ve had a much higher chance of being lost in waterways or eaten by scavengers because they’re so small compared to the rest of the animal. That makes the most recent discovery an especially exciting one. \n \n “It’s great to finally have a brachiosaurus foot,” Elizabeth Freedman Fowler, a paleontologist at Dickinson State University who wasn’t involved with this work, told Gizmodo. “Getting a decently complete foot for any dinosaur is a lucky find. As we keep digging and finding more bones, we are getting an idea of just how huge each dinosaur species can truly grow. I think we are going to keep breaking the record for ‘biggest’ over and over for many years to come.” \n \n Advertisement \n \n [PeerJ]', 'The largest dinosaur foot ever found, belonging to one of the largest land animals this planet\'s ever seen, surely deserves the title ""Bigfoot"" more than Sasquatch. \n \n Excavated in 1998 by an expedition from the University of Kansas, and described in a new study published in PeerJ – the Journal of Life and Environmental Sciences, ""Bigfoot"" was discovered in the Black Hills area of Wyoming. Scientists determined the dinosaur — a very close relative of Brachiosaurus — had the biggest feet of any sauropod, and roamed the area 150 million years ago. \n \n Crew member Anthony Maltese, who is also the lead author of the study, writes that the foot was nearly 1 meter wide. It didn\'t belong to the largest dinosaur ever discovered, the study said, but ""Bigfoot"" did have particularly large feet. \n \n Maltese and his team of researchers from the U.S., Switzerland, and Germany have identified the enormous foot as belonging to an animal related to Brachiosaurus, a member of the sauropod family — you know, the dinosaurs with the long necks and tails. It\'s not only the largest sauropod foot ever identified, but also the first confirmed brachiosaur foot from the Late Jurassic period of North America. \n \n A rendering of Brachiosaurus-araucaria, or ""Bigfoot.""

A University of Kansas expedition crew member is in there for scale. Image: KUVP archives \n \n So, just how did the team connect ""Bigfoot"" to sauropods, and then determine it was, in fact, related to Brachiosaurus? Maltese and team members Emanuel Tschopp, Femke Holwerda, and David Burnham used 3D scanning and highly detailed measurements to compare the large specimen to various species of sauropod, including Camarasaurus and Diplodocus. \n \n By comparing elements of the foot — like metatarsals and phalanges — with existing examples, the scientists determined it was neither of those two, but more likely that of a brachiosaurid. \n \n And there\'s still plenty to discover. Maltese said in a press statement that the rock outcrops that produced this fossil hold many more ""fantastic dinosaur skeletons,"" and that the research team will press on with their studies from there. \n \n Personally, I\'d like to know if ""Bigfoot"" sneezed as dramatically as the Brachiosaurus in Jurassic Park.', 'As it turns out, ""Bigfoot"" was a dinosaur--a giant, plant-eating one. A new study based on fossils excavated in Wyoming reveals the largest dinosaur foot ever found and identifies it as a brachiosaur, a type of sauropod dinosaur that was among the largest land animals on Earth. The work, published today in the journal PeerJ, also confirms that 150 million years ago brachiosaurs called a huge swath of North America home. \n \n ""There are tracks and other incomplete skeletons from Australia and Argentina that seem to be from even bigger animals, but those gigantic skeletons were found without the feet. This beast was clearly one of the biggest that ever walked in North America,"" said co-author Emanuel Tschopp, a Theodore Roosevelt Richard Gilder Graduate School postdoctoral fellow in the American Museum of Natural History\'s Division of Paleontology and author on the new PeerJ study. \n \n The foot was excavated in 1998 by an expedition team from the University of Kansas which included Anthony Maltese, now at the Rocky Mountain Dinosaur Resource Center in Woodland Park, Colorado. \n \n ""It was immediately apparent that the foot, nearly a meter wide, was from an extremely large animal, so the specimen was nicknamed \'Bigfoot,\'"" said Maltese, lead author of the study. \n \n Now, after thorough preparation and examination, Maltese, Tschopp, and collaborators have identified the foot as belonging to an animal very closely related to the long-necked, long-tailed sauropod Brachiosaurus, best known as the sauropod featured in the movie Jurassic Park. The researchers used 3D scanning and detailed measurements to compare the specimen to feet from numerous dinosaur species. Their research confirms that this foot is the largest dinosaur foot discovered to date. \n \n The study also shows that brachiosaurs inhabited a huge area from eastern Utah to northwestern Wyoming. \n \n ""This is surprising,"" Tschopp said. ""Many other sauropod dinosaurs seem to have inhabited smaller areas during that time."" \n \n The rock outcrops that produced this fossil--the Black Hills region of Wyoming, famous today for tourist attractions like Deadwood and Mount Rushmore--hold many more fantastic dinosaur skeletons, says Maltese.

These fossils are part of the Morrison Formation — a rocky expanse known for its Late Jurassic period fossils, especially its sauropods (long-necked herbivorous dinosaurs that walked on all fours), such as Diplodocus, Brachiosaurus and Apatosaurus.

""This foot definitely belonged to the largest individual preserved in this quarry, but unfortunately, nothing else of it was found."" \n \n The foot — a left hindfoot — was so massive that the paleontologists from the 1998 dig nicknamed it ""Bigfoot."" But despite its gargantuan size, the foot hadn\'t been described in detail until now, said lead study researcher Anthony Maltese, curator of the Rocky Mountain Dinosaur Resource Center in Woodland Park, Colorado, who also took part in the 1998 excavation. \n \n To investigate, Maltese and his colleagues used a 3D-scanning technique to take precise measurements of the mystery dinosaur\'s foot and then compared those with the foot bones of other sauropods. They found that the beast was closely related to Brachiosaurus and that it likely stood about a whopping 13 feet (4 m) tall at the hip. \n \n Given the dinosaur\'s fantastic foot size, it\'s safe to call it a titanosaur — the largest group of sauropod dinosaurs — which includes the 122-foot-long (37 m) Patagotitan and the 115-foot-long (35 m) Argentinosaurus. \n \n The newly described foot bones are slightly larger than those of the long-necked Giraffatitan sauropod dinosaur and ""considerably larger than those of Dreadnoughtus, which was reported to be one of the largest sauropods ever found.""

That\'s because foot size doesn\'t directly equate to body size. \n \n ""Some of the largest sauropods such as Argentinosaurus or Patagotitan do not preserve pedal [foot] material, but have femur lengths that considerably exceed our estimate for [the newly discovered dinosaur],"" the researchers wrote in the study. For instance, the mystery dinosaur has an estimated femur length of 6.7 feet (2 m), while Argentinosaurus had a femur length of 8.3 feet (2.5 m) and Patagotitan\'s was 7.7 feet (2.3 m), the researchers said. \n \n The finding also reveals that large brachiosaurs and their close relatives inhabited huge geographical swaths 150 million years ago, from eastern Utah to northwestern Wyoming. \n \n ""This is surprising,"" Tschopp said in a statement.

34,"['Photo illustration by Slate. Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images. \n \n To this besieged White House, the Stephanie Clifford (aka Stormy Daniels, aka Peggy Peterson) lawsuit against President Donald Trump might only register as a single locust on the plague scale. Stormy Daniels doesn’t even represent the most interesting sex scandal the White House has to confront this week. Nevertheless, her lawsuit poses a few interesting legal questions that some poor judge in Los Angeles Superior Court will have to very publicly grapple with. \n \n The nature of the dispute is paradoxically convoluted. Clifford’s lawsuit seeks to invalidate a nondisclosure agreement requiring her to keep secret her sexual relationship with Donald Trump, but the lawsuit itself announces the nature of the relationship in the first paragraph of the suit’s factual background: \n \n Ms. Clifford began an intimate relationship with Mr. Trump in the Summer of 2006 in Lake Tahoe and continued her relationship with Mr. Trump well into the year 2007. \n \n Indeed, the opening of the barn doors surely preceded this lawsuit. Countless news outlets have already reported that Clifford had approached Slate’s Jacob Weisberg in late 2016 with details that match the allegations in the lawsuit. The Wall Street Journal has also reported on the details of a $130,000 payment made by Trump’s personal attorney, Michael Cohen, to Clifford at the height of the campaign. This payment may have been a violation of federal election law, but the point is that it speaks to how much the public already knows about this supposedly confidential case. \n \n That arrangement had a nondisclosure agreement with a mandatory arbitration clause, of which Cohen availed himself late last month. Again, it’s all very labyrinthine. \n \n Putting aside for the moment the question of whether Clifford’s lawsuit, by its being filed publicly instead of under seal, represents a breach of the nondisclosure agreement, the next most convoluted question involves Clifford’s attorney Michael Avenatti’s central claim that the agreement is invalid. He argues that there can be no confidential settlement to violate because, as he told NBC’s Today: “Mr. Trump did not sign. We believe that that was so that he could later claim deniability, and therefore, from a legal perspective, we believe she’s free to talk.” \n \n Sure enough, Trump’s seismograph-like signature does not appear on the agreement, either as himself or by his latest alleged nom de plume, “David Dennison.” But if Clifford deposited the check, the court might view that act as a unilateral ratification of her end of the agreement. If a court interprets the parties’ conduct as evincing the existence of a contract, it wouldn’t then matter whether either party signed. \n \n Whether Clifford’s attorney is right involves an area of contract law most lawyers last encountered on their first-year exam, known as the “statute of frauds.” Each state has its own such statute and they’re largely similar, but essentially it requires that certain types of contracts must be signed in writing by both parties. It’s well-established that a court can find a contract valid even where neither party signs simply by the conduct of the parties, though this rule is somewhat constrained in contracts governed by the statue of frauds. If a court deems this agreement as falling outside the statue of frauds, then Trump’s lack of signature might not matter. Generally, the types of contracts that require signatures are weighty and have lasting implications—real estate contracts, mortgages, long-term employment contracts, surety agreements, debts dischargeable in bankruptcy, and so on. \n \n That a lawsuit seeking to undo the terms of an agreement could potentially violate that agreement suggests that we’re inside a farcical adaptation of the film Inception. \n \n So the question for the court might be whether the Trump–Clifford nondisclosure agreement categorically squares with California’s enumerated statute of frauds. While the aforementioned types don’t quite fit, one interesting candidate is California Civ. Code 1624(a)(1), which requires a signature of the party to be charged or the party’s agent where the agreement, “by its terms is not to be performed within a year from the making” of the agreement. So the question is: What would that mean, with respect to this nondisclosure agreement, where Clifford is obligated to remain silent indefinitely, a period that could easily extend past a year? Despite that argument’s intuitive appeal, courts have mostly viewed indefinite duration contracts as not falling within this one-year provision, sometimes reasoning that the party could die within a year, sometimes finding validation where only one of the parties completes performance. Often, one party’s ratification (e.g., cashing the check) can serve as an exception to the statute of frauds. \n \n Whatever the merits of Clifford’s argument that Trump’s failure to sign the agreement rendered it invalid, it may not ultimately matter because in order for Trump to prevail on the agreement he would have to take Clifford to court and enforce it. For a president of the United States to sue an ex–porn actress for revealing details of their extramarital affair allegedly occurring shortly after the birth of his son Barron would seem to be a politically fraught venture, even for a president as Teflon as Trump has proven to be. \n \n One big caveat to consider here is that Cohen has already filed an arbitration proceeding pursuant to the agreement, with the lawsuit alleging that it was filed “surreptitiously” and without notice to Clifford, and that its purpose was to silence Clifford. The California court could perhaps tell Clifford that she needs to take her case to the same arbitration panel. Clifford’s response to that suggestion is implicit in her lawsuit—arguing that there is no agreement because Trump didn’t sign it. Accordingly, if there’s no agreement, the arbitration clause within can be disregarded. \n \n The stakes are daunting enough for Clifford, at least on paper—the agreement contains a $1 million liquidated damages clause for each individual breach of the agreement, and it’s reasonable to assume that she doesn’t presently have $1 million in the bank. Whether or not filing such a lawsuit publicly might separately constitute such a breach, or multiple such breaches, is a rabbit hole beyond the scope of the rabbit hole we’ve already crawled down. That a lawsuit seeking to undo the terms of an agreement could potentially violate that agreement suggests that we’re inside a farcical adaptation of the film Inception. \n \n At every stage of this story, the White House has simply pretended that Stephanie Clifford doesn’t exist. On Wednesday, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said that Trump had been unaware of the payment and that he denied the relationship took place, another point of contention of the lawsuit itself—the suit argues that it stretches credulity to argue Trump didn’t know about the payment—and one that would seem potentially to offer another avenue for invalidating it. If Trump was not even aware of the agreement, how could he agree to it and how could Cohen even have acted as an agent on his behalf in signing? Then again, what Trump supposedly paying $130,000 for was the right to pretend none of this ever happened. Harvey Weinstein can probably sympathize. \n \n Ultimately, if Trump chooses to enforce the agreement against Clifford in court it will serve as a tacit admission of Clifford’s underlying story. However, if a court throws out the suit and the enforcement is made in arbitration, then we may never get the full story. Perhaps the lesson here is that nondisclosure agreements over personally embarrassing incidents involving the rich and famous aren’t particularly useful as anything more than a calculated bluff, when the revelations can’t be undone by 1 million uncollectable dollars.', 'Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. \n \n / Updated By Sarah Fitzpatrick \n \n President Donald Trump\'s lawyer is trying to silence adult-film star Stormy Daniels, obtaining a secret restraining order in a private arbitration proceeding and warning that she will face penalties if she publicly discusses a relationship with the president, NBC News has learned. \n \n The new pressure on Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, comes a day after she filed a lawsuit in a Los Angeles court alleging that a nondisclosure agreement she made to keep quiet about an ""intimate"" relationship with Trump is invalid because he never signed it. \n \n Tuesday\'s lawsuit says that Trump attorney Michael Cohen — who brokered the agreement with Clifford during the presidential campaign — attempted to ""intimidate"" Clifford and ""shut her up"" by initiating what it calls a ""bogus arbitration proceeding"" against her in Los Angeles on Feb. 27. \n \n On that day, Cohen obtained a temporary restraining order against Clifford from the private arbitrator, a retired judge, which bars her from disclosing ""confidential information"" related to the nondisclosure agreement signed in October 2016, according to a copy of the order obtained by NBC News. \n \n Read the temporary restraining order against Stormy Daniels \n \n On Feb. 28, Cohen emailed the restraining order to Clifford\'s former attorney, Keith Davidson. ""The document itself is to remain confidential and not to be disclosed to anyone as per the terms of the judge\'s order,"" the email, obtained by NBC News, said. \n \n Reached for comment late Wednesday afternoon, Clifford\'s current attorney, Michael Avenatti, said Cohen, through his own attorney, Lawrence Rosen, has made further attempts to enforce the order and caution Clifford that she is subject to damages if she talks about Trump. \n \n ""Earlier today, Mr. Cohen through his attorney, Mr. Rosen, further threatened my client in an effort to prevent her from telling the truth about what really happened,"" Avenatti said. ""We do not take kindly to these threats, nor we will be intimidated."" \n \n Cohen and Rosen did not immediately respond to requests for comment from NBC News. \n \n But Rosen, who has represented Trump and his companies in the past, said in a statement to other media outlets that the agreement with Clifford contained an arbitration clause with permission to ""seek an injunction in the event of a breach or threatened breach of the agreement."" \n \n “The designated judge from the arbitration tribunal found that Ms. Clifford had violated the agreement and enjoined her from, among other things, filing this lawsuit,"" Rosen said in the statement. \n \n White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a press briefing Wednesday that Trump denies ""all of these allegations"" — that he had an affair with Clifford more than a decade ago or that he knew Cohen had paid her $130,000. \n \n ""I have had conversations with the president about this and as I outlined earlier, this case had already been won in arbitration,"" Sanders said. It\'s unclear what Sanders was referring to; Trump is not listed as a party on the restraining order issued by the arbitration judge. \n \n Asked about that comment, Avenatti quipped, ""Yeah, and he won the popular vote, too."" \n \n Analysis: Stormy Daniels isn\'t suing Donald Trump for cash \n \n “President Trump hasn’t won anything relating to Ms. Clifford,"" he added. \n \n ""First of all, it does not appear as if he was even a party to the arbitration Ms. Sanders is referring to. How can you win something you’re not even a part of? Secondly, claiming that Mr. Trump ‘won’ at arbitration when there has been no hearing, no notice to Ms. Clifford, no opportunity given to her to respond, and no decision on the merits, is completely bogus."" \n \n Earlier on Wednesday, Avenatti told ""Today"" that Clifford\'s lawsuit, if successful, would allow his client to ""tell her story."" \n \n ""She believes it\'s important that the public learn the truth about what happened,"" he said. ""I think it\'s time for her to tell her story and for the public to decide who is telling the truth."" \n \n The suit asks a California court to affirm that the agreement Clifford signed is invalid. \n \n The ""hush agreement,"" as it\'s called in the suit, refers to Clifford as Peggy Peterson and another individual as David Dennison. In one of the documents, the true identity of Dennison is blacked out, but Avenatti said the individual is Trump. \n \n Clifford signed both the agreement and a side letter agreement using her professional name on Oct. 28, 2016, just days before the 2016 presidential election. Cohen signed the document the same day.

The producer, Anthony Massey, replied in florid terms. \n \n ""It was late summer or early autumn of 1988 when he [Thompson] was the newly appointed editor of the Nine O\'Clock News, and I was a Home News Organiser. It was 9.15 in the morning, in the middle of the old sixth floor newsroom. \n \n ""I went up to his desk to talk about some story after the 9.00 meeting we used to have then.

It hurt. I pulled my arm out of his jaws, like a stick out of the jaws of a labrador."" \n \n Massey told his then boss, Chris Cramer, now a senior CNN executive, that he wanted to ""bring the whole BBC disciplinary process"" against Mr Thompson, but the incident ""lost momentum"" when Mr Massey was sent on a month-long assignment abroad. \n \n Paxman, in his reply, said he found the tale extraordinary. ""If any of this came out, he\'d be toast,"" he wrote of Thompson. \n \n Mr Massey passed the email exchange with Paxman to a friend, who passed it to other colleagues in the BBC, and it was quickly forwarded to scores of people, and leaked to the Guardian. \n \n Today Mr Massey was refusing to comment: ""I\'m afraid I cannot help."" But the BBC, concerned that it might be seen to victimise the producer for what it admitted was ""just gossip"" that was never intended for publication, said there would be no recriminations and that Mr Massey was expected to turn up for work as normal last night. \n \n After speaking to Mr Thompson, a BBC spokesman confirmed there had been an incident, but attempted to play down the story. \n \n ""There was an incident 17 years ago when Mark was editor of the Nine O\'Clock News.

""And he tells Anastasia to wipe that smile off his face.

The temporary Feb. 27 order, obtained in a private arbitration meeting with a retired judge, prohibits Daniels (whose real name is Stephanie Clifford) from discussing ""confidential information"" related to the nondisclosure agreement she signed in Oct. 2016, NBC News reports. Daniels' lawyer tells NBC that Cohen has continued to make efforts to silence Daniels via ""threats"" and ""intimidation"" since the order was procured, warning her she is subject to damages should she talk. In her lawsuit against Trump attempting to have the NDA declared invalid, filed Tuesday, Daniels refers to a ""bogus,"" ""improper and procedurally defective arbitration proceeding hidden from public view,"" the AP reports. Cohen's own attorney says the NDA Daniels signed included an arbitration clause with permission to ""seek an injunction in the event of a breach or threatened breach of the agreement,"" and that ""the designated judge from the arbitration tribunal found that Ms. Clifford had violated the agreement and enjoined her from, among other things, filing [her lawsuit against Trump]."" Also Wednesday, White House rep Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that Trump denies ""all of these allegations""—both the affair and any knowledge of Cohen's $130,000 payment to Daniels—and that ""this case [has] already been won in arbitration."" Her exact meaning was not clear, as Trump is not listed as a party on the restraining order, and CNN's Chris Cillizza notes several of Sanders' ""non-answers"" skirt the issue of whether Trump knew about the hush money. If all of this seems a lot to wrap your head around, you're not alone; Slate calls it ""convoluted to the point of paradox."""
35,"['Of the 12 arrested on Saturday, seven were booked at the Anaheim Detention Facility, according to a statement released by Anaheim Police. \n \n Three people were stabbed, one with a flagpole, and 12 people were arrested during a brawl on Saturday morning between self-described Ku Klux Klan members and counter-protesters at an Anaheim park, police said. \n \n Initially arrested were five Klan members – four men and a woman – and seven counter-protesters – five men, a male juvenile and a woman. Seven people were booked in the Anaheim jail on assault or abuse charges. Police are seeking one additional suspect who can be seen in a video of the altercation punching a Klansman. \n \n “I’ve lived in Anaheim my whole life and I have never heard of anything like this,” said Anaheim resident Joe Castaneda, who saw the melee break out. \n \n The confrontation occurred at around noon after a group of six KKK members showed up at Pearson Park, a witness said. Klan leaders earlier this week announced their intention to hold a rally there, and a group of about 30 counter-protesters were waiting for them. \n \n One of the counter-protesters was stabbed with the decorative end of a flagpole, said Anaheim police Sgt. Daron Wyatt. An officer responding to the scene saw one of the Klansmen stab a counter-protester with a knife. The Klansman admitted to stabbing the man, but told the officers that it was self-defense, Wyatt said. \n \n The counter-protesters and the Klansmen briefly had words before the fight began, Castaneda said. \n \n He said the counter-protesters were telling the Klansmen that they weren’t welcome in the community and to get out. He couldn’t hear what the Klansmen were saying. \n \n “Some words were exchanged and that is pretty much when the fight began,” Castaneda said. \n \n The Klansmen were badly outnumbered, Castaneda said, forcing most of them to get back into a black SUV and try to flee. They left three Klansmen behind. \n \n “It was just the three of them against a whole crowd,” Castaneda said. \n \n At one point, Castaneda said, one of the Klansmen lunged at him with the flagpole, but backed away after Castaneda stepped back and showed the man a cane he uses to walk. \n \n The men were wearing military type clothing, Castaneda said. “They were definitely dressed up (for) the occasion.” \n \n The man stabbed by the flag pole was taken to a hospital in critical condition, Wyatt said, but his condition later improved. The second stabbing victim suffered lesser injuries. The extent of injuries for the third victim, found in a vehicle on Lemon Street, was not clear. All victims are expected to survive. \n \n Warning: The following video contains graphic footage. \n \n Anaheim police on Friday sent a Twitter message out telling the community that they were aware of the planned KKK rally. The message noted that several other rallies have occurred over the past few years, with a small group of Klansman passing out “literature” and holding signs. \n \n Counter-protesters had been at the park since early Saturday morning awaiting the rally, according to a witness who had been there since 9 a.m. \n \n “You could feel the pulsing energy. I know that people were watching the street to see when the Klansmen would show up,” said Melodye Shore of Laguna Niguel, who was observing the protest with a friend. “As soon as they saw that van, they were just all over it.” \n \n She said police response was not immediate. \n \n “I would think that they would be a physical presence, considering that they did know that there was a planned activity,” she said. “They should have been right there. But no, it took awhile. I had time to take a bunch of pictures before the police showed up.” \n \n Anaheim Police said in a news release they had a contingent of officers dedicated to the event. “Those officers were on scene immediately as the violence erupted and called for additional personnel,” according to the statement. \n \n On Saturday, most of the protesters were gone by mid-afternoon, with a group of about two-dozen park visitors remaining to watch police go over the portion of Cypress Street where the conflict occurred. \n \n The Klan once had a strong presence in Anaheim, and at the Pearson Park site. \n \n On April 14, 1924, Anaheim voters elected four of five City Council members who secretly belonged to the Klan. \n \n Many city workers resigned, but nine of Anaheim\'s 10 police officers supported the Klan – which held parades, painted the streets with K.I.G.Y. for “Klansmen I Greet You,” and stationed gunmen on buildings to shoot anyone dousing their burning crosses. \n \n In August 1924, the Klan staged its largest rally ever in the state, drawing 10,000 people to what is now called Pearson Park. Within a year, however, on Feb. 3, 1925, more than 95 percent of the voters turned out to recall the Klansmen and reclaim their town. \n \n Wyatt said police are seeking video footage of the melee. \n \n ""We know there were all kinds of people out here with video, and we need that,"" he said. \n \n He asked witnesses to call Orange County Crime Stoppers at 855-847-6227. \n \n Staff writer Samuel Mountjoy contributed to this report.', 'The former bassist in the all-female teenage rock group has described being drugged and raped at an aftershow party in 1975 \n \n Jackie Fuchs, formerly the bassist in all-female rock band the Runaways, has spoken for the first time about an incident in which she was allegedly raped by the group’s then manager, Kim Fowley. \n \n In a report published in the Huffington Post titled The Lost Girls, Fuchs describes a New Year’s Eve gig in Orange County, California, in 1975, when she was aged 16. \n \n According to the bassist, who performed under the name Jackie Fox, Fowley took the band to a hotel near the club after the show, where they started celebrating with friends. Witnesses claim she was given a number of Quaalude sedatives, before Fowley allegedly asked if one of the roadies at the party would like to have sex with Fuchs. \n \n “You don’t know what terror is until you realise something bad is about to happen to you and you can’t move a muscle,” Fuchs is reported as saying. “I can’t move. I can’t speak. All I can do is look him in the eye and do the best I can do to communicate: please say no ... I don’t know what it looked like from the outside. But I know what was going on inside and it was horror”. \n \n The roadie declined Fowley’s offer, but Fuchs says she then started to slip in and out of consciousness. \n \n “I remember opening my eyes, Kim Fowley was raping me, and there were people watching me,” said Fuchs. \n \n According to the article, Fuchs said she was unwilling to make her alleged rape public until the recent number of high-profile sexual assault cases involving prominent individuals such as Bill Cosby and Kesha’s producer Dr Luke. Kesha has accused Dr Luke of drugging and assaulting her, while he has countersued, accusing her of lying to get out of her contract. Meanwhile, it emerged on 6 July that Cosby obtained Quaaludes with the intent of giving them to young women he wanted to have sex with. \n \n Fowley, who died in January, had previously denied any sexual impropriety with members of the band. The Huffington Post cites a passage in the Runaways’ 2013 band biography: “They can talk about it until the cows come home but, in my mind, I didn’t make love to anybody in the Runaways nor did they make love to me.” \n \n Fuchs left the group in 1977.

Their target, SIS leader Abu Sayyaf, did not go down quietly. \n \n The preplanned operation near the eastern Syrian city of al-Amr was supposed to be a snatch-and-grab mission to capture Abu Sayyaf alive. Instead, he was killed amid an intense fire fight and hand-to-hand combat between ISIS militants and the Army Delta Force commandos. \n \n Twelve enemy fighters were killed in the operation, while no American forces were hurt, U.S. officials said. \n \n As the Special Operations Forces departed, they took Abu Sayyaf\'s wife, Umm Sayyaf, who is also considered to be an ISIS operative, into custody. As the helicopters departed, they were struck by heavy ground fire but not disabled and were able to depart the area safely. \n \n The mission is the first known American commandos operation inside Syria outside of a failed attempt to rescue hostages held by ISIS last year. \n \n Umm Sayyaf is being held in Iraq and will be secluded from other prisoners, officials told NBC News. She is accused of being ""directly complicit in (ISIS) activities, specifically human trafficking,"" an official said. \n \n The White House\'s National Security Council confirmed Umm Sayyaf is being ""debriefed."" \n \n ""We are also working to determine any information she may have regarding hostages — including American citizens who were held by (ISIS),"" spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan said in a statement. \n \n In addition, Friday\'s operation ""also led to the freeing of a young Yazidi woman who appears to have been held as a slave by the couple,"" the White House said. \n \n Abu Sayyaf was in charge of overseeing ISIS\'s oil and gas operations, which provide crucial revenue for the militant group that has conquered swaths of Syria and neighboring Iraq. Iraqi authorities supported Friday\'s raid. \n \n A U.S. military official described the mission, which was met with heavy resistance from ISIS, as a ""hugely successful operation” and represents a “significant blow” to the terror network operating in Syria and Iraq. \n \n ""Despite the rhetoric, (ISIS) is suffering significant losses in leadership and the ability to conduct operations,"" the official told NBC News. ""Through strikes in Iraq and Syria, the Kurdish offensive in northern Syria and military successes in Iraq, (ISIS) is desperate."" \n \n The United States is leading a coalition in a military campaign to roll back the jihadist group whose self-declared caliphate in Syria and Iraq has reshaped the region. \n \n In the Iraqi city of Ramadi, U.S.-led air strikes forced ISIS to withdraw from a government building over which the group\'s black flag had flown on Friday. Were it to fall, Ramadi would be the first major city to be won by ISIS since an effort by Iraqi security forces and paramilitary groups to push it back began last year. \n \n In Syria, the group fought Syrian government forces for control of the ancient city of Palmyra, an attack that has raised fears its UNESCO World Heritage site could meet the same fate as monuments destroyed by ISIS in Iraq. \n \n While Washington is working closely with Iraq in the fight against ISIS, it has shunned the idea of cooperating with Syrian President Bashar Assad, who it says has lost legitimacy to rule and must leave power. The United States said it did not warn Assad in advance or coordinate with his officials over Friday\'s special forces raid. \n \n IN-DEPTH \n \n SOCIAL \n \n — Kristen Welker, Richard Engel, Jim Miklaszewski and Courtney Kube \n \n Reuters contributed to this report.']",3,"– Authorities say 13 people are in custody following a violent altercation that left three people stabbed at a Ku Klux Klan gathering in Southern California, the AP reports.

A man wearing a ""Grand Dragon"" shirt was seen kicked by protesters, the LA Times reports, and Brian Levin, director of CSU San Bernardino's Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, says he pushed a Klan leader away during the violence. ""How do you feel that a Jewish guy just saved your life?"" Levin says he asked him. According to Levin, the man replied, ""Thank you."" The KKK's history in Anaheim goes way back: The hate group held four out of five seats on the City Council before being ousted during a recall effort in 1924. Almost 300 Klansmen once lived in the city, where they patrolled with masks and robes and once held a rally that drew 20,000.

(Katherine Frey/The Washington Post) \n \n U.S. soccer star Megan Rapinoe never got a chance to kneel during the national anthem Wednesday at Maryland SoccerPlex. \n \n In a preemptive move, the owner of the Washington Spirit, Air Force veteran Bill Lynch, ordered “The Star-Spangled Banner” to be played while the teams were in the locker room. \n \n The Spirit took the action, the National Women’s Soccer League club said, “rather than subject our fans and friends to the disrespect we feel such an act would represent.” \n \n [Rapinoe responds after the game: ‘It’s [expletive] unbelievable. Saddened by it.’] \n \n Typically, the players warm up for an extended period, return to the locker room for final instructions, then take the field for introductions and the anthem. In this case, moments after the Spirit and Seattle Reign players finished warm-ups and retreated indoors, fans were asked to stand and observe the anthem. \n \n Rapinoe first knelt for the anthem Sunday during the Reign’s game at Chicago against the Red Stars, saying she did it as a nod to San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick. Kaepernick created a national stir late last month when he refused to stand for the anthem during a preseason game. \n \n [Colin Kaepernick plans to put money from his top-selling jersey to good use] \n \n Players on both teams arrived at the SoccerPlex unaware of plans for the early playing of the anthem. Spirit Coach Jim Gabarra told his players in the locker room just before the anthem started. Rapinoe, who had entered as a substitute in the previous two matches, was not in Seattle’s starting lineup and came on in the second half. \n \n In a match twice delayed by lightning, the first-place Spirit (12-3-3) won, 2-1, to clinch home-field advantage in the league semifinals, Sept. 30 or Oct. 1. Crystal Dunn, Rapinoe’s U.S. Olympic teammate, scored a sensational goal from 22 yards just before halftime and Cheyna Williams put away a rebound in the 61st minute. Kim Little converted a penalty kick in the 71st for the Reign (6-6-6). \n \n [More on the match, plus video of Dunn’s goal] \n \n The Spirit said it did not want Rapinoe to detract from the final regular season home game, which, combined with other results in the league, could’ve clinched first place for Washington with two matches remaining. \n \n “We understand this may be seen as an extraordinary step, but believe it was the best option to avoid taking focus away from the game on such an important night for our franchise,” the Spirit said in a statement. “While we respect every individual’s right to express themselves, and believe Ms. Rapinoe to be an amazing individual with a huge heart; we respectfully disagree with her method of hijacking our organization’s event to draw attention to what is ultimately a personal — albeit worthy — cause.” \n \n Kaepernick’s stance has continued to generate headlines. The NFL.com’s Steve Wyche was the first to notice Kaepernick sitting during the anthem before the 49ers Aug. 27 game against Green Bay. “I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,” Kaepernick said afterward. “To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.” \n \n Kaepernick has continued to sit for the anthem since, and Rapinoe is part of a handful of athletes to follow his lead. The Spirit, however, was able to sidestep any controversy with its move Wednesday night. \n \n “As a veteran owned team, the national anthem holds an exceptionally special meaning for this organization,” the team’s statement continued. “Our owner Bill Lynch has lost personal friends during overseas conflicts and has other close friends who have also lost loved ones. Playing the national anthem prior to sports events became standard during World War II and was a way to express the team’s and fan’s patriotism and show support for the U.S. Military. The tradition of honoring our military and our patriotism before our games is very important to us. We strongly feel that there are better ways to begin a conversation about a cause than tarnishing a tradition that is so important to so many.” \n \n “To willingly allow anyone to hijack this tradition that means so much to millions of Americans and so many of our own fans for any cause would effectively be just as disrespectful as doing it ourselves. Professional athletes have incredible numbers of followers, to which we believe they have the ability to articulate a conversation with objectives and plans and begin a serious conversation directly, or through traditional media appearances, without insulting our military and our fans. \n \n “We do regret that this decision has denied the players who had no intention of taking a knee their own opportunity to honor our great country from the field. This is an issue we are communicating to and with them about personally.” \n \n NWSL Commissioner Jeff Plush attended Wednesday’s match and, after the anthem played, said he was unaware of the Spirit’s plans. \n \n “I would have preferred to have had an honest dialogue of what we wanted to do, what their goals were, and then work through it,” he said. “I don’t suggest I have all the answers, but it’s better to talk about it. I’m disappointed.” \n \n On the broader topic, he said: “It’s an emotional issue. I’m trying to be aware of that and respectful of different points of view. It’s a challenging issue and a challenging time. We’ve got some issues we need to work through as a country. … The issue brought forth by Colin and then Megan is a real issue. We need to have serious conversations about it. I don’t know whether it belongs on the playing surface. It’s bigger than us.” \n \n In recent days, Lynch shared his feelings about the anthem controversy with his players, saying he would be disappointed if any of them followed Rapinoe’s lead. He did not threaten to fine or suspend anyone who did kneel. \n \n The Spirit and Reign will meet again Sunday in Seattle. \n \n In a statement released earlier Wednesday, Reign management said: “We will continue to encourage all Reign players to participate in the pre-match ceremony, which honors those who have served and made sacrifices on our behalf. We will also continue to allow players to participate in the pre-match ceremony in a manner consistent with their personal beliefs, reflecting our respect for the rights earned and defended by those fighting for our nation.”', 'Police officers at Maryland SoccerPlex were assigned to Seattle Reign star Megan Rapinoe, whose decision to kneel during the national anthem has stirred controversy.

We were told just before we left the locker room that the anthem had already been played. I let Megan know that. We had a very brief reaction to that. We were trying to be very focused on what we were trying to do. I just felt there was a strange atmosphere at the start of the game because most people thought it would’ve been played and we are walking out not really knowing why.” \n \n Are you disappointed how the anthem issue was handled? \n \n “Disappointed in the sense that we’ve tried to do everything we can to prepare for every eventuality leading up to today. To not be notified prior is disappointing.” \n \n The Spirit owner said he didn’t want Megan hijacking the event, but now the anthem is the topic of discussion after the game. \n \n “The last thing we’re speaking about is the game.

Is a Millennial Grocery Chain the Fix? Come to 365 for the cage-free eggs, stay for the TeaBot. \n \n When the first 365 by Whole Foods Market opened near me in Los Angeles, I went immediately, curious to see how millennials shop for food. Do they just take photos of it? Do they look for items with their own names on them? Do they even buy groceries? Don’t they just smash buttons on their iPhones until a cooked meal appears at their door? Market researcher Mintel reported last year that 40 percent of them don’t even eat cereal because it requires cleaning up afterward. \n \n The 365 concept is Whole Foods’ response to three quarters of sales declines at stores open at least a year. The parent store’s focus on organic and local has been copied elsewhere, cheaper. It’s getting killed by Trader Joe’s and Aldi, because they offer lower prices; smaller, easy-to-navigate stores; and an ever-rotating selection of inventive items covered in chocolate or Sriracha. Whole Foods is a victim of its own success: It got shoppers to buy fresh groceries instead of stuffing their freezers. But that meant they were going to the store more often, so they wanted to get out faster, without having to choose among 100 olive oils. And if you’re going to get them to drive somewhere, the destination has to feel like an “experience” they can’t get online. Instacart and AmazonFresh have the competitive advantage there, among folks who want to stay on the couch, snacking on something other than cereal. \n \n Photographer: Julian Berman for Bloomberg Businessweek \n \n Whole Foods has signed 19 leases for 365 stores across the country. It planted the first in the hipster-est section of L.A., Silver Lake, known for having a coffee shop/dog adoption agency and a stop sign on which someone’s added “Hammer Time” in graffiti. To get the perspective of someone in 365’s target audience, I brought along my 27-year-old friend Igor Hiller; his millennial bona fides include doing improv at Upright Citizens Brigade and having car insurance paid by his mother. \n \n Photographer: Julian Berman for Bloomberg Businessweek \n \n We were greeted outside with a sign that said “Free Air Guitars.” Walking in, we found a clean, well-lit, and colorful store, with exposed beams and ducts. There were no employees in sight, as if to say, “Shop, don’t shop, totally up to you, dude.” (What they’re actually saying is: fewer employees, less overhead, smaller costs to pass on.) Igor liked it immediately. He liked that it was a third smaller than the Whole Foods he spent hours roaming as a screenwriter’s assistant; that items were cheaper, closer to what he paid at Trader Joe’s; that there were only a few choices per product; and that the salad bar was priced by the container, not the pound, making him reconsider his entire belief system about avoiding items with a lot of water weight. He got way too excited that prices were listed on digital tablets instead of on chalkboards with photos of farmers—he gets it, farmers grow food, whatever. He didn’t mind the absence of a butcher or a cheesemonger, or that the wine expert was replaced by a screen where he could search reviews of pinot noirs. \n \n We stopped at the TeaBot, where we chose personalized blends, caffeine levels, and temperatures. Mine was based on a mixture called Chai These Nuts. Then we went over to a mural that said “Silver Kale.” Igor made me pose with him in front of it while another shopper took our photo. “It’s very Instagrammable,” Igor said. “That’s why they put that in.” He didn’t like the anagram, though. (Get it? Silver Lake, Silver Kale?) “I hate any advertisement that pretends to know me. You’re not my friend. You’re a company. Don’t try to have an inside joke with me.” \n \n There seemed to be fewer shoppers at 365 who were Igor’s age than there were fortysomethings like me. Five minutes after we got there, we ran into my Generation X friend Bruce Gilbert, a music supervisor for shows such as Transparent and Orange Is the New Black, wearing a Joy Division T-shirt with lead singer Ian Curtis replaced by Joey Tribbiani from Friends. Sipping a cortado from the Allegro cafe—it also serves beer and wine—he told us he’d been there four times in the previous three days, partly to check out the MILF scene. “I was here at 10 o’clock last night,” he said, which was apparently peak time. He hadn’t shopped for groceries yet. \n \n Photographer: Julian Berman for Bloomberg Businessweek \n \n That’s cool with 365’s president, the very chill Gen Xer Jeff Turnas, who’s been with Whole Foods for 21 years. “We didn’t set out to say we just want millennials in our store,” he says. “We set out to create a fun, new, fresh way to shop with amazing prices.” Turnas spent the past few years in Europe and, with 365, is trying to copy the vibe that makes supermarkets there more experiential. He obsessed about the store’s music; the playlist, which you can subscribe to on Spotify (current followers: 34), includes such songs as Odessa by Caribou and How Did I Get Here by Odesza. (The website 365 team members use for job information is called Backstage Pass; a “You Rocked It” program lets them award points to co-workers that can be redeemed for gift cards.) And Igor was right: Turnas added the mural after the stylish company that provides 365’s employee uniforms told him the store needed an Instagram attraction. “I liked ‘Silver Save’ more than ‘Silver Kale,’ ” he says, preferring a message that riffed on prices. “But we let the artist do his thing.” \n \n Photographer: Julian Berman for Bloomberg Businessweek \n \n Turnas is also cool with the store’s fake Instagram account. Created by 27-year-old music video director Jack Wagner, it gained attention for fabricating a story that singer Kim Gordon had been bitten by a coyote in the parking lot. It also posted a fake apology from a barista for inserting indie rock cassette tapes into boxes of organic cereal. Wagner started the account after walking to 365 every morning to get a breakfast burrito and iced coffee. He, too, hasn’t yet purchased any groceries. “We drank beers,” Wagner says. “We treated it like a bar and pregamed there before a Memorial Day party.” Turnas says Wagner’s account might have bothered the executives who run Whole Foods, but not the folks at 365. “I’m not sure it’s negative,” Turnas says. He figures it’s an honor that someone cared enough to mock the place. Still, supermarket analyst Phil Lempert, the food trends editor for NBC’s Today show, says 365 is “trying way too hard to be hip.” \n \n It’s difficult enough to succeed even when you’re not. Tesco, the hugely successful British grocer, started a U.S. chain called Fresh & Easy in 2007 and wound up loaning Ron Burkle $234 million in 2013 to assume its liabilities; Burkle closed all 150 stores last October. Fresh & Easy was intentionally unhip. Vegetables and fruits were wrapped in cellophane—it was supposed to make them look convenient and safe, but they were seen instead as gross. The self-checkout lines were confusing. The lack of Sriracha-and-chocolate-influenced products bored customers. \n \n Some items available at 365 that you won’t find at regular Whole Foods Sweet potato wrap with feta & kale: $4 \n \n Orange-maple salmon with edamame quinoa pilaf & asparagus: $10 \n \n Sriracha soy-chicken skewers: $6.99/lb. \n \n Chimichurri beef-skirt steak: $12.99/lb. \n \n Carrot dog: $6 \n \n Peanut power bowl: $8 \n \n Vegan veggie pizza: $12 \n \n Harissa boneless pork tenderloin: $9.99/lb. \n \n Farmed tilapia with tequila-lime rub: $8.99/lb. \n \n Mixed summer squash noodles: $4 \n \n Potato-cheddar-jalapeño pierogi: $3.99 \n \n Momofuku ssäm sauce: $5.99 \n \n Aldi, however, has had great success as a no-frills supermarket. (In a not-very-millennial move, Aldi, a private company, declined to share its financials.) It’s all about speed and price, not Spotify playlists. Aldi is as cheap as a grocery can be, and when I visited one alone in Arcadia, about 20 minutes outside L.A., I could see why. You put a quarter in the shopping cart dispenser to rent one, getting your money back when you return it, so no worker has to play fetch. There are no paper or plastic bags—it’s BYOB—and no one to put what you buy into them. Items are displayed Costco-style, in the cases they arrived in, and about 90 percent are house brands. Instead of 30 aisles, there are only five, but there’s room for constantly changing “Aldi Finds” such as chocolate-covered pistachios and Sriracha kettle chips. “The customer doesn’t have to walk in the store and have so many options and take time to decide. We’ve done that work for them,” says Liz Ruggles, Aldi’s marketing director. There are 1,500 Aldi stores in the U.S., and the company says it plans to open 500 more by the end of 2017. \n \n More competition is coming. Kroger, the largest supermarket chain in the country, is working on its own cooler version of itself: In February it opened a Main & Vine in Gig Harbor, Wash., exactly the kind of city you want to audition in. Produce, which makes up half the store’s inventory, is in the interior aisles, not on the perimeter, an acknowledgment that people are putting fresh ingredients center stage in their meal planning. A chef cooks at a table in the front of the store, and you can buy the ingredients to re-create his dishes, such as Mexican-style corn; bacon, Brie, and apple baguette sandwiches; and spiced cherry grilled chicken thighs. There are regular wine, beer, and cheese tastings, as well as a bar and cafe. Millennials “want to hang out in a cool environment” and feel like foodies, says Mike Donnelly, Kroger’s executive vice president for merchandising, who’s in charge of Main & Vine. Up to a point. They don’t want bento boxes, Donnelly learned.

Per the Washington Post, Spirit owner Bill Lynch, an Air Force veteran, made sure the anthem was played at Maryland SoccerPlex only after his team and Rapinoe's Seattle Reign FC headed to the locker room after warmups, a preemptive strike against Rapinoe's anticipated repeat of her protest at a Sunday night game (a show of support for the 49ers' QB Colin Kaepernick). ""We understand this may be seen as an extraordinary step, but believe it was the best option to avoid taking focus away from the game on such an important night for our franchise,"" the Spirit said in a statement, referencing its last regular-season home game that could help earn it a first-place slot. The statement went on to say that although Rapinoe is ""an amazing individual with a huge heart,"" the Spirit didn't want her ""hijacking"" the game for her ""personal—albeit worthy—cause,"" nor to ""subject our fans and friends to the disrespect we feel such an act would represent."" Rapinoe, for her part, said after the game she was ""saddened"" by the song subterfuge and called it ""f---ing unbelievable"" and ""incredibly distasteful, four days before [the anniversary of] one of the worst tragedies in our country, to say I tried to hijack this event."" One other person not aware in advance of the Spirit's plans, per the Post: National Women's Soccer League Commissioner Jeff Plush, who says he was ""disappointed"" by Lynch's move.

Photo: Bax Lindhardt/Scanpix \n \n Danish submarine owner Peder Madsen is to appear in a Copenhagen court on Tuesday over the death of Swedish journalist Kim Wall on board his homemade underwater vessel UC3 Nautilus. \n \n Madsen is expected to appear in person at the court hearing due to begin at 2pm, according to the Danish public prosecutor's office. \n \n The 46-year-old inventor has been in custody since August 12th suspected of “negligent manslaughter” in a grisly case that has puzzled investigators and shocked the public. \n \n Danish prosecutors now plan to formally ask the Copenhagen district court to extend Madsen's detention, alleging that he murdered 30-year-old Wall and desecrated her body. \n \n Freelance journalist Wall's torso, with head and limbs cut off, was found floating in Køge Bay off Copenhagen on August 21st, ten days after she went missing while interviewing Madsen aboard his homemade submarine for a feature story she was researching about him. \n \n Madsen had insisted that he had “buried Wall at sea” after she died on board due to an “accident”. \n \n He denies the charges, Danish police said. \n \n Investigators say that the body's legs, arms and head, which have not yet been found, were removed deliberately, and that the body had been tampered with to make it sink. Wall's blood was found inside the submarine. \n \n “We will try to hold him in custody on a murder charge … after her body was found,” special prosecutor Jakob Buch-Jepsen told the AFP news agency on August 24th. \n \n Authorities are still searching for the rest of her remains, which they hope will provide some clues about the cause of death. Investigators have not commented on a possible motive. \n \n The court is expected to ask Madsen to undergo a psychiatric evaluation. \n \n READ ALSO: Who is Danish inventor Peter Madsen? \n \n \n \n Police scanning the submarine for clues.

Madsen framed it as an accident involving what Reuters describes as a ""heavy hatch cover,"" saying, ""I lose my foothold and the hatch shuts. Kim had been severely hurt and was laying with an intense bleeding. There was a pool of blood where she had landed."" The Copenhagen Post reports the cover weighs about 155 pounds, and reports that you had to pass through the hatch in order to reach the bridge to steer the submarine. Madsen testified that he sailed for deeper waters intending to commit suicide, but instead buried Wall at sea. The Local reports that Danish prosecutors are asking that Madsen remain in custody. Madsen's lawyer says his client still pleads not guilty on the manslaughter charge, but is guilty of desecrating Wall’s body in that he buried her at sea; Madsen claims her body was intact when he disposed of it, though it was not found that way."
39,"['Katharine Brown was one of David O. Selznick’s most trusted employees. Her job—and it was a 24-hour-a-day one—was to scour New York’s publishing circles and sniff out unproduced properties that her hard-driving boss could spin into box-office gold. As the mercurial, 34-year-old movie mogul’s official East Coast story editor and unofficial gal Friday/arbiter of good taste, Brown needed to have lightning-quick instincts and the thick hide of an elephant. After all, Selznick was notoriously demanding and infamous for his short-fused three a.m. phone calls. It wasn’t easy keeping pace with a mind that whirred as feverishly as Selznick’s. But Brown was one of the few movie executives who could keep up. \n \n On the afternoon of May 20, 1936, she fired off an urgent Teletype to her employer. The message read: “ . . . have just airmailed detailed synopsis of Gone with the Wind by Margaret Mitchell, also a copy of the book . . . This is an absolutely magnificent story . . . a great literary property and we must have it . . . The book is 1,000 pages long and I have only gotten through half of it, it is one of the most lush things I have ever read . . . I am absolutely off my nut about this book . . . I beg, urge, coax and plead with you to read it at once . . . I know that after you do you will drop everything and buy it.” \n \n In fact, Selznick did not drop everything after reading Gone with the Wind. He didn’t even crack its imposing spine. Instead, he relied on the 150-page synopsis that Brown had given him, poring over it while on vacation in Honolulu. Selznick knew that the success of adapting Mitchell’s novel would depend on casting. Even though he was a compulsive gambler who lived to place exorbitantly large bets—whether in the boardroom or at the horse track—he balked at the book’s rich $50,000 price tag. But like all gamblers, he lived in a constant state of fear that someone else might rake in a pot that he felt rightfully belonged to him. He wasn’t sure he wanted Gone with the Wind, but he was certain that he didn’t want anyone else to have it. \n \n So after several weeks of hemming and hawing, on July 6, 1936, Selznick finally relented to Brown’s impassioned pleas, opened his checkbook and paid a king’s ransom for the movie rights. It would be the easiest decision and the most incident-free moment of the next three years.', 'ATLANTA (AP) — Seventy-five years after the premiere of the movie ""Gone with the Wind,"" research is shedding light on the racial tensions that existed at the time between the producer and city of Atlanta officials. \n \n In this image released by Turner Classic Movies, Clark Gable, left, appears in character as Rhett Butler and Vivien Leigh as Scarlett O\'Hara, in the film ""Gone with the Wind."" 75 years after the premiere...

Selznick... (Associated Press) \n \n In this image released by Turner Classic Movies, Clark Gable, left, appears as Rhett Butler, and Vivien Leigh as Scarlett O\'Hara in a scene from the film, ""Gone with the Wind."" 75 years after the premiere... (Associated Press) \n \n Emory University film studies professor Matthew Bernstein has conducted extensive research into the archives of the film\'s producer, David O. Selznick. His findings illustrate some of Selznick\'s concerns with the city\'s treatment of the film\'s black stars at the Dec. 15, 1939 premiere. \n \n ""Producer David O. Selznick was upset that Hattie McDaniel would not be invited to the Atlanta premiere,"" said Bernstein. ""He argued over and over that she should be allowed."" \n \n McDaniel played the character, Mammy, and went on to become the first black actor to receive an Academy Award for her performance as Best Supporting Actress in 1940. \n \n Selznick was guided by the office of Atlanta\'s then-mayor William B. Hartsfield. It was Hartsfield that originally reached out to Selznick to bring the premiere to the city. \n \n But due to the racial segregation laws in the Jim Crow south, none of the movie\'s black stars were allowed to attend the premiere or even be included in the movie\'s promotional program. McDaniel did attend the Los Angeles premiere and was featured in the program. \n \n ""Selznick, because he was Jewish, was very mindful of the persecution of the Jews in Europe in the late-1930s under Nazism,"" Bernstein remarks. ""And he saw an analogy between that persecution and the life of African-Americans under Jim Crow, especially in the South."" \n \n Bernstein spent years poring over the Harry Ransom Center\'s Selznick archive at the University of Texas, Austin. Among the items studied, memos and telegrams exchanged with Selznick\'s staff document the extent of his efforts to persuade Atlanta officials to change their minds. \n \n However, Katharine Brown, Selznick\'s east coast assistant and story editor, concedes in a Dec. 8, 1939 letter to Selznick that efforts to include the black cast must end. \n \n ""I hope this will not prove to be a dissatisfaction to you but with everyone so touchy, I am trying very hard to use my very best judgment not to create situations,"" Brown writes. \n \n In contrast to the city\'s treatment of the movie\'s black cast, local black organizations performed at various events leading up to the night of the premiere. \n \n ""One of the most fascinating things about the festivities is Martin Luther King Jr., when he was 10 years old, actually appeared on stage at a charity ball dressed as a slave in front of a mock-up of Tara singing with the Ebenezer Baptist Church choir,"" Bernstein points out. \n \n Steve Klein, a spokesman for The King Center, confirmed the event as a reflection of the times but offered a poignant analogy for the civil- and human-rights icon. ""It\'s kind of neat that he could go on and be awarded the Nobel Prize.""', 'Audiences still frankly give a damn about the lavish Civil War epic ""Gone With the Wind"" 75 years after its release. \n \n When adjusted for inflation, the Oscar-winning romance remains the domestic box-office champ with a gross of $1.6 billion. The 220-minute Technicolor film received a record 13 Oscar nominations, winning eight competitive Academy Awards, including best film, actress (Vivien Leigh), supporting actress (Hattie McDaniel) and director (Victor Fleming). With a production cost estimated between $3.85 million and more than $4 million, it was the longest and most expensive Hollywood sound film of the time. \n \n More than 30 million copies of Margaret Mitchell\'s 1936 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, on which the film was based, have been sold. The film has been re-released eight times, been a staple on television since the 1970s and a bestseller on video, DVD and now Blu-ray. \n \n Celebrations of the film\'s diamond anniversary include an exhaustive exhibit at the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas, Austin, a new collector\'s edition Blu-Ray and several books including Life\'s ""Gone With the Wind: The Great American Movie 75 Years Later."" \n \n Despite criticism and controversy over the film\'s racial stereotypes — the slaves in the film are happy, and McDaniel\'s Mammy is a welcome member of the family and loyal servant — ""Gone With the Wind"" continues to have a special, if troubling, place in the hearts of American filmgoers. \n \n The film was and I think continues to be a pop cultural phenomenon. — USC Professor Richard Jewell \n \n ""The film was and I think continues to be a pop cultural phenomenon,"" said Richard Jewell, professor at USC\'s School of Cinematic Art. ""It\'s one of the few movies that lived up to the book."" \n \n Long before social media, the buzz surrounding the film version of ""GWTW"" was astonishing. After independent producer David O. Selznick brought the rights to the book, ""GWTW"" fans waited on every story coming out of Hollywood about the production, particularly about who would play the willful and beautiful Scarlett O\'Hara, the belle of the Tara plantation. \n \n Though such stars as Joan Crawford, Carole Lombard and Katharine Hepburn were among those considered to play Scarlett — about 1,400 actresses were interviewed — Selznick chose British actress Vivien Leigh, who had made a few films, to play the lead role. \n \n Fan favorite Clark Gable was selected to play Rhett Butler, the rakish Charlestonian who pursues her, and British actor Leslie Howard was cast as Scarlett\'s obsession, the glum Ashley Wilkes. Olivia de Havilland, best known for ingenue roles opposite Errol Flynn, landed the plum role as Wilkes\' sweet cousin and wife, Melanie, and McDaniel was chosen to play the O\'Haras\' beloved and opinionated Mammy. \n \n Jewell noted the film was brilliantly cast. ""Clark Gable was absolutely the right person to play Rhett Butler. Every actress in Hollywood wanted to play Scarlett. The fact that they went with a relatively unknown and she turned out to be the incarnation of Scarlett. It\'s like a baseball team when one day every one gets a hit. \n \n ""It\'s a testament to the old studio system where producers were the most important factor in most cases. Selznick kept that film together. It was Selznick\'s vision more than Victor Fleming\'s. To me he is one of the greatest producers of all time."" \n \n But as Missy Schwartz, editor of the Life ""GWTW"" book and a senior editor at Entertainment Weekly, pointed out, ""you can\'t watch it without 21st century eyes. You have to address race. It\'s problematic, there is no question. It is just not the reality [of slavery]."" \n \n The conversation about ""GWTW\'s"" treatment of slavery, race and a benign antebellum South was particularly heated over the last year with the release of 2013 best picture Oscar winner ""12 Years a Slave,"" which depicted the brutality of slavery. \n \n Todd Boyd, professor of critical studies at USC\'s School of Cinematic Arts, told The Times this year that ""the entirety of the history of African Americans in Hollywood has been problematic, and I think in some ways still is. A lot of people looked at those movies as sort of an authentic representation of what African Americans were like."" \n \n Jim Crow laws were in full force in the South 75 years ago. McDaniel and the other black cast members couldn\'t attend the premiere in Atlanta on Dec. 15, 1939. Gable had threatened to boycott the premiere but was persuaded by McDaniel to attend. The Life book reveals that during production, Gable had also protested when he learned there were segregated toilets on one of the sets, promising not to return if they were still there the next day. They weren\'t. \n \n African Americans protested the film when it opened in major cities. Black playwright Carlton Moss stated in the Daily Worker found Mammy\'s love for the white family ""that has helped to keep her people enchained forever"" particularly reprehensible. \n \n Jewell noted that a lot of films from the Golden Age of Hollywood make one ""uncomfortable"" because of depictions of race and other issues. ""But they need to be screened and talked about, as a way to measure the kind of attitudes that existed at that point, which was 75 years after the end of the Civil War. These kind of stereotypical depictions of black people need to be put in a historical context so people will have a better appreciation of how far we have come."" \n \n TCM host and film historian Robert Osborne believes ""GWTW"" has endured because of its emotional resonance. \n \n ""It\'s about survival,"" he said. ""It hit the world in the \'30s when Europe was going to war and just before we went into the war. Also, everybody has had somebody in their life that they loved more than they loved them back. \n \n ""I think the brilliant thing about the story is that there are little samplings of every part of us in it. It doesn\'t matter if it was set during the Civil War. It\'s a relevant movie about emotions."" \n \n ------------ \n \n Here are events, books and collector\'s items linked to the 75th anniversary of ""Gone With the Wind."" \n \n ""The Making of Gone with the Wind: The exhibition at the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas, Austin, features about 300 rare items culled from the center\'s David O.

South Korean Vice Defense Minister Baek Seung-joo said the gesture was aimed at fostering ""an international community full of humanitarianism and trust."" \n \n In the 1950-53 Korean War, China fought on North Korea\'s side against U.N. forces led by the United States. \n \n The return of the soldiers\' remains became possible when South Korean President Park Geun-hye offered to send them back during a visit to China last June, highlighting warming ties between the former combatants. \n \n Qin Furong, whose father died in the war, said she appreciated the move, although it\'s unclear if her father\'s remains were among those returned because many were still unidentified. \n \n ""We relatives feel gratitude that they could return the bodies to our home country, and I\'m glad to see the friendliness South Korea shows toward us,"" Qin said. \n \n In Seoul, Zou Ming, an official from the Chinese Ministry of Civil Affairs, thanked South Korea for its ""proactive efforts and sincerity."" \n \n For decades, the remains had been buried on a quiet hillside just south of South Korea\'s border with North Korea, outside the city of Paju. In recent years, the burying ground became popular with Chinese tourists visiting Paju. \n \n Beijing has never given a precise number for its Korean War dead, but estimates run as high as 900,000. \n \n While China remains North Korea\'s only real ally, it has also established close ties with the South since the two normalized diplomatic relations in 1992. China has overtaken the U.S. as South Korea\'s biggest trading partner, with two-way commerce between the two hitting $215 billion in 2012. \n \n The Chinese soldiers\' bodies were returned just ahead of China\'s traditional Tomb-Sweeping Day when families remember their dead ancestors.

In Entertainment Weekly, Chris Nashawaty tells the story of the film's making, which centered on producer David Selznick. He was at first reluctant to make the film, despite a glowing review of the book by one of his employees. ""I am absolutely off my nut about this book,"" Katharine Brown wrote, finally convincing him to take action. But plenty got in the way. Among the challenges: The first writer dropped out after spending months on the script. After a number of other writers tried their hand, including Selznick himself, writer Ben Hecht took it on, but there was no time for him to read Margaret Mitchell's book. So Selznick and director Victor Fleming ""stayed up all night acting out the story for him."" Clark Gable was under contract to Selznick's father-in-law, who finally ""loaned"" him to Selznick, with plenty of strings attached—and Gable wasn't thrilled about it. Original director George Cukor didn't get along with Gable and was eventually replaced by Fleming, who didn't get along with Vivien Leigh. ""Leigh hated Fleming. With a passion. Fleming hated her. Clark Gable hated David … Everybody hated David,"" an assistant said. Fleming quit before returning. Ultimately, the film required ""125 days of photography, 37 months of preparation, half a million feet of film and a budget of $4.25 million (at a time when the average feature cost less than $1 million),"" Nashawaty writes. And the trouble was far from over: Racism plagued the various premieres, with black cast members in many cases banned from attending, the Los Angeles Times reports. That prompted anger from Selznick, the AP reports; Gable, meanwhile, had already stood against segregated toilets on set, threatening to bail on the film, according to a Life magazine book cited by the Times. Ultimately, however, ""Selznick kept that film together,"" says a film scholar, and it still holds the record for domestic box-office gross, adjusted for inflation, the Times notes (and you can bet it's a lot better than the current crop of big-grossing films)."

How did Garth of Izar come to be regarded as the greatest Starfleet Captain of his time? \n \n \n \n This Kickstarter is for Prelude to Axanar, which we will film at the beginning of May. The Kickstarter for Prelude will pay for the actors, the make-up, visual effects and actual filming costs. The resulting film will be about 20 minutes and also produce about half a dozen vignettes of the characters talking about different subjects. \n \n \n \n Prelude to Axanar will then allow us to launch into Axanar having proven our ability to deliver professional quality Star Trek.

Another 10% we have budgeted for Perks (the gifts you earn at different donation levels). And there is generally a 10% drop out rate (which we hope is way less!). So basically we get 70% to spend on Prelude to Axanar. \n \n The budget for Prelude to Axanar was about $ 20,000. But thanks to all your donations, we have doubled that to $ 40,000, allowing us to do everything better and more professionally. We set the Kickstarter bar low at $ 10,000 as we really didn\'t know what kind of response we would get. We could have gotten Prelude done for $ 10,000, but it would have meant deferring payment to our VFX team and others, who graciously offered to work and take payment after the main Kickstarter if needed. So now we don\'t have to do that, or cut any corners. So the first $ 40,000 goes to Prelude. So to get that $ 40,000, we need to raise about $ 57,000 (remember we only get 70%), which we have done. \n \n What does that pay for? Well, first we need about $ 10,000 for make up. That is because we need to get all the initial design, sculpting and production of Richard Hatch\'s Klingon hair and make-up and Gary Graham\'s hair and make-up done up front. The good news is that money doesn\'t then need to be spent in Axanar. We have Make Up Effects Lab, the guys who actually worked on Star Trek since the beginning of TNG working with us, so you know we are getting the best. \n \n We also need about $ 10,000 to pay the actors and their expenses (Michael Hogan and JG Hertzler do not live in LA). When you get such amazing actors as we have gotten, you have to pay them because this is how they make a living. And we want them very invested in our project and to go above and beyond. For example, Richard Hatch (who is also my acting coach) has opened up his Tuesday acting class to our production to do rehearsals and scene work in class. That is an amazing opportunity. Gary Graham said he was going to come by to work with the other actors in the class. So if you want these professionals to be invested in your production, you need to invest in them. We have expanded our cast thanks to this Kickstarter. \n \n Then, there is the Visual Effects. That is $7,500 right now. That leaves $12,500 for the shoot itself. All those numbers are pretty accurate, but you never know what pops up. So it is nice to have a cushion. \n \n So again, to get that $ 40,000, we need to raise about $ 57,000. And thank you all for helping us reach that! \n \n Limited Edition Starfleet Procurement Patch available ONLY to donors! \n \n So what about what we raise above that? Well, first it will be nice to have a cushion in case we experience any cost overruns. But mostly, anything above the $ 57,000 or so will go into our Axanar infrastructure. So here is where that money goes: \n \n Infrastructure - We are spending $ 10,000 to fund the infrastructure of Axanar Productions. This means the legal paperwork needed to create our production company and the rather expensive insurance to cover all our productions over the coming year. It allows us to set up production offices (We have gotten the space for free in some amazing offices here in Los Angeles) and start to produce Axanar. \n \n Starfleet Tunics - $ 10,000 allows us to fund the Starfleet costumes for Axanar. We have retained the services of the company that produces the TOS tunic replicas for Anovos, so you know these tunics will be top quality. With a large cast, and needing to custom manufacture top quality costumes in quantity, we need to do it right. Making the Starfleet tunics will actually take 90 days from beginning to end. \n \n VFX - $ 10,000 goes to start paying Tobias Richter and his team for the work they are doing on Axanar. Tobias has already started putting out some amazing work and has spent days and days honing the look of the 3D ship models. \n \n USS Ares \n \n So there you go! That is where your money is going. Rest assured that whatever money we raise will go towards bringing you the Star Trek you all want to see. We take our responsibility to you seriously and appreciate that you have invested with us! \n \n We take PayPal!

More problematically, what does it mean for a corporation to assert ownership of a language that has at least one native speaker (who may or may not have rated this amazing crib) and many more who speak it daily as a second conversational language, hosting learned workshops on their chosen language. \n \n Paramount also asserts a copyright in the designs of Klingon ships and ""spacedocks,"" citing a controversial 2015 ruling that held that the Batmobile was a ""character"" and subject to copyright restrictions. \n \n However, Paramount and CBS disagree (bIlughbe’*). In their reply the rightsholders call the argument absurd and among other things, they point out that the language system is not very useful if there are no real Klingons to communicate with. “This argument is absurd, since a language is only useful if it can be used to communicate with people, and there are no Klingons with whom to communicate,” they write (full filing: pdf). “Defendants’ use of the Klingon language in their works is simply further evidence of their infringement of Plaintiffs’ characters, since speaking this fictitious language is an aspect of their characters.” \n \n PARAMOUNT: WE OWN THE KLINGON LANGUAGE [Ernesto/Torrentfreak] \n \n report this ad', 'Cookies on Pottermore \n \n We use cookies to give you the very best experience on the Pottermore website and to allow you to make use of all our site features.

Thus Paramount Pictures hopes to prosper as it wages a legal battle with the makers of popular Kickstarter crowdfunded Star Trek fan film Prelude to Axanar. Paramount claims the film's use of the fictional language Klingon adds up to copyright infringement; the filmmakers contend that attempting to copyright Klingon is absurd given the language is an ""idea or a system."" For legal precedent, they cite the system of bookkeeping: ""Although copyright protects the author’s expression of the system, it does not prevent others from using the system."" But there's doesn't appear to be a quick and easy answer. The US Copyright Office doesn't specifically ""deal with the copyrightability of constructed or fictional languages, let alone Klingon,"" observes Consumerist, which was unable to dig up much in the way of case law on the matter. Paramount, which claims exclusive ownership over many Star Trek features, including characters, themes, plots, dialogue, settings, props, character makeup, costumes, sets, fictional language, and so forth, has responded to the filmmakers' plea by noting that ""a language is only useful if it can be used to communicate with people, and there are no Klingons with whom to communicate,"" reports TorrentFreak. By allowing the characters in Prelude to speak Klingon, they assert, the film is infringing on Paramount's characters because speaking the language ""is an aspect of their characters."" The jury's still out, but Boing Boing goes so far as to call this Paramount's attempt to ""kill"" the film, and it frames Paramount's claims as ""dubious,"" in part because it borrows phonemes (from Hindi, Arabic, etc.) as well as grammar (from Japanese, Turkish, etc.)—not to mention it's spoken by many fans around the world. (Here's one wild use of Klingon in the real world.)"
41,"['The Colchester Zoo in England is home to a community of mandrills, the largest of the monkeys. One of these mandrills, a female named Milly, began covering her eyes with her hand when she was three. A dozen years later Milly and her zoo mates continue to perform this gesture, which appears to mean “do not disturb.” The signal is the first gesture with cultural roots reported in monkeys. \n \n Culture accounts for behavioral differences that are geo\xadgraphic, rather than genetic or environmental. Gestures—nonvocal, communicative actions—are often cultural in humans and sometimes in apes, notes Mark E. Laidre, an evolutionary biologist now at the University of California, Berkeley. Laidre observed the Colchester mandrills for a total of 100 hours during the summers of 2007 and 2008. As re\xadported in PLoS ONE in February, he found that mandrills performing the eye-covering gesture were approached and touched by other mandrills significantly less than when they were not using the gesture. “Animals who didn’t want to be bothered used it,” Laidre says. \n \n Laidre and other researchers studying mandrills have not seen the eye-covering gesture in other populations, indicating it is a local phenomenon. Laidre also ruled out alternative explanations for the gesture’s appearance. Milly does not have any medical issues with her eyes that might have prompted her to cover them, nor is the gesture more com\xad-mon on sunny days. It is also unlikely that human activity influenced the mandrills because monkeys—in contrast to apes, dolphins and dogs—do not mimic human behavior, Laidre says. All this evidence suggests that the eye-covering gesture arose naturally and that it conveys information within the mandrill community. \n \n Having brought attention to the Colchester mandrills’ gestural abilities, Laidre expects researchers will now find other monkeys using cultural gestures. If gesturing is per\xadformed more broadly among primates than previously thought, Laidre says, “the capacity to communicate with the hands in a meaningful way may have existed a long time before humans came on the scene.” \n \n This article was originally published with the title A Signal for Solitude.', 'Monkeys learn to cover their eyes when they want to be left alone Monkeys at Colchester Zoo have invented a unique do not disturb sign that has amazed experts. \n \n Photo: Eastnews Press Agency', 'Tweet with a location \n \n You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications. You always have the option to delete your Tweet location history. Learn more']",3,"– Monkeys at a British zoo have developed a way of saying ""leave me alone"" that doesn't involve biting or flinging poop. The mandrills cover their eyes—much like in the ""see no evil"" gesture—when they desire solitude, and their fellow monkeys respect the signal, the Telegraph reports. Researchers believe that a member of the group invented the sign and other monkeys picked it up in a never-before-witnessed example of monkeys creating sign language within their own community. The researcher who observed the phenomenon says he has been observing mandrills for years and never seen the gesture used anywhere else. Further research is likely to turn up more monkey gestures invented for cultural reasons, suggesting that ""the capacity to communicate with the hands in a meaningful way may have existed a long time before humans came on the scene,"" he tells Scientific American."

44,"['In a match made in hippie heaven, Phish guitarist Trey Anastasio will join the four living original members of The Grateful Dead for three 50th-anniversary shows July 3-5 at Soldier Field in Chicago. The Dead\'s last performance with Jerry Garcia, who died in August 1995, was at the same 55,000-seat capacity venue on July 9, 1995. \n \n Grateful Dead Q&A;: Bob Weir & Trey Anastasio on How It All Came Together \n \n The sense of closure is no \xadaccident: These shows are likely to be the finale for the ""core four,"" as the \xadsurviving members are now known: Bob Weir, 67; Phil Lesh, 74; Mickey Hart, 71; and Bill Kreutzmann, 68. ""These will be the last shows with the four of us together,"" Weir tells Billboard. \n \n ""That\'s why we\'re doing it in Chicago,"" says Peter Shapiro, 42, who\'s producing the shows in association with AEG-owned Madison House Presents. ""They\'re the great American rock\'n\'roll band returning to where it ended, 20 years later."" \n \n Anastasio is set to take the stage with the band, along with keyboardist Bruce Hornsby, a frequent player with the Dead during the \'80s and into the \'90s, and Jeff Chimenti, who plays keys with Weir\'s side project, RatDog. ""We had to sort through a number of options,"" says Weir. ""Were we going to do a festival-style event or go back to our classic mode of an evening with the band? We narrowed it down to: Let\'s just do it simple and clean."" \n \n Competition to land the coveted booking was stiff, with such players as Goldenvoice\'s Paul Tollett and Live Nation mounting efforts to reunite the Dead at venues like the Empire Polo Grounds in Indio, Calif., the site of Coachella, and Bonnaroo (the latter, according to sources, offered the band $3 million for a headlining set -- and was rejected). It helped that Shapiro has an exclusive contract with Lesh and co-owns three Brooklyn Bowl locations (Las Vegas and London opened in 2014) that are favorites of jam bands, as well as the Capitol Theatre in Port Chester, N.Y., where Anastasio previously had joined Weir onstage. \n \n The Phish frontman says that accepting the invitation was a no-brainer. ""I got a really heart-warming letter from Phil saying that he and the other three guys had talked about it and hoped I would do it,"" Anastasio tells Billboard. ""I didn\'t hesitate for a second to say yes. It\'s an absolute honor to be part of this final chapter."" \n \n In the tradition of the original Grateful Dead Ticketing Service, tickets for the shows -- named Fare Thee Well for a lyric in the Garcia/Robert Hunter song ""Brokedown Palace"" -- will be available to fan club members on a first-come, first-served basis from Feb. 9 to 11. A local public presale will occur Feb. 12-13; a general public on-sale starts Feb. 14. Jerry Garcia\'s daughter Trixie Garcia will officially announce the shows on Dead50.net today (Jan. 16). \n \n Both of these iconic bands have had historic success in the live arena. During its last 10 years on the road, the Dead grossed more than $200 million from 350 shows, according to Billboard Boxscore; Phish ranks among today\'s top touring acts, grossing more than $30 million in 2014, $4 million during its four-night New Year\'s Eve run at Miami\'s American Airlines Arena alone. Melding the followings of both acts could potentially inject some $50 million into Chicago\'s local economy (in addition to marketing the 20th anniversary of the Dead\'s last show, the city was chosen for ease of travel). \n \n Still, there is substantial risk involved. Given that the Dead have no recent touring history indicating they could support a triple stadium play, producers are treating this as a true one-of-a-kind destination event, a la Led Zeppelin at the O2 in London in 2007. But for millions of fans, the significance of these gigs goes beyond the bottom line -- most considered such a pairing purely a thing of fantasy. \n \n The Grateful Dead: A Billboard Chart History \n \n Even Anastasio is giddy. ""I saw my first Dead show at the Hartford Civic Center in 1980 when I was 16,"" he says. ""After that, I went to as many shows as I could, sometimes even standing right in front of Jerry, up on the rail, a few feet away from his amplifier. I\'ve been listening, going through the history, and it has been really fun."" Adds Weir: ""Trey is schooled in what we call \'the fluid tonic\': listening intently to what\'s going on and reacting meaningfully to what other people are playing."" \n \n The connection between the Dead and Phish, who had only a few years of crossover early in Phish\'s career while Garcia was still alive, has long been viewed as a sort of passing of the baton from one generation of like-minded music fans to the next. But when it comes to the players, offers Weir, ""The comparison is just apples and oranges -- they have their flavor, we have ours."" \n \n For his part, Anastasio sees the Dead\'s place as the quintessential American band. ""I\'ve realized that it\'s no coincidence that they named their best album ever American Beauty,"" he says. ""Jerry Garcia was a great American master and the Grateful Dead are not just a genuine piece of musical history, but also an important part of American history. This is a band, born right at the beginning of electric rock, that took the American tradition and moved it forward. They really embodied the American concept of freedom, rolling around the country with a ginormous gang of people and the mindset that \'you can come if you want, you can leave if you want. We don\'t know what\'s going to happen. All we know is we\'re not looking back.\' What could be more American?"" \n \n Grateful Dead Documentary in the Works With Martin Scorsese \n \n Anastasio\'s enthusiasm is shared by the Dead\'s members. ""The Grateful Dead lived an incredible musical story and now we get to write a whole new chapter,"" said Kreutzmann in an announcement issued on Friday. \n \n Added Lesh: ""It is with respect and gratitude that we reconvene the Dead one last time to celebrate - not merely the band\'s legacy, but also the community that we\'ve been playing to, and with, for fifty years."" \n \n ""I have a feeling this will come out just right,"" offered Mickey Hart. ""Can\'t wait to find out…HERE WE GO!"" \n \n The one remaining burning question: will the Core Four return to touring as the Grateful Dead? Weir says it\'s unlikely that the Chicago bow will be part of a longer run, it\'s by no means the end of the road. ""I know we\'ll all continue playing this music forever in our own ways,"" he says. ""I\'ve got some miles left in me."" \n \n With reporting by Ray Waddell \n \n An edited version of this article first appeared in the Jan. 24 issue of Billboard.', 'In what will be a bittersweet announcement for Deadheads, the four surviving and original members of the Grateful Dead revealed that they will reunite to celebrate their 50th anniversary with three gigs at Chicago\'s Soldier Field July 3rd to 5th.

45,"['Published: January 2011 Special Series: 7 Billion \n \n By Robert Kunzig \n \n Photograph by Randy Olson \n \n One day in Delft in the fall of 1677, Antoni van Leeuwenhoek, a cloth merchant who is said to have been the long-haired model for two paintings by Johannes Vermeer—“The Astronomer” and “The Geographer”—abruptly stopped what he was doing with his wife and rushed to his worktable. Cloth was Leeuwenhoek’s business but microscopy his passion. He’d had five children already by his first wife (though four had died in infancy), and fatherhood was not on his mind. “Before six beats of the pulse had intervened,” as he later wrote to the Royal Society of London, Leeuwenhoek was examining his perishable sample through a tiny magnifying glass. Its lens, no bigger than a small raindrop, magnified objects hundreds of times. Leeuwenhoek had made it himself; nobody else had one so powerful. The learned men in London were still trying to verify Leeuwenhoek’s earlier claims that unseen “animalcules” lived by the millions in a single drop of lake water and even in French wine. Now he had something more delicate to report: Human semen contained animalcules too. “Sometimes more than a thousand,” he wrote, “in an amount of material the size of a grain of sand.” Pressing the glass to his eye like a jeweler, Leeuwenhoek watched his own animalcules swim about, lashing their long tails. One imagines sunlight falling through leaded windows on a face lost in contemplation, as in the Vermeers. One feels for his wife. \n \n Leeuwenhoek became a bit obsessed after that. Though his tiny peephole gave him privileged access to a never-before-seen microscopic universe, he spent an enormous amount of time looking at spermatozoa, as they’re now called. Oddly enough, it was the milt he squeezed from a cod one day that inspired him to estimate, almost casually, just how many people might live on Earth. \n \n Nobody then really had any idea; there were few censuses. Leeuwenhoek started with an estimate that around a million people lived in Holland. Using maps and a little spherical geometry, he calculated that the inhabited land area of the planet was 13,385 times as large as Holland. It was hard to imagine the whole planet being as densely peopled as Holland, which seemed crowded even then. Thus, Leeuwenhoek concluded triumphantly, there couldn’t be more than 13.385 billion people on Earth—a small number indeed compared with the 150 billion sperm cells of a single codfish! This cheerful little calculation, writes population biologist Joel Cohen in his book How Many People Can the Earth Support?, may have been the first attempt to give a quantitative answer to a question that has become far more pressing now than it was in the 17th century. Most answers these days are far from cheerful. \n \n Historians now estimate that in Leeuwenhoek’s day there were only half a billion or so humans on Earth. After rising very slowly for millennia, the number was just starting to take off. A century and a half later, when another scientist reported the discovery of human egg cells, the world’s population had doubled to more than a billion. A century after that, around 1930, it had doubled again to two billion. The acceleration since then has been astounding. Before the 20th century, no human had lived through a doubling of the human population, but there are people alive today who have seen it triple. Sometime in late 2011, according to the UN Population Division, there will be seven billion of us. (Pictures: Population 7 Billion.) \n \n And the explosion, though it is slowing, is far from over. Not only are people living longer, but so many women across the world are now in their childbearing years—1.8 billion—that the global population will keep growing for another few decades at least, even though each woman is having fewer children than she would have had a generation ago. By 2050 the total number could reach 10.5 billion, or it could stop at eight billion—the difference is about one child per woman. UN demographers consider the middle road their best estimate: They now project that the population may reach nine billion before 2050—in 2045. The eventual tally will depend on the choices individual couples make when they engage in that most intimate of human acts, the one Leeuwenhoek interrupted so carelessly for the sake of science. \n \n With the population still growing by about 80 million each year, it’s hard not to be alarmed. Right now on Earth, water tables are falling, soil is eroding, glaciers are melting, and fish stocks are vanishing. Close to a billion people go hungry each day. Decades from now, there will likely be two billion more mouths to feed, mostly in poor countries. There will be billions more people wanting and deserving to boost themselves out of poverty. If they follow the path blazed by wealthy countries—clearing forests, burning coal and oil, freely scattering fertilizers and pesticides—they too will be stepping hard on the planet’s natural resources. How exactly is this going to work? \n \n THERE MAY BE SOME COMFORT in knowing that people have long been alarmed about population. From the beginning, says French demographer Hervé Le Bras, demography has been steeped in talk of the apocalypse. Some of the field’s founding papers were written just a few years after Leeuwenhoek’s discovery by Sir William Petty, a founder of the Royal Society. He estimated that world population would double six times by the Last Judgment, which was expected in about 2,000 years. At that point it would exceed 20 billion people—more, Petty thought, than the planet could feed. “And then, according to the prediction of the Scriptures, there must be wars, and great slaughter, &c.;,” he wrote. \n \n As religious forecasts of the world’s end receded, Le Bras argues, population growth itself provided an ersatz mechanism of apocalypse. “It crystallized the ancient fear, and perhaps the ancient hope, of the end of days,” he writes. In 1798 Thomas Malthus, an English priest and economist, enunciated his general law of population: that it necessarily grows faster than the food supply, until war, disease, and famine arrive to reduce the number of people. As it turned out, the last plagues great enough to put a dent in global population had already happened when Malthus wrote. World population hasn’t fallen, historians think, since the Black Death of the 14th century. \n \n In the two centuries after Malthus declared that population couldn’t continue to soar, that’s exactly what it did. The process started in what we now call the developed countries, which were then still developing. The spread of New World crops like corn and the potato, along with the discovery of chemical fertilizers, helped banish starvation in Europe. Growing cities remained cesspools of disease at first, but from the mid-19th century on, sewers began to channel human waste away from drinking water, which was then filtered and chlorinated; that dramatically reduced the spread of cholera and typhus. \n \n Moreover in 1798, the same year that Malthus published his dyspeptic tract, his compatriot Edward Jenner described a vaccine for smallpox—the first and most important in a series of vaccines and antibiotics that, along with better nutrition and sanitation, would double life expectancy in the industrializing countries, from 35 years to 77 today. It would take a cranky person to see that trend as gloomy: “The development of medical science was the straw that broke the camel’s back,” wrote Stanford population biologist Paul Ehrlich in 1968. \n \n Ehrlich’s book, The Population Bomb, made him the most famous of modern Malthusians. In the 1970s, Ehrlich predicted, “hundreds of millions of people are going to starve to death,” and it was too late to do anything about it. “The cancer of population growth … must be cut out,” Ehrlich wrote, “by compulsion if voluntary methods fail.” The very future of the United States was at risk. In spite or perhaps because of such language, the book was a best seller, as Malthus’s had been. And this time too the bomb proved a dud. The green revolution—a combination of high-yield seeds, irrigation, pesticides, and fertilizers that enabled grain production to double—was already under way. Today many people are undernourished, but mass starvation is rare. \n \n Ehrlich was right, though, that population would surge as medical science spared many lives. After World War II the developing countries got a sudden transfusion of preventive care, with the help of institutions like the World Health Organization and UNICEF. Penicillin, the smallpox vaccine, DDT (which, though later controversial, saved millions from dying of malaria)—all arrived at once. In India life expectancy went from 38 years in 1952 to 64 today; in China, from 41 to 73. Millions of people in developing countries who would have died in childhood survived to have children themselves. That’s why the population explosion spread around the planet: because a great many people were saved from dying. \n \n And because, for a time, women kept giving birth at a high rate. In 18th-century Europe or early 20th-century Asia, when the average woman had six children, she was doing what it took to replace herself and her mate, because most of those children never reached adulthood. When child mortality declines, couples eventually have fewer children—but that transition usually takes a generation at the very least. Today in developed countries, an average of 2.1 births per woman would maintain a steady population; in the developing world, “replacement fertility” is somewhat higher. In the time it takes for the birthrate to settle into that new balance with the death rate, population explodes. \n \n Demographers call this evolution the demographic transition. All countries go through it in their own time. It’s a hallmark of human progress: In a country that has completed the transition, people have wrested from nature at least some control over death and birth. The global population explosion is an inevitable side effect, a huge one that some people are not sure our civilization can survive. But the growth rate was actually at its peak just as Ehrlich was sounding his alarm. By the early 1970s, fertility rates around the world had begun dropping faster than anyone had anticipated. Since then, the population growth rate has fallen by more than 40 percent. \n \n THE FERTILITY DECLINE that is now sweeping the planet started at different times in different countries. France was one of the first. By the early 18th century, noblewomen at the French court were knowing carnal pleasures without bearing more than two children. They often relied on the same method Leeuwenhoek used for his studies: withdrawal, or coitus interruptus. Village parish records show the trend had spread to the peasantry by the late 18th century; by the end of the 19th, fertility in France had fallen to three children per woman—without the help of modern contraceptives. The key innovation was conceptual, not contraceptive, says Gilles Pison of the National Institute for Demographic Studies in Paris. Until the Enlightenment, “the number of children you had, it was God who decided. People couldn’t fathom that it might be up to them.” \n \n Other countries in the West eventually followed France’s lead. By the onset of World War II, fertility had fallen close to the replacement level in parts of Europe and the U.S. Then, after the surprising blip known as the baby boom, came the bust, again catching demographers off guard. They assumed some instinct would lead women to keep having enough children to ensure the survival of the species. Instead, in country after developed country, the fertility rate fell below replacement level. In the late 1990s in Europe it fell to 1.4. “The evidence I’m familiar with, which is anecdotal, is that women couldn’t care less about replacing the species,” Joel Cohen says. \n \n The end of a baby boom can have two big economic effects on a country. The first is the “demographic dividend”—a blissful few decades when the boomers swell the labor force and the number of young and old dependents is relatively small, and there is thus a lot of money for other things. Then the second effect kicks in: The boomers start to retire. What had been considered the enduring demographic order is revealed to be a party that has to end. The sharpening American debate over Social Security and last year’s strikes in France over increasing the retirement age are responses to a problem that exists throughout the developed world: how to support an aging population. “In 2050 will there be enough people working to pay for pensions?” asks Frans Willekens, director of the Netherlands Interdisciplinary Demographic Institute in The Hague. “The answer is no.” \n \n In industrialized countries it took generations for fertility to fall to the replacement level or below. As that same transition takes place in the rest of the world, what has astonished demographers is how much faster it is happening there. Though its population continues to grow, China, home to a fifth of the world’s people, is already below replacement fertility and has been for nearly 20 years, thanks in part to the coercive one-child policy implemented in 1979; Chinese women, who were bearing an average of six children each as recently as 1965, are now having around 1.5. In Iran, with the support of the Islamic regime, fertility has fallen more than 70 percent since the early ’80s. In Catholic and democratic Brazil, women have reduced their fertility rate by half over the same quarter century. “We still don’t understand why fertility has gone down so fast in so many societies, so many cultures and religions. It’s just mind-boggling,” says Hania Zlotnik, director of the UN Population Division. \n \n “At this moment, much as I want to say there’s still a problem of high fertility rates, it’s only about 16 percent of the world population, mostly in Africa,” says Zlotnik. South of the Sahara, fertility is still five children per woman; in Niger it is seven. But then, 17 of the countries in the region still have life expectancies of 50 or less; they have just begun the demographic transition. In most of the world, however, family size has shrunk dramatically. The UN projects that the world will reach replacement fertility by 2030. “The population as a whole is on a path toward nonexplosion—which is good news,” Zlotnik says. \n \n The bad news is that 2030 is two decades away and that the largest generation of adolescents in history will then be entering their childbearing years. Even if each of those women has only two children, population will coast upward under its own momentum for another quarter century. Is a train wreck in the offing, or will people then be able to live humanely and in a way that doesn’t destroy their environment? One thing is certain: Close to one in six of them will live in India. \n \n I have understood the population explosion intellectually for a long time. I came to understand it emotionally one stinking hot night in Delhi a couple of years ago… The temperature was well over 100, and the air was a haze of dust and smoke. The streets seemed alive with people. People eating, people washing, people sleeping. People visiting, arguing, and screaming. People thrusting their hands through the taxi window, begging. People defecating and urinating. People clinging to buses. People herding animals. People, people, people, people. —Paul Ehrlich \n \n In 1966, when Ehrlich took that taxi ride, there were around half a billion Indians. There are 1.2 billion now. Delhi’s population has increased even faster, to around 22 million, as people have flooded in from small towns and villages and crowded into sprawling shantytowns. Early last June in the stinking hot city, the summer monsoon had not yet arrived to wash the dust from the innumerable construction sites, which only added to the dust that blows in from the deserts of Rajasthan. On the new divided highways that funnel people into the unplanned city, oxcarts were heading the wrong way in the fast lane. Families of four cruised on motorbikes, the women’s scarves flapping like vivid pennants, toddlers dangling from their arms. Families of a dozen or more sardined themselves into buzzing, bumblebee-colored auto rickshaws designed for two passengers. In the stalled traffic, amputees and wasted little children cried for alms. Delhi today is boomingly different from the city Ehrlich visited, and it is also very much the same.', 'Some time late in 2011—at least according to the people-crunchers at the U.N. Population Reference Bureau—humanity will reach a new demographic milestone with the birth of the 7th billion living person. (As a measure of just how fast global population is growing, the 6th billionth living person—Bosnian Adnan Nevic—is only 11.) You can expect the event to be marked by the usual Malthusian worries—can the planet Earth really support 7 billion people, especially with the population expected to top 9 billion by mid-century? With some 1.5 billion people already living on less than $1.25 a day, nearly 1 billion people hungry and the natural world already heavily damaged, are we on the path to destruction? \n \n That’s the question the environment writer Robert Kunzig tackles in a cover story on population for National Geographic magazine. (I’ll excerpt a bit below, but it’s a great piece and worth reading in its entirety—in fact, consider picking up the issue, which tackles the 7 billion question with photos, articles and graphics.) Kunzig notes that global population has grown astoundingly fast during most of our lifetimes—while it took all of human history to around 1800 for the global population to reach 1 billion (a little Black Death here and there didn’t help), it will take a little more than 50 years for the world’s numbers to grow from 3 billion to 7 billion. A U.N. graph shows how fast population has grown, and where it might be headed: \n \n That rapid increase is due to the demographic transition—and on the surface, it’s a sign of human progress. In the past, high fertility rates were the norm around the world, as women had to have large number of children to ensure that at least a few them would survive into adulthood. (That’s often still the case in extremely poor, heavily rural countries like Niger, where the average woman has seven children.) Eventually, though, child mortality declined thanks to advances in medicine and sanitation. As women adjusted to the new reality—and as families moved from farms to cities, where additional children were more of an economic burden than a boon—the fertility rate dropped, but that took a generation or so, and in the meantime population exploded. (Suddenly there were lots more surviving children who could then go and reproduce themselves.) The U.S., Europe and other rich countries have already gone through the transition—in most well-off countries fertility is around or even well below the replacement rate of 2.1 children per woman—and it’s begun to happen in all but the poorest developing countries as well. (China, thanks to the one-child policy, put itself through an accelerated demographic transition.) But the transition will take a while to play itself out, and global population will keep growing rapidly, albeit unevenly—for the next several decades, eventually reaching a level as high as nearly 11 billion or 8 billion by 2050, depending on how fertility rates change in the years ahead. \n \n Either way that seems to be a lot of people—and most of them will be born in poor developing nations, to parents already struggling to support themselves. If you’ve ever visited the urban slums outside growing megacities like Bombay or Lagos you might wonder how they could take any more people—yet they’ll continue to proliferate like bacterial cultures. Those teeming slums seem to provoke a visceral disgust among the thinkers who worry most about population—like Paul Ehrlich, the author of The Population Bomb, whom Kunzig quotes: \n \n I have understood the population explosion intellectually for a long time. I came to understand it emotionally one stinking hot night in Delhi a couple of years ago… The temperature was well over 100, and the air was a haze of dust and smoke. The streets seemed alive with people. People eating, people washing, people sleeping. People visiting, arguing, and screaming. People thrusting their hands through the taxi window, begging. People defecating and urinating. People clinging to buses. People herding animals. People, people, people, people. \n \n As Kunzig notes, that was written in 1966, when India only had 500 million people—today it has 1.2 billion, and it is projected to have over 1.7 billion by mid-century, which would make it the most heavily populated nation on Earth. But the question isn’t whether we will literally have enough space for more people—Kunzig points out that if 9 billion people were spread out around the habitable parts of the planet, the entire Earth would still have only half the population density of France. The fear—from Malthus to Ehrlich—is that we won’t be able to support ourselves, that there won’t be enough food, water or energy to go around, as Kunzig wonders: \n \n Many people are justifiably worried that Malthus will finally be proved right on a global scale—that the planet won’t be able to feed nine billion people. Lester Brown, founder of Worldwatch Institute and now head of the Earth Policy Institute in Washington, believes food shortages could cause a collapse of global civilization. Human beings are living off natural capital, Brown argues, eroding soil and depleting groundwater faster than they can be replenished. All of that will soon be cramping food production. Brown’s Plan B to save civilization would put the whole world on a wartime footing, like the U.S. after Pearl Harbor, to stabilize climate and repair the ecological damage. “Filling the family planning gap may be the most urgent item on the global agenda,” he writes, so if we don’t hold the world’s population to eight billion by reducing fertility, the death rate may increase instead. Eight billion corresponds to the UN’s lowest projection for 2050. In that optimistic scenario, Bangladesh has a fertility rate of 1.35 in 2050, but it still has 25 million more people than it does today. Rwanda’s fertility rate also falls below the replacement level, but its population still rises to well over twice what it was before the genocide. If that’s the optimistic scenario, one might argue, the future is indeed bleak. \n \n I wrote earlier this week about the debate between Malthusians and Cornucopians—the economists who believe that human ingenuity, responding to human need, always prevails to find new resources to match rising populations. It’s an open question for the future, though so far the Cornucopians have been proven right. It’s worth noting that while we worry about the effects of overpopulation in the future, humanity was far worse off by every material standard in the centuries before the Industrial Revolution, when the global population was a fraction of what it is today. As Kunzig writes, the future of humanity—and of the planet we live on—will have less to do with absolute numbers that it will with how we choose to live: \n \n For centuries population pessimists have hurled apocalyptic warnings at the congenital optimists, who believe in their bones that humanity will find ways to cope and even improve its lot. History, on the whole, has so far favored the optimists, but history is no certain guide to the future. Neither is science. It cannot predict the outcome of People v. Planet, because all the facts of the case—how many of us there will be and how we will live—depend on choices we have yet to make and ideas we have yet to have. We may, for example, says [population biologist Joel] Cohen, “see to it that all children are nourished well enough to learn in school and are educated well enough to solve the problems they will face as adults.” That would change the future significantly. \n \n Indeed, growing populations won’t be the only demographic challenge the world faces in the decades to come. Remember how I said that population was growing globally but unevenly? Even as a country like India will likely need to cope with 500 million new people between now and mid-century, most rich nations—where the fertility rate is below replacement level and people live longer and longer—will need to cope with extreme aging. As the 2010 World Population fact sheet shows (download a PDF here), in Japan, Italy and Germany there are already only 3 working people to support every 1 pensioner. Compare that to sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East, where the ratio is closer to 25 to 1. That disparity will only grow in the future, exacerbating budget headaches and skewing economies. In the U.S., for example, spending on Social Security and Medicare is expected to rise from 8.4% of GDP today to 14.5% by mid-century. \n \n So here’s the planet we could have in 2050: an overpopulated, overstressed developing world and an aging, economically stagnant developed world, with inequality even larger than it is today. Is there any way to escape that fate? While development and education will be incredibly important (especially for women—literacy is one of the best ways to reduce fertility), the answer may end up being immigration. Think about it—in the future the developed world will lack young workers, and the developing world will have an excess of that resource. Immigration could be a way to balance demographics and economics—alleviating population pressure in the poorer parts of the world while jump starting aging developed nations. The U.S. already does this—immigration will provide most of American population growth. It would be a radical solution, given the political resistance to increased immigration in much of the rich world. (If you think it’s a hot topic in the U.S., try Japan, which steadfastly resists assimilating foreigners, despite the dire threat posed by an aging population.) But it might be the only way to save our overpopulated planet. \n \n More from TIME on population: \n \n What Condoms Have to Do With Climate Change \n \n Population: The Numbers Game', ""LaBeouf’s new film Man Down took a measly amount on its opening weekend, but he’s not the only famous face to fail badly at the box office \n \n Some of you might know that Shia LaBeouf still makes films, despite his reputation as an art-pop prank gone haywire, a kind of weaponised James Franco.

Given that an adult ticket in my non-London cinema costs £12.60, it is safe to assume that the only person who saw Man Down last weekend was a solitary toddler with an NUS card who somehow qualifies for a state pension.

You could say it did badly (the BFI lists its opening weekend gross at just £90) – but I’d argue it didn’t do badly enough. \n \n Motherhood (2010): £88 \n \n Motherhood was a $5m-movie starring Uma Thurman, who at that point was an A-list actor, albeit one on the wane. It made less than £100, causing the film critic Barry Norman to exclaim: “Good God. I have never heard of anything like this before.” There are plenty of possible explanations for why Motherhood failed so catastrophically – lack of promotion, the distributor’s lack of confidence – but the most likely reason is that it’s an insufferably middle-class whine stuffed into the clothing of a weak romcom. \n \n The Colony (2016): £47 \n \n Hands up who wants to see Emma Watson play a German lady from 1973 battling against a preacher and possible child molester who indirectly works for Augusto Pinochet? No? What if I told you that, despite all this, Watson keeps her plummy British accent? Still no? Well, what if I told you that Empire called it a “grotesque miscalculation that disrespects the memory of those who perished in one of the darkest episodes in recent history”? Nope? Never mind. The Colony opened for one daily matinee screening in Hull, Widnes and Burnley, and even then nobody bothered to watch it. \n \n The Chumscrubber (2005): £36 \n \n Even though it starred Ralph Fiennes, Glenn Close, Jamie Bell and Allison Janney – and cost $10m to make – only a handful of British viewers saw The Chumscrubber in a cinema. Maybe that’s because people just weren’t in the mood for a comedy-drama about suicide that particular weekend. Or maybe it’s because nobody wanted to say the word ‘chumscrubber’ out loud. Either way, nobody remembers that the film was ever made.""]",3,"– Things to look forward to in 2011: all-natural Frito-Lay chips, a bunch of truly unnecessary movie sequels, and … the world’s 7 billionth living person. That lucky baby will arrive sometime next year, according to the UN Population Reference Bureau, writes Bryan Walsh for Time. The world’s 6 billionth living person was born just 11 years ago in Bosnia, and the population is expected to exceed 9 billion by the middle of the century. Can the planet really handle that? Robert Kunzig attempts to take on that question in a very lengthy National Geographic cover story (worth a read). Walsh picks out a few highlights: Kunzig calls out attention to the fact that it took nearly all of human history to get us to the 1 billion mark, but we're set to explode from 3 billion to 7 billion in about 50 years. By 2050, we'll be somewhere between 8 billion and 10.5 billion, according to the UN. Space isn't the issue. Kunzig notes that if 9 billion people were spread throughout Earth's habitable regions, the population density would be half of that in France. The potential problems: Not enough food, water, energy. And a lot of aging people. Writes Kunzig, ""Fixating on population numbers is not the best way to confront the future. The number of people does matter, of course. But how people consume resources matters a lot more ... It’s too late to keep the new middle class of 2030 from being born; it’s not too late to change how they and the rest of us will produce and consume food and energy."""
46,"['‘Kong: Skull Island’ a fun return to the ape’s stomping ground \n \n We just won’t leave Kong enough alone, will we? \n \n For some 80 years now, through movie after movie after movie, the giant ape has been minding his own giant ape business on Skull Island. But then some pesky humans show up and try to capture him or tame him or kill him or otherwise mess with him, and the next thing you know the big guy is swatting away aircraft, roaring up a storm and defending his turf while developing a real resentment for the little pests in clothes — with the exception of the occasional sympathetic blonde who catches his eye, of course. \n \n “Kong: Skull Island” plays like a mash-up of “Apocalypse Now,” “Hamburger Hill,” “Congo,” “Jurassic Park,” even “The African Queen” — with a couple of elements so ridiculous they could have been borrowed from a “Gilligan’s Island” episode. \n \n It’s wildly entertaining and it has a sense of humor about itself — and it doesn’t hurt when a great big monster movie features an A-list cast including John Goodman, Samuel L. Jackson, Brie Larson, Tom Hiddleston and John C. Reilly. They’re all in a really expensive B-movie and it seems like they’re having a heckuva time fighting the good green-screen fight against all manner of lethal creatures on Skull Island. \n \n Director Jordan Vogt-Roberts and the team of screenwriters set this version of “Kong” in the summer of 1973, just as direct U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War is coming to end. This isn’t just some arbitrary device; the war and how it affected those who fought it (and those who fought against it) is a constant theme in “Skull Island.” \n \n The opening half hour or so feels like more like a Vietnam film than a monster movie, with the soundtrack blasting classic rock staples such as “White Rabbit,” “Run Through the Jungle,” “Long Cool Woman in a Black Dress” and “Paranoid,” as the main characters are introduced and the mission to Skull Island is set in motion. \n \n John Goodman’s Bill Randa is an old-school secret ops conspiracy theorist near the end of his career. With anti-war protests raging in the streets of the capital, Randa remarks to an associate, “Mark my words, there’ll never be a more screwed-up time in Washington,” and yes, that line is destined to elicit big-time laughs. \n \n Randa secures funding for a fact-finding mission to the mysterious Skull Island. The team includes a military escort led by Lt. Colonel Packard (Samuel L. Jackson), who is still seething with anger over the U.S. pulling out of Vietnam; Capt. Conrad (Tom Hiddleston), the obligatory former black ops legend now working for himself, and combat photographer Mason Weaver (Brie Larson), who is along for the ride because, hey, we need Brie Larson along for this ride. \n \n Director Vogt-Roberts, cinematographer Larry Fong and the special-effects wizards produce some remarkable visuals during the arrival at Skull Island, with helicopters swooping in formation, attention-grabbing slow-motion moments, and perfectly timed moments of comedic relief followed by the shocking (and pretty rough for PG-13) violence. It’s great stuff. \n \n Oddly enough, once we settle in for the Kong part of the movie, “Skull Island” isn’t quite as entertaining or edgy. It turns into a full-fledged monster movie, as the exploration team quickly learns the enormous monkey is just one of the astonishing and deadly creatures inhabiting the island. Relax for a second, and you could be consumed or crushed by a huge spider or a gigantic lizard thingy or a squid the size of a ship — or maybe you’ll be plucked off the ground and torn apart by a flock of prehistoric-looking birds! \n \n As Col. Packard starts going full Col. Kurtz, obsessed with his mission against all odds and logic, Capt. Conrad and Mason the Photographer and a few others stumble upon one Hank Marlow (John C. Reilly), a World War II pilot from Chicago who has been stranded on Skull Island for nearly 30 years. (“Have the Cubs won the World Series yet?” asks Hank.) \n \n The stuff with Hank is beyond goofy — but Reilly plays the comic relief role to the hilt, firing off a few terrific one-liners. By that point, “Skull Island” has lost its sense of menace and has gone a little soft, even as a few supporting characters meet some pretty grisly deaths. (As usual, the MPAA’s ratings board is much more forgiving about multiple gruesome killings than language or nudity when it comes to handing out a PG-13.) \n \n Hiddleston is solid as an old-fashioned, dashing leading man. Larson is wonderful as the plucky Mason. Jackson and Goodman are as reliable as Jackson and Goodman always are, in just about any genre. \n \n As for King Kong: he might have to look for another address, because for being so mysterious and secretive and elusive, Skull Island sure brings in a lot of nosy tourists. \n \n ★★★ \n \n Warner Brothers presents a film directed by Jordan Vogt-Roberts and written by Dan Gilroy, Max Borenstein and Derek Connolly. Rated PG-13 (for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action, and for brief strong language). Running time: 118 minutes. Opens Friday at local theaters.', 'Kong: Skull Island is, reportedly, a reboot of the original King Kong from 1933. At the same time, it features a ton of dinosaurs and prehistoric creepy-crawlies in a not-so-subtle nod to Jurassic Park (1993). The presence of helicopters, napalm, psychedelic rock and two characters named Conrad and Marlow mean you might equally consider it a remix of Apocalypse Now (1979) or its source material, Heart of Darkness. I also caught trace elements of Flight of the Phoenix (2004) and Tora! Tora! Tora! (1970). The resulting film bears some relation to the menu at my local Chinese restaurant, which lists “soup with sweetcorn,” “soup with noodles” and “soup with egg drop"" before reaching—with an air of summary exasperation or exhaustion—“soup with everything.” That’s pretty much what we get here: soup with everything. \n \n We start in Washington, D.C., where a bearish conspiracy nut (John Goodman, naturally) is petitioning his senator for money to explore an island in the South Pacific with his team of geologists. He is granted the protection of a full Army helicopter squadron, loaded to the gills with napalm and machine guns, led by an irascible lieutenant (Samuel L. Jackson) fresh from the fields of Vietnam. The whole movie is set in 1973, quite possibly because the filmmakers judged it to be the one period so whacked-out on drugs that nobody would raise any objection to the plot. Also along for the ride are a British Special Air Service officer and jungle survival expert (Tom Hiddleston) and a magazine photographer (Brie Larson). “Isn’t this a little small for a Time photographer?” Hiddleston asks her. “How did British special forces get dragged into this?” Larson asks him. When half your characters devote most of their screen time to exploring the motivations of the other half, you know something is amiss. \n \n How difficult can it be to get people to go to explore an island? But then the film, which was directed by Jordan Vogt-Roberts from a script by Dan Gilroy and Max Borenstein, is driven less by curiosity about exploring the great unknown than by an urgent need to have everyone arrive at the threshold of the great unknown, guns drawn, and start blasting. The film begins where most Kong movies end: with the giant ape swatting aircraft from the skies as if they were flies. \n \n And so the team is stranded, as Goodman puts it, on Skull Island, “a place where myth and science meet.” Or as I came to think of it, the land where backstory goes to die. Everyone has to fight through great thickets of prehistory, and not just the dinosaurs. Equally Jurassic is the wild-eyed, shaggy-bearded pilot (John C. Reilly) whom the team discovers in the jungle, where he’s been lurking since World War II . Then there is Kong himself, orphaned at a young age after giant lizards eat his parents, engaged ever since in a prolonged but unsuccessful battle with his rage issues. What he should really do is book himself a ticket to New York, head for the Upper West Side and find himself a good therapist, but as its title suggests, Kong: Skull Island is as hung up on Kong’s island as on the great ape himself. We get a full flora and fauna report, including ants, spiders, lizards and squid. It’s like a version of Superman that can’t work up the puff to get out of Smallville. \n \n The original was a fable about American colonialism, as well as a Beauty and the Beast love story about the ultimate romantic martyr, but Larson snatches just one brief, swoony moment with Kong. This is a combat picture, pure and simple, led from the front by Jackson, who glimpses his nemesis through great plumes of fire, clenches his teeth and vows, “This is one war we’re not going to lose.” The visuals have a high ick factor (intestines pulled through mouths, vomited skulls) but sometimes attain a nutty pop grandeur: I loved the sight of Hiddleston wearing a gas mask, using a samurai sword to slice his way through a flock of pterodactyls in a purple haze. Far out. Jimi Hendrix would dig it. \n \n It’s the usual story: a lopsided mixture of mega-blast effects and a script that hasn\'t worked out what opposable thumbs are for. “This is beyond us,” says Reilly, stealing every scene in sight with daffy riffs about gods and monsters, like Dennis Hopper’s gadfly photographer in Apocalypse Now. You’d say he was the comic relief, except Kong: Skull Island can’t seem to manage seriousness in the first place. Quit monkeying around.', 'Nevada Republicans on Saturday moved the GOP presidential caucus to Feb. 4, giving up their No. 3 spot in the nation\'s early voting line-up to end a standoff with New Hampshire over the election calendar. \n \n State party Chairwoman Amy Tarkanian noted Nevada would still hold the first caucus in the West. And she said the Silver State remains a major prize in the early going of the White House race, especially if leading GOP candidates split victories in the first four states. \n \n ""We could be the tipping point in the race,"" Tarkanian said. ""Anything can happen in the first four states. And we\'re first in the West."" \n \n In this stage of the presidential contest, Mitt Romney is favored to win in New Hampshire and Nevada, while his Southern conservative rivals such as Herman Cain are proving more popular in Iowa and South Carolina while Florida could be up for grabs. \n \n Former Gov. Bob List, a GOP national committeeman, said that as a swing state Nevada remains a key battleground in both the primary and caucus season as well as in the 2012 general election. \n \n ""I think Nevada is going to be very relevant in the presidential sweepstakes,"" List said. ""And we are very much respected for stepping up and resolving this dispute with New Hampshire."" \n \n The vote to shift the caucus date back from Jan. 14 came during a meeting of the Nevada GOP Central Committee, which has several hundred members. Only a few people objected in a voice vote. \n \n As a result of the move, the Nevada GOP will be fifth in the early voting line-up behind Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Florida. \n \n New Hampshire officials were clearly happy with the Nevada GOP\'s move. \n \n ""It\'s a win for the process, and it\'s certainly a win for New Hampshire,"" said Phyllis Woods, an RNC member from the Granite State. ""Going forward, we really want to have Nevada as an ally. We really don\'t want to have enemies as we go into the next primary calendar."" \n \n In arguing for the move, Tarkanian told the meeting at The Venetian that Nevada\'s voice would still be strong and the date dispute with New Hampshire had become a ""huge debacle"" and distraction. \n \n ""Our focus should be on defeating (Barack) Obama,"" she said, adding, ""It\'s time to move forward. We will be the good guys in the end. We don\'t need to be New Hampshire\'s piñata."" \n \n The Republican National Committee had urged Nevada to move its date, and Tarkanian won support for the idea from Gov. Brian Sandoval and other GOP leaders in the state and nationwide as well. \n \n Sandoval and U.S. Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nev., also both endorsed Tarkanian for election to a full, two-year term as party chairwoman. She won Saturday, running unopposed after one potential challenger refused the nomination by Republicans upset with the recent party turmoil. \n \n Tarkanian said she would focus on a voter registration drive and had raised $70,000 since she became party chairwoman in June. \n \n Ahead of the meeting, party leaders had rejected the idea of same-day registration after rank-and-file members of the GOP Central Committee worried it could allow for fraud or havoc on caucus day. \n \n The GOP meeting instead voted Saturday to put into the party platform opposition to same-day registration for both caucuses and elections. The Republicans also said they wanted to require voters to register at least 14 days before any vote. \n \n The Nevada GOP will retain its full 28-delegate slate to the nominating convention by setting its caucus for Feb. 4. The date is two weeks earlier than the state\'s original Feb. 18 date that had been set before Florida jumped into January to upset the early voting calendar. \n \n New Hampshire had threatened to hold its primary in December if Nevada Republicans didn\'t pick a new date so the Granite State could schedule its vote for Jan. 10, a Tuesday. \n \n New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner insisted a state law required at least seven days between contests and Nevada\'s vote was too close. \n \n Several lower-tier candidates had threatened to boycott Nevada\'s GOP caucus if Republicans didn\'t cede to New Hampshire, as well as Hermain Cain, the former CEO of Godfather\'s Pizza who\'s leading in some polls. \n \n Under the new calendar, the Iowa caucus is scheduled for Jan. 3. Iowa GOP chairman Matt Strawn confirmed Saturday that the Hawkeye State will keep its caucus date despite Nevada\'s move. \n \n New Hampshire will likely be on Jan. 10, the South Carolina primary is set for Jan. 21 and the Florida primary is scheduled for Jan. 31. \n \n Florida started the calendar scramble by moving its primary into January despite RNC rules that said states weren\'t allowed to vote before Feb. 1, 2012. The states that moved primaries to January will be penalized half their delegates to the nominating convention. \n \n While Nevada Republicans will vote fifth in 2012, the state\'s Democrats have decided to maintain the original early voting schedule and No. 3 spot in the calendar behind Iowa and New Hampshire. \n \n The Nevada Democratic Party on Saturday announced it will hold its presidential caucus on Jan. 21, two weeks before the Republicans. South Carolina Democrats said they would caucus on Jan. 28. \n \n U.S. Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., who pushed hard to get the early voting spot for Nevada in 2008, criticized the GOP for giving in on the date. \n \n ""I\'m deeply disappointed that the Nevada Republican Party has caved to the will of the Republican National Committee and New Hampshire,"" Reid said in a statement. ""By working with South Carolina, Nevada Democrats have not only preserved our position in the nomination process but will ensure the West plays a crucial role in selecting our nation\'s president in future contests."" \n \n If there was any question, the state Democratic Party made it clear they would be working to re-elect President Barack Obama. \n \n ""Next year, we are pleased to stand firmly behind President Barack Obama as he continues fighting to create good paying jobs, protect Medicare and Social Security and help families struggling to keep a roof over their heads,"" the statement said. \n \n The Associated Press contributed to this story.

It might be a familiar story, but critics are mostly applauding Jordan Vogt-Roberts' telling.

Tom Shone was not on the same page. Here's ""the usual story: a lopsided mixture of mega-blast effects and a script that hasn't worked out what opposable thumbs are for,"" he writes at Newsweek. Thank goodness for John C. Reilly ""stealing every scene,"" he adds. ""You'd say he was the comic relief, except Kong: Skull Island can't seem to manage seriousness in the first place. Quit monkeying around."" Stephanie Zacharek agrees Reilly is ""wonderful,"" but that's not all she has to admire. ""Vogt-Roberts knows he's gotta go big or go home, so he treads boldly."" The result is a film that's ""great fun"" as well as ""grand and nutty and visually splendid,"" she writes at Time. The real star, however, is Kong.

Media requires JavaScript to play. \n \n Fresh attempts to evacuate two wounded Western journalists from Homs in Syria have failed, the Red Cross says. \n \n Vehicles from the Syrian Red Crescent reached the besieged suburb of Baba Amr, but left without them. \n \n Frenchwoman Edith Bouvier would not board vehicles, reports said, and other evacuees, including UK photographer Paul Conroy, stayed in solidarity. \n \n Earlier, Syrian forces launched fresh attacks on a number of towns, reports say, with dozens more people killed. \n \n The Local Co-ordination Committees (LCC), an activists\' group which organises and documents protests, said a total of 125 people had died across Syria, many of them in a single incident at a checkpoint in Homs - although there has been no independent verification of this. \n \n Broken leg \n \n Reports on Monday evening said the Syrian Red Crescent had managed to regain access to Baba Amr but officials later confirmed they had left without the journalists. \n \n Three Syrians, including a pregnant Syrian woman, her husband, and an elderly female patient, were moved to safety. \n \n Continue reading the main story At the scene The bombardment has started in Binnish, which for the past week has been under the control of the opposition. The Free Syrian Army and the Syrian Liberation Army are based in this town. We know that a government offensive has been taking place in the nearby city of Idlib. The townspeople have become increasingly concerned that the troops would then turn their attention to Binnish. That is what has happened this morning. We were woken to the sound of artillery bombardment. There is gunfire in the distance. We believe they are using anti-aircraft weapons against the town, and also setting up mortar positions. This is a town of about 40,000 people and although there are militiamen belonging to the Free Syrian Army and other groups, this has not been a military situation. From what we can tell, the bombardment is entirely random and is not targeting specific individuals. This seems to be part of a wider government offensive that is taking place in the north of the country, to regain control of opposition areas. \n \n Ms Bouvier suffered a broken leg and Mr Conroy was hit by shrapnel in the leg and stomach in an attack last Wednesday that claimed the lives of American Sunday Times journalist Marie Colvin and French photographer Remi Ochlik. \n \n It had been hoped that the bodies of the two dead journalists would be brought out during the same mission, but this also failed. \n \n The BBC\'s Jim Muir reports from neighbouring Beirut that Ms Bouvier refused to board the Red Crescent vehicles, and the others stayed behind out of solidarity. \n \n Paul Conroy\'s wife said on Sunday that her husband had rejected an earlier opportunity to leave Homs with the Syrian Red Crescent as the photographer had been advised that they were ""not to be trusted"". \n \n And the UK\'s International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell told the BBC there was evidence of people on the ground ""infiltrating the Syrian Red Crescent"" and ""posing an additional danger"" to injured people seeking to leave Homs. \n \n Meanwhile, the LCC said 15 people had been killed in the Idlib area, nine in the Aleppo area, and several in the suburbs of Damascus. \n \n Several towns in Idlib came under army assault for the first time, reports said. \n \n BBC correspondent Ian Pannell, who is in northern Syria, says troops fired artillery, mortars and anti-aircraft guns at Binnish and other towns on Monday. \n \n Binnish has been under the control of the Free Syrian Army and the Syrian Liberation Army for the past week. \n \n Our correspondent says the bombardment, which began in the early morning, appeared to be entirely random, hitting civilian areas rather than targeting rebel positions. \n \n The towns of Sarmin and Maarat al-Numan were also hit, reports said, along with the town of Qusayr, nine miles (15km) outside Homs. \n \n Weapons call \n \n As the crackdown intensified, the European Union imposed further sanctions on Syria. \n \n They include: \n \n a freeze on the European-held assets of the Syrian central bank \n \n travel bans on seven close associates of President Bashar al-Assad \n \n a ban on cargo flights from Syria into the EU \n \n restrictions on the trade in gold and precious metals \n \n UK Foreign Secretary William Hague welcomed the fresh sanctions. \n \n ""We will continue working closely with our EU partners to support the Arab League and its plan to end the violence in Syria and bring about a Syrian-led transition to a peaceful and more open political system,"" he said. \n \n Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. \n \n Qatar Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani said the international community should do ""whatever necessary"" to help the Syrian opposition, ""including giving them weapons to defend themselves"". \n \n ""I think they\'re right to defend themselves with weapons and I think we should help these people by all means,"" he added. \n \n Syrian state television has meanwhile announced the results of a referendum on a new constitution, which was dismissed by opposition activists and the West as a sham. \n \n The poll showed around 89% support for the proposal, the report said, on a turnout of just over 57%.', 'Are you there? Send us your images or video. \n \n (CNN) -- As the death toll from Syria\'s almost year-long uprising continues to climb, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moallem vowed to defend his country\'s ""independence."" \n \n ""We are not happy to see brothers killing each other. But this is our country. But we will defend our sovereignty and independence,"" he told reporters. \n \n The minister said no one is dying in Syria because of hunger or sickness and that despite the ""economic international boycott,"" his government is providing all necessary services. \n \n ""Do you think there is a government in this world ... (that cares) about Syrian people welfare more than the Syrian government? I don\'t see this logic,"" Moallem said. \n \n As day broke on Tuesday, four people were killed across Syria, opposition activists said. At least 144 people were reported killed Monday, including 64 who died in a ""horrifying massacre"" at a checkpoint in Homs province. \n \n Those killed at a checkpoint in the Abel area were attempting to flee shelling in the Baba Amr neighborhood in the city of Homs, said the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, a network of opposition activists. \n \n ""Reports said security members and thugs kidnapped the women among them,"" the network said in a statement. Residents found 47 corpses in one area and 17 in a second one, it said. \n \n A total of 68 corpses were found in the area, in farmland in western Homs province, said the opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, apparently referencing the same incident. The bodies were found after an injured survivor reported the attack, the group said. All the bodies had been either shot or stabbed. \n \n In all, 104 people were killed Monday in Homs, an opposition stronghold, according to the LCC. They included four defected soldiers, three woman and three children. \n \n The deaths came on a day when Syrian officials announced that the nation\'s new draft constitution received approval and the European Union imposed new sanctions on the country amid ongoing clashes. \n \n The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said earlier explosions rocked Homs and shelling was occurring in Baba Amr. Twenty people were wounded when a large shell struck an anti-government gathering in Homs, the group said. \n \n Meanwhile, Interior Minister Mohammed al-Shaar announced that 89.4% of voters approved the draft constitution, and 57.4% of eligible voters cast ballots. President Bashar al-Assad\'s regime has touted the constitutional referendum as a move toward reform. \n \n Syria announced the referendum amid intense international cries to stop the bloodshed and open its regime to change. But analysts and protesters widely describe the effort as a farce, a superficial attempt to pacify al-Assad\'s critics. \n \n ""We dismiss it as absolutely cynical. ... Essentially, what he\'s done here is put a piece of paper that he controls to a vote that he controls so that he can try and maintain control,"" U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said of the referendum and al-Assad. \n \n She cited the ongoing violence in such cities as Homs and Hama and asked: ""How could you possibly have any kind of a democratic process in conditions like that?"" \n \n Aid efforts were under way in the midst of the violence. \n \n The Syrian Red Crescent and the International Committee of the Red Cross entered the province of Hama on Monday to provide aid to civilians, said Simon Schorno, spokesman for the Red Cross. A one-month supply of food, along with blankets and hygiene kits, were distributed to 12,000 people, he said. \n \n Beatrice Megevand-Roggo, the Red Cross\' head of operations for the Middle East, said a handful of aid workers were also able to go into Baba Amr. \n \n ""There were four ambulances that entered Baba Amr, belonging to the Syrian Red Crescent. They were loaded with medical goods. They indeed were not able to evacuate the two foreign journalists. I don\'t have the reasons why. They could evacuate an elderly woman, a pregnant woman with her husband,"" she said. \n \n The two journalists Megevand-Roggo was referencing were British photographer Paul Conroy and French reporter Edith Bouvier. Both were wounded in shelling. \n \n Red Cross spokesman Hicham Hassan said aid workers were also not able Monday to recover and evacuate the bodies of two journalists killed in Baba Amr last week. \n \n Marie Colvin, an American journalist who worked for London\'s Sunday Times, was killed in a shelling attack, along with French journalist Remi Ochlik. Colvin\'s mother, Rosemarie, said Sunday that aid workers have been trying for days to remove her daughter\'s body. \n \n CNN and other media outlets cannot independently verify opposition or government reports because Syria has severely limited access to the country by foreign journalists. But the vast majority of reports from the ground indicate that government forces are massacring citizens in an attempt to wipe out civilians seeking al-Assad\'s ouster. \n \n No attempts at getting al-Assad to stop his regime\'s crackdown on dissidents have stopped the onslaught. \n \n The Council of the European Union agreed Monday on new sanctions regarding Syria after foreign ministers met in Brussels, Belgium, said spokeswoman Susanne Kiefer. \n \n Seven ministers of the al-Assad regime will have their EU assets frozen and will be denied entry into the EU, Kiefer said. In addition, assets of the Syrian Central Bank in the EU will be frozen. Legitimate trade will be allowed to continue, she said, but must be authorized first. \n \n ""Today\'s decisions will put further pressure on those who are responsible for the ruthless campaign of repression in Syria,"" Catherine Ashton, the EU foreign policy chief, said in a statement. ""The measures target the regime and its ability to conduct the appalling violence against civilians. As long as the repression continues, the EU will keep imposing sanctions."" \n \n Elsewhere in Syria on Monday, two people were killed and eight wounded by government shelling on the village of Sarmeen in Idlib province, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. \n \n The shelling began Sunday night, and Syrian troops have entered Sarmeen, said Abu Mustafa al-Sayed, a Syrian opposition and community leader in the town of Binnish, also in Idlib province. The Syrian army has Sarmeen surrounded, and communications with the residents have been cut off, he said. \n \n And in Damascus, security forces fired on mourners at a funeral, according to the Local Coordination Committees. Clashes were also occurring in Deir Ezzor, the group said, and 14 students were arrested during a protest at Aleppo University. \n \n The opposition network estimates that 9,000 people have been killed since the government launched its crackdown in March. The Syrian government says that more than 2,000 members of its security forces have been killed by ""terrorists"" during that same period. \n \n Asked Monday whether Syria would be referred to the International Criminal Court, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said, ""I hope the international community reflects on the conditions of referral. ... It\'s a difficult issue. Syria is not a participating state, so it\'s up to the Security Council to address this question. They must therefore continue to gather the elements that would permit an eventual referral."" \n \n CNN\'s Jo Shelley, Per Nyberg, Salma Abdelaziz, Jack Maddox, Hamdi Alkshali and Kareem Khadder and journalist Mohamed Fadel Fahmy contributed to this report.', 'Image caption Paul Conroy was smuggled across the border into Lebanon and is said to be in good spirits. \n \n Injured British journalist Paul Conroy has been rescued from the Syrian city of Homs, but the whereabouts of French reporter Edith Bouvier remain unclear. \n \n French President Nicolas Sarkozy has withdrawn an earlier statement that she was also safely in Lebanon. \n \n The severely-injured Ms Bouvier is believed to have left Homs with Mr Conroy, but there are reports the rescue convoy was shelled. \n \n The UN meanwhile says more than 7,500 people have now died in the crackdown. \n \n UN human rights chief Navi Pillay said atrocities against civilians were being committed, and she had received reports that ""massive campaigns of arrests"" by Syrian troops against rebels had deprived many civilians of food, water and medical supplies. \n \n Her comments came at an emergency meeting of the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) in Geneva, which renewed calls for a humanitarian ceasefire. \n \n Syria\'s representative to the UN, Faysal Khabbaz Hamoui, stormed out of the session, accusing countries of ""inciting sectarianism and providing arms"". \n \n Analysis The confusion surrounding the whereabouts of the wounded French reporter Edith Bouvier - and President Sarkozy\'s embarrassing admission that he had got it wrong in saying she had crossed safely into Lebanon - illustrate both the complications and the extreme dangers surrounding efforts to bring the trapped western journalists to safety. Necessarily, any attempt to extricate them has to be surrounded with secrecy, especially if it involves smuggling them across the Baba Amr battlefront and then the tense and dangerous terrain between Homs and the Lebanese border. From several accounts, the four journalists - Paul Conroy, Edith Bouvier, William Daniels and Javier Espinosa - came under shellfire as they were trying to escape, and the group got broken up. The one certain thing is that Paul Conroy managed to make it across the border, with the help of the activists guiding him. The Avaaz group, which played a role in the operation, said many activists died while escorting the journalists, who will clearly have their own dramatic story to tell. The whereabouts of the missing three journalists remains unclear, though some relatives and other sources believe they may still be trapped in Baba Amr under shellfire. \n \n Reports on Tuesday said Homs had come under some of its heaviest bombardment yet, with the government sending in units of an elite armoured division into rebel-held districts. \n \n President Sarkozy\'s statement on the campaign trail that Ms Bouvier had reached safety came after nearly 24 hours of confusion over the journalist\'s fate. He later withdrew the statement, describing the situation as unclear and complex. \n \n ""It has not been confirmed that she is in safety in Lebanon,"" he told journalists in Montpellier. ""Communications with Homs are very difficult."" \n \n The BBC\'s Jim Muir in Beirut says confusion remains over Ms Bouvier\'s location. \n \n Campaign group Avaaz said it had co-ordinated an operation to free the wounded journalists and two trapped colleagues, and some of the activists involved had died in the process. \n \n Avaaz executive director Ricken Patel said the rescue group had been split in two by shelling after leaving Homs, and only Mr Conroy\'s group had been able to move forward. \n \n Avaaz described the three other journalists - Ms Bouvier, Javier Espinosa from Spain and Frenchman William Daniels - as ""unaccounted for"". \n \n Mr Conroy was apparently able to walk across the border into Lebanon during the night, but our correspondent adds that the more seriously wounded Ms Bouvier would have had to be carried on a stretcher. \n \n Both journalists were hurt in the attack in which journalists Marie Colvin and Remi Ochlik died. There has been no word on what has happened to their bodies. \n \n Mr Conroy\'s brother Alan said the family still did not know where he was. \n \n ""When we\'ve heard him on the phone or he turns up on the doorstep, then we\'ll be very happy,"" he said. ""He\'s a very strong character anyway. He\'ll cope."" \n \n \'War criminal\' \n \n In Washington, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has said that President Bashar al-Assad fits the definition of a war criminal. \n \n Campaign group Avaaz in Syria Says it co-ordinated rescue attempt of Paul Conroy, Edith Bouvier and two other journalists from Homs \n \n Has set up a network of citizen journalists and smuggled in foreign journalists \n \n Claims to have delivered more than $1.8m of medical equipment to the worst-hit areas \n \n Has helped collect and verify information on the scale of the crackdown on dissent \n \n She told a Senate hearing that an argument could be made for declaring the Syrian leader a war criminal. \n \n Mrs Clinton added that such an action would complicate the chances of finding a solution to the violence - and tended to make it harder to persuade a leader to stand down. \n \n As many as 125 people died across Syria on Monday, many of them in a single incident at a checkpoint in Homs, the activists\' network the LCC said. \n \n Sixty-five more were killed on Tuesday, it said. Death tolls remain very hard to verify as media access across the country is tightly restricted. \n \n The emergency session of the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) discussed a confidential report delivered by a UN panel of experts that lists Syrian army officers and government officials who could be investigated for crimes against humanity. \n \n French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe has urged the 47 nations in the council to be prepared to submit a complaint against Syria to the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague. \n \n ""The task of the council is to express the disgust of the entire world at the odious crimes that the Syrian state is committing against its people,"" he said. \n \n But the meeting is unlikely to bring about any change from the government in Damascus which is currently fighting for its survival, says the BBC\'s Jim Muir, in Beirut. \n \n It is more likely to put pressure on countries such as Russia and China, which have opposed any international action against Syria, he adds.', 'AFP \n \n A remote island off France’s Brittany coast will soon be home to new residents, but who’s crazy enough to want to live out their Swiss Family Robinson dream on a 1.6km long deserted outcrop? \n \n Unfortunately for anyone interested, applications to live on the island of Quéménès, close to the Brittany coast, closed at 6pm on Tuesday evening. \n \n The unique opportunity was advertised by the French coastal protection agency Conservatoire du littoral from mid-June. \n \n “We received around 60 enquiries and 40 applications, but only 15 or so of those were serious,” Isabelle Gay, the Finistere area manager for the Conservatoire du littoral, said speaking to The Local. \n \n “Some sent us a simple cover letter, others sent a more complete application. All the profiles are very different: everything from young couples, to singletons, families, retired couples.” \n \n Dutch and Belgian couples had made enquiries about living on the island, said Ms Gay, but the shortlist is now only down to French citizens. \n \n Google Maps \n \n Those on the shortlist will have to make it through a rigorous selection process. \n \n A panel of seven or eight French conservation agency’s members and its partners will have to be convinced that the chosen inhabitant can survive and live happily on the island which is part of the Molène archipelago. \n \n ""We are particularly looking for people who can live in an isolated area, but also welcome the public to the island,"" Ms Gay said. \n \n Residents who\'ll make the island their home for at least five years or more would be ideal, she added. \n \n Soizic and David Cuisnier, the couple who live on the island now, made the decision to leave in May. \n \n AFP \n \n The Cuisniers were given the keys to the island ten years ago, and have since expanded their family with two children: seven-year-old Chloé and five-year-old Jules. \n \n Accessible only by boat, the parents decided to leave to let the children get to school more easily. \n \n But they also fell out with the agency over rent. \n \n The agency charges a yearly €7,000 ‘licence fee’ to live on the island, and the inhabitants are expected to look after the farm: growing potatoes, collecting seaweed, rearing Ouessant-breed lambs. \n \n On top of that, they will also have to run a small B&B; which is open from April to October, where they can earn a little income. \n \n Before the Cuisniers made Quéménès their home, the island had been inhabited since the 19th century and was owned for 40 years by one family until they sold it to the Conservatoire in 2003. \n \n Marie-Thérèse Darcque-Tassin, whose family lived there from 1953 to 1993, told FranceInfo life there was “atypical and tough but I’m proud of it”. \n \n For some, living on a remote island off the French coast sounds ideal. \n \n So the french government is looking for a couple to live on their own island.

Officials said at least three gunmen dressed as medical staff then entered the 400-bed Sardar Mohammad Daud Khan facility and took up positions on the upper floors. \n \n A second explosion was heard as Afghan special forces engaged the gunmen and “heavy fighting” ensued, a defence ministry spokesman said. An earlier death toll of three was revised upwards after security forces carried out checks in the aftermath of the fighting. \n \n Isis’s Afghan wing has claimed responsibility, according to a report by the Isis-affiliated Amaq news agency. A November suicide attack on a crowded mosque, claimed by the same group, killed more than 30 people and wounded dozens. \n \n Isis was also accused by local officials of killing six Red Cross employees in an ambush on a convoy in northern Afghanistan last month. It has claimed at least two other attacks on minority Shias in Kabul since last July. \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest An unverified photo released by Isis purporting to show one of the Kabul hospital attackers. Photograph: Amaq \n \n Afghanistan’s president, Ashraf Ghani, said the latest attack “trampled on all human values”. “In all religions, a hospital is regarded as an immune site and attacking it is attacking the whole of Afghanistan,” he said, during an address in Kabul for International Women’s Day. \n \n Abdul Qadir, a hospital employee, told Reuters he saw a gunman dressed in a white doctor’s coat take out an AK-47 assault rifle and open fire, killing at least one patient and a hospital worker. \n \n \n \n Reuters reported that patients could be seen climbing out of the building and sheltering on window ledges outside the hospital, across the road from the heavily fortified US embassy. \n \n Isis has been active in Afghanistan since 2014 but maintains a far smaller presence – and poses far less of an existential threat to the Afghan state – than the Taliban, who continue to be responsible for the majority of violence in the country. \n \n Hundreds of US airstrikes in the past year have helped to limit the group’s influence to a handful of districts in and around the eastern Nangarhar province, though Wednesday’s attack showed it continues to have the ability to strike outside those areas. \n \n Gen John Nicholson, the most senior US commander in Afghanistan, has claimed American efforts have killed about one-third of Isis’s fighters and shrunk its territory by two-thirds. \n \n The Afghan affiliate’s leader, Hafiz Saeed Khan, was killed in a US drone strike in August. \n \n The group’s support among local people has also been limited by its trademark brutality and imposition of a blinkered vision of Islam – including bans on smoking and poppy cultivation and the annulment of government-officiated weddings – in spite of local customs. \n \n Analysts have put the number of Isis fighters in Afghanistan at up to 2,000, though a close assessment is difficult to establish because of the uncertain toll of casualties and success of recruitment drives. \n \n The Taliban claimed an attack last week on a police station and intelligence service office in the capital that killed and wounded dozens.']",5,"– At least 144 people were killed yesterday in the latest Syrian violence, including some 64 slaughtered in a ""horrifying massacre"" at a single checkpoint in Homs province, according to witnesses. But the government has no plans to end its attacks on citizens. Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moallem vowed to ""defend"" his country. ""We are not happy to see brothers killing each other,"" he said. ""This is our country. But we will defend our sovereignty and independence,"" he told reporters. The scores killed at the checkpoint were attempting to flee shelling in the city of Homs. Security forces and thugs kidnapped the women among them, and killed the men, sources told CNN. They were either shot or stabbed to death. The killings occurred as Syrian officials announced that the nation's new draft constitution was overwhelmingly approved by voters, and the European Union imposed new sanctions. US officials dismiss the constitution vote ""as absolutely cynical,"" said State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland. What Basahr al-Assad has done ""is put a piece of paper that he controls to a vote that he controls so that he can try and maintain control."" In other Syrian news, the BBC earlier reported that French reporter Edith Bouvier refused to board a Red Cross vehicle that managed to enter besieged Baba Amr, and UK photographer Paul Conroy stayed behind in solidarity. But the BBC now reports that Conroy has indeed been smuggled out of the country; Bouvier's whereabouts are unknown."

Four stories, five bedrooms, and six fireplaces? $9.65 million? To the outside world, this brownstone probably seems like it has it all. The perfect address, 64 Perry Street. The perfect look. But had the brownstone gotten so caught up in its own fame that it had forgotten what it actually was about? \n \n Later today, I got to thinking about relationships. The ones we have with our environment, and the people closest to us. Why did the previous owner move out after just four months? After all, the most exciting, challenging and significant relationship of all is the one you have with your real estate. Maybe real estate is like shoes, or men — you're always seeking the next Big thing. But I began to ponder: is it possible that the brownstone so badly needed the constant adulation of annoying tourists walking by to stare at its famous stoop that it had ignored the most important relationship of all, the one with its owner? Had we, single women of New York still buying expensive cupcakes and complicated cocktails, become victims of self-parody, just like the brownstone? Was it possible that it, and we, had become ... stoop-id?"", '(CNN) The top US military commander on the Korean peninsula said Friday that even as the United States and North Korea work on easing tensions and working toward denuclearization, diplomacy between the two nations was operating in an environment ""void of trust."" \n \n Speaking by teleconference to the Aspen Security Forum, Gen. Vincent Brooks said the peninsula had ""gone now 235 days without a provocation."" On November 28 last year, North Korea tested an intercontinental ballistic missile that it claimed could reach the US mainland. Since then, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said his regime had done all the testing it needed to do, and dismantled at least one test site. \n \n During his summit with President Donald Trump in June, he reportedly promised the US leader that he would also take apart another site , but it is not clear whether that has occurred. \n \n ""Our challenge now candidly is to continue to make progress but to make that progress in an environment that is essentially void of trust, and without trust we\'ll find it difficult to move forward,"" said Brooks, the commander of US forces in Korea, who is also in charge of the United Nations command and the combined South Korea-US forces command. \n \n ""So building that trust while that pressure continues and while the efforts for diplomacy continue is the order of the day. In many ways the lack of trust is the enemy we now have to defeat,"" he said. \n \n \'The world is a gangster\' \n \n The most recent diplomatic foray by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to Pyongyang earlier in July was not particularly successful. \n \n Pompeo, who was expected to see Kim Jong Un during the visit, left North Korea without meeting the dictator. His plane had barely taken off from Pyongyang international airport when North Korean state media announced the regime\'s displeasure with the way the talks had gone. \n \n ""We expected the US to bring constructive measures to build confidence in accordance with the spirit of the US-NK Summit,"" the statement carried by state-run news agency KCNA said. \n \n ""However, the attitude of the US in the first high-level talks held on the 6th and 7th were indeed regrettable."" \n \n The United States displayed a ""gangster-mindset"" during the talks, the North Koreans said. \n \n Pompeo pushed back soon after. \n \n ""If those requests were gangster-like, the world is a gangster,"" he said, adding that the two sides ""had detailed, substantive conversations about the next steps toward a fully verified and complete denuclearization."" \n \n ""No one\'s been closer to that than I have,"" he told Fox News on Thursday. ""Everyone else is simply speculating. I\'ve been there."" \n \n He added that the North Koreans ""have consistently reaffirmed their commitment"" to the deal agreed to by Trump and Kim in Singapore. \n \n ""No one was in any confusion that this was going to happen in hours or days,"" he said, adding that discussions are continuing and the country has a ""bright future."" \n \n Demonstrable action \'or we cannot be satisfied\' \n \n Gen. Brooks argued that the ""maximum pressure"" campaign the United States instituted last year, pushing punishing sanctions on the Kim regime, coupled with intensified military pressure, had contributed to compelling North Korea to engage with the international community. \n \n With Kim\'s noted promise to denuclearize the peninsula must, however, also come viable action that backs up the promise, Brooks said. \n \n ""There has to be demonstrable action in that direction or we cannot be satisfied and we probably can\'t be friends and we probably won\'t be at peace,"" Brooks told the audience. ""So we have to see something moving in both directions in order to get us there."" \n \n From his perch in South Korea, Brooks said he has seen some changes in the pattern of behavior and training of North Korea\'s million-plus army, the majority of which are positioned between Pyongyang and Seoul. \n \n He said he has seen some reduction in training readiness from North Korean troops. \n \n ""They have to alternate their training with harvesting and planting. We\'ve seen some changes in terms of how much time they\'re spending in the field. Some of that might be attributed to fuel shortages; some of that might be because of the renewed engagement,"" he said. \n \n He also noted that in terms of what North Korea has promised to do regarding the denuclearization process, nothing has actually changed on the ground. \n \n ""Let\'s say their production capability is still intact,"" he said. ""We haven\'t seen a complete shutdown of production. We have not seen removal of fuel rods. There still steps that must be taken on the road to denuclearization."" \n \n Transfer of human remains \n \n Brooks said at least some remains of Americans killed during the Korean War would be brought back to the United States. \n \n ""We are confident we\'ll succeed in transferring some of the remains. Not all of them, but some of them,"" he said. ""The pain of those families is as acute today as it was then."" \n \n At least one US official told CNN on July 17 that North Korea would return the first set of possible US service member remains on July 27 , the anniversary of the signing of the armistice that signaled the end of the Korean war. \n \n On that day in 1953, Chinese, North Korean and UN forces signed the armistice, which also established the parameters of the demilitarized zone that separates North and South Korea. \n \n On June 24, US forces in South Korea sent 100 wooden transport cases to the Demilitarized Zone to prepare to receive the remains. \n \n The date of their return has been unclear. On July 12, North Korean officials did not turn up to a meeting with US officials at the DMZ where they were set to discuss the repatriation of the remains. \n \n Brooks downplayed possible posturing by North Korea as the discussions between the two countries continue, saying that diplomacy takes time. This includes, he said, reports of North Korea stepping up its nuclear production activity \n \n ""We don\'t overreact to things like that,"" he said. ""If those things are true, what does it mean to us as we go forward? It could mean several things. We know what our end point is and we know what they\'ve agreed to, so let\'s keep our eye on that and not get distracted.""']",3,"– Still pining for Carrie Bradshaw?

He was the second Wayne State officer to be shot while on duty. \n \n “I am saddened to report that a short time ago, Wayne State University Officer Collin Rose died from the gunshot wound he suffered while working in the line of duty yesterday evening,” Wayne State University President M. Roy Wilson said in a message to the campus community at 6 p.m. Wednesday. “This is a tragedy felt by all of us — Collin and his family and friends, his fiancée, and our campus and community. Please keep Collin and his fiancée and family in your thoughts and prayers. Collin served Wayne State with distinction, and we owe those he left behind our deepest sympathies and our strong support. \n \n ► Related: Echoes of the last Wayne State officer to be shot -- Thanksgiving 1977 \n \n ► Related: Wayne State suspect has history of assaulting cops \n \n ► Related: Suspect arrested, officer ID\'d in Wayne State police shooting \n \n “Please keep all our police officers in your thoughts as well. Collin is the first and only Wayne State officer ever to fall in the line of duty. Our officers mourn with us, but these dedicated, professional men and women continue to serve us courageously, every day. We can honor Collin’s memory best with our ongoing gratitude and support for all of our officers.” \n \n The 29-year-old police officer was shot in the head Tuesday evening while patrolling an area a few blocks off campus, near Martin Luther King Boulevard and Trumbull, in Detroit\'s Woodbridge neighborhood when he stopped to investigate a man. \n \n Rose was alone in the car with his two dogs. It\'s standard policy for officers to patrol alone, police said, It\'s also standard policy not to get the dogs — which are trained for narcotics and bomb sniffing — out and to use them to control a subject. \n \n It is unclear why Rose was in the area, which is off campus. Wayne State police are also sworn Detroit police officers and patrol the area around campus. \n \n Police have not said whether Rose was responding to a 911 call, which Lincoln Apartments manager, Betty Evans, said she made. She said she argued with a man on a bicycle, who didn\'t live there, and called 911 when he wouldn\'t leave the area. She looked outside as an officer arrived to confront the man on the bike. \n \n ""He was outside, in front. The officer was trying to get his hands behind his back. We heard a shot and the officer went down, and we heard two more shots,"" Evans said. \n \n ""I feel sorry for the officer. I hate the crime that\'s going on in the city."" \n \n There also had been a rash of car break-ins in the area the day before. Wayne State University police Chief Tony Holt said he didn\'t know how that factored into Rose\'s decision to stop the suspect. The suspect, who is not being named by the Free Press because he has not been formally charged, was arrested late Tuesday night. \n \n The suspect is known to the Wayne State police and other area departments. In 2011, he was charged with two counts of felony assault involving a police officer, one causing injury, and pleaded guilty, resulting in a 53-day jail sentence, records show. There also was an incident in 2014, Holt said, although he didn\'t have details of that. \n \n The shooting is hitting the 65-member police department hard, Wilson said at a Wednesday news conference. Many Wayne State officers, visibly shaken, gathered in the back at the news conference and exchanged long hugs with each other. \n \n Officials painted a picture of a dedicated officer when talking about Rose. \n \n He was a 2010 graduate of Ferris State University and was one credit short of completing his master\'s degree in police administration at Wayne State. His first job was with the Richland police department in western Michigan. \n \n “Collin is a 2010 FSU Criminal Justice and Law Enforcement Academy graduate,” Ferris State President David Eisler said in a statement. “We ask that you keep his family in your thoughts and prayers.” \n \n Gov. Rick Snyder\'s office issued a statement late Wednesday, saying Rose was committed to serving others. \n \n ""May he rest in peace knowing that Michiganders are collectively mourning his loss and that we will support his family, friends and colleagues to the best of our ability while they grieve,"" Sndyer said. \n \n Rose had worked and conducted training all over the state, Holt said. He was also heavily involved in organizing memorials for other slain police officers in the area.

(WANE) The Fort Wayne mother accused of killing her two children in the backseat of a stolen car in late September said she was spurred to action when she heard the Amber Alert issued to find her on the radio. “That’s when I went straight to Elkhart and that’s when I killed my kids,” said Pasztor. When asked why the Amber Alert was the impetus to smother her children Pasztor replied, “because I knew the police was gonna get us. And with me behind bars and my kids out here with all my problems; no. Sorry. No. I’m not that selfish. I’m not a coward.” \n \n Pasztor refused to offer details, but claimed she felt someone was going to harm her kids. She believed the only solution was to usher them on to heaven. She told NewsChannel 15 she didn’t have the heart to shoot them, so she smothered them. \n \n In an exclusive interview with NewsChannel 15’s Brett Thomas over video chat from the Elkhart County Jail on Monday, Amber Pasztor admitted to smothering her two children to death, one by one. Pasztor faces two charges of murder in Elkhart County for the deaths of 6-year-old Rene Pasztor and 7-year-old Liliana Hernandez – charges she said unequivocally she is guilty of. \n \n With a phone to her ear and speaking matter-of-factly, Pasztor told NewsChannel 15 how she pushed in the door of the home of her father, the legal guardian of the children, grabbed the children and put them into a stolen car, and just started driving. Pasztor said she was driving aimlessley when she received word that an Amber Alert had been issued. \n \n “They were in good hands but I don’t think they were safe,” Pasztor said. “My kids are in a better place … they’re in heaven now. They don’t have no worries no more.” \n \n Pasztor also admitted to fatally shooting her neighbor, 66-year-old Frank Macomber, in a ditch off Wallen Road in Fort Wayne. Pasztor has not been charged with Macomber’s death. \n \n Pasztor said she made the plan days beforehand, when she arranged to go camping with him and have sex with him. In a wooded area off Wallen Road, then, Pasztor said she shot Macomber with his own gun once, killing him, then took his car. She said she dumped the gun in a Michigan river.', 'Amber Pasztor, the woman who killed her two children after abducting them from their grandparents house last Monday, was scheduled for a hearing the day she killed her children. \n \n WANE reports that Amber Pasztor was charged with criminal trespassing back in late July. On August 1, she was found guilty of the criminal trespassing charges and was sentenced to one year in jail. \n \n When Pasztor was able to get the sentence changed, she ended up spending no time in jail, and instead was ordered to stay away from the residence and complete 20 hours of community service. \n \n At the beginning of this month, Pasztor was said to be non-compliant with her sentence and was ordered back to court, which was scheduled for the day she kidnapped her two children, Liliana Hernandez and Rene Pasztor. \n \n Further, WANE revealed that shocking information has been found in regards to Liliana’s and Rene’s father, Rene Hernandez. Back in 2010, Rene Hernandez’s bisected body was located in a wooded area. According to the Whitley County Sheriff’s Office, the crime was never solved. \n \n The Whitley County Sheriff’s Office did say they spoke with Amber Pasztor after his body was discovered, and at the time she had one child with Hernandez and was pregnant with another, the same children allegedly abducted and killed by Amber just last week. \n \n Elkhart Co. coroner: Autopsies show Liliana Hernandez and Rene Pasztor died of asphyxiation, both ruled homicides. https://t.co/2j8OR7eCSA — Holly Hays (@hollyvhays) September 27, 2016 \n \n Whitley County Sheriff Marcus Gatton told reporters that Amber was never connected to Rene Hernandez’s death, but said it is likely they will be revisiting this case, Kokomo Tribune reports. \n \n “I’m sure we will be visiting her again.” \n \n Many are questioning whether Amber Pasztor is a female serial killer. When Amber abducted her children, she was with a neighbor, Frank Macomber, and was driving his car. \n \n Frank was reported missing that day and the amber alert went out for the children. Police eventually found Frank’s body the following day in a wooded area. Reports revealed that Frank had been shot to death. \n \n Investigators believe that the two cases are connected and say they think that Frank was killed before the children were kidnapped. \n \n Michelle Troye, Frank’s daughter, knew that something was very wrong when he went missing that day. She was convinced that not only would her father not be connected to the kidnapping, but that he was in grave danger. \n \n “I am 100 percent certain that he is not involved in this situation because he wouldn’t hurt anybody, especially children.” \n \n Frank and Amber had some sort of relationship and were neighbors, but the type of relationship between the two was unknown. Frank would sometimes help Amber, whether it was giving her cash or giving her rides. Troye was very non-accepting of her father’s relationship with Amber. \n \n “We were very persistent and telling him we do not want her around you, you do not need to have her around you, she is not right. He did not listen.” \n \n Troye kept hope that maybe her father would return home and be just fine, but all her hopes faded when she found out that the two children were found dead. \n \n “If those kids were alive, maybe she changed her mind about hurting anybody and there was still hope for my dad, but after hearing that, I lost all hope.” \n \n According to State Laws, there is no statute of limitation for murder in the state of Indiana. A murder case in the state of Indiana can be re-opened at any time, as many times as they feel necessary. Should they find it likely to re-open Rene Hernandez’s murder case, investigators have made it clear that they will likely be in contact with Amber Pasztor. \n \n Will Amber Pasztor be the next serial killer recognized in the state of Indiana? Only time will tell. Updates will be provided as they become available. \n \n [Featured Image by Bits and Splits/AP Images]', 'Skip in Skip x Embed x Share The discovery of two slain Indiana children, just hours after an Amber Alert was issued in their disappearance, was called a ""senseless tragedy"" by one of the prosecutors in the case.

""I figured they (gang members) know us, they wouldn\'t come to the neighborhood and start shooting, but they really didn\'t even care. \n \n \n \n ""She looked forward every day to opening up the candy store, and for somebody just to come take her life, it\'s not right,"" Banks said. \n \n \n \n She said the block was filled with children playing when two men came out out a gangway and one of them started shooting at a group of people standing on the sidewalk near the candy stand. ""We\'re just sitting out here, normal, she\'s sitting next to me and I just heard shooting,"" Banks told WGN-TV. \n \n \n \n Banks said she threw herself to the ground while her daughter ran for the family\'s home. Moments later, Banks said she found her daughter unconscious inside a hallway. \n \n \n \n ""I\'m lost for words. That was my pride and joy,"" Banks said. The little girl had been looking forward to going to Disney World next month. ""She just got her hair done, she was going to Disney World."" \n \n \n \n A 19-year-old man, described by police as a gang member, was wounded in the ankle and taken to Loyola University Medical Center in Maywood, police said. The girl was pronounced dead there at 11:16 p.m., according to the Cook County medical examiner\'s office. \n \n \n \n Heaven is the 20th person under the age of 17 to be killed by gunfire in Chicago this year, according to a Tribune crime analysis. \n \n \n \n Police recently released statistics showing the number of Chicago Public School students shot this past school year -- 319 -- was the highest in four years. The toll from last weekend\'s gun violence in the city included the deaths of two boys, 13 and 14. \n \n \n \n The Austin community, which includes the North Austin neighborhood, has seen 16 homicides so far this year -- four in the last week. \n \n \n \n Banks said her daughter was frightened by all the violence around her home and had pleaded with her to move out. ""She would say, \'Mom, let\'s move.\' "" \n \n \n \n Banks had a message for the gangs in her neighborhood. ""You all cannot just get away with killing my baby,"" she said. ""You all took her life."" \n \n The slaying comes just days before state funding will run out for all five workers from the anti-violence group CeaseFire who mediate gang conflicts in Austin, according to the group. \n \n \n \n Rick Velasquez, whose outreach organization relies on CeaseFire, said even if Gov. Pat Quinn secures more funding at the last minute, the workers would still have to be temporarily laid off. \n \n \n \n “So how many murders are were going to wait until we get this thing moving?” said Velasquez, executive director of Youth Outreach Services. \n \n \n \n Earlier this week, the city for the first time approved funding for 40 CeaseFire workers to work in two police districts where shootings and homicides have risen: Grand Crossing on the South Side and Ogden on the West Side. \n \n \n \n Wednesday night’s shooting occurred in the Grand Central police district, which has seen significantly less gun violence than the other two districts. From January 1 through June 17 in Grand Central, there were 46 shootings compared to 56 during the same period in 2011, an 18 percent decrease, according to department statistics. Homicides were slightly up during that time, though: eight compared to five last year. \n \n Representatives of CeaseFire visited the Banks home Thursday morning. \n \n \n \n Longtime residents of the block say gang tensions have put residents on edge. Ron Ware, 61, said it was only a matter of time before a child or another innocent bystander was shot. \n \n \n \n Parents only let their children outside for short periods of time, he said, and then only with close supervision, he said. \n \n \n \n “I’ve seen a lot in my time, but it stuck in my head all night long – that baby holding her baby,” Ware said. “I couldn’t sleep.” \n \n \n \n Heaven’s aunt, Sharmaine Sykes, 28, said Heaven was a “girly girl” always eager to dress up in jewelry and high-heel shoes. \n \n \n \n But recent violence in the neighborhood started to make the happy-go-lucky child afraid, she said, and she had asked her mother to move out. \n \n \n \n “It hurts so much,” said another relative, Nisha Odell, 18, Heaven’s cousin. “I’m trying not to cry.” \n \n \n \n Odell said her younger cousin was joyful and made friends with everyone she met, young or old. “She’s the sweetest little girl you could think of,” Odell said. “She was playful. She talked to everybody.

A stray bullet struck her as she ran to the safety of her home. \n \n ""She loved to sing, dance and crack jokes. And she always smiled,"" her mother, Ashake Banks, told ABC News. Banks had opened the stand to keep a closer watch on and protect children in her violent neighborhood on Chicago\'s west side. ""There was already shooting in the neighborhood,"" she said. ""So I figured that if I set up a big tent and a candy store, it would keep the kids in the middle of the block instead of going down to the [corners] where all the activity was."" \n \n Banks believes the shooter was a gang member targeting someone else in the crowd near the stand. She had hoped the gangs would stay away from a place meant for kids. ""But they really didn\'t even care…. They killed my baby."" \n \n Heaven\'s death is the latest of 253 murders so far this year in what has become a numbing drumbeat of violence. But her killing may be a crescendo. It prompted an angry Mayor Rahm Emanuel to lecture the gangs driving this staggering 38% increase in Chicago homicides. \n \n Asked about this shooting at an economic development event, the mayor said, ""This is not about crime.

She said, ""It\'s not a story a multi-billion dollar industry wants to get out.""Anne keeps a video on her phone of the saline breast implants covered with mold, that were removed from her body after a two-year nightmare. Ziegenhorn said, ""I felt like that was it, I was gonna die, and the doctors were gonna let me die.""It started in 2011. The woman who was a picture of health suddenly started gaining weight, losing her vision and experiencing burning, unrelenting pain. She had sores all over her body. Her thinking was so cloudy she thought she might have Alzheimer\'s. She was misdiagnosed with everything from lupus to arthritis to thyroid problems. She said, ""Silicone sickness in and of itself is one entity. And then you add the mold to it that we had, and then you\'ve got two illnesses going on.""The diagnosis that Anne believes saved her life came from Dr. Susan Kolb, author of ""The Naked Truth About Breast Implants."" Dr. Kolb said, ""My experience in doing this for thirty years is that eventually everybody will become ill from their breast implants, unless they die sooner from something else.""Dr. Kolb says she\'s seeing lots of women with mold in their saline implants, often from defective valves. She says some patients also have detoxification problems, that make them particularly sensitive to the silicone shells of the implants. She says in 25-30 percent of the population, the reactions are debilitating. The doctor is not anti-implants, she has them herself. But she believes for safety, women need to get their implants replaced every eight to fifteen years. Amanda Gilcrease is a patient who had her implants removed. She said, ""All the neurological symptoms... the burning, numbing, stabbing, shooting, electrical shocking pains throughout my body went away immediately.""Through Dr. Kolb, Anne Ziegenhorn met other women suffering the same frightening symptoms.

Both were diagnosed with Saline Biotoxin Illness, and received an explant from Dr. Susan Kolb. \n \n Paula Blades shared this picture of her back, riddled with scars. For years, she dealt with sores that would not heal. \n \n Many are willing to pay the price and go under the knife to fix their insecurities, including Paula Blades. She chose breast augmentation. Then, after years of severe mystery illnesses, it turns out the very thing she needed to feel good about herself was killing her. \n \n The Choice \n \n Down a quiet Gilbertsville road, you\'ll find Paula Blade\'s home. \n \n ""We live on a little farm. I love animals,"" Paula said. \n \n The lawn is manicured. Inside, her home is tastefully decorated, every detail thought out. Growing up, Paula had less control over her appearance. \n \n ""I actually had this little Skipper Barbie doll growing up, and you could twist her arm and her chest would expand,"" Paula said. ""So my cousins, they would try to, they would, like, try to twist my arm trying to get them to grow."" \n \n Paula laughs about it now, but the teasing harbored insecurities about her chest size. She was determined to have a breast augmentation. She even asked her parents for one when she graduated high school. They said no, but in 1992, at 20 years old, Paula was capable of making the decision on her own. She did her research and chose saline breast implants. \n \n ""Was told they were totally safe, would last me a lifetime,"" Paula said. ""If they did rupture, it\'s no big deal."" \n \n The implants had a valve, like many on the market. They are placed into the breast deflated, then a syringe is used to fill the implant with saline through the valve. \n \n Trouble With Her Health \n \n \n \n Even in the beginning, there was trouble. Two years after her surgery, she went back under the knife to fix the look of the implants. They looked wavy under her skin. \n \n It wasn\'t until years later that serious health problems began to plague her. \n \n ""I started getting like chronic sinusitis and different infections —bronchitis, things of that nature that wouldn\'t go away,"" Paula explained. ""I got these sores all over my upper torso that wouldn\'t heal."" \n \n ""Severe chronic sinusitis and running a temperature every day. My white blood cell count was increased,"" she recalled. \n \n Paula also lost a lot of weight, dropping to just 80 pounds. She went to doctor after doctor and faced diagnosis after diagnosis. She went through multiple hospital stays. \n \n ""Just one thing after another,"" Paula said. ""It seemed like it never ever was going to end."" \n \n No one could tell her the source of her illnesses, and she only got sicker. \n \n ""I was to the point where I was planning my funeral. I knew I was gonna\' die,"" Paula said. \n \n One night, Paula was channel surfing and happened to stop on Discover Health. The show \'Monsters Inside Me\' was on. Paula saw a woman. She was a stranger, but her symptoms were all too familiar to Paula. \n \n ""She was like me. She had the same symptoms, everything, and I was just like \'Oh my gosh, that\'s me,\'"" Paula said. \n \n Paula also saw Dr. Susan Kolb, with Plastikos Plastic Surgery Center in Atlanta, on the program.

In Paula\'s case, the procedure lasted hours, because it\'s not as simple as removing the implant. \n \n ""Specifically, you have to have the entire scar capsule removed. Not just the implant,"" Kolb said. \n \n The implants were then sent to Dr. Pierre Blais with Innoval Failure Analysis in Ottawa, Canada, for further testing. That testing found ""the valve capping mechanism...faulty"", the ""filling fluid grossly contaminated"" and indication of ""aspergilli-related entities,"" —mold. \n \n ""It can do all sorts of things in the body,"" said Kolb. \n \n Kolb also discovered silicone from the shell of her saline implant had leaked, collecting in certain areas of her body. \n \n Finding Support \n \n Anne Ziegenhorn and Paula talked with a British radio station about their stories the day we interviewed them. Anne\'s from Florida, but she knows exactly what Paula\'s been through. \n \n ""After going through what I\'ve gone through —hundreds and thousands of dollars in medical bills, I\'ve lost my career.

If you live in a climate that is humid and moldy, you may be more susceptible to this condition. In that case, saline implants may not be the best option for you. \n \n As far as finances, Kolb says women need to make sure they are financially prepared to not only pay for the surgery, but upkeep on the implants. She told me silicone implants, for example, need to be changed out every eight years. Others can last longer.

Blade's tale is a similar one, and she says that when her removed implants were tested, the implants' valve was found to be faulty, the ""filling fluid [was] grossly contaminated,"" and there were signs of mold. Dr. Kolb believes the mold can often be traced to defective valves (saline implants are put into the body deflated, and the saline is then inserted via the valve). While an FDA spokesman tells Wear TV that he's not aware of similar complaints being filed by women with moldy implants, he does note that most women will eventually need theirs replaced.

56,"['The electrochemical conversion of CO 2 and H 2 O into liquid fuel is ideal for high-density renewable energy storage and could provide an incentive for CO 2 capture. However, efficient electrocatalysts for reducing CO 2 and its derivatives into a desirable fuel1,2,3 are not available at present. Although many catalysts4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11 can reduce CO 2 to carbon monoxide (CO), liquid fuel synthesis requires that CO is reduced further, using H 2 O as a H+ source. Copper (Cu) is the only known material with an appreciable CO electroreduction activity, but in bulk form its efficiency and selectivity for liquid fuel are far too low for practical use. In particular, H 2 O reduction to H 2 outcompetes CO reduction on Cu electrodes unless extreme overpotentials are applied, at which point gaseous hydrocarbons are the major CO reduction products12,13. Here we show that nanocrystalline Cu prepared from Cu 2 O (‘oxide-derived Cu’) produces multi-carbon oxygenates (ethanol, acetate and n-propanol) with up to 57% Faraday efficiency at modest potentials (–0.25 volts to –0.5 volts versus the reversible hydrogen electrode) in CO-saturated alkaline H 2 O. By comparison, when prepared by traditional vapour condensation, Cu nanoparticles with an average crystallite size similar to that of oxide-derived copper produce nearly exclusive H 2 (96% Faraday efficiency) under identical conditions. Our results demonstrate the ability to change the intrinsic catalytic properties of Cu for this notoriously difficult reaction by growing interconnected nanocrystallites from the constrained environment of an oxide lattice. The selectivity for oxygenates, with ethanol as the major product, demonstrates the feasibility of a two-step conversion of CO 2 to liquid fuel that could be powered by renewable electricity.', 'Scientists said on Wednesday they have developed a new way to make liquid ethanol efficiently without using corn or other crops needed in the conventional method for producing the biofuel. \n \n The scientists said their process turns carbon monoxide gas into liquid ethanol with the help of an electrode made of a form of copper. They said the new technique may be more environmentally friendly and efficient than the current method. \n \n Critics say that growing crops for biofuels is energy-intensive and takes up vast tracts of nonagricultural land, using too much water and fertilizer. They also say diverting corn and sugar to make biofuels pushes up food prices. \n \n The United States leads the world in ethanol production, with 13.3 billion gallons in 2013, followed by Brazil\'s 6.3 billion gallons, according to the Washington-based Renewable Fuels Association, which represents the U.S. ethanol industry. \n \n E85 ethanol fuel is pumped into a vehicle at a gas station in the town of Nevada, Iowa, on Dec. 6, 2007. Scientists say they have developed a new way to make liquid ethanol fuel in an efficient process that does not use corn or other crops. JASON REED / Reuters \n \n A group of scientists led by Stanford University chemist Matthew Kanan described the new method in research published in the journal Nature. Kanan said a prototype device could be ready in two to three years, enabling an assessment on whether the process can become commercially viable. \n \n ""I emphasize that these are just laboratory experiments today. We haven\'t built a device,"" Kanan said. ""But it demonstrates the feasibility of using electricity that you could get from a renewable energy source to power fuel synthesis — in this case ethanol. There are some real advantages to doing that relative to using biomass to produce ethanol."" \n \n Ethanol fuel generally is produced at high-temperature fermentation facilities that chemically transform corn, sugarcane and other plants into liquid fuel. \n \n Kanan and his colleagues built an electrochemical cell — a device consisting of two electrodes that were put in water saturated with carbon monoxide gas. One of the electrodes was made of a material they call ""oxide-derived copper."" \n \n When voltage was applied across the electrodes, the carbon monoxide gas was converted into ethanol, they said. \n \n The researchers hope to take carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and convert it to carbon monoxide, which then would be fed into the copper-oxide catalyst. The researchers hope the catalytic cell would be powered by a renewable energy source such as solar or wind. \n \n — Reuters', 'Stanford scientists Matthew Kanan and Christina Li have created an oxide-derived copper catalyst that converts carbon monoxide to ethanol. The catalyst consists of a continuous network of copper nanocrystals with well-defined grain boundaries. The nanocrystalline network may be critical for producing ethanol, the scientists say. Credit: Matthew Kanan, Stanford University Stanford University scientists have found a new, highly efficient way to produce liquid ethanol from carbon monoxide gas. This promising discovery could provide an eco-friendly alternative to conventional ethanol production from corn and other crops, say the scientists. Their results are published in the April 9 advanced online edition of the journal Nature. \n \n ""We have discovered the first metal catalyst that can produce appreciable amounts of ethanol from carbon monoxide at room temperature and pressure – a notoriously difficult electrochemical reaction,"" said Matthew Kanan, an assistant professor of chemistry at Stanford and coauthor of the Nature study. \n \n Most ethanol today is produced at high-temperature fermentation facilities that chemically convert corn, sugarcane and other plants into liquid fuel. But growing crops for biofuel requires thousands of acres of land and vast quantities of fertilizer and water. In some parts of the United States, it takes more than 800 gallons of water to grow a bushel of corn, which, in turn, yields about 3 gallons of ethanol. \n \n The new technique developed by Kanan and Stanford graduate student Christina Li requires no fermentation and, if scaled up, could help address many of the land- and water-use issues surrounding ethanol production today. ""Our study demonstrates the feasibility of making ethanol by electrocatalysis,"" Kanan said. ""But we have a lot more work to do to make a device that is practical."" \n \n Novel electrodes \n \n Two years ago, Kanan and Li created a novel electrode made of a material they called oxide-derived copper. They used the term ""oxide-derived"" because the metallic electrode was produced from copper oxide. \n \n ""Conventional copper electrodes consist of individual nanoparticles that just sit on top of each other,"" Kanan said. ""Oxide-derived copper, on the other hand, is made of copper nanocrystals that are all linked together in a continuous network with well-defined grain boundaries. The process of transforming copper oxide into metallic copper creates the network of nanocrystals."" \n \n For the Nature study, Kanan and Li built an electrochemical cell – a device consisting of two electrodes placed in water saturated with carbon monoxide gas. When a voltage is applied across the electrodes of a conventional cell, a current flows and water is converted to oxygen gas at one electrode (the anode) and hydrogen gas at the other electrode (the cathode). The challenge was to find a cathode that would reduce carbon monoxide to ethanol instead of reducing water to hydrogen. \n \n ""Most materials are incapable of reducing carbon monoxide and exclusively react with water,"" Kanan said. ""Copper is the only exception, but conventional copper is very inefficient."" \n \n In the Nature experiment, Kanan and Li used a cathode made of oxide-derived copper. When a small voltage was applied, the results were dramatic. \n \n ""The oxide-derived copper produced ethanol and acetate with 57 percent faradaic efficiency,"" Kanan said. ""That means 57 percent of the electric current went into producing these two compounds from carbon monoxide. We\'re excited because this represents a more than 10-fold increase in efficiency over conventional copper catalysts. Our models suggest that the nanocrystalline network in the oxide-derived copper was critical for achieving these results."" \n \n Carbon neutral \n \n The Stanford team has begun looking for ways to create other fuels and improve the overall efficiency of the process. ""In this experiment, ethanol was the major product,"" Kanan said. ""Propanol would actually be a higher energy-density fuel than ethanol, but right now there is no efficient way to produce it."" \n \n In the experiment, Kanan and Li found that a slightly altered oxide-derived copper catalyst produced propanol with 10 percent efficiency. The team is working to improve the yield for propanol by further tuning the catalyst\'s structure. \n \n Ultimately, Kanan would like to see a scaled-up version of the catalytic cell powered by electricity from the sun, wind or other renewable resource. \n \n For the process to be carbon neutral, scientists will have to find a new way to make carbon monoxide from renewable energy instead of fossil fuel, the primary source today. Kanan envisions taking carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere to produce carbon monoxide, which, in turn, would be fed to a copper catalyst to make liquid fuel. The CO2 that is released into the atmosphere during fuel combustion would be re-used to make more carbon monoxide and more fuel – a closed-loop, emissions-free process. \n \n ""Technology already exists for converting CO2 to carbon monoxide, but the missing piece was the efficient conversion of carbon monoxide to a useful fuel that\'s liquid, easy to store and nontoxic,"" Kanan said. ""Prior to our study, there was a sense that no catalyst could efficiently reduce carbon monoxide to a liquid. We have a solution to this problem that\'s made of copper, which is cheap and abundant. We hope our results inspire other people to work on our system or develop a new catalyst that converts carbon monoxide to fuel."" \n \n Explore further: Newly discovered catalyst could lead to the low-cost production of clean methanol \n \n More information: Electroreduction of carbon monoxide to liquid fuel on oxide-derived nanocrystalline copper, Nature, dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature13249', 'Today, nearly all ethanol fuel is made from corn or sugarcane, which requires vast tracts of land and huge quantities of water and fertilizer. Researchers at Stanford University have now developed an electrochemical process that could be far cheaper and better for the environment. \n \n The work is still experimental, but it’s significant because the group was able to synthesize ethanol and other desired products with so little energy input. “The levels of activity for CO reported here are unprecedented and a large step toward the realization of a practical system for converting CO to ethanol,” says Clifford Kubiak, professor of chemistry and biochemistry at the University of California, San Diego. \n \n The scientists created a copper-based catalyst that is very effective at producing ethanol and other carbon compounds from carbon monoxide and water in a simple chemical reaction. They say the process, described in a paper published in Nature on Wednesday, could be powered by renewable sources of electricity, such as solar and wind, and would be an alternative to traditional biofuel production. \n \n Making ethanol is normally remarkably energy-intensive, involving gathering and treating biomass and then fermenting the sugar found in the plant matter. The Stanford paper shows it’s feasible to produce ethanol directly from water and waste gases using an electric current. \n \n “You get the same fuel, although in principle it could be much more efficient because you are not relying on biomass,” says Matthew Kanan, an associate professor of chemistry at Stanford who co-authored the paper. \n \n The researchers envision a two-step process in which carbon dioxide is first converted into carbon monoxide using either existing processes or more energy-efficient ones currently under development. Then the carbon monoxide would be converted to ethanol or other carbon-based compounds electrochemically. \n \n Existing methods for turning carbon monoxide into fuel are complicated, requiring very large reactors and high pressures. An electrolyzer, which uses an electrical current to drive a chemical reaction, could make the required system much smaller, says Joel Rosenthal, an assistant professor at the University of Delaware. This could allow ethanol production to be miniaturized and distributed. \n \n One could image, for example, having a rooftop solar panel produce liquid fuel stored in a tank the size of a water heater. “The big value of chemical fuels in general, and liquid fuels in particular, is that they have much, much higher energy density than typical battery technologies, so you can store a lot more energy in a smaller amount of space,” Rosenthal says. \n \n Ib Chorkendorff, the director of the Catalysis for Sustainable Energy research center at the Technical University of Denmark, describes the work as “an important step towards the goal of finding an efficient route for storing electricity as chemical energy.” \n \n The key to the new catalyst is preparing the copper in a novel way that changes its molecular structure. Until now, copper catalysts produced a wide range of carbon-based compounds, rather than one desired product, and required a lot of energy. \n \n The Stanford group starts with copper metal and, by heating it in air, grows a layer of copper oxide on top. Then that surface layer is chemically converted back to metallic copper. In the process, the copper takes on a very different surface with more active area for it to act as a catalyst. \n \n It will take years to know whether a device based on this chemistry would be commercially viable. But if perfected, it could provide an economic incentive for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.', 'Facebook is aware of reports of disruption to its service in Egypt but said it had not seen any major changes in traffic from the Middle Eastern country. \n \n Egyptians had complained Facebook and Twitter and other sites were being blocked and mobile networks disrupted.

A group of scientists has published research in Nature detailing a new method of making ethanol out of carbon monoxide gas, instead of corn or sugarcane, Reuters reports. Researchers saturated water with the gas, then zapped it with a novel device featuring two electrodes, one made of what they're calling ""oxide-derived copper,"" to convert it into fuel. ""I emphasize that these are just laboratory experiments today,"" lead researcher Matthew Kanan says. He expects to have a prototype device ready in two to three years. The environmental implications are profound. Critics of ethanol say it drives up food prices and consumes loads of land and water. It can take more than 800 gallons of water to grow enough corn to make 3 gallons of ethanol, Phys.org points out. What's more, researchers envision a two-step process in which the carbon monoxide is derived from carbon dioxide in the air, providing an ""economic incentive"" for scrubbing carbon from the atmosphere, the MIT Technology Review reports. The new process could also work on a far smaller scale than biomass methods; the Review envisions rooftop solar panels generating fuel that's kept in water heater-sized tanks.

Once a consumer buys the coffee machine, the coffee drinker may spend as much as $50 to $60 per pound on the coffee contained in the K-Cups, considerably more than the cost of even Starbucks’s breakfast blend, which goes for about $11.95 per pound. \n \n Some years back, thousands of Keurig single-serve machine fans found a cheaper alternative, however — refillable, non-disposable K-cups, little plastic coffee grounds holders, which the company graciously sold under the brand of “My K-Cup.” \n \n Not only was it cheaper, but the coffee drinker had more choice, as “My K-Cup” could be filled with any brand of coffee off the shelf. \n \n But in August 2014, when Keurig introduced its “2.0” line of coffeemakers, it stopped making “My K-Cup” for it and made the machine incompatible with any K-cups already in existence, as well as with any unlicensed disposable K-cups made by other companies. \n \n It was $50 a pound and a trail of waste — or nothing. \n \n [K-cups inventor: ‘I feel bad sometimes that I ever did it’] \n \n That was two provocations, but two too much.

Seeking Alpha sees it as the anti-iPhone scenario: ""People are happy with the original and aren't interested for the most part in fixing what isn't broken."" But at the Washington Post, Fred Barbash lays out a different problem: the ""My K-Cup"" one. The coffee packaged into each K-Cup costs customers dearly: on a per pound basis, they spend up to $60, or roughly five times what they'd pay for a bag of Starbucks coffee. Enter the My K-Cup, a refillable option that freed consumers from the expense and brand limitations of Keurig's K-Cups. The problem? The K-Cups that worked in previous models (both those made by Keurig and its competitors) lack a special ink introduced for the 2.0. Those cups no longer work, and neither do My K-Cups; no new refillable option was introduced. The complaints came in short order. As a one-star Amazon review for the K550 2.0 puts it, ""If you want a machine that brews a good cup of coffee then this will work for you. If you want a machine that puts all sorts of restrictions on what type of k-cups you can use this is also the machine for you."" The Post reports the company's initial line of defense was that the move was born out of safety, as the machine wouldn't know how to properly brew a coffee Keurig didn't package. Other companies introduced hacks (one competitor mailed out a free override device), and yesterday, Kelley ""capitulated,"" as Barbash puts it, saying ""we heard loud and clear from consumers""; the My K-Cup will return.

64,"['No one liked the government shutdown, but apparently, it wasn’t without love. The kind of love that transpires when, say, you and your partner both don’t have to go to work. One week passes. Then two. You’re bored. You’re adults. You share a bed. \n \n And nine months later, there you are at a hospital that seems strangely overcrowded. \n \n “We keep getting asked, ‘What’s going on?’ ” said Sibley Memorial Hospital nurse Yulette Newman. “And we sit back and say, ‘Well, you’re in D.C. What was happening nine months ago?’ ” \n \n According to some local hospitals, one apparent aftereffect of the 16-day October furlough has made its way into maternity wards. At Sibley, for example, an average of 9.2 births occur daily. During the past month, that number has increased by three births, or 32.6 percent, per day. \n \n Newman, who has been a nurse in Sibley’s Family Centered Care Unit for eight years, is credited by her fellow nurses with predicting the so-called baby boom. On the 10th day of the shutdown, she posted a photo of an “Expected Date of Confinement Wheel” on Facebook. The circular calendar is used by obstetricians to predict when a baby will be born, based on the date of conception. \n \n Furlough babies? (Getty) \n \n The caption “Furlough babies????” earned Newman 16 likes, 22 comments and a little boost in hospital fame come June, when the number of births was on the rise. \n \n Nurses at Anne Arundel Medical Center in Annapolis, Md., were making the same jokes this month, when births in the first half of July increased from 265 in 2013 to 385 in 2014. \n \n There were 99 additional births at Virginia Hospital Center in the months of April, May and June, although spokeswoman Maryanne Boster acknowledged that birth rates have been rising at the hospital for a few years. \n \n The fruitful aftermath of shutdown boredom could also be seen in federal offices. Jessica Hernandez, a program analyst for the Food and Drug Administration, was one of three pregnant women in her 150-person office after the shutdown. She traced the conception of her daughter Gabrielle Nadine, who was born June 3, to her time off work, although she admits it was “all kind of hazy.” \n \n “It was definitely stressful not knowing when we would get paid, but I actually had a great time,” Hernandez said. “I got lunch with other feds, hung out with my mom, volunteered at my other daughter’s school, cleaned some closets and then just relaxed.” \n \n Her relaxation contributed to her better mood, she recalled, and her better mood contributed to her choice of activities when her husband came home from his sales consulting job. \n \n Carl Woog, a Pentagon employee whose wife recently gave birth to a baby boy, said they tracked her conception date back to just after the shutdown ended. Although Woog wasn’t furloughed, he and his wife “may have been celebrating congressional action,” he joked. \n \n Of course, with this raft of happy new arrivals come the baby-boom skeptics — those who say that any uptick in Beltway babies is purely coincidental. And there isn’t an increase everywhere. Nationwide, birth rates are still near historic lows. Communications departments at Medstar Washington Hospital Center, Medstar Georgetown University Hospital and Inova Fairfax Hospital balked at the post-shutdown baby-boom claim, saying they have seen no significant rise in births. \n \n Statisticians have also weighed in, noting that claims of baby booms have previously popped up in the news media after severe weather or events. A well-known 1970 study discredited a baby boom reported in the New York Times after the Great Blackout of 1965. \n \n But more recent work has shown tangible increases in fertility after the Oklahoma City bombing and after a string of hurricane advisories on the East Coast. \n \n Newman, the nurse at Sibley Hospital, says there will always be skeptics of the theories that she and many other maternity nurses believe in: that full moons, drops in barometric pressure and bad weather all can affect conception and birth rates. \n \n “But every time [something unusual happens], I think, nine months from now, here we go!” Newman said. “And sure enough, I’m usually right.” \n \n \n \n CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article misstated the sex of one of the children mentioned. Carl Woog’s wife gave birth to a boy', '— For years, the weather has been a scapegoat for allegedly causing cabin-fever induced spikes in births, and now some in the Washington area are pointing to Congress to explain packed maternity wards at several local hospitals. \n \n This July, nine months after Congress failed to pass appropriations legislation _ shutting down much of the government and sending hundreds of thousands of federal workers home for more than two weeks _ some hospitals are reporting higher-than-average numbers of births. Skeptics say the coincidence is probably just another false “baby boom” claim, which have been made after hurricanes, snowstorms and even the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. \n \n “Usually these stories are just romantic hypotheses with nothing to support them,” said Philip Morgan, a professor of sociology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who’s the director of the Carolina Population Center. “A few hospitals will have extra babies, so if you go looking for evidence you can find it.” \n \n In 1970, statistician Richard Udry published an analysis of a supposed baby boom reported by The New York Times nine months after a blackout had hit the city in the fall of 1965. Examining the combined hospital statistics throughout the city compared with averages from several years prior, Udry found no evidence of a real rise in births. \n \n Still, even Udry knew that his evidence would hardly quell the excitement related to reports of such baby booms. \n \n “It is evidently pleasing to many people to fantasy that when people are trapped by some immobile event which deprives them of their usual activities, most will turn to copulation,” Udry wrote. \n \n UNC’s Morgan said such events were unlikely to affect the birthrate because they rarely had an effect on other factors, such as couples using contraception. However, he said some cases had been scientifically corroborated, including a rise in births in metropolitan Oklahoma City after the bombings in 1995 and a decrease following the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court decision in Southern states. \n \n “It’s possible, but I doubt it,” Morgan said. “If anything, the government shutdown would irritate people and make them rethink having a child.” \n \n While it would take years to compare this year’s births with the long-term trend to prove such a boom, the spike in births at at least one hospital has people excited. \n \n “It’s not actually a rumor, it’s real,” said Gary Stephenson, a spokesman for Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington, who said the hospital had averaged three more births per day so far in July compared with the same period last year. In addition, the hospital had eight more babies this June than it did in June 2013. \n \n While Stephenson acknowledged that the increased rate wasn’t beyond the norm, he said similar past events, such as the debunked post-blackout boom in New York, seemed to give such anomalies credit. \n \n “When you see constituent bumps (in births) over time . . . I think it does cause one to think,” Stephenson said, adding that a nurse at Sibley had predicted the recent uptick. \n \n Not all hospitals said they had evidence of a baby boom, however. A spokeswoman for MedStar Washington Hospital Center, the district’s largest, said the maternity ward there hadn’t seen any recent anomalies in the number of births, which was actually down in recent weeks. \n \n Brian Williams, the anchor of “NBC Nightly News,” took the opportunity of the reported boom to offer some on-air humor. \n \n “How long until someone on television points out that during the shutdown the folks in Washington are apparently doing at home what Washington has been accused of doing to the American people?” Williams said last week. \n \n A similar case of an alleged baby boom made news last year, when some hospitals in New Jersey reported a surge in births nine months after Hurricane Sandy hit the region in October 2012. \n \n The phenomenon was also recently referenced in a Hyundai commercial that aired during the FIFA World Cup competition. The ad showed a packed maternity ward before flashing back nine months to victory celebrations in which a young couple lock eyes and begin kissing. \n \n The federal government shutdown, which occurred last Oct. 1 to Oct. 16, sent roughly 800,000 federal workers home during that period. In addition, more than 1 million employees were required to work without pay. Congress later restored pay for all the federal workers. \n \n Email: jmoritz@mcclatchydc.com; Twitter: @JCMoritzTU.', 'Officials with Port Canaveral said a police sergeant has been fired after he brought shooting targets resembling Trayvon Martin to a firearms training session. \n \n \n \n Sgt.

65,"['Northwestern football players win pivotal union case. \n \n Northwestern University football players on scholarship are employees of the school and therefore entitled to hold an election to decide whether to unionize, an official of the National Labor Relations Board ruled Wednesday. \n \n The stunning decision, coming after a push by former quarterback Kain Colter backed by organized labor, has the potential to shake up the world of big-time college sports. \n \n The National Collegiate Athletic Association and universities set the rules and cut the lucrative deals with TV networks and sponsors, exerting near total control over the activities of players known as ""student athletes."" But now those football players, at least at Northwestern, are employees too and may seek collective bargaining status, according to the 24-page ruling by Peter Sung Ohr, the regional director of the NLRB. \n \n Ohr\'s decision is ""revolutionary for college sports,"" said Robert McCormick, a professor emeritus at the Michigan State University College of Law who focuses on sports and labor law. \n \n Experts said the ruling could have wide impact beyond Northwestern\'s locker room, potentially influencing other players, schools, and state and federal agencies. For example, McCormick said that if college players demand compensation for injuries suffered during training or a game, Ohr\'s opinion could raise the question of whether they should be treated as employees under the state Workers\' Compensation Act. \n \n The decision also opens the door for athletes with scholarships at public universities to move more quickly to unionize because state labor boards, which govern public universities, usually follow labor law interpretations issued by the NLRB. \n \n There were many questions left unanswered, including whether a union vote among Northwestern players would succeed, but Ohr\'s decision is preliminary. Northwestern immediately said it will appeal to the NLRB in Washington, and experts anticipate the case ultimately could be heard by the Supreme Court. \n \n ""Northwestern believes strongly that our student-athletes are not employees, but students,"" Northwestern said in a statement. ""Unionization and collective bargaining are not the appropriate methods to address the concerns raised by student-athletes."" \n \n Northwestern\'s football players are the first in college sports to seek union representation. Behind the effort is the College Athletes Players Association, or CAPA, a union funded by Ramogi Huma, a former UCLA linebacker who has become an advocate for players\' rights. CAPA is backed by the United Steelworkers, which is covering the group\'s legal expenses. \n \n ""This is a huge step toward justice for college athletes,"" Huma said. \n \n He said the NCAA invented the term ""student-athletes"" 60 years ago in an attempt to prevent students from unionizing. Wednesday\'s decision, he said, asserts the rights of college athletes under labor law. \n \n The union has said it would seek to negotiate over health and safety issues and does not intend to push for ""pay-for-play"" wages, which are not allowed under regulations issued by the NCAA. \n \n Among its demands, CAPA is seeking financial coverage for former players with sports-related medical expenses, independent concussion experts to be placed on the sidelines during games and the creation of an educational trust fund to help former players graduate. \n \n It also wants players to receive compensation for commercial sponsorships, which it says is consistent with ""evolving"" NCAA regulations. \n \n In siding with the union, Ohr said the football players primarily have an economic relationship with the university, which controls and directs their daily activities and compensates them in the form of scholarships, which are worth about $76,000 per academic year if the player enrolls in summer classes. \n \n ""The record makes clear that the employer\'s scholarship players are identified and recruited in the first instance because of their football prowess and not because of their academic achievement in high school,"" Ohr wrote. \n \n Football players with scholarships, he said, ""fall squarely"" within in the labor law\'s definition of an employee. Ohr said those players spend many more hours on their football duties than on their studies. Furthermore, he said, the players are subject to special rules and policies that do not govern the general student population. \n \n For example, he said, freshmen and sophomore students on scholarships are required to live on campus. Upperclassmen, he added, can live off campus but are required to submit their lease for approval to their coach, Pat Fitzgerald. \n \n ""Even the players\' academic lives are controlled as evidenced by the fact that they are required to attend study hall if they fail to maintain a certain grade-point average (GPA) in their classes,"" Ohr wrote. \n \n Northwestern argued that the term ""student athlete"" is still appropriate. ""We believe that participation in athletic events is part of the overall educational experience for those students, not a separate activity.""', ""Northwestern football players qualify under federal law as employees of the university and, therefore, can legally form the nation's first college athletes' union, the National Labor Relations Board announced Wednesday. \n \n “We had both the facts and the law on our side,” Gary Kohlman, the attorney representing the players, said in a telephone interview with Bloomberg News. \n \n It's a stunning ruling, but hardly the final one on the matter. Northwestern has already announced plans to appeal the ruling by National Labor Relations Board regional director Peter Ohr to the full NLRB in Washington, D.C. After that, it probably will go through appellate courts and even the Supreme Court if necessary. \n \n Outgoing Northwestern quarterback Kain Colter was the driving force behind forming the College Athletes Players Assn., which would take the lead of organizing the players if a union is formed. The legal bills have been paid by the United Steelworkers union. \n \n CAPA attorneys have argued college football generates enormous amounts of profit on players' labor, which makes the players employees of the schools. CAPA said scholarships are the equivalent of payment, but not nearly enough. \n \n Northwestern attorneys countered student-athletes shouldn't be categorized with unionized workers such as truck drivers or factory employees. It said scholarships aren't payments, they are grants. \n \n The NCAA is facing increasing pressure, including multiple lawsuits, challenging its classification of athletes as amateurs. The focus of this particular case is for athletes to unionize at private schools because the federal labor agency does not have jurisdiction over public universities. \n \n ALSO: \n \n Severe weather halts Monday practice at Masters \n \n Dogs or 'Cats?

(Associated Press) \n \n The decision by a regional director of the National Labor Relations Board means it agrees football players at the Big Ten school qualify as employees under federal law and therefore can legally unionize. \n \n ""Based on the entire record in this case, I find that the Employer\'s football players who receive scholarships fall squarely within (federal labor law\'s) broad definition of \'employee,"" Peter Sung Ohr, the NLRB regional director, said in his 24-page decision. \n \n An employee is generally regarded by law as someone who receives compensation for a service and is under the direct control of managers. Players argued that their scholarships are compensation and coaches are their managers. \n \n The Evanston, Ill-based university argued college athletes, as students, don\'t fit in the same category as factory workers, truck drivers and other unionized workers. Immediately after the ruling, the school announced it plans to appeal to labor authorities in Washington, D.C. \n \n Alan Cubbage, Northwestern\'s vice president for university relations, said in a statement that while the school respects ""the NLRB process and the regional director\'s opinion, we disagree with it."" \n \n The specific goals of the College Athletes Players Association, or CAPA, which would take the lead in organizing the players, include guaranteeing coverage of sports-related medical expenses for current and former players, ensuring better procedures to reduce head injuries and potentially letting players pursue commercial sponsorships. \n \n But critics have argued that giving college athletes employee status and allowing them to unionize could hurt college sports in numerous ways, including by raising the prospects of strikes by disgruntled players or lockouts by athletic departments. \n \n For now, the push is to unionize athletes at private schools, such as Northwestern, because the federal labor agency does not have jurisdiction over public universities. \n \n Outgoing Wildcats quarterback Kain Colter took a leading role in establishing CAPA. The United Steelworkers union has been footing the legal bills. \n \n Colter, whose eligibility has been exhausted and who has entered the NFL draft, said nearly all of the 85 scholarship players on the Wildcats roster backed the union bid, though only he expressed his support publicly. \n \n CAPA attorneys argued that college football is, for all practical purposes, a commercial enterprise that relies on players\' labor to generate billions of dollars in profits. That, they contend, makes the relationship of schools to players one of employers to employees. \n \n In its endeavor to have college football players be recognized as essential workers, CAPA likened scholarships to employment pay — too little pay from its point of view. Northwestern balked at that claim, describing scholarship as grants. \n \n The NCAA has been under increasing scrutiny over its amateurism rules and is fighting a class-action federal lawsuit by former players seeking a cut of the billions of dollars earned from live broadcasts, memorabilia sales and video games. Other lawsuits allege the NCAA failed to protect players from debilitating head injuries. \n \n NCAA President Mark Emmert has pushed for a $2,000-per-player stipend to help athletes defray some of expenses. Critics say that isn\'t nearly enough, considering players help bring in millions of dollars to their schools and conferences. \n \n During the NLRB\'s five days of hearings in February, Wildcats coach Pat Fitzgerald took the stand for union opponents, and his testimony sometimes was at odds with Colter\'s. \n \n Colter told the hearing that players\' performance on the field was more important to Northwestern than their in-class performance, saying, ""You fulfill the football requirement and, if you can, you fit in academics."" Asked why Northwestern gave him a scholarship of $75,000 a year, he responded: ""To play football. To perform an athletic service."" \n \n But Fitzgerald said he tells players academics come first, saying, ""We want them to be the best they can be ... to be a champion in life."" \n \n An attorney representing the university, Alex Barbour, noted Northwestern has one of the highest graduation rates for college football players in the nation, around 97 percent. Barbour insisted, ""Northwestern is not a football factory."" \n \n ___ \n \n Follow Michael Tarm at https://twitter.com/mtarm', 'HAVANA (AP) — The exchange of five Taliban detainees at Guantanamo for a U.S. Army soldier held captive in Afghanistan could set a precedent for a similar swap with Cuba, a Cuban intelligence agent who spent years imprisoned in the United States said Monday. \n \n Cuban intelligence agent Fernando Gonzalez, known as one of the ""Cuban Five,"" speaks during a press conference in Havana, Cuba, Monday, June 2, 2014.

Gonzalez who spent years in jail in the United States... (Associated Press) \n \n Fernando Gonzalez, who returned to the island in February after serving more than 15 years behind bars in the United States, said the deal to secure the release of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl has a clear parallel to the cases of Alan Gross, a civilian U.S. government subcontractor, and three Cuban agents still imprisoned in the United States. \n \n ""It is obvious that the only thing needed is the will on the part of the U.S. government to bring about that swap or exchange,"" Gonzalez said in his first news conference back in Havana. ""This latest development makes that clear."" \n \n U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Washington remains committed to winning release for any American citizens held overseas, but suggested that Gross\' case is not comparable to that of a uniformed soldier captured in a war zone. U.S. officials have publicly been cool to the idea of a swap involving the Cuban agents for Gross. \n \n ""Nothing has changed in that case now,"" Psaki said. \n \n Gross was arrested in Cuba in 2009 while working to set up hard-to-detect Internet networks for the island\'s tiny Jewish community as part of a U.S. government development contract. He says his actions posed no threat to the Cuban state. But Havana considers such programs to be an affront to its sovereignty, and he was sentenced to 15 years. \n \n Havana has said repeatedly it wants to sit down with Washington to negotiate the fate of Gross and the three members of the so-called Cuban Five who remain imprisoned in the United States. The agents were arrested in 1998 and convicted on charges including espionage, although Cuba argues that they were only keeping tabs on militant exile groups blamed for terror attacks on the island. \n \n ""On this side there is nothing standing in the way"" of an exchange, Gonzalez said. ""On this side we have transparently and with clarity shown an intention for this situation to be resolved and for humanitarian concerns to be taken into account on both sides."" \n \n Gross, a 65-year-old Maryland native, suffers from various health problems. His U.S. lawyer said in April that he is determined to go home within the next year, either alive or dead. \n \n Rene Gonzalez, who is not related to Fernando Gonzalez, was the first of the Cuban agents to walk free and returned to Cuba in 2013. Antonio Guerrero is the next one scheduled to be released, in 2017. \n \n The cases of Gross and the Cuban Five have been a major sticking point for Cold War foes Havana and Washington, which have not had formal relations for more than five decades. \n \n Bergdahl was released over the weekend after five years in Taliban captivity, stirring debate in Washington over whether the exchange could put other Americans at greater risk of being taken as bargaining chips. \n \n ___ \n \n AP diplomatic writer Matthew Lee in Washington contributed to this report. \n \n ___ \n \n Andrea Rodriguez on Twitter: www.twitter.com/ARodriguezAP', 'SINCE its first use in the 1980s -- a breakthrough dramatised in recent ITV series Code of a Killer -- DNA profiling has been a vital tool for forensic investigators. Now researchers at the University of Huddersfield have solved one of its few limitations by successfully testing a technique for distinguishing between the DNA -- or genetic fingerprint -- of identical twins. \n \n The probability of a DNA match between two unrelated individuals is about one in a billion. For two full siblings, the probability drops to one-in-10,000. But identical twins present exactly the same DNA profile as each other and this has created legal conundrums when it was not possible to tell which of the pair was guilty or innocent of a crime. This has led to prosecutions being dropped, rather than run the risk of convicting the wrong twin. \n \n Now Dr Graham Williams and his Forensic Genetics Research Group at the University of Huddersfield have developed a solution to the problem and published their findings in the journal Analytical Biochemistry. \n \n Previous methods have been proposed for distinguishing the DNA of twins. One is termed ""mutation analysis,"" where the whole genome of both twins is sequenced to identify mutations that might have occurred to one of them. \n \n ""If such a mutation is identified at a particular location in the twin, then that same particular mutation can be specifically searched for in the crime scene sample. However, this is very expensive and time-consuming and is unlikely to be paid for by cash-strapped police forces,"" according to Dr Williams, who has shown that a cheaper, quicker technique is available. \n \n It is based on the concept of DNA methylation, which is effectively the molecular mechanism that turns various genes on and off. \n \n As twins get older, the degree of difference between them grows as they are subjected to increasingly different environments. For example, one might take up smoking, or one might have a job outdoors and the other a desk job. This will cause changes in the methylation status of the DNA. \n \n In order to carry our speedy, inexpensive analysis of this, Dr Williams and his team propose a technique named ""high resolution melt curve analysis"" (HRMA). \n \n ""What HRMA does is to subject the DNA to increasingly high temperatures until the hydrogen bonds break, known as the melting temperature. The more hydrogen bonds that are present in the DNA, the higher the temperature required to melt them,"" explains Dr Williams. \n \n ""Consequently, if one DNA sequence is more methylated than the other, then the melting temperatures of the two samples will differ -- a difference that can be measured, and which will establish the difference between two identical twins."" \n \n HRMA has some limitations, acknowledges Dr Williams. For example young twins, or twins raised in highly similar environments may not have yet developed sufficient methylation differences. \n \n Also the technique requires a high sample quantity that might not be present at the crime scene. \n \n ""Nevertheless, we have demonstrated substantial progress towards a relatively cheap and quick test for differentiating between identical twins in forensic case work,"" says Dr Williams, who gives a detailed summary of the science behind the breakthrough at blog-site The Conversation.']",5,"– Northwestern football players aren't just student-athletes—they're employees of the university who have the right to form a union, a federal official ruled today.

68,"[""The focus would be helping students become more intelligent science consumers by learning how scientific work is done: how ideas are developed and tested, what counts as strong or weak evidence, and how insights from many disciplines fit together into a coherent picture of the world. \n \n Leaders of the effort said that teachers may well wind up covering fewer subjects, but digging more deeply into the ones they do cover. In some cases, traditional classes like biology and chemistry may disappear entirely from high schools, replaced by courses that use a case-study method to teach science in a more holistic way. \n \n In many respects, the standards are meant to do for science what a separate set of guidelines known as the Common Core is supposed to do for English and mathematics: impose and raise standards, with a focus on critical thinking and primary investigation. To date, 45 states and Washington have adopted the Common Core standards. \n \n “This is a huge deal,” said David L. Evans, the executive director of the National Science Teachers Association. “We depend on science in so many aspects of our lives. There’s a strong feeling that we need to help people understand the nature of science itself, as an intellectual pursuit.” \n \n The climate and evolution standards are just two aspects of a set of guidelines containing hundreds of new ideas on how to teach science. But they have already drawn hostile commentary from conservative groups critical of mainstream scientific thinking. \n \n For instance, as the standards were being drafted, a group called Citizens for Objective Public Education, which lists officers in Florida and Kansas, distributed a nine-page letter attacking them. It warned that the standards ignored evidence against evolution, promoted “secular humanism,” and threatened to “take away the right of parents to direct the religious education of their children.” \n \n In many states, extensive scientific instruction does not begin until high school. The guidelines call for injecting far more science into the middle grades, with climate change being one among many topics. In high school, students would learn in more detail about the human role in generating emissions that are altering the planetary climate. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n While thousands of schools in the United States already teach climate change to some degree, they are usually doing it voluntarily, and often in environmental studies classes. In many more schools, the subject does not come up because students are not offered those specialized courses, and state guidelines typically do not require that the issue be raised in traditional biology or chemistry classes. \n \n Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Inevitably, educators said, some states will do it better than others. \n \n The other states that helped draw up the guidelines were Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont, Washington and West Virginia. The organizations included the National Science Teachers Association, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the National Research Council and Achieve, a nonprofit education group that helped develop the earlier common standards in mathematics and English. Financing was provided by private foundations, including the Carnegie Corporation of New York, the Noyce Foundation and the Cisco Foundation, as well as DuPont. \n \n Outlining how the standards might change science classrooms, educators said they foresaw more use of real-world examples, like taking students to a farm or fish hatchery — perhaps repeatedly, over the course of years — to help them learn principles from biology, chemistry and physics. \n \n Educators want to introduce students to topics that can be made comprehensible only by drawing on the ideas and methods of many scientific disciplines, one of the reasons climate change and other large-scale environmental problems are seen as holding so much potential in the classroom. \n \n Some teachers are already ahead of the curve. \n \n Judith Luber-Narod, a high-school science teacher at the Abby Kelley Foster Charter Public School in Worcester, Mass., has incorporated climate change into her environmental studies classes, even though she teaches in a somewhat conservative area. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n “I hesitated a little bit talking about something controversial,” she said. “But then I thought, how can you teach the environment without talking about it?” \n \n Her students, on the other hand, love topics some deem controversial, she said. She devised an experiment in which she set up two terrariums with thermometers and then increased the level of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, in one of them. \n \n The students watched as that terrarium got several degrees hotter than the other. \n \n “I say to them, ‘I’m here to show you the evidence,’ ” she said. “ ‘If you want to believe the evidence when we’re done, that’s up to you.’ ”"", 'American school children will for the first time receive extensive lessons on climate change following the adoption on Tuesday of new science education guidelines. \n \n However, the final standards were substantially weakened from earlier drafts. \n \n The final guidelines cut by about a third the amount of time devoted to a subject seen as critical to future generations. \n \n They are also less explicit than earlier drafts about the human role as a driver for climate change. ""It\'s buried at best,"" said Mark McCaffrey, policy director for the National Center for Science Education. \n \n The new science teaching standards will introduce climate change as a core aspect of science education for middle and high school students \n \n in up to 40 states – in many for the first time. \n \n The guidelines were unveiled at a time when climate change has become \n \n a flashpoint for conservative groups, similar to the teaching of evolution in classrooms \n \n The Next Generation Science Standards are not mandatory. But scientists and educational experts in 26 states helped to develop them, and they will for the first time bring a degree of cohesion to the teaching of climate change, said Frank Niepold, co-chair of the climate education group at the US Global Change Research Program, \n \n who was involved in the three-year effort. \n \n ""In the current situation the state standards are all over the map. \n \n It\'s a hodgepodge,"" he said. ""We are still in a situation where across \n \n the country basically in every state students can still graduate from \n \n high school and in some cases go through college without learning the \n \n basics."" \n \n The mission of the new standards was to prepare a new generation of \n \n Americans for college and adulthood, said Matt Krehbeil, a consultant \n \n to the process. \n \n ""The NGSS aim to prepare students to be better decision makers about \n \n scientific and technical issues and to apply science to their daily \n \n lives,"" he said in a statement. \n \n However, the standards appeared considerably shorter than draft versions that had circulated in recent months. Unlike earlier drafts, the final standards do not propose teaching climate change until children are in middle school and high school. \n \n Mario Molina, deputy director at the Alliance for Climate Education, said the experts drafting the guidelines had cut 35% from the sections devoted to climate change, in response to public comments. He did not believe it was political, but was response to a need to compress a great deal of material. \n \n However, he said teachers will now need additional materials and clarifications to teach climate change in detail. \n \n Earlier versions had proposed introducing some aspects of climate change as early as kindergarten. \n \n The standards are also much vaguer about the causes of climate change. An earlier version for primary school students had said explicitly that human activity was a driver of climate change. ""It\'s not as explicit in terms of the connection between human activities and climate change,"" Molina said. \n \n McCaffrey agreed. ""They talk about climate just in a very general way,"" he said. ""At the third grade level they are not explicit that they are talking about human activities."" \n \n McCaffrey said the lack of clarity could be an opening for teachers to teach their own opinions in place of science, or resort to DVDs and other materials being pushed into classrooms by conservative groups that deny the existence of climate change. \n \n ""It opens the door for teaching a phony controversy,"" he said. \n \n The new guidelines also offered far less time for teaching about the physics involved in the greenhouse effect. Such knowledge was critical to ensuring students understand that greenhouse gases cause climate change, and that such emissions must be cut to prevent the worst effects of climate change. \n \n ""We are not seeing the students need to understand the greenhouse effect,"" he said. ""It was in the earlier version a year ago."" \n \n A spokesman for the Next Generation Science Standards refused to comment on the new guidelines, and hung up on the phone when asked about climate change. \n \n The new standards were released at a time when conservative groups in America are making a strong push to limit teaching of established climate science or inject fringe ideas on climate change into the curriculum. \n \n Some 18 states have considered ""academic freedom acts"" that would allow teachers to depart from established science and deny the existence of climate change – including seven this year alone. \n \n In Britain, meanwhile, draft guidelines released last month cut climate change off the curriculum for children under the age of 14. \n \n But it was hoped that the broad support from states and the involvement of so many experts from the National Research Council the National Science Teachers Association, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science, would defuse any political controversy attached to the teaching of climate change. \n \n ""Climate change is not a political issue and climate change is not a debate. It is science. It is strongly supported heavily research science, and our hope is that teachers will not see this as a political issue or a political debate,"" Molina said. \n \n He said the new standards will help guide teachers on teaching climate change. However, it was critical that science organisations offer support and resources to teachers who may not be as familiar with climate change as with other areas of science. \n \n ""There are existing materials out there – DVDS and stuff on YouTube and so forth – that are being used in classrooms to perpetuate confusion. A lot of teachers just don\'t have the background in science themselves. They may be hesitant and confused. That is why professional development is so vital,"" he said.', 'One of the largest heists in bitcoin history is happening right now. 96,000 bitcoins - that’s roughly £60m as of the time of writing - was taken from the accounts of customers, vendors and administrators of the Sheep Marketplace over the weekend. \n \n Sheep was one of the main sites that came to replace the Silk Road when it closed in October, but it too has now closed as a result of this theft. It’s a little hard to work out exactly what’s happened, but Sheep customers have been piecing it together on reddit’s r/sheepmarketplace. \n \n Here\'s what happened: someone (or some group) managed to fake the balances in peoples’ accounts on the site, showing that they had their bitcoins in their wallets when they’d actually been transferred out. Over the course of a week the whole site was drained, until the weekend when the site\'s administrators realised what was happening and shut everything down. \n \n Originally it was thought that only 5,200BTC - or £3m - was taken, with a message posted on Sheep\'s homepage blaming a vendor called ""EBOOK101"" for finding and exploiting a bug. However, over the weekend it became clear that the amount stolen was much, much larger. \n \n In a normal robbery that money would be gone by now, but it isn\'t. Bitcoin is pseudonymous, not anonymous, and bitcoins can’t just disappear. It works because each and every transaction is public and visible to each and every other person using the Bitcoin network, and a person is only as anonymous as their link to their wallet. \n \n A couple of reddit users realised that the sheer size of the heist makes “tumbling” the coins - the normal method of laundering bitcoins - impossible, as long as they kept on their toes. Someone with bitcoin can send some to a tumbler like bitcoinfog, where it will be split into smaller subdivisions and mixed with other bitcoins from other places, recombining and splitting again several times over until the whole amount eventually comes out the other end, theoretically in such a way that it’s impossible to track. Silk Road’s in-built tumbler successfully foiled the FBI, allegedly. \n \n However, reddit user TheNodManOut managed to track where the first bunch of transfers out of Sheep went, and from there and silkroadreloaded2 worked out which tumbler that the thief was using. Here’s how silkroadreloaded2 describes what’s happened since (“Tomas” is the alleged owner of Sheep, and one of the suspects for many users): \n \n All day, we\'ve been chasing the scoundrel with our stolen bitcoins through the blockchain. Around lunchtime (UK), I was chasing him across the roof of a moving train, (metaphorically). I was less than 20 minutes, or 2 blockchain confirmations, behind ""Tomas"". He was desperately creating new wallet addresses and moving his 49 retirement wallets through them, but having to wait for 3 or 4 confirmations each time before moving them again. Each time I caught up, I ""666""ed him - sent 0.00666 bitcoins to mess up his lovely round numbers like 4,000. Then,all of a sudden, decimal places started appearing, and fractions of bitcoins were jumping from wallet to wallet like grasshoppers on a hotplate without stopping for confirmations. Shit! He was tumbling our stolen bitcoins a second time, and a tumbler is unbeatable.... Unless you guess which one it is, nearly all the coins belong to the person you\'re tracking, jump in with him, and get jumbled up through the same wallets using the same algorithm. I was hopping from foot to foot shouting ""come on!"" at my laptop, waiting an age for 6 blockchain confirmations to get 0.5 btc into ""bitcoin fog"". My half a bitcoin got sliced and diced through loads of wallets and I followed the biggest chunk with blockchain.info - along with 96,000 stolen ones! \n \n Or, in other words: \n \n He gathered 96,000 in one pot, then split it into about 50 smaller ones. then he saw me 666ing them all. Imagine a sports stadium with 96,000 people in it, each with $1000. He sent them all via different routes all over the world, but the same 96,000 people then arrived at a different stadium and he went to bed. Now there are 96,001, and I just phoned you on my mobile to tell you where the stadium is. \n \n A major problem with tumblers is that they only work with lots of bitcoins coming and going from a lot of different sources - if a tumbler is taking in 96,000 bitcoins, those will massively outnumber all other bitcoins being tumbled and it’ll be easy to spot them coming out the other end. Mix in a little of your own with all those other ones and you\'ll find out the wallet addresses that the tumbler uses, and it should be easy to spot large transactions splitting off from there. \n \n The fascinating consequence of this is that you can see the stolen bitcoins on the public blockchain, and as long as there are people keeping tabs on it there’s going to be no way for the thief to cash in on their haul. Considering how people rely on tumblers to maintain anonymity when buying illegal stuff online, this unusual loophole is something of a revelation. \n \n Right now, as you’re reading this, you can watch as the the thief starts trying to move their bitcoins on again - it’s currently down to 92,000 bitcoins and dropping as smaller chunks begin going out. Selling those bitcoins and turning them into cash is going to be extremely difficult, as the major Bitcoin exchanges all demand proof of identity (specifically to avoid charges that they\'re involved in money laundering), and if they\'re broken down into smaller quantities to sell via a site like localbitcoins.com a paper trail will still be generated. As soon as it\'s possible to link one real-life bank account or identity to any bitcoins from that stash, it will be possible to work out their real-life identity. \n \n This counts as one of the largest robberies in history at Bitcoin\'s current market value, ranking in the same company as real-life thefts like the $108m diamond theft at the Harry Winston store in Paris in 2008. 96,000 bitcoins also places the thief as one of the wealthiest Bitcoin millionaires on the current rich list (but bear in mind that few serious Bitcoin players keep their currency in just one wallet) - and all without having to go to the trouble of wearing balaclavas or threatening someone with a gun. \n \n Let\'s watch and see what happens next.']",3,"– For the first time since 1996, educators have released major national guidelines for science in schools. The big news this time: They include a call for climate change education, potentially beginning in middle school, the New York Times reports. They also strongly urge schools to teach evolution. The Next Generation Science Standards, as they're known, are the result of collaboration between educators and 26 states. Though states don't have to follow the rules, 26 are ""seriously considering"" them, the Times notes. ""In the current situation the state standards are all over the map. It's a hodgepodge,"" an expert involved says. ""We are still in a situation where across the country, basically in every state, students can still graduate from high school and in some cases go through college without learning the basics."" Still, the completed guidelines are watered down from earlier drafts, the Guardian notes. The amount of material devoted to climate change has been cut by a third, and the final draft isn't as clear on human involvement in climate change: ""It's buried at best,"" says an education leader."

70,"['Truthfully, if it hadn’t been my paying job as a critic to watch Fede Alvarez’s remake of “Evil Dead’’ all the way to the end, I probably would have headed for the exit door long before the point where somebody cuts off her own arm with an electric carving knife. \n \n Of course, then I’d have missed another character being severed lengthwise with a chain saw while some members of the audience hooted in approval. \n \n Gorehounds will have a field day with the plentiful mutilations, decapitations and other blood-drenched moments in the redo. \n \n It amazingly sports an R rating, though it’s far grislier than Sam Raimi’s 1981 original (which was initially released without a rating but acquired an NC-17 for a 1995 re-release). \n \n The effects are also far more realistic than there were in the bargain-basement original from 32 years ago. \n \n Which means that instead of spoofing the excesses of that era’s slasher films, they’re basically being offered up for the delectation of contemporary moviegoers. \n \n While there were a couple of squeamish walkouts, many young men and women at the promotional screening I attended seemed to enjoy watching victims being shot at with nail guns, whacked on the head with crowbars or cutting off a piece of their face with a jagged piece of glass. \n \n Besides gallons of blood, there’s no small amount of urine, as well as a scene where a woman is raped by a plant. \n \n Acting is sort of besides the point in a movie like this, which has the performers spouting deliberately ridiculous dialogue and constantly risking their lives in ways that no sane person would. \n \n The setting is a remote cabin the woods — conveniently cut off by a flash flood — where a heroin-addicted young woman (Jane Levy) has been brought to try to go cold turkey. \n \n When she starts having delusions and warning everyone they won’t live through the night, they have to wonder if it’s a symptom of withdrawal or because the most dweebish guy (Lou Taylor Pucci) has started reading incantations from a mysterious old book he found. \n \n Also along for the gory, gory night are the junkie’s long-estranged brother (Shiloh Fernandez) and a student nurse (Jessica Lucas) whose skill at suturing wounds with duct tape comes in handy. \n \n Though it tries — with a much too heavy hand — the new “Evil Dead’’ is far less humorous than its predecessor, which catapulted director Raimi and star Bruce Campbell (who produced this one) into long mainstream careers. \n \n Which is not to say this “Evil Dead’’ reboot won’t also beget sequels.', 'The rare remake that likely will be enjoyed most by diehard fans of its predecessor, “Evil Dead” often comes off as the cinematic equivalent of a cover-band concert tribute to a supergroup’s greatest hits — albeit with a lot more gore. First-time feature helmer Fede Alvarez’s blood-soaked reprise of Sam Raimi’s franchise-spawning low-budget shocker, “The Evil Dead,” boasts far better production values than the penny-pinching 1981 original and conceivably could delight genre fans who have never seen the first version or its previous remakes/sequels. But it’s bound to play best with those who catch Alvarez’s many wink-wink allusions to Raimi’s pic. \n \n Working from a script he co-wrote with Rodo Sayagues, Alvarez briskly sets up his recycling of Raimi’s horror premise — five friends visit a secluded cabin in the woods where all hell breaks loose — with an aptly portentous prologue and backstory-heavy opening scenes. But Alvarez goes Raimi one better, by actually offering a logical reason why the characters don’t immediately vamoose once supernatural manifestations begin. \n \n Mia (Jane Levy), a drug-addicted young woman trying to go cold turkey, is undergoing physically and psychologically agonizing withdrawal, and her companions — including prodigal brother David (Shiloh Fernandez) and medically trained buddy Olivia (Jessica Lucas) — are loath to interrupt the recovery process. Besides, all those terrible things Mia claims to see are just hallucinations triggered by withdrawal, right? \n \n Wrong. \n \n Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci), the academically inclined member of the group, finds in the cabin a mysterious Book of the Dead filled with horrific illustrations, mysterious symbols and ample warnings not to read aloud anything that appears in its ancient pages. Unfortunately, Eric does not heed those admonitions, awakening a familiar demon for a new generation of young victims. Mia is the first to be infected by the monstrously malignant and singularly foul-mouthed bogeyman, but it doesn’t stop there, inspiring her cabin mates to damage themselves and each other in creatively gory ways. \n \n Alvarez repeatedly references plot elements and specific shots from Raimi’s original pic. Taking his cue from the original, he makes especially effective use of lenser Aaron Morton’s swooping, swirling camera movements, which suggest the POV of a rampaging poltergeist. But Alvarez’s tone is completely different, as the helmer rarely attempts to emulate the self-mocking, over-the-top campiness that distinguished the original “Evil Dead” from so many other cheapie creepies of the 1980s. \n \n Actor Bruce Campbell (who’s onboard here as a producer) more or less established himself as a cult figure back in the day with his inspired overplaying of Ash, the astonishingly resilient protagonist of Raimi’s original. In Alvarez’s version, Fernandez’s David serves the equivalent role, but he’s deadly serious. \n \n Indeed, the only character who even gets to crack a joke is Pucci’s Eric. Asked if he’s certain that actions described in the Book of the Dead will rid them of the troublesome spirit, the frantic fellow replies, “Am I sure? Of course not! It’s not a science book!” \n \n Levy is believably beastly as the possessed Mia, and manages the heavy lifting when her character must handle some last-act heroics. Other members of the cast do what they can with thinly written parts. For instance, it’s not really Elizabeth Blackmore’s fault that her role as David’s g.f. is so ill-defined and unimportant that some may forget she’s in the pic until she starts to make lethal use of a nail gun. \n \n The bloody mayhem is so graphic and frequent throughout “Evil Dead,” one cannot help suspecting that alternate takes had to be shot to ensure an R rating. The emphasis on dismemberment and disfigurement should make this must-see entertainment for gorehounds, but could literally scare off auds accustomed to less explicit, PG-13 fare. \n \n Ultimately, the new “Evil Dead” will rely heavily on existing fans of this unlikely franchise to make a killing in theatrical and homevid release. Those who get the inside jokes should be easy to spot: They’ll be the ones laughing when the onscreen carnage erupts most furiously. \n \n Evil Dead \n \n Reviewed at SXSW Film Festival (Headliners), March 8, 2013.

Mia (Jane Levy) is trying to kick a drug habit cold turkey, with the others (Shiloh Fernandez, Jessica Lucas, Lou Taylor Pucci, and Elizabeth Blackmore) along for support. \n \n PHOTOS: Scenes from \'Evil Dead\' \n \n After discovering a mysterious book, bound in human skin, they unleash a demonic force that wants them all dead and pits them against one another. \n \n The new film is produced by Raimi, Rob Tapert and Bruce Campbell (writer-director, producer and star of the 1981 movie, respectively) and nimbly walks the fine line of tribute, update and doing its own thing. \n \n What this ""Evil Dead"" gets most right is its tone, paying homage yet staking its own territory; it\'s scary without being downbeat, fun without being too jokey. Levy in particular is perfectly in sync with Alvarez\'s mix of sincerity, snark and scares. \n \n Alvarez certainly seems to have relished the chance to splatter and spray his cast with all manner of goo. His aesthetic is a few shades lighter than the gloomy grunge of other recent horror reinventions, and he never loses sight of the black comedy lurking in the story\'s corners. \n \n But back to the goo. There is plenty of over-the-top gore, great gushing geysers of it. Yet one of the most squirm-inducing moments — apart from the notorious, still difficult-to-justify ""tree rape"" scene — isn\'t from a Grand Guignol spurt of blood, but rather a relatively minor cut as a machete blade slices across the top of a bent knee. \n \n It\'s a sensation one can actually relate to, as opposed to something like the gruesome slapstick of slipping on a shorn-off piece of someone else\'s face. \n \n Respectfully aware of its origins — including a wait-for-it tag after the end credits — ""Evil Dead"" is something of a forward-looking throwback. It\'s unlikely the movie will gain the same ardent following as Raimi\'s debut, but it offers enough good-time gore, goofiness, scares and screams to leave an audience feeling a certain elated exhaustion. \n \n mark.olsen@latimes.com \n \n \'Evil Dead\' \n \n MPAA rating: R for strong bloody violence and gore, some sexual content and language \n \n Running time: 1 hour, 30 minutes \n \n Playing: In general release', 'The remake of “The Evil Dead,” Sam Raimi’s 1981 horror film about a cabin of cult curiosities, doesn’t have the original’s wooden performances, puffy clothes and hairdos or its amusingly crude special effects, but it does share its blood lust. Torrential and somewhat rust colored, the blood in the remake splish-splashes across the screen, spurts out of bodies, soaks into floors and falls from the sky like a biblical portent. If the rivers of red in Mr. Raimi’s movie flowed more like molasses than water, it’s because they were created with food dye and Karo syrup. \n \n The new “Evil Dead” has none of the first movie’s handmade charm or hilarity, intentional or otherwise. (It also lost its “The.”) The director, Fede Alvarez, approaches the creaky material with a surprisingly straight face and a fair amount of throat clearing. Unlike Mr. Raimi, who scarcely bothered with preliminaries, Mr. Alvarez sets the creepy mood with a sacrificial immolation and a basement strung with desiccated cats. When his five souls roll up to their cabin, he continues to keep his foot on the brake with some back story involving Mia (Jane Levy), her drug addiction and issues with her brother, David (Shiloh Fernandez.) \n \n Finally something wicked does come, racing and smashing through the surrounding forest, and Mr. Alvarez, making his feature directing debut, gets his gore on. Taking his cues as much from the Abstract Expressionists as from Mr. Raimi, Mr. Alvarez opens up the book of the dead (bound in human flesh and tied with barbed wire) and makes handy sport with an electric meat knife and a nail gun, among other convenient and preposterous household items. As the plot thickens and the viscera and limbs fly, his mood appreciably lightens, and at least one scene approaches the macabre comedy of the black knight scene in “Monty Python and the Holy Grail.” \n \n “The Evil Dead” enjoys the reputation of a cult classic, but its more lasting significance is as a cheapie do-it-yourself production that achieved indie success.

We want to see trade reforms. China is not delivering, OK?,” National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow said in a Bloomberg Television interview on Friday. “Their economy’s weak, their currency is weak, people are leaving the country. Don’t underestimate President Trump’s determination to follow through.” \n \n China also signaled on Friday it has no intention of retreating from a trade war. The government announced it has prepared a list of $60 billion worth of U.S. goods to hit with duties should the U.S. follow through on a plan to impose duties on an additional $200 billion of Chinese goods, as early as next month. The Chinese duties ranging from 5 percent to 25 percent will be levied on 5,207 kinds of American imports, the Ministry of Finance said in a statement on its website. \n \n The retaliation stands to further inflame tensions between the world’s two biggest economies. It echoes China’s response to the previous round of tariffs last month, when the U.S. and China imposed tariffs on $34 billion worth of each others’ goods. \n \n Another $16 billion in U.S. levies on Chinese goods will likely follow in the coming days or weeks, which Beijing has said it will retaliate against in-kind. \n \n These U.S. Products May Be Affected by China’s Proposed Tariffs \n \n In addition, Trump this week ordered officials to consider imposing a 25 percent tax on $200 billion worth of imported Chinese goods, up from an initial 10 percent rate. The move was intended to bring China back to the negotiating table for talks over U.S. demands for structural changes to the Chinese economy and a cut in the bilateral trade deficit. Friday’s retaliation from China suggests that tactic hasn’t worked. \n \n U.S. and Chinese officials have held “hardly any conversations” in the past month, but there’s “some hint” the Chinese may be warming to the idea of negotiations, Kudlow said. There’s recently been some communication at the highest levels, he told reporters outside the White House. \n \n Three rounds of trade negotiations between senior U.S. and Chinese officials earlier this year centered on U.S. demands for China to make structural changes to its economy and to reduce its trade surplus with America. On Friday, U.S. data showed the merchandise trade gap with China slightly widened in June to $32.5 billion after May’s $32 billion. \n \n Tariff Escalation \n \n The U.S. tariffs now in place or threatened add up to almost half of the value of goods it imported from China last year. The Chinese side seem to be seeking to match that ratio with the new proposals. \n \n Chinese authorities -- bracing for economic fallout -- have taken a range of measures in recent weeks to bolster the economy. On Friday officials stepped in to cushion the yuan, which has been battered by trade tensions and was approaching the key level of seven to the dollar. \n \n Read more: China steps in to support its currency \n \n The People’s Bank of China will impose a reserve requirement of 20 percent on some trading of foreign-exchange forward contracts, according to a statement on Friday evening. That will effectively make it more expensive to short the yuan, and is a tactic that the central bank used to stabilize the currency in the aftermath of its shock devaluation in 2015. \n \n Kudlow said the weaker yuan indicates that investors have questions about the strength of China’s economy, adding a lack of intervention to prop up the yuan is helping cushion the impact of the trade war for China. A weaker currency usually makes exports more competitive. \n \n “Some of the currency fall though, I think, is just money leaving China cause it’s a lousy investment and if that continues that will really damage the Chinese economy,” Kudlow said on Friday. \n \n China is trying to seek an “equal” position in future talks with the U.S. with Friday’s retaliation announcement, said Gai Xinzhe, analyst at the Bank of China’s Institute of International Finance in Beijing. “Any talks in the future, should they happen, should be conducted on an equal and faithful basis.” \n \n Beijing’s plans for tariffs on $60 billion of U.S. goods includes an additional 5 percent in duty on about 600 kinds of U.S. products including planes and computers; another 10 percent on almost 1,000 products including wigs and textiles; an extra 20 percent on more than 1,000 items including some chemicals, cookers and paper; and an additional 25 percent on over 2,400 products such as meat, wheat, wine and LNG. \n \n ""China’s differential tax rate countermeasures are rational and restrained,"" the Ministry of Commerce said in a separate statement on its website. ""The implementation date will be subject to the actions of the U.S., and China reserves the right to continue introducing other countermeasures."" \n \n — With assistance by Xiaoqing Pi, Yinan Zhao, Kevin Hamlin, Miao Han, and Jonathan Ferro']",5,"– Perhaps unsurprisingly, the remake of 1981's gore-fest Evil Dead is a love-it-or-hate-it affair.

72,"['WASHINGTON (AP) — Republicans muscled a balanced-budget plan through the Senate early Friday, positioning Congress for months of battling President Barack Obama over the GOP\'s goals of slicing spending and dismantling his health care law. \n \n FILE - Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Ky., accompanied by Sen. Mike Enzi, R-Wyo., speaks to reporters on Capitol Hill in Washington, in this March 24, 2015 file photo. Senators worked into... (Associated Press) \n \n Working into Friday\'s pre-dawn hours, senators approved the blueprint by a near party-line 52-46 vote, endorsing a measure that closely follows one the House passed Wednesday. Both budgets embody a conservative vision of shrinking projected federal deficits by more than $5 trillion over the coming decade, mostly by cutting health care and other benefit programs and without raising taxes. \n \n The Senate was beginning a spring recess after approving the measure, leaving Congress\' two GOP-run chambers to negotiate a compromise budget in mid-April. The legislation is a non-binding blueprint that does not require Obama\'s signature but lays the groundwork for future bills that seem destined for veto fights with the president. \n \n ""Republicans have shown that the Senate is under new management and delivering on the change and responsible government the American people expect,"" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. \n \n Democrats viewed the document differently, saying it relied on gimmickry and touted the wrong priorities. \n \n ""The budget we passed today is irresponsible and fails to effectively invest in our future,"" said Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md. \n \n The budget\'s solidly ideological tenor contrasted with a bipartisan bill the House overwhelmingly approved Thursday permanently blocking perennial cuts in physicians\' Medicare fees. It too will wait until April for final congressional approval by the Senate, with McConnell saying his chamber will handle it ""very quickly when we get back."" \n \n Though doctors face a 21 percent cut in Medicare fees April 1, the government can delay processing those payments until Congress\' return. The measure, which also provides money for health care programs for children and low-income people, would be partly financed with higher premiums for top-earning Medicare recipients. \n \n On the budget, only two Republicans voted no: Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Rand Paul of Kentucky, a pair of presidential hopefuls. Two other potential GOP presidential candidates, Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, voted yes. \n \n All voting Democrats were opposed. \n \n The Senate completed its budget work after enduring one of its more painful traditions: A multi-hour ""vote-a-rama"" in which senators repeatedly debate and vote on a pile of non-binding amendments well past midnight. Senators offer the amendments because the votes can demonstrate support for a policy or be used to embarrass opponents in future campaigns. \n \n Those approved included one by Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, entitling married same-sex couples to Social Security and veterans\' spousal benefits. It got 11 GOP votes, including from several Republicans facing competitive re-elections next year. \n \n Also adopted was one by McConnell aimed at thwarting Obama administration efforts to reduce coal pollution. \n \n Congress\' GOP budgets both matched the spending plan that Obama presented last month when it comes to defense, proposing $612 billion for next year, a 4.5 percent boost over current levels. Some conservatives were unhappy because they wanted more of the extra military spending to be offset with savings from elsewhere in the budget. \n \n But mostly, the Republican blueprints diverge starkly from Obama\'s fiscal plan. \n \n While his leaves a projected deficit exceeding $600 billion 10 years from now, the Senate plan claims a surplus of $3 billion. \n \n Over the decade, Obama would raise $2 trillion in higher taxes from the wealthy, corporations and smokers while granting tax breaks to low-income and middle-class families. He would boost spending on domestic programs including road construction, preschools and community colleges and veterans. \n \n The Senate budget would cut $4.3 trillion from benefit programs over the next 10 years, including annulling Obama\'s health care law, a step the president would without doubt veto. \n \n Those savings would include $431 billion from Medicare, matching Obama\'s figure. The House budget would pare $148 billion from the health care program for the elderly and convert it into a voucher-like program for future beneficiaries, a step the Senate shunned. \n \n The Senate budget would cut $236 billion from the budgets of nondefense agencies. The House would go even further, slicing $759 billion.', 'The U.S. Capitol building is seen before President Barack Obama arrives to deliver his State of the Union address to a joint session of the U.S. Congress on Capitol Hill in Washington, January 20, 2015. \n \n WASHINGTON The Senate passed a Republican-authored budget plan early on Friday that seeks $5.1 trillion in domestic spending cuts over 10 years while boosting military funding. \n \n The 52-46 vote on the non-binding budget resolution put Congress on a path to complete its first full budget in six years. It came at the end of a marathon 18-hour session that saw approval of dozens of amendments ranging from Iran sanctions to carbon emissions and immigration policies. \n \n Two Republican senators who are running or considering running for president, Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, voted against their party\'s budget plan, which is similar to one passed by House Republicans on Wednesday. \n \n In addition to aiming to eliminate deficits within 10 years, both documents seek to ease the path for a repeal or replacement of President Barack Obama\'s signature health care reform law. \n \n But differences between the two documents still need to be worked out and a combined budget passed next month by both chambers. Doing so would allow Republicans to invoke parliamentary rules to repeal ""Obamacare"" with a simple majority in the Senate rather than a tough-to-achieve 60 vote threshold. \n \n Under the convoluted U.S. spending process, the budgets do not become law, but influence government agency funding bills later in the year. They also showcase the fiscal vision for Republicans, who now control both Houses of Congress for the first time since 2006 and are eager to demonstrate their ability to govern. \n \n ""This balanced budget is an important first step to help Washington live within its means, just like hardworking families have to do every day,"" said Republican Senate Budget Chairman Mike Enzi. \n \n He added that once a final budget is passed lawmakers would begin to work to find alternate savings that would allow them to ease statutory budget caps on military and domestic programs. \n \n The Senate budget seeks to eliminate U.S. deficits by 2025 without raising taxes through deep cuts to social safety net programs, investments in transportation and education and other domestic programs. \n \n At the same time, it proposes to boost defense spending by adding about $38 billion to an off-budget war funding account, and offers core Pentagon budget increases in subsequent years. \n \n More than 50 non-binding amendments were considered on Thursday and Friday in an open ""vote-a-rama"" process that allowed senators to promote pet causes or try to force opposition members into votes that may be used in campaign ads. \n \n Republicans passed a symbolic roll-back of the Obama administration\'s carbon emissions rules for power plants, while a Democratic proposal to recognize climate change risks for the military won approval. \n \n Another Democratic amendment to let all Americans earn paid sick leave passed with a surprisingly strong 61 votes, with support from 14 Republicans. The Senate also voted unanimously to make it easier to reimpose sanctions if Iran violates any nuclear deal. \n \n (Reporting by David Lawder; Editing by Tom Heneghan)', 'Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n WASHINGTON — Around 8 p.m. Thursday, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the minority leader, called Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York into his office with news that would stun Washington the next morning: Mr. Reid planned to retire at the end of his term. \n \n Mr. Reid’s decision to contact Mr. Schumer first, before even President Obama, was another powerful reminder of what Senate Democrats have long known: Mr. Schumer — the flip-phone using, rumpled, relentless son of a Brooklyn exterminator — is the presumptive front-runner to lead the Senate Democrats when Mr. Reid is gone. \n \n In that moment, Mr. Schumer’s possibilities finally caught up with his ambition. \n \n Just hours after Mr. Reid announced his retirement, throwing the future of his caucus into flux, at least one thing was clear: The Democratic leader post that Mr. Schumer has long coveted is his to lose. \n \n Mr. Reid, demonstrating the steely will with which he has ruled his conference, worked aggressively to anoint Mr. Schumer, the No. 3 Democrat, as his successor shortly after beginning to tell people that he would not seek re-election, effectively edging out Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat. Mr. Durbin later said that he, too, would back Mr. Schumer. \n \n “He will be elected to replace me in 22 months,” Mr. Reid told Nevada Public Radio. “I think one reason that will happen is because I want him to be my replacement.” \n \n Mr. Schumer spent most of the day calling lawmakers to lock down their support for his leadership bid, which he officially announced Friday afternoon, saying in statement, “I am honored and humbled to have the support of so many of my colleagues and look forward to our Senate Democratic caucus continuing to fight for the middle class.” \n \n After more than three decades in Congress, Mr. Schumer, 64, has a reputation nationally as an institutional presence in the baroque Senate chamber and the green rooms of the Sunday talk shows. But his potential ascent to the top Democratic post also represents a boon for New York, where Mr. Schumer cut his teeth with his rapacious attention to local issues, one Sunday morning news conference at a time. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n New York has never produced a leader of the Senate, and it has been more than a century since a New Yorker was speaker of the House. \n \n “New York is very fortunate that we will have someone with his abilities and talents to help our state,” said former Senator Alfonse M. D’Amato, a Republican whom Mr. Schumer unseated in a contentious 1998 battle, but who now describes him as “a tiger” on Capitol Hill. “He will do exactly that — use that power and that clout.” \n \n Unlike the frequently endangered Mr. Reid — and the previous Democratic Senate leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota — Mr. Schumer, who was first elected to the House in 1980, has proved seemingly unbeatable on his home turf. He has not faced a competitive campaign since his first election to the Senate, as he has kept the state’s Democratic community united around him. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n That same indefatigable relationship building has also helped him in the Senate. Mr. Durbin and Mr. Schumer, who were once longtime roommates in Washington, have jockeyed for years behind the scenes, at times tensely, over who would replace Mr. Reid. Mr. Durbin plans to run again for the No. 2 position, and has Mr. Reid’s endorsement. \n \n Mr. Schumer, a master tactician and inveterate deal maker, ran the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee in 2006, when Democrats retook control of the Senate, and again in 2008, when they increased their majority. Mr. Schumer also earned the respect and trust of more moderate Democrats, who view him as someone eager to get things done and often call him when they have a concern or problem. \n \n Shortly after the 2014 midterm elections, when Democrats lost their majority, some Democrats who had chafed under Mr. Reid’s leadership urged Mr. Schumer to challenge Mr. Reid for minority leader. But Mr. Schumer quickly quashed the plan, out of “loyalty and friendship” to Mr. Reid, said someone close to Mr. Schumer, speaking anonymously to discuss a sensitive topic. \n \n Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the No. 4 Democrat, is also interested in remaining in her party’s leadership, though she is not actively campaigning for a specific post. \n \n While some progressive groups called for Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts to consider running, Democrats have mentioned Ms. Murray as the most likely senator to pose a possible challenge for Mr. Schumer. She ran the party’s Senate Campaign Committee in 2012, is well liked and respected by her colleagues, and has a natural base of support among her party’s 14 female members. \n \n Though the official vote is nearly two years away, after the 2016 elections, the Democratic leadership was eager for a smooth transition, and at least a tacit understanding of who will replace Mr. Reid. \n \n In New York, where Mr. Schumer’s prowess as a retail politician is often on display, his possible elevation was cause for instant celebration. \n \n “I don’t know when the last time was when we had someone in such a position,” said Representative Joseph Crowley of Queens, adding, “He’s going to be at the head of the table, and I think that’s something that we haven’t necessarily had.” \n \n In contrast with other prominent New York officials, including Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York, Mr. Schumer has never become a divisive figure, focusing insistently on the state’s economic interests and local concerns, rather than on ideological crusades. \n \n Mr. Crowley said Mr. Schumer has attended nearly every meeting of the state’s delegation, both in Washington and back home. When Mr. Crowley sought a House leadership post in 2012, he said he sought advice from Mr. Schumer, who helped rally the delegation behind him. \n \n Mr. Schumer has continued to work the state’s circuit of local parades and association dinners even as he has climbed the ranks of national leadership, making frequent visits to upstate cities, including Syracuse, Rochester and Buffalo. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n “When I get together with him, I can get through a list of 10 issues in 45 seconds,” said Mayor Stephanie A. Miner of Syracuse. “Between talking fast and talking on two or three flip-phones at any one time, he’s always extraordinarily responsive.” \n \n New York City politicians called Mr. Schumer an omnipresent force, regularly seen riding his bike around the city and showing up at swearing-in ceremonies for all manner of state and local officeholders. \n \n “He’s everywhere in the state and has been for a long time now,” said State Senator Daniel L. Squadron, a former aide to Mr. Schumer. \n \n Eric Adams, the Brooklyn borough president, said he encountered Mr. Schumer last week at a Lunar New Year event, where the senator received an omen of good luck: In a traditional ceremony, featuring costumed dancers dressed as lions, scattering vegetables in the crowd, a piece of lettuce landed on New York’s senior senator. \n \n “When he caught a piece, he said: ‘I guess I have good fortune coming my way,’ ” Mr. Adams recalled. “He should thank that lion.”', 'If Mitt Romney loses his run for the White House, a turning point will have been his decision Monday to absolve President Obama of raising taxes on the middle class. He is managing to turn the only possible silver lining in Chief Justice John Roberts\'s ObamaCare salvage operation—that the mandate to buy insurance or pay a penalty is really a tax—into a second political defeat. \n \n Appearing on MSNBC, close Romney adviser Eric Fehrnstrom was asked by host Chuck Todd if Mr. Romney ""agrees with the president"" and ""believes that you shouldn\'t call the tax penalty a tax, you should call it a penalty or a fee or a fine?"" \n \n ""That\'s correct,"" Mr. Fehrnstrom replied, before attempting some hapless spin suggesting that Mr. Obama must be ""held accountable"" for his own ""contradictory"" statements on whether it is a penalty or tax. Predictably, the Obama campaign and the media blew past Mr. Fehrnstrom\'s point, jumped on the tax-policy concession, and declared the health-care tax debate closed. \n \n Assistant editorial page editor James Freeman on the GOP\'s muddled message over whether the individual mandate constitutes a tax. Photo: Associated Press \n \n For conservative optimists who think Mr. Fehrnstrom misspoke or is merely dense, his tax absolution gift to Mr. Obama was confirmed by campaign spokeswoman Andrea Saul, who tried the same lame jujitsu spin. In any event, Mr. Fehrnstrom is part of the Boston coterie who are closest to Mr. Romney, and he wouldn\'t say such a thing without the candidate\'s approval. \n \n In a stroke, the Romney campaign contradicted Republicans throughout the country who had used the Chief Justice\'s opinion to declare accurately that Mr. Obama had raised taxes on the middle class. Three-quarters of those who will pay the mandate tax will make less than $120,000 a year, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The Romney high command has muddied the tax issue in a way that will help Mr. Obama\'s claims that he is merely taxing rich folks like Mr. Romney. And it has made it that much harder for Republicans to again turn ObamaCare into the winning issue it was in 2010. \n \n Why make such an unforced error? Because it fits with Mr. Romney\'s fear of being labeled a flip-flopper, as if that is worse than confusing voters about the tax and health-care issues. Mr. Romney favored the individual mandate as part of his reform in Massachusetts, and as we\'ve said from the beginning of his candidacy his failure to admit that mistake makes him less able to carry the anti-ObamaCare case to voters. \n \n Mr. Romney should use the Supreme Court opinion as an opening to say that now that the mandate is defined as a tax for the purposes of the law, he will work to repeal it. This would let Mr. Romney show voters that Mr. Obama\'s spending ambitions are so vast that they can\'t be financed solely by the wealthy but will inevitably hit the middle class. \n \n Democrats would point to the Massachusetts record, but Mr. Romney could reply that was before the Supreme Court had spoken, that he had promised Bay Staters not to raise taxes, and so now the right policy is to repeal the tax along with the rest of ObamaCare. The tragedy is that for the sake of not abandoning his faulty health-care legacy in Massachusetts, Mr. Romney is jeopardizing his chance at becoming President. \n \n Perhaps Mr. Romney is slowly figuring this out, because in a July 4 interview he stated himself that the penalty now is a ""tax"" after all. But he offered no elaboration, and so the campaign looks confused in addition to being politically dumb. \n \n This latest mistake is of a piece with the campaign\'s insular staff and strategy that are slowly squandering an historic opportunity. Mr. Obama is being hurt by an economic recovery that is weakening for the third time in three years. But Mr. Romney hasn\'t been able to take advantage, and if anything he is losing ground. \n \n The Romney campaign thinks it can play it safe and coast to the White House by saying the economy stinks and it\'s Mr. Obama\'s fault. We\'re on its email list and the main daily message from the campaign is that ""Obama isn\'t working."" Thanks, guys, but Americans already know that. What they want to hear from the challenger is some understanding of why the President\'s policies aren\'t working and how Mr. Romney\'s policies will do better. \n \n Meanwhile, the Obama campaign is assailing Mr. Romney as an out-of-touch rich man, and the rich man obliged by vacationing this week at his lake-side home with a jet-ski cameo. Team Obama is pounding him for Bain Capital, and until a recent ad in Ohio the Romney campaign has been slow to respond. \n \n Team Obama is now opening up a new assault on Mr. Romney as a job outsourcer with foreign bank accounts, and if the Boston boys let that one go unanswered, they ought to be fired for malpractice. \n \n *** \n \n All of these attacks were predictable, in particular because they go to the heart of Mr. Romney\'s main campaign theme—that he can create jobs as President because he is a successful businessman and manager. But candidates who live by biography typically lose by it. See President John Kerry. \n \n The biography that voters care about is their own, and they want to know how a candidate is going to improve their future. That means offering a larger economic narrative and vision than Mr. Romney has so far provided. It means pointing out the differences with specificity on higher taxes, government-run health care, punitive regulation, and the waste of politically-driven government spending. \n \n Mr. Romney promised Republicans he was the best man to make the case against President Obama, whom they desperately want to defeat. So far Mr. Romney is letting them down. \n \n Printed in The Wall Street Journal, page 9', 'A President Of the Peephole \n \n \n \n By Carl Sferrazza Anthony \n \n Special to The Washington Post \n \n Sunday, June 7, 1998 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n F earing revelations about his illicit affair with a young campaign volunteer \x96 which included sex in an Oval Office hideaway while under the guard of Secret Service agents \x96 the president realized that stonewalling was ultimately futile.

The scandals erupted at a time when technological advances in communication were feeding a nation hungry for distraction, and the economy was booming. Sex sold \x96 and the ravenous press corps was all too happy to name names and offer seamy details. The president and his wife boosted their public image by bringing Hollywood stars to the White House; they knew the value of glamour and the power of celebrity. It also helped that he was a genial populist and inveterate shaker of hands, fond of golf and cards, a man of the people. Ladies thought him virile and handsome; he photographed well. For some reason, all of this seems familiar. Whatever else may be said of Warren Gamaliel Harding \x96 whose tenure as 29th president ended with his peculiar, premature death in 1923 \x96 he was a truly modern politician. His administration, which reeked of corruption, offers a prototype for Washington scandals. Whitewater, Iran-contra and Watergate are better known today, but the granddaddy of them all was Teapot Dome, a political maelstrom that broke 75 years ago this month and is still hard to top in terms of sheer outrageousness. Harding, a small-town Ohio newspaper publisher, was uniquely unsuited for the job of president \x96 and he knew it. ""I am not fit for this office and never should have been here,"" he once said. But he ""looked like a president,"" as one major backer put it, and his wife, Florence, was instrumental in shepherding his political career. (The press considered Florence, known as the Duchess, to be the power behind the throne; one cartoon depicted the couple as ""The Chief Executive and Mr. Harding."") Harding, a one-term Republican senator, won the job by promising Americans a ""return to normalcy"" after World War I. Though his legacy was soiled, his domestic achievements were substantial: the 40-hour work week, improved health care for new mothers, the first balanced-budget bureau, a focus on technology. And we have to give Harding credit for establishing a venerable institution: the Washington gossip mill. Based on new documentation, here\'s a reprise of the Harding era. I love your back, I love your breasts \n \n Darling to feel, where my face rests, \n \n I love your skin, so soft and white, \n \n So dear to feel and sweet to bite. . . . \n \n I love your poise of perfect thighs, \n \n When they hold me in paradise. . . . \n \n \x97 A Harding poem to one of his mistresses, Carrie Phillips No president had more ""women scrapes,"" as his attorney general put it, than Warren G. His first affair, three years into his marriage to Florence, was with Susie Hodder \x96 his wife\'s best friend from childhood \x96 resulting in the birth of a daughter. His second affair was with Florence\'s closest adult friend, Carrie Fulton Phillips. It lasted 15 years. His third enduring mistress was his Senate aide, Grace Cross. Number four was the most infamous and the first presidential mistress to write a memoir: In the large Oval Office closet, the president had at least one tryst with Nan Britton, Britton went under covers with the president and wrote a memoir. (File Photo/Courtesy Library of Congress) \n \n a campaign volunteer who had started having sex with Harding when he was 51 and she was 22. Their assignations, facilitated by Secret Service agents James Sloan and Walter Ferguson (""Harding hated to have them around, for he despised being watched,"" reported the chief usher), came to an abrupt stop when another agent, Harry Barker, tipped Florence off, and she ran down for a confrontation. It was in Harding\'s Senate office, late one night in the winter of 1919, that Britton claimed she conceived their daughter, Elizabeth Ann. They disrobed because Harding wanted to ""visualize"" her while he worked there during the day. Britton worried that they lacked the ""usual paraphernalia which we always took to the hotels . . . and of course, the Senate Offices do not provide preventive facilities for use in such emergencies."" He had assorted other flings, including one with Rosa Hoyle, said to have conceived his only illegitimate son, and one with Augusta Cole, whose pregnancy by Harding was terminated. He bedded a Washington Post employee known as Miss Allicott, and former chorus girls Maize Haywood and Blossom Jones \x96 all procured by Harding\'s crony, Washington Post publisher and owner Ned McLean. And then there\'s the string of ""New York women"" \x96 including one who committed suicide after Harding wouldn\'t marry her, and another who had a stash of incriminating love letters purchased by Harding loyalists. The president even publicly ogled Margaret Gorman, the first Miss America, in Atlantic City, days after her crowning. Follow the Money Just weeks after his inauguration in 1921, Harding approved Interior Secretary Albert Fall\'s request to transfer oil reserves from the Navy Department to Fall\'s control. Fall then secretly leased the reserve at Elks Hills, Calif., to oilman Edward Doheny and the one at Teapot Dome, Wyo., to Harry Sinclair \x96 in exchange for a ""loan"" of cash and stock worth nearly $400,000, delivered in a small black satchel, and a ""gift"" of $100,000 from Doheny. Fall became the first Cabinet member to be thrown in prison. Col. Charles Forbes, the first director of the U.S. Veterans Bureau, created by Harding, was particularly close to the first lady. She saw to his appointment, and entrusted him with $450 million to build hospitals and provide decent medical care for the thousands of disabled veterans of World War I, on whose behalf the Duchess was a national activist. Instead, he bilked tens of thousands out of building contractors and medical supply companies. He was eventually imprisoned \x96 but not before Harding personally throttled him against the Red Room wall in the White House. Although Attorney General Harry Daugherty, a Harding crony and campaign manager, eluded conviction on a variety of pardon-selling and influence-peddling charges, his Justice Department was riddled with malfeasance, kickbacks and payoffs. One of the department\'s central tasks was to intimidate any Harding mistress who threatened the president with blackmail. High Officials Evalyn McLean, the Post publisher\'s wife, was a confidante of Mrs. Harding and an admitted intermittent morphine The president served liquor freely in the present-day Yellow Oval Room to his guests. addict. Despite Prohibition, she also was a heavy drinker and speakeasy regular \x96 but then, so were her husband and other ranking government officials: Albert Fall, Col. Forbes and the president\'s chief aide, George Christian. In the Veterans Bureau, stories eventually broke about flapper secretaries and young officers having a regular cocktail hour, with shakers and glasses at the ready, overseen by Forbes. The president served liquor freely in the present-day Yellow Oval Room to his guests. Alice Longworth \x96 a regular at poker \x96 recalled that the first lady mixed the drinks. ""No rumor could have exceeded the truth. . . . [T]rays with bottles containing every imaginable brand of whiskey stood about,"" she remembered. And, according to recently declassified FBI reports, Harding was drunk on whiskey during an Oval Office confrontation with railroad union leaders during their 1922 strike. At the center of the capital\'s most elite bootlegging service was Jess Smith \x96 who, even though never an employee or even a volunteer at the Justice Department, used official letterhead, cars and staff, and sat in on private meetings with FBI Director Billy Burns. Smith enjoyed these perks as the bachelor companion of the attorney general. Smith also served as the first lady\'s favorite escort and arbiter of her jaunty \'20s fashions. Through the Justice Department, Smith had access to whiskey supplies confiscated by Prohibition agents, and some of the booze went directly to the White House, and to the McLeans, while the rest was kept for parties at the ""Love Nest,"" the small house shared by Smith and Daugherty, complete with a pink taffeta bedroom. Hollywood Values Working closely with Republican National Committee Chairman Will Hays during the 1920 campaign, Florence Harding conceived of recruiting Hollywood movie stars to support her husband. Al Jolson was drafted to head the Harding-Coolidge Theatrical League, and on Aug. 24, 1920, the marriage of politics and entertainment was forged forever when Jolson brought 40 movie stars to the Harding home for a campaign rally. The White House became a little Hollywood. On any given day, D.W. Griffith, the Gish sisters or Tom Mix might pose for newsreel cameras with the Hardings. When Hays left his job as postmaster general to become president of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America, he developed a ""project to link the White House with the motion picture industry"" by providing a movie library. All of this was nothing short of immoral to old society. The religious press took even greater offense to Florence\'s ringing the stately halls with jazz for the first time. The Biblical Recorder excoriated the Hardings for ""setting a bad example by joining in the modern dance with its \'jazz\' music."" Squelching the Bimbos There was a good reason for Jess Smith having a vaguely defined association with the Justice Department. In this way, he was able to act at the implicit direction of the attorney general and FBI director and carry out a systematic intimidation of Harding mistresses who threatened to do as Carrie Phillips did and demand blackmail for their love Ned McLean ... did his utterly unethical best to destroy any anti-Harding efforts he heard about as publisher of The Post. letters. At one point, in exchange for apparently small amounts of money, affidavits disclaiming rumors of their liaisons were wrestled out of Evelyn Ruby, Augusta Cole and Cecilia Hoyle, and made their way to the first lady. In April 1921, Ned McLean officially became an agent of the FBI, and did his utterly unethical best to destroy any anti-Harding efforts he heard about as publisher of The Post. Such responsibilities included ripping the blouse of Nan Britton to try to snatch letters she claimed to be carrying \x96 in the privacy of his editorial office. Even on the eve of his inauguration, Harding was providing more trouble for his troubleshooters. He had arranged a late-night rendezvous with Grace Cross, his Senate aide, in a Willard Hotel room. Some of his friends, recalled Olive Clapper, a reporter\'s wife, ""ordered her to pack and get out of town, threatening to put the FBI on her trail if she didn\'t go at once. She was so frightened she left immediately."" Psychic Guidance Mrs. Harding\'s diary, discovered last year at an Ohio barn auction, revealed her to be a true believer in crystal ball readings, the zodiac and clairvoyance. In February 1920, as a Senate wife, she had her first consultation with capital society\'s seer, ""Madame Marcia."" The psychic predicted that if Harding ran for president that year, he would be nominated \x96 but that if he won the election, he would not live through his full term and instead die of ""sudden, peculiar, violent . . . death by poison."" Knowing that the blackmail price of $25,000 demanded by Carrie Phillips for the love letters could never be met unless her husband became a presidential nominee, Florence pushed him through the primaries on to the nomination, ignoring the ominous prediction. During the Harding presidency, Madame Marcia was regularly fetched by the first lady\'s Secret Service agent, brought through the back entrance and escorted to the presidential bedroom for zodiac updates. Madame Marcia also did horoscopes for the president\'s public appearances; the first lady was trying to protect him from numerous assassination and bomb threats. When Florence got early inklings of the Teapot Dome, Veteran\'s Bureau and Justice Department scandals, she asked Marcia to do astrological charts of Cabinet members \x96 and used the results as evidence to remove some of the crooks from the administration. Blackmailers\' Delight Newly discovered documents now prove that Harding was the only president successfully blackmailed by a mistress. Once he was nominated as the Republican candidate, the national GOP committee paid off Carrie Phillips\'s lump-sum demand of $25,000 and monthly stipend of $2,000, funneled through a secret bank account kept, apparently, under Jess Smith\'s name (the records were burned by Attorney General Daugherty). Once Harding became president, Phillips returned from an all-expense-paid trip abroad and demanded that her brother and son-in-law be given federal posts. It was done. Harding even circulated the name of Phillips\'s husband to be ambassador to Japan \x96 before word got out why he thought a dry-goods salesman from Marion, Ohio, deserved the post and the idea was quashed. One night, when he was a senator, Harding had such a row with aide Grace Cross that she cut his back and the police were called. Thereafter, Cross went around town talking about a ""birthmark"" on the president\'s back that she could identify \x96 undoubtedly the wound \x96 which became part of her arsenal in unsuccessful attempts to get blackmail money. However, former Democratic attorney general Mitchell Palmer would later use his knowledge of the Cross affair to force Harding to drop a Justice Department prosecution against him. Crossing a Friend After a failed attempt to frame Cross with a phony affidavit claiming she was a liar and blackmailer, Smith approached Bertha Martin \x96 a friend of Cross\'s \x96 to try to get possession of the aide\'s love letters from Harding. Martin said she would turn on her friend on the condition that she was given the job of society editor at The Post. Smith went to McLean, who gave his nod. Martin took Cross to lunch, asked to see the letters, snatched them away and bolted out of the restaurant. She was made society editor \x96 and still managed to stay friends with Cross, taking her on a European vacation, courtesy of the secret blackmail fund. Deadly Sins During a party at Smith and Daugherty\'s ""Love Nest,"" some New York chorus girls were brought down to entertain a stag party. In attendance was the president. When glasses and bottles were being flung off the table so the dancing girls could perform, one Washington prostitute, identified only as a Miss Walsh, was knocked unconscious. Harding was hustled out. The woman died and was buried in a potter\'s field. In recently discovered transcripts of her taped revelations, Evalyn McLean recalled that the FBI director ""railroaded"" the woman\'s brother into St. Elizabeths mental hospital when he suggested a blackmail payment. Censorship by Book Burning ""The Strange Death of President Harding,"" written in 1930 by the notorious perjurer and former FBI agent Gaston Means, implied that Florence Harding poisoned her husband in retaliation for his adultery, but the book has long been dismissed as a fabrication. New evidence shows that while Means lied in details, he told general truths. He said that he was part of an FBI effort to seize and destroy a small, privately printed book, ""The Illustrated Life of Warren Gamaliel Harding,"" that revealed Harding\'s affair with Carrie Phillips, the RNC blackmail payoff and Florence\'s out-of-wedlock child by a common-law first husband. This turned out to be the only book suppressed by the government in peacetime. The entire action was illegal, and thus the boxes of books and updated manuscript inserts were taken not to any government property but to the McLean estate, where they were all burned. Well, not all: An original with the author\'s notes sits with none other than Evalyn McLean\'s papers at the Library of Congress. Spying Among Gaston Means\'s other sensational charges was that he spied for the first lady on Nan Britton. In fact, it was probably Grace Cross \x96 for at least one letter sent to her from the president\'s office was purloined and found its way into the file on Cross in the McLeans\' private papers. Post reporter Vylla Poe Wilson later admitted that both ""Mrs. Harding and Mrs. McLean were very jealous women, and they hired Gaston Means to follow Harding and McLean and report on their actions."" In congressional hearings on the Justice Department, it was confirmed that Agent Means not only spied on Cross but the president\'s physician, Charles Sawyer, and his mistress, the first lady\'s housekeeper. Suicides Congress first heard tales of gross corruption at the Veterans Bureau in February 1923. Col. Forbes\'s colleague in kickbacks, Charles Cramer \x96 the bureau\'s chief counsel, and the purchaser of the Hardings\' Senate home \x96 wrote out a letter to the president in his dining room, then stood before the bathroom mirror and shot himself. The letter mysteriously disappeared. At the start of the summer, the first big Harding scandal broke with the news that Jess Smith was found in his room with his head in a trash can, and a bullet in his head. The official word went out that it was a suicide due to health and emotional problems. Bertha Martin of The Post recalled that it was ""noised about"" town that Smith was a known homosexual, and that he was heartbroken over Daugherty\'s sudden rejection of his friendship when the president learned of Smith\'s nefarious activities. Others, like Evalyn McLean, simply believed Daugherty, Means or Burns had Smith killed because he knew too much. As for Martin, after a second career bootlegging whiskey to embassies, she was found dressed in her fur coat, pearls and white gloves with her head on the gas range, another alleged suicide. Negligent Homicide? Beginning on June 20, 1923, the Hardings sought to escape the heat and scandal of Washington on a 15,000-mile transcontinental train trip and voyage to Alaska. The president was 57 at the time. The recently unsealed diary and notes of naval physician Joel Boone reveal Boone\'s grave concerns about the president\'s heart condition. The warnings were ignored by longtime Harding homeopath ""Doc"" Sawyer, who made no effort to stop Harding from speaking in the blistering heat, driving the golden spike to complete the Alaska Railroad, or doing other arduous tasks. In this Sawyer had the absolute approval of the first lady, who was now enjoying the height of her national popularity and didn\'t want the trip canceled. She viewed the incompetent Sawyer as her own Rasputin, who\'d miraculously kept a chronic kidney ailment from killing her. When Harding suffered a bout of food poisoning from tainted crab meat at Cordova, Alaska, Doc Sawyer ultimately weakened the president\'s sick heart by treating him with heavy doses of purgatives to flush out the toxins. On Aug. 2, 1923, when Boone was out of the sickroom in San Francisco\'s Palace Hotel, Sawyer plied one too many purgatives \x96 in Florence\'s presence \x96 and Harding died. There was a quick coverup regarding who was in the room and at precisely what time the president died. Mrs. Harding refused to permit an autopsy or a death mask, protecting her beloved Sawyer. ""Now that is all over,"" she told Evalyn McLean after Harding\'s death, ""I think it was all for the best."" Evidence Destruction At the McLean estate, aptly named Friendship, Evalyn permitted the widowed first lady to bring from the White House wood crates full of government documents (which may have been incriminating to Harding) and helped burn them. Even though Mrs. Harding was being spied on and her phone was tapped during the congressional investigations of the scandals, she was able to keep destroying documents within the privacy of her Willard Hotel suite. Four months after leaving Washington, Florence died at age 64 in Marion, Ohio. She was staying in a cottage on the grounds of the Sawyer Sanitarium ""for the treatment of nervous and mental diseases,"" amid signs that read: ""Please do not stare at the Patients.""

73,"[""NEW YORK (AP) — Colin Kroll, a tech executive who co-founded the HQ Trivia app, has died.

TMZ has learned. \n \n Law enforcement sources tell TMZ, Kroll\'s girlfriend called police early Sunday and asked them to check up on him after she was unable to get in touch. Cops went to downtown Manhattan to do a welfare check, entered his apartment and found Kroll\'s body in his bedroom with drug paraphernalia nearby. \n \n A police source tells TMZ at this point cops believe the drugs involved were cocaine and heroin. \n \n Kroll was named CEO of HQ Trivia in 2018. He had previously been fired from Twitter after he was determined to be a ""bad manager."" Female employees claimed his behavior made them uncomfortable, however, no sexual harassment claims were ever filed. \n \n HQ Trivia was having problems recently. It was steadily losing audience. In January, HQ was in the top 10 list of most downloaded iPhone games. It\'s now fluctuating between #250 and 500 in the U.S. Also, Kroll was dealing with an H.R. complaint by an HQ employee for his ""aggressive management style."" \n \n Kroll was also the co-founder of Vine and was General Manager between 2013 and 2014. And, he was the Chief Technology Officer for Jetsetter. Prior to that, Kroll served as the Engineering Manager at Yahoo between 2007 to 2009. \n \n Kroll was 34. \n \n RIP', 'HQ could use another win. \n \n The company behind HQ Trivia, the once-viral game-show app created by the same guys who invented Vine, is facing a pivotal moment. \n \n HQ is preparing to launch a new game show, one that it hopes will legitimize its place as a rising player in the world of mobile entertainment. But it’s also dealing with some serious issues, including a declining audience for HQ Trivia and the aftermath of a dramatic change of CEOs. \n \n Publicly, it’s clear that HQ Trivia’s viral ride is over. The app, where users can win cash prizes for correctly answering trivia questions presented live by a wacky host, captured the internet’s attention late last year. Some saw it as the future of media, and HQ Trivia spent much of January and February in the Top 10 list of most-downloaded free iPhone games. It’s now fluctuating between No. 250 and No. 500 on that list in the U.S. The audiences it pulls for its trivia shows, while still in the hundreds of thousands, are a fraction of what they were earlier this year. \n \n Privately, HQ is going through different growing pains. The company recently forced out its CEO, replacing one co-founder with another following a contentious boardroom battle between the two, Recode has learned. \n \n Adding to the drama is the fact that an HQ employee filed a formal complaint to HR in August against new CEO Colin Kroll for his aggressive management style, according to multiple sources. The alleged behavior was not sexual, these sources said, but was elevated to HQ’s board of directors. \n \n HQ’s board was made aware of the complaint before Kroll was appointed CEO, but felt comfortable promoting him after an outside investigator looked into the alleged behavior. \n \n Recode reached out to HQ and Kroll with our reporting. A company spokesperson sent the following statement: \n \n A complaint was filed during the course of the leadership transition. We initiated an external investigation through a 3rd party to vet the complaint, and that investigation yielded no concerns. We take pride in our company culture and strive to create an environment where everyone feels safe, respected and valued. \n \n It’s been a lot of drama for a young company, and all of it comes at an important time. HQ recently announced its second game show, a “Wheel of Fortune”-style game for smartphones called “Words,” and many close to the company believe this new game needs to be a hit. \n \n HQ expects to do more than $10 million in revenue this year, according to sources, but has also taken millions in venture funding and has a $100 million valuation. The belief is that HQ can’t survive on one trivia show alone — not if it wants to become a legitimate media business and live up to its outsized expectations. \n \n Whether that one hit, HQ Trivia, is still a success depends on how you look at it. HQ Trivia used to draw more than a million players per contest and had more than two million for some of its largest games with the biggest prizes. \n \n A large part of that audience has vanished. A recent Sunday night contest with a $25,000 prize drew 580,000 players. Last Sunday, a Disney-themed contest drew a more sizable 818,000 players, but mid-week shows have been in the 200,000 to 400,000 player range. \n \n On the other hand, HQ Trivia makes enough in sponsorship deals and in-app purchases — users can buy “extra lives” in case they get a question wrong — that the show pays for itself, according to multiple sources. HQ’s user numbers are similar to the audience size that some cable networks pull in for Sunday night prime-time windows. Disney Channel, for example, averages 836,000 viewers in Sunday night primetime, according to Nielsen. \n \n The reality, though, is that Disney maintains this audience for a three-hour window. HQ gets it for just a few minutes. HQ needs to find a second act. \n \n “HQ commands the largest live audience on mobile daily,” a company spokesperson told Recode. “We’re excited to introduce new interactive shows that will continue to engage and entertain them in new ways.” \n \n HQ co-founder and recently replaced CEO Rus Yusupov was more blunt on Twitter. “Games are a hits business and don’t grow exponentially forever,” he admitted in a tweet in August. “More soon!” \n \n As HQ’s prominence has died down, disagreements between its founders and investors have started to increase. \n \n Over the summer, HQ’s small board of directors started discussing the idea of replacing then-CEO Yusupov. HQ Trivia’s audience was declining, and some believed that Yusupov wasn’t executing fast enough on the company’s product roadmap. \n \n Instead of spending time and money developing new trivia game shows, Yusupov, who is design- and content-focused, was blowing out the production for HQ’s flagship game show with big prizes and celebrity guests, these sources say. HQ has launched a U.K. version and a sports-themed spinoff of HQ Trivia, but the plan for some time has been to create even more themed spinoffs and other games outside of the HQ Trivia format. \n \n In August, Kroll and Lightspeed’s Jeremy Liew, an early investor who is on HQ’s board, decided that Kroll should take over as CEO. The company’s two founders had at times been at odds with how to manage HQ’s operations, like how and where to invest company money, according to multiple sources. Kroll was also HQ’s “technical” co-founder — the engineer who some believed could better execute in getting the company up and running as a platform for hosting and launching multiple shows. \n \n Those differences, plus the decline in HQ’s audience, were enough to convince the majority of the board that a change needed to be made. \n \n HQ’s only other board member, Founders Fund’s Cyan Banister, refused to get involved, sources say. Founders Fund operates under a strict founder-friendly code, boasting on its website that “Founders Fund has never removed a single founder.” Banister viewed a vote in favor of one of HQ’s founders as a vote against the other. \n \n She technically gave up her board seat, and thus her vote, to avoid the conflict. She is now a board observer, according to multiple sources, and it’s unclear if she will rejoin the board at a later date. \n \n It was a two-against-one decision: Kroll and Liew on one side, Yusupov on the other. Yusupov was out as CEO and Kroll was in. \n \n Then came the complaint. Shortly after a decision to swap CEOs had been made — but had not yet been formally voted on by the board — an HQ employee filed a formal complaint with HR against Kroll for what was described by one source as “inappropriate and unprofessional” management behavior. The complaint includes allegations that Kroll used aggressive language in the office, according to two sources. \n \n The complaint was elevated to HQ’s board of directors and set off alarms, given Kroll’s past. He was previously fired from Twitter for poor management, and his behavior toward some female colleagues during his time at Twitter made some people uncomfortable. Word about that behavior started making the rounds in Silicon Valley last year while HQ was trying to raise a new funding round and prompted some investors to pass on an investment, Recode reported at the time. Kroll has since apologized. \n \n An outside investigator hired by the board looked into the new complaint and found that Kroll’s behavior “yielded no concerns,” according to the company’s statement. The board of three then voted unanimously to appoint Kroll as CEO. \n \n In an email announcing the change to company investors, Yusupov, who is now HQ’s chief creative officer, said that he “stepped down”; he characterized the move as “just an evolution of our partnership as we grow as entrepreneurs and leaders.” In reality, Yusupov was upset. He technically voted for the change, but only after seeing the writing on the wall. He wasn’t happy to lose his job running the company, according to multiple sources. \n \n Games are a hits business and don’t grow exponentially forever. HQ has massive early traction and still millions playing daily. Also developing new game formats, one of which we think is really special and complements Trivia nicely. More soon! Until then thanks for playing https://t.co/wnAcztBuJU — Rus (@rus) August 14, 2018 \n \n That saga was the latest in what has been a long history for HQ’s founding team. Yusupov and Kroll have worked together for years, mostly on mobile video projects. They’ve had a lot of success. They co-founded the looping video app Vine, which they sold to Twitter for millions in 2012. It was a cultural force in helping spur a new wave of internet celebrities before it was ultimately shut down in 2016. \n \n The duo started another company together in 2016 called Intermedia Labs, which is the parent company of HQ Trivia. Their first few mobile video apps never took off, but HQ was a quick hit. After launching in August of 2017, HQ routinely pulled in more than one million viewers per game, sometimes twice per day. \n \n About six months after launch, HQ was attracting interest from major advertisers like Nike and celebrity guest hosts like Jimmy Kimmel and The Rock. The show’s regular host, Scott Rogowsky, became such a wild internet star that he generated Justin Bieber-like hysteria when he spoke at an event for Jewish teens and community leaders early this year. \n \n But the relationship between Yusupov and Kroll hasn’t always been smooth. Yusupov was unaware of the extent of Kroll’s issues at Twitter, according to multiple sources, and it created a “rough patch” for the co-founders earlier this year when that behavior was affecting the company’s fundraising efforts. Then, of course, Kroll replaced Yusupov at HQ. \n \n Despite all this, those close to him believe that Yusupov will stay at HQ and help build out the production of the company’s new shows. \n \n But questions remain. \n \n Can Kroll succeed as CEO? He was fired from Twitter for what he himself described as “poor management,” and now there’s the formal complaint from an employee at HQ. Kroll and Yusupov are both working with an executive coach, according to multiple sources, which is not uncommon for business executives. But their prior management experience was one of the reasons investors were wary of investing in HQ. Employee complaints don’t alleviate those concerns. \n \n Then there is the business itself. The company has multiple game shows in the works, according to a source, including ideas centered around comedy and shopping. Is HQ capable of creating another hit show?

He was 35, the AP reports. The New York Police Department says officers went to Kroll's Manhattan apartment early Sunday after getting a call asking for a wellness check on him. They found him unconscious and unresponsive on his bed. He was pronounced dead at the scene. TMZ says he ""died of an apparent drug overdose,"" but the medical examiner's office will determine cause of death. Kroll was the chief executive of the trivia app, which live-streams short trivia shows to users and became popular after its release in 2017. He also was a founder of Vine, which was an app built around six-second videos, and worked for a period at Twitter. But Vine was scuttled four years after Twitter bought it in 2012, and HQ Trivia had fallen in popularity, falling from iTunes' list of 100 free games, per CNN. What's more, Intermedia Labs—a business he co-founded that created HQ Trivia—was said to be in disorder. Kroll recently ousted co-founder Rus Yusupov and engaged in behavior that one source told Re/Code was ""inappropriate and unprofessional."" Kroll had been fired from Twitter for poor managerial skills, and had a reputation for behaving poorly with some female colleagues—although a Kroll probe by an outside investigator ""yielded no concerns,"" the company said."
74,"[""Americans as a whole don’t exercise enough—at least that’s what the latest studies show—and so the message is clear: get more active, take walks, Let’s Move! Basically anything is better than sitting on the couch. But how much exercise is enough? That’s a hotly debated question for which experts still don’t have a satisfactory answer. But given that most of us are starting from a sedentary position, the assumption has long been the more the better. \n \n But in a report published Monday in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology researchers from Denmark say that people who push their bodies too hard may essentially undo the benefit of exercise. Those who ran at a fast pace more than four hours a week for more than three days a week had about the same risk of dying during the study’s 12-year follow up as those who were sedentary and hardly exercised at all. The link held even after the researchers accounted for potentially confounding factors such as age, sex, whether the participants had a history of heart disease or diabetes, or whether they smoked and drank alcohol. \n \n MORE This Is How Much Exercise Experts Really Think You Need \n \n In fact, those with the lowest risk of dying during the study period were people who ran less than three times a week for one to 2.4 hours, at a slow to moderate pace. Even people who ran slightly more, for 2.5 hours to four hours a week at an average pace less than three times a week, showed slightly higher mortality risk, at 66%, something that came as a surprise to the authors. \n \n See the 10 Healthiest Cities to Live in America Colin Anderson—Blend Images/Corbis Getty Images Matt Hogan/www.mphoganphoto.com Jim Wilson—The New York Times/Redux Getty Images Celin Serbo—Aurora Photos/Corbis Misty Keasler—Redux for TIME Getty Images K.C. Cohen—Courtesy of Boston Children's Hospital Getty Images 1 of 10 Advertisement \n \n “I would expect the light joggers to have really low risk,” says Jacob Marott, a researcher at the Copenhagen City Heart Study at Frederiksberg Hospital and one of the study’s co-authors. “But regarding the moderate joggers, I was a little surprised they didn’t have a bigger benefit from jogging than the light joggers. It made me think that if it’s really true, then exercise recommendations should take that into account.” \n \n MORE It Doesn’t Matter How Much You Exercise If You Also Do This \n \n What Marott and his team found was that both too little running and too much running are linked to higher rates of death. The most intense runners ended up with a risk of dying that was similar to that of those who opted to stay on the couch. Somewhere in between is the Goldilocks amount that’s just right to maintain heart health, burn off excess calories and keep blood sugar levels under control. And according to his results, that sweet spot is closer to the ‘less’ side of the curve than the ‘more’ side. \n \n That dovetails with the mounting research that so-called micro-workouts—high intensity but brief workouts that could be as short at 1 minute, according to another recent paper—may be better for the body than long and continuous workouts. \n \n That still means that some exercise is better than no exercise, but scientists may be getting more sophisticated about understanding that more isn’t always better, and that there may be a tipping point at which the harms of running start to outweighed its benefits. \n \n Those negative effects might include things like changes in the structure and function of the heart and its vessels; previous studies showed that marathoners and long distance cyclists, for example, tend to be at higher risk of developing abnormal heart rhythms, and may be more vulnerable to enlarged hearts, which are less efficient at pumping blood and delivering oxygen and removing waste than normal-sized organs. \n \n MORE Short Bursts of Exercise Are Better Than Exercising Nonstop \n \n Marott acknowledges that it’s also possible that some other behaviors or factors common to avid runners, such as their exposure to the sun, which can increase their risk of skin cancer, might be explaining their higher risk of dying during the study. Other studies will have to investigate whether that’s the case, but in the meantime, Marott says “if you want to do something good for yourself, you don’t have to be extreme. Jogging one to four hours a week for no more than three days a week at a slow to moderate pace is actually achievable. And that’s a positive take-home message.” \n \n Read next: 7 Reasons Why You’re Working Out and Still Not Losing Weight \n \n The Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

Logical, detail-oriented and analytical? That\'s left-brained behavior. Creative, thoughtful and subjective? Your brain\'s right side functions stronger -- or so long-held assumptions suggest. \n \n But newly released research findings from University of Utah neuroscientists assert that there is no evidence within brain imaging that indicates some people are right-brained or left-brained. \n \n For years in popular culture, the terms left-brained and right-brained have come to refer to personality types, with an assumption that some people use the right side of their brain more, while some use the left side more. \n \n Following a two-year study, University of Utah researchers have debunked that myth through identifying specific networks in the left and right brain that process lateralized functions. Lateralization of brain function means that there are certain mental processes that are mainly specialized to one of the brain\'s left or right hemispheres. During the course of the study, researchers analyzed resting brain scans of 1,011 people between the ages of seven and 29. In each person, they studied functional lateralization of the brain measured for thousands of brain regions -- finding no relationship that individuals preferentially use their left -brain network or right- brain network more often. \n \n ""It\'s absolutely true that some brain functions occur in one or the other side of the brain. Language tends to be on the left, attention more on the right. But people don\'t tend to have a stronger left- or right-sided brain network. It seems to be determined more connection by connection, "" said Jeff Anderson, M.D., Ph.D., lead author of the study, which is formally titled ""An Evaluation of the Left-Brain vs. Right-Brain Hypothesis with Resting State Functional Connectivity Magnetic Resonance Imaging."" It is published in the journal PLOS ONE this month. \n \n Researchers obtained brain scans for the population they studied from a database called INDI, the International Neuroimaging Data-Sharing Initiative. The participants\' scans were taken during a functional connectivity MRI analysis, meaning a participant laid in a scanner for 5 to 10 minutes while their resting brain activity was analyzed. \n \n By viewing brain activity, scientists can correlate brain activity in one region of the brain compared to another. In the study, researchers broke up the brain into 7,000 regions and examined which regions of the brain were more lateralized. They looked for connections -- or all of the possible combinations of brain regions -- and added up the number of connections for each brain region that was left- lateralized or right-lateralized. They discovered patterns in brain imaging for why a brain connection might be strongly left- or right-lateralized, said Jared Nielsen, a graduate student in neuroscience who carried out the study as part of his coursework. \n \n ""If you have a connection that is strongly left- lateralized, it relates to other strongly lateralized connection only if both sets of connections have a brain region in common,"" said Nielsen. \n \n Results of the study are groundbreaking, as they may change the way people think about the old right-brain versus left-brain theory, he said. \n \n ""Everyone should understand the personality types associated with the terminology \'left-brained\' and \'right-brained\' and how they relate to him or her personally; however, we just don\'t see patterns where the whole left-brain network is more connected or the whole right-brain network is more connected in some people. It may be that personality types have nothing to do with one hemisphere being more active, stronger, or more connected,"" said Nielsen.']",2,"– It's common knowledge that a healthy person shouldn't sit around all day, but new research on running is emphasizing the opposite danger. Running too much can be just as bad for you as being sedentary, the study suggests. Researchers tracked some 1,100 healthy runners and 413 sedentary folks over a period of more than 12 years, HealthDay reports via Medical Xpress. People ranged in age from 20 to 95. The risk of dying during the study turned out to be approximately the same among heavy runners—those who ran quickly more than three days a week for a total of more than four hours—and sedentary people who rarely exercised, Time reports. The best plan, according to the study, was to run lightly: The group that had the best results ran at a slow-ish pace (about 5mph) less than three times each week, going for an hour to 2.4 hours total. Even a group that ran a bit more often and longer saw a slight increase in death risk, Time notes. The findings could perhaps relate to cardiovascular problems previously observed in the most die-hard runners and cyclists. ""If you want to do something good for yourself, you don’t have to be extreme,"" says a study author. But another researcher points to a number of possible flaws in the findings, including the fact that the hardest-running group was quite small.

However, sometimes we want to share quick information about WS to people we meet and video might not be feasible. Below is a quick explanation of Williams syndrome which is often just enough to share with friends in the community. You are encouraged to download and share electronically or print (it is business card size and can be easily carried for reference and/or distribution.) \n \n Full-size image here \n \n An easy way to print in quantity can be found on Avery Design and Print (click here). \n \n Williams syndrome (WS) is a genetic condition that is present at birth and can affect anyone. It is characterized by medical problems, including cardiovascular disease, developmental delays, and learning challenges. These often occur side by side with striking verbal abilities, highly social personalities and an affinity for music. \n \n Williams syndrome is caused by the spontaneous deletion of 26-28 genes on chromosome #7. The deletion occurs in either the egg or the sperm used to form the child with Williams syndrome. Accordingly, the deletion is present at the time of conception. It is likely that the elastin gene deletion accounts for many of the physical features of Williams syndrome. Some medical and developmental problems are probably caused by deletions of additional genetic material near the elastin gene on chromosome #7. The extent of these deletions may vary among individuals. In most families, the child with Williams syndrome is the only one to have the condition in his or her entire extended family. However, the individual with Williams syndrome has a 50% chance of passing the disorder on to each of his or her children. \n \n WS affects 1 in 10,000 people worldwide – an estimated 20,000 to 30,000 people in the United States. It is known to occur equally in both males and females and in every culture. \n \n Children with Williams syndrome tend to be social, friendly and endearing. Parents often say the joy and perspective a child with WS brings into their lives had been unimaginable. \n \n But there are major struggles as well. Many babies have life-threatening cardiovascular problems. Children with WS need costly and ongoing medical care and early interventions (such as speech or occupational therapy) that may not be covered by insurance or state funding. As they grow, they struggle with things like spatial relations, numbers, and abstract reasoning, which can make daily tasks a challenge. As adults, most people with Williams syndrome will need supportive housing to live to their fullest potential. Many adults with WS contribute to their communities as volunteers or paid employees; often working at assisted living homes for senior citizens, hospitals and libraries, or as store greeters or veterinary aides. \n \n Just as important are opportunities for social interaction. As people with Williams syndrome mature – beyond the structure of school and family activities – they often experience intense isolation which can lead to depression. They are extremely sociable and experience the normal need to connect with others; however people with Williams syndrome often don’t process nuanced social cues and this makes it difficult to form lasting relationships. \n \n There are many physical features and medical challenges which are fairly common to Williams syndrome. However, every child is an individual - the number of features present, and which features are present varies from child to child. \n \n Common features of Williams syndrome include: \n \n Characteristic facial appearance \n \n Most young children with Williams syndrome are described as having similar facial features. These features include a small upturned nose, long philtrum (upper lip length), wide mouth, full lips, small chin, and puffiness around the eyes. Blue and green-eyed children with Williams syndrome can have a prominent ""starburst"" or white lacy pattern on their iris. Facial features become more apparent with age. \n \n Heart and blood vessel problems \n \n The majority of individuals with Williams syndrome have some type of heart or blood vessel problem. Typically, there is narrowing in the aorta producing supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS), or narrowing in the pulmonary arteries. There is a broad range in the degree of narrowing, ranging from trivial to severe (requiring surgical correction of the defect). Since there is an increased risk for development of blood vessel narrowing or high blood pressure over time, periodic monitoring of cardiac status is necessary. \n \n Hypercalcemia (elevated blood calcium levels) \n \n Some young children with Williams syndrome have elevations in their blood calcium level. The true frequency and cause of this problem is unknown. When hypercalcemia is present, it can cause extreme irritability or ""colic-like"" symptoms. Occasionally, dietary or medical treatment is needed. In most cases, the problem resolves on its own during childhood, but lifelong abnormality in calcium or Vitamin D metabolism may exist and should be monitored. \n \n Low birth-weight / slow weight gain \n \n Most children with Williams syndrome have a slightly lower birth-weight than their brothers or sisters. Slow weight gain, especially during the first several years of life, is also a common problem and many children are diagnosed as ""failure to thrive"". Adult stature is smaller than average \n \n Feeding difficulty (generally limited to the early years) \n \n Many infants and young children have feeding problems. These problems have been linked to low muscle tone, severe gag reflex, poor suck/swallow, tactile defensiveness etc. Feeding difficulties tend to resolve as the children get older. \n \n Irritability (colic during infancy) \n \n Many infants with Williams syndrome have an extended period of colic or irritability. This typically lasts from 4 to 10 months of age, then resolves. Abnormal sleep patterns with delayed acquisition of sleeping through the night may be associated with the colic. Extreme irritability may also be caused by hypercalcemia in some children with WS. \n \n Dental abnormalities \n \n Slightly small, widely spaced teeth are common in children with Williams syndrome. They also may have a variety of abnormalities of occlusion (bite), tooth shape or appearance. Most of these dental changes are readily amenable to orthodontic correction. \n \n Kidney abnormalities \n \n There is a slightly increased frequency of problems with kidney structure and/or function. \n \n Hernias \n \n Inguinal (groin) and umbilical hernias are more common in Williams syndrome than in the general population. \n \n Hyperacusis (sensitive hearing) \n \n Children with Williams syndrome often have more sensitive hearing than other children; certain frequencies or noise levels can be painful and/or startling to the individual. This condition often improves with age. \n \n Musculoskeletal problems \n \n Young children with Williams syndrome often have low muscle tone and joint laxity. As the children get older, joint stiffness (contractures) may develop. Physical therapy is very helpful in improving muscle tone, strength and joint range of motion. \n \n Overly friendly (excessively social) personality \n \n Individuals with Williams syndrome have a very endearing personality. They have a unique strength in their expressive language skills, and are extremely polite. They are typically unafraid of strangers and show a greater interest in contact with adults than with their peers. \n \n Developmental delay, learning challenges and attention deficit disorder \n \n Most people with Williams syndrome will have mild to severe learning differences and cognitive challenges. Young children with Williams syndrome often experience developmental delays. Milestones such as walking, talking and toilet training are often achieved somewhat later than is considered normal. Distractibility is a common problem in mid-childhood, which can improve as the children get older. \n \n Older children and adults with Williams syndrome often demonstrate intellectual ""strengths and weaknesses."" There are some intellectual areas (such as speech, long term memory, and social skills) in which performance is quite strong, while other intellectual areas (such as fine motor and spatial relations) show significant weakness.', 'This article is over 1 year old \n \n The corpses, roped together, were discovered by a French climber, according to local authorities \n \n Three bodies found on Mont Blanc after being hidden by glacier for decades \n \n The bodies of three climbers suspected to have died more than two decades ago have been discovered on the Italian side of western Europe’s highest peak Mont Blanc, local police have said. \n \n “The glacier is constantly shifting and we can say that the deaths occurred around 1995,” said a spokesman for the Alpine rescue police service in Italy’s northwestern Val d’Aoste region. \n \n Melting glaciers in Swiss Alps could reveal hundreds of mummified corpses Read more \n \n According to Italian media, the alarm was sounded by a French climber who discovered the bodies and took pictures of them. \n \n Operations were under way to recover the bodies, which were linked together by rope. \n \n In July, the bodies of a Swiss couple who disappeared 75 years ago after going to milk their cows were found frozen in a shrinking glacier above Chandolin in the Valais canton. \n \n Mont Blanc, which straddles Italy’s northwest border with France, continues to claim victims among hikers and climbers. \n \n There have been a series of fatal accidents on the mountain in the past month, with climbers from France, the Czech Republic, South Korea and Ukraine killed while trying to scale its heights. \n \n The search for a missing Japanese climber was called off last week.']",3,"– Jonathan Martinez, the 8-year-old boy killed in Monday's San Bernardino school shooting, was ""the happiest kid you'll ever meet"" despite the rare genetic condition he suffered from, says teaching assistant Jennifer Downing. Jonathan was born with Williams syndrome, which affects around one in 10,000 people and causes developmental delays as well as heart problems, the AP reports. But the genetic condition, which the boy's family want to raise awareness of, also makes children friendly and sociable, qualities Jonathan was known and loved for at North Park Elementary, the San Bernardino Sun reports. Downing says Jonathan, who had already undergone heart surgery once, was also the best reader in the class. Jonathan was killed in his special-needs classroom when Cedric Anderson opened fire on his estranged wife, teacher Karen Smith. Fellow teacher Diane Abrams says the boy's sweet nature makes the violent manner of his death even harder to deal with."" He was so special to teach.

76,"['This photo released by the Syrian official news agency SANA shows Syrian rescue teams investigating the scene after an explosion in Aleppo, Syria, Sunday, March 18, 2012. An explosion ripped through a... (Associated Press) \n \n Syrian security forces clashed Monday with gunmen in an upscale neighborhood of the capital Damascus that is home to embassies and senior officials in one of the worst confrontations in the tightly-controlled city center in the country\'s yearlong uprising. At least three people were killed. \n \n The clash deep in Mazzeh district in west Damascus shows the shifting nature of the conflict in Syria, and suggests that rebels might be trying to offset government morale gains from recent successful offensives against opposition strongholds areas in the north and center of Syria by striking close to where senior regime members live. \n \n Damascus has been largely free of the daily shootings and deaths reported across the country since the uprising against Assad began in March last year. But in addition to gunbattles in Mazzeh and in the suburbs, the capital has witnessed several major bomb attacks targeting security facilities, most recently on Saturday. The government blames ""terrorists"" for the bombings but the opposition says that the regime itself may be carrying them out to discredit the uprising. \n \n Monday\'s fighting broke out when security forces stormed an apartment used as a hideout by an ""armed terrorist"" group in Mazzeh after evacuating the building of all inhabitants, the state-run news agency SANA said. \n \n It added that the forces killed two of the gunmen and arrested the third while a member of the security forces also lost his life. SANA gave no further details. \n \n A resident of the western Mazzeh district said automatic rifles and machineguns were used in the two-hour clash that ended at about 4 a.m. local time. ""We also heard three strong explosions,"" said the man who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of government reprisal. \n \n He added that the clash was close to the Swiss embassy and the home of Maj. Gen. Assef Shawkat, the deputy chief of staff for security affairs who is married to President Bashar Assad\'s sister, Bushra. \n \n Armed rebels are active in Damascus\' suburbs and satellite towns but rarely venture into the heart of the capital where Assad\'s troops are deployed in force. \n \n The new fighting shows that rebels can still strike in the heart of the capital despite successful government offensive in the past weeks in the suburbs of Damascus, in the central city of Homs and the northern region of Idlib. \n \n The U.N. says more than 8,000 people have been killed in the year-long uprising. \n \n Syrian authorities claim the opposition is made up of ""terrorist"" groups carrying out a foreign conspiracy. \n \n An activist in the capital said the Monday morning clashes occurred near the Political Security Directorate building. He said the clashes were followed with raids by security forces who were searching for the attackers. \n \n The Local Coordination Committees activist group reported a heavy presence of security troops as well as pro-government gunmen known as shabiha in Mazzeh. It added that many police vehicles were patrolling the area. \n \n The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which has a network of activists throughout Syria, said 18 of Assad\'s troops were wounded in the clashes. It described the clashes ""as the most violent of its kind and closest to security centers in Damascus since the revolution began."" \n \n The rebel Free Syrian Army, which includes thousands of army defectors, have claimed responsibility in the past for attacks against regime forces. \n \n The group\'s leader, Col. Riad al-Asaad, refused to comment on the fighting in Damascus when contacted by The Associated Press by telephone. ""This is a sensitive military matter that we cannot comment about,"" he said from Turkey. \n \n On Saturday, three suicide bombings in Damascus killed 27 people. Two of them also targeted government security buildings. \n \n On Sunday, an explosion killed two and wounded 30 in the northern city of Aleppo, Syria\'s largest. \n \n The Observatory said troops shelled the central village of Qalaat al-Madiq in central Hama province heavily damaging two homes. It added that troops stormed the northern village of Ebdita and set about 60 homes on fire. \n \n The group said gunmen opened fire at a car in the northern province of Idlib killing an army lieutenant colonel and wounding two other members of the military. \n \n ___ \n \n Bassem Mroue can be reached on twitter at http://twitter.com/bmroue', 'Russia joins Syria truce calls as fighting rages \n \n DAMASCUS — Syria\'s ally Russia added its voice Monday to rising calls for a truce so aid can be sent to violence-hit cities after deadly clashes rocked a district of the capital near the heart of the embattled regime. \n \n France, meanwhile, pressed the UN Security Council to adopt a statement backing international envoy Kofi Annan\'s mission to end bloodshed that has cost an estimated more than 9,100 lives in the past year. \n \n President Bashar al-Assad\'s security forces launched attacks in several regions, opposition activists said. \n \n Pre-dawn fighting in a heavily guarded area of Damascus, the capital\'s fiercest since the revolt against Assad\'s regime erupted, came as residents still reeled from deadly weekend bombings. \n \n At least three rebels and a member of the security forces were killed in the upscale western neighbourhood of Mazzeh, state television and monitors said. \n \n ""Three terrorists were killed and a fourth was arrested in the fighting between security forces and an armed terrorist gang sheltered in a house of a residential district,"" the TV reported. \n \n Rami Abdel Rahman, head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said four rebels were killed. \n \n Mourtada Rasheed, an activist in Damascus, said blasts and heavy shooting could be heard in Mazzeh and two other districts -- Qaboon and Arbeen. \n \n In Russia, International Committee of the Red Cross chief Jakob Kellenberger met Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, whose country is an ally of Damascus and has some influence on the regime. \n \n ""The two parties call for the Syrian government and armed groups to immediately agree to a daily humanitarian truce to allow the ICRC access to the wounded and to civilians who need to be evacuated,"" the foreign ministry said. \n \n Moscow ""underscored the need to allow the ICRC access to all detained persons in Syria following the protests"" against Assad\'s regime. \n \n An ICRC spokeswoman said the Moscow meeting was part of Kellenberger\'s broader efforts to prompt world powers to secure commitments from the regime and rebels to lay down their arms for a few hours each day. \n \n ""The ICRC hopes to see concrete results of such meetings on the ground in the coming days and weeks,"" Victoria Zotikova told AFP. \n \n Kellenberger expressed fears that much of Syria could soon be engulfed in the type of brutal violence recently seen in the flashpoint city of Homs, where hundreds died in more than a month of shelling and a subsequent army assault. \n \n ""This is absolutely unacceptable to us,"" he told ITAR-TASS. \n \n Meanwhile, a mission sent by former UN secretary general Kofi Annan arrived in Damascus for talks on a monitoring operation to end the conflict. \n \n ""There are five people with expertise in political, peacekeeping and mediation,"" Annan spokesman Ahmad Fawzi told AFP. \n \n ""They will be staying for as long as they are making progress on reaching agreement on practical steps to implement Mr Annan\'s proposals,"" he added. \n \n On Monday, France proposed a UN Security Council statement giving strong backing to Annan\'s efforts. \n \n ""The aim now is to find common ground and send a strong message to the Damascus regime,"" a diplomat in New York said, with French Ambassador Gerard Araud saying Paris hopes for a vote on Tuesday. \n \n The Annan proposal includes a halt to the violence, humanitarian access, the release of detainees held over the past year and withdrawal of security forces from protest cities. \n \n As a condition for ceasefire talks, the Damascus government insisted that the opposition had to lay down its arms, diplomats at the United Nations said. \n \n At the same time, neighbouring countries had to guarantee they would not send weapons to Syrian groups or give political or financial support to the opposition, they told AFP on condition of anonymity. \n \n Separately, technical experts from the UN and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation are taking part in a Syrian government-led mission to assess the impact of the deadly crackdown. \n \n The mission to 15 cities, on the first such assignment in Syria since the violence started, was launched in Homs on Sunday. \n \n Monday\'s clashes in the capital came after twin car bombs ripped through two neighbourhoods of Damascus on Saturday, killing 27 people, according to an interior ministry toll. \n \n An Observatory statement said fresh fighting erupted later on Monday between rebels and security forces in the Qaboon and Barzeh areas of Damascus. \n \n Troops backed by dozens of tanks also raided districts of Deir Ezzor city in eastern Syria, the Observatory said, a day after at least 25 army deserters were killed in seizing its Hamidiyeh district. \n \n Five soldiers, including two officers, were also killed, it said. \n \n And troops bombarded the Bab Sbaa, Khalidiyeh and Karm al-Shami districts of Homs, the monitoring group said. \n \n Troops in the northwestern province of Idlib attacked Abdita, home village of defector Colonel Riyadh Asaad, head of the Turkey-based rebel Free Syrian Army, local activist Nurredin al-Abdo told AFP. \n \n Security forces killed at least nine civilians on Monday -- including a young girl -- in Idlib, Homs and the southern province of Daraa, while a captain who deserted was killed

They are calling them names and taking them out of their houses ... people have left their homes. They are in the streets. The security forces are all around the place,"" she said. \n \n Another witness who lives in the area said there was fighting near Hamada supermarket and the sound of explosions in nearby. ""Security police have blocked several side streets and the street lighting has been cut off,"" she said. \n \n Reporting from Beirut in neighbouring Lebanon, Al Jazeera\'s Rula Amin said: ""Residents are telling us there was intense gunfire for hours. They could hear from loudspeakers the army and the security forces asking armed men to leave one of the buildings, Hamada supermarket. \n \n ""Al-Mezzeh is not geographically located in the heart of the capital but it\'s a very important neighbourhood. It is heavily guarded. There are a lot of high-ranking officials living in al-Mezzeh, in addition to the UN headquarters, embassies, and ambassadors,"" she said. \n \n ""This is taking place as the government claims they have control over the capital."" \n \n \'Damascus documents\' \n \n The latest fighting comes as Al Jazeera gained access to confidential documents prepared for Assad by his intelligence chiefs that give details of the regime\'s plans to contain the uprising and protect government strongholds. \n \n The documents, running into hundreds of pages, point to a government desperate to keep control of the capital Damascus and include clear orders to stop protesters from getting into the city. \n \n Elsewhere on Monday, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said Russia\'s foreign minister voiced clear support for a plan for daily humanitarian ceasefires in Syria and promised Russia would press Assad\'s government to accept it. \n \n Russian foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov ""clearly agreed to and was supportive of"" the idea of a daily two-hour cessation of hostilities to allow for life-saving aid operations, ICRC President Jakob Kellenberger told Reuters after talks with Lavrov in Moscow on Monday. \n \n Asked whether Lavrov had promised that Russia would pressure Syria\'s government on the plan, Kellenberger said, ""Yes, very much so"". \n \n The two sides issued no joint statement but ICRC officials said Kellenberger ""received positive indications of support"" from Lavrov. \n \n The Red Cross has yet to receive permission from Syria to access all parts of the country affected by fighting. Moscow, an ally of Damascus, is seen as having a certain amount of influence on the Syrian leadership. \n \n Attacks \n \n This came a day after Syria\'s opposition reported heavy raids by security forces and fighting with rebels in northern and southern provinces and suburbs of Damascus on Sunday. \n \n A car bomb close to a state security office in Syria\'s second biggest city of Aleppo killed at least three people on Sunday, according to the SOHR. \n \n Syrian state TV said that the""terrorist"" explosion took place between two residential buildings in the al-Suleimaniya district, behind a post office. \n \n In Damascus, crowds gathered for memorials to the 27 victims of Saturday\'s car bombs, which had targeted a customs office and air force intelligence headquarters. \n \n State television also blamed ""terrorists"" for those attacks, but opposition activists said they doubted armed groups trying to bring down Assad would have the capacity to carry out such operations against his security institutions in Damascus. \n \n The United Nations estimates that more than 8,000 people have died so far in the violence following the revolt against four decades of rule by the Assad family. \n \n Syrian authorities say they are fighting insurgents who have so far killed more than 2,000 members of the security forces.', 'Please enable Javascript to watch this video \n \n Jamestown, Va. - Researchers at Jamestown believe they may have solved Colonial America’s oldest unsolved murder case. \n \n In September of 1996, archaeologists discovered human skeletal remains under an old roadbed about 100 yards from the colony church tower. \n \n The remains were given the identifying tag of “JR102C,” and have been casually referred to as “JR.” \n \n Tests revealed the remains to be that of a 19-year-old man who may have been a European immigrant living in colony for several years prior to his death. \n \n According to the Jamestown Rediscovery Project, the man was buried in a coffin, which suggests he had a gentleman’s status. The bones of the right leg were found twisted and broken below the knee, with a lead musket ball and a smaller lead shot found on and within the bone. \n \n Researchers believe the wound was the cause of death. \n \n However, the true identity of the colonist remained unknown. \n \n William Kelso, Director of Archaeological Research and Interpretation for the Jamestown Rediscovery Project, says new research points to a duel that took place in 1624 between George Harrison and Richard Stephens. \n \n Harrison was shot and they believe his remains may be the mystery colonist. \n \n ""This wound shows that the person was killed by getting hit in the side of the knee. So in a duel, you stand sideways and this would come through like that,"" he says. \n \n Kelso says “JR” may be the oldest forensic evidence of an unsolved murder in Colonial America but there are still questions to be answered despite their theories. \n \n One doubt is due to the type of bullet. \n \n ""That\'s a combat round.

""People came to Mazzeh and they are trying to attack residents. They are calling them names and taking them out of their houses,"" an opposition activist tells al-Jazeera. ""The clashes were the strongest and the closest to security installations in the capital since the outbreak of the revolt a year ago,"" a watchdog tells AFP. The fighting follows car bombs in Damascus and Syria's second-biggest city of Aleppo this weekend. Damascus hasn't faced the daily clashes reported in other Syrian cities, the AP notes. An activist said last night's violence was sparked by a Free Syrian Army hit-and-run effort, though state TV said it began with a security raid on an ""armed terrorist"" hideout. The clashes may have been a rebel attempt to damage security forces' morale after a series of effective attacks on the opposition, the AP suggests."

(Associated Press) \n \n LAS VEGAS (AP) — Recreational marijuana sales have exceeded the expectations of Las Vegas area store owners, who have seen long lines outside their dispensaries since Saturday, when Nevada became the fifth state with shops selling pot to the public. \n \n That move jumpstarted a market projected to be fueled by the tens of millions of visitors that Sin City welcomes each year. \n \n Eager pot customers on Monday again lined up before dispensaries opened their doors. Some were looking to make their first purchase since Saturday, and others were shopping for seconds. Tourists and locals alike have taken advantage of the change in state law. \n \n ""I\'m a very happy with the way sales have gone and continue to go, especially when you consider that the word didn\'t really get out ahead of time."" said Andrew Jolley, president of the Nevada Dispensary Association and a store owner. ""The public really only had a couple of weeks\' notice, whereas Colorado had a full year to prepare."" \n \n Nevada voters approved legalizing recreational pot in November, but regulations needed before the sales could start weren\'t approved until the past two weeks. The state later this week will release a report regarding the unannounced enforcement inspections that were conducted Saturday at dispensaries across the state. \n \n The demand for recreational marijuana has been such that dispensaries had to turn away customers in line over the weekend, and at least one extended its hours of operation. Dispensaries reported wait times of 45 minutes to an hour Saturday afternoon and up to 20 minutes Sunday. \n \n The Euphoria Wellness dispensary had 50 people waiting to make purchases midmorning Monday. Its marketing coordinator, Jim Ferrence, said budtenders helped at least 1,000 customers during the first two days of legal recreational pot sales. \n \n Customers on average bought a quarter of an ounce of marijuana flowers and a sampling of various edibles and concentrates, Ferrence said. ""Everyone was calm, cool and collected. No unruly crowds at all,"" he said. \n \n Those 21 and older with a valid ID can buy up to an ounce of pot. As of Friday, the state had licensed 44 dispensaries to sell recreational marijuana. Thirty-nine of those shops are in the Las Vegas area. \n \n More than 42 million tourists flock for business and pleasure to Las Vegas every year. They along with visitors to the rest of Nevada are expected to make nearly two of every three recreational pot purchases in the state. \n \n But people can only use the drug in a private home as it remains illegal to consume it in public, including the Strip, hotels and casinos. Violators face a misdemeanor citation and a $600 fine. \n \n Fifteen tourists on Monday hopped on a bus for a three-hour tour of dispensaries in the Las Vegas area. The ""Cannabus"" took the visitors to two stores with whom they have an agreement to allow riders to skip the lines. \n \n The recreational marijuana sales did not cause Las Vegas police a headache over the weekend. The department did not deploy additional officers and does not track misdemeanor citations, Officer Larry Hadfield on Monday said. \n \n ""It was business as usual,"" he said. ""Everything went smooth as far as we can tell."" \n \n The state stands to earn millions from the sales of recreational marijuana, but the tax collection data won\'t be available for several weeks. \n \n Nevada joins Colorado, Oregon, Washington and Alaska in allowing adults to buy the drug that\'s still banned by the federal government. The market in the Silver State is expected to outpace all others in the U.S., at least until California starts its sales. \n \n ""With all due respect to Denver, Seattle, and Portland, Las Vegas is already the party capital of the world, and this is just an extension of that,"" Ferrence said.

The tax rate for recreational pot is 33 to 38 percent, depending on local regulations, with all state and local taxes included. A 15 percent tax on wholesale marijuana distribution from cultivation and production facilities included in the total tax rate did not contribute to this week’s tax revenue, as dispensaries loaded up on supply prior to July 1 when the new wholesale tax took effect. \n \n “We had a higher demand than everybody initially thought,” dispensary association director Riana Durrett said. “It shows this market really exists.” \n \n Thousands of marijuana shoppers took to dispensaries over the weekend, forming lines as long as three hours for their chance to legally purchase the plant. Nevadans passed Ballot Question 2 in November, legalizing the use and possession of up to one ounce of marijuana flower or up to one-eighth ounce of concentrates. Legislation allowing sales of the plant at medically licensed dispensaries was finalized in late May. \n \n Nevada was one of four states to legalize recreational use of the plant in November’s election. In addition, four other states allow recreational pot sales. \n \n Editor’s note: This story has been revised.

But the chaos is on the licensing side of things. The new law allows those 21 and up to buy up to an ounce of pot from what are 47 licensed dispensaries, reports the AP. The problem, explains Vice News, is that the only way for dispensaries to legally get pot for the next 18 months is via wholesale liquor distributors, who secured the exclusive right via a November ballot measure. But of the seven liquor distributors to have applied for a license to restock dispensaries, zero have ""met the application requirements."" That's where the statement of emergency, signed Friday by Gov. Brian Sandoval, comes in. It says the emergency regulation is needed to allow the Department of Taxation to figure out whether limiting licenses to liquor dealers will result in an insufficient number of pot distributors in the state. This is a real concern, because without pot sales, ""the State will not realize the revenue on which the State budget relies."" Indeed, the Las Vegas Sun reports the first four days of sales brought in $500,000 in tax revenue, with the six-month tax estimate set at $30 million. The whole thing has been a bit of a saga: In mid-June, liquor distributors won a preliminary injunction banning the state from handing out licenses to other entities, Reason notes. As for how pot sales have happened to date, dispensaries were able to stock up pre-July 1. But ""some establishments report the need for delivery within the next several days,"" a rep for the department said in an email to the Reno Gazette-Journal Friday."

The city would pay at least $4.5 million but no more than $30 million over four years. \n \n The proposal “creates an innovative pathway for individuals served with gang injunctions to gain the job skills they need to turn their lives around,” City Attorney Mike Feuer said in a statement. \n \n If a court approves the settlement, the city also will stop enforcing curfew restrictions that a federal court ruled were unconstitutional and provide an expedited way for people named in injunctions to be removed from the list. \n \n “Unconstitutional gang injunction curfews forced several thousand black and brown residents of Los Angeles indoors on a nightly basis,” Olu K. Orange, an attorney for the lawsuit plaintiffs, said in a statement. “These individuals are part of the Los Angeles community and this settlement is a step by city leaders toward showing them that their lives do matter.” \n \n Gang injunctions were designed as a tool for fighting gang crime and violence. They give police the power to arrest reputed gang members named in the injunction for otherwise legal activities such as gathering in public, wearing gang colors or being outside in a specified gang area late at night. \n \n Since being pioneered in Los Angeles in the 1980s, the use of the injunctions has proliferated across the nation and even overseas.

Berlusconi’s majority is so slim that it effectively cannot pass legislation, the New York Times reports, and analysts say that the slightest bump in the road could break the fragile coalition entirely. Berlusconi called the vote himself after failing a routine vote this week and refusing calls to step down. Berlusconi survived thanks to loyalists afraid his government would be replaced by a non-political technocratic one seeking structural changes to Italy’s economy—a government they’d have no place in. Of course, many business leaders were hoping for exactly that. “The best signal that Italy could have sent to the markets would have been to boot Mr. Berlusconi out, but it has failed to do so,” one economic think tank director tells the AP. Opponents, meanwhile, complained that Berlusconi can win confidence votes, but cannot govern. “He only knows how to stay stuck in his seat using tricks,” one opposition leader complained."

But the ocean is capped by an ice crust and no one was sure about its thickness. Europa is relatively large among the dozens of moons of Jupiter. \n \n Some scientists thought it was a mile or two thick, but most scientists thought it was several miles thick. A thick crust would be bad news for life because it would mean the ocean could never splash up on Europa’s shores to interact with possible sources of food needed to sustain life. \n \n New research announced Wednesday indicates the crust is thick, but it also shows that there are lakes above the oceans and that they are churning. This is key, because it means possible life forms in Europa’s oceans could make it the surface via the lakes to find food. \n \n ""One opinion in the scientific community has been, \'If the ice shell is thick, that\'s bad for biology — that it might mean the surface isn\'t communicating with the underlying ocean,\' "" according to Britney Schmidt, a postdoctoral fellow at The University of Texas at Austin\'s Institute for Geophysics and the lead author of a new study published in the journal Nature. \n \n ""Now we see evidence that even though the ice shell is thick, it can mix vigorously. That could make Europa and its ocean more habitable,"" she said in a statement. \n \n This is fantastic news for scientists hoping find signs of life on Europa, said Niebur. \n \n The lakes are estimated to be 2 to 3 miles below the crust, while the oceans are estimated to be 30 miles down, Niebur said. “It’s a missing link to understanding to whether it (Europa) could support life.” \n \n Scientists are basing their findings, in part, on what they learned from images taken by the old Galileo spacecraft, which was launched in 1989 to gather data and images from Jupiter and its moons. (It crashed into Jupiter in 2003). Those pictures show round bumps called chaos terrains. Based on the way ice moves around on Earth, the researchers developed a model to explain the bumps. \n \n The only way to confirm the model would be to fly a spacecraft to Europa to investigate. A mission is on the drawing board, but NASA hasn’t approved anything yet, according to Niebur.', 'These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to. That way, as the pages that are referenced are changed or taken from the web, a link to the version that was live when the page was written will be preserved.Then the Internet Archive hopes that references to these archived pages will be put in place of a link that would be otherwise be broken, or a companion link to allow people to see what was originally intended by a page\'s authors.The goal is to fix all broken links on the web .

A vast ocean is believed to lie beneath as much as 20 miles of ice on Europa, but new research suggests that huge lakes exist a lot closer to the surface. A suspected interchange of water between the lakes and the ocean means that nutrients could be transferred from near the surface to life far below, the BBC reports. The research team examined bumps known as ""chaos terrain"" on Europa's surface and developed models based on the way ice moves around on Earth. If the researchers are right, ""you've moved from a system that checks one of the requirements for life to a system that checks two requirements for life,"" an astrobiologist tells the Christian Science Monitor.

Still draining at the exact same rate. Unplugged with a full charge 2 1/2 hours ago, and already down to 80% with light usage."" \n \n ""Installed the new IOS 5.0.1 two hours ago. I started a test at 1:30 CT today. 5% battery drain in 45 minutes with WIFI and location services turned on and me not touching the Iphone 4S. The new update doesn\'t seem to help much."" \n \n ""I updated last night (UK) and it didn\'t fix anything. Losing 6% / hr in standby which is the same as with 5.0."" \n \n Some have even claimed that the fix made the situation worse: \n \n ""Lost 15% in 45 mins and I didn\'t even use the phone. What happened? This update is no help. In fact, it drains the battery even quicker."" \n \n ""Updated to 5.0.1 last night and my battery life seems even worse than before! My phone dropped by 4% overnight in flight mode! I have had it out of flight mode since 6.30am (at which time the battery was at 51%), and its now 8.30am and its down to 35%."" \n \n ""For me, its worse than ever. the battery life was much better, since i updated 5.0.1 for iphone yesterday. Battery % was on 92% last night, 3g is not on, wifi also, and now the battery is on 69%. unbelievable!!!"" \n \n In the midst of the complaints, one user chimed in with a more reasoned approach: ""Don\'t rely on immediate numbers when you\'ve had mixed pre/post patch usage. Most likely you need to reset the network/device itself and discharge/recharge! It\'s not magic! Enthusiasm is normal but Apple users have to learn to be methodical."" \n \n In line with that, some people advised performing a total discharge to 0 percent and then recharging all the way. Others suggested resetting the device by doing a complete backup and restore. \n \n Apple also provides a page on battery usage for the iPhone and how it runs battery tests on the various models. \n \n The users who say iOS 5.0.1 didn\'t resolve the battery problem could be in the minority since other early adopters reported that the update did, in fact, take care of the issue. And several people on the Apple Support Forum say the fix did help them. But even a small minority can indicate that the update didn\'t fully address the issue or that other factors may be involved. \n \n Complaints of poor battery life certainly didn\'t start with the iPhone 4S or iOS 5. Users of the iPhone 3G also griped about short battery life.

81,"['Oscar de la Renta was a great man, and a great American designer. Over five decades he made fashion that was elegant, based on the tools of the trade that he learned in Spain at Balenciaga, and in Paris, at Lanvin under Antonio Castillo. I also considered him one of my close, best friends. He truly cared about my well-being, regardless of whether or not it was my weight-loss battle, or was I lonely, and would I come dine with him and Annette at home in New York. I spent Thanksgiving with him, about eight or nine years ago, just the three of us and his son Moises in Kent, Connecticut. Family was of the utmost importance to him. The wedding he and his wife created for stepdaughter Eliza Bolen’s nuptials, was one of the most beautiful and original country weddings I ever attended. And the social world was there in full force. \n \n Oscar was king of the historical social anecdote, no matter if it was about the Marquis de Cuevas’s famous costume ball, or Marie-Hélène de Rothschild’s dinners. He lived through his youth, following the great bullfighters of Spain, when he worked in Madrid, he honed his design DNA in Paris and with his great success in New York, he always gave back, philanthropically. He personally supported an orphanage in the Dominican Republic. This was one of his passions—he provided housing, food, education, and hope for those beautiful children. \n \n I met Oscar de la Renta, in 1974, when I arrived in New York. He was then wed to his first wife, Françoise de Langlade, a former French Vogue editor-in-chief. Oscar and Françoise took me under their wings and mentored me socially. \n \n Every single morning, Françoise would call me once I got to my desk at Women’s Wear Daily down on Twelfth Street. It was an open floor plan then, and my desk was no more than ten steps from John Fairchild’s desk with a low bookcase separating us. I was an accessories editor, and at night, a beat reporter. This is where I learned my craft as a social chronicler. Françoise would often call me up and ask me where I had been and what I had done the night before. \n \n Oscar and his wife were the first to invite me to dinner in their home, with the likes of Dr. Henry Kissinger, or Tatiana and Alexander Liberman; they also invited me to dinner when they were in Paris, with their friends, like Cristiana Brandolini d’Adda and the late Andre Olivier. \n \n One day, Françoise called me and said I had messed up socially, I had forgotten to come to lunch with just her and Annette Reed, now Mrs. de la Renta. In those days—the seventies—Oscar and Françoise were the Social Lions of New York. They served the best food and made dinner at home a vast, rich experience of color and textures with wine and decor. In the new book, Valentino: At the Emperor’s Table, Valentino specifically wanted me to write in the introduction how Oscar and his wife were the best and most outstanding New York host and hostess. \n \n His impeccable personal style with people, parties, and fashion fueled his work. Known for his appropriate elegance, he always designed with the ultimate motivation that women must look and feel beautiful. Having worked beside him on so many of his Balmain haute couture collections for nearly a decade as a stylist, I watch him return again and again to his roots, the highest standards of French couture, having first apprenticed with Cristóbal Balenciaga in Madrid, and then working as designer at Castillo-Lanvin. There was always a sense of the flourish of a great flamenco flounce in his dinner and evening dresses, the bias elegance of silk charmeuse in slim sheath dresses, and simple black or white cashmere coats, that his wife Annette loved. In the winter, she often wears one of his cashmere coats to dinner and never removes it, she loves them so. \n \n In 2013, Oscar asked me to help him with an exhibit that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton organized on First Lady style at the Clinton Library in Little Rock, Arkansas. We all flew down to the presidential library and the show was full of exquisite, elegant de la Renta clothes worn by former First Ladies from Nancy Reagan to Laura Bush. \n \n As evidenced in his last great wedding dress, which he designed for Mrs. George Clooney, Oscar was also a master of the grand wedding gown. My favorite, of course, was the dress and veil he designed for Elizabeth Shaffer, who got married last summer. Oscar and Annette took a helicopter and flew down from Connecticut to Long Island so that he could make the final adjustments just before she walked down the aisle. \n \n Some of my fondest memories of Oscar are in his native Dominican Republic, diving into a natural waterfall in the mountains, or having the ultimate pleasure of seeing him dance. He was the best dancer. It was a joy just to be in his presence, especially in his beautiful homes and gardens, where happiness reigned. \n \n Click through the slideshow below for Oscar de la Renta’s best moments in Vogue.', 'View Images Ground beef patties are packaged for distribution in Amarillo, Texas. New dietary recommendations released today suggest a diet high in vegetables and low in red meat, but no longer warn against foods high in cholesterol. \n \n Photograph by Brian Finke, National Geographic \n \n The Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee issued its recommendations today, calling on Americans to eat less meat, watch their sodium intake, and start thinking about the environment more. As many had predicted, it also peeled back a 40-year-old warning against eating foods high in cholesterol, like eggs and shrimp. \n \n ""The overall body of evidence examined by the 2015 DGAC identifies that a healthy dietary pattern is higher in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, low- or non-fat dairy, seafood, legumes, and nuts; moderate in alcohol (among adults); lower in red and processed meat; and low in sugar-sweetened foods and drinks and refined grains,"" the report says. \n \n Not a surprise, unless you\'ve been living under a rock somewhere, but the devil will be in the details. \n \n One critical detail is that the committee, for the first time, is including ""the impact of food production, processing, and consumption on environmental sustainability"" in its recommendations. \n \n ""Linking health, dietary guidance, and the environment will promote human health and the sustainability of natural resources and ensure current and long-term food security,"" the committee says. \n \n After intense lobbying by representatives of the U.S. meat industry and other special interest groups, the language calling on Americans to eat less red meat was softened somewhat by a footnote saying that lean red meat can be part of a healthy diet. (Read more about the meat debate in ""Carnivore\'s Dilemma"" in National Geographic magazine.) \n \n Why It Matters \n \n While some see being told what to eat as a ""big government as nanny"" moment, the recommendations—and what the U.S. Department of Agriculture ultimately decides to adopt—are used to set food policy for major institutions and schools. Those policies in turn serve as a guide for everyone who wants to do business with or just plain needs to eat at government offices, other big institutions, or schools. \n \n The Big Picture \n \n Dietary recommendations like these don\'t come around all that often. The U.S. Department of Agriculture releases them only every five years. A lot of science and politics can change in that time, and someone always has a beef with what ends up in the final document. \n \n Despite some debate about saturated versus unsaturated fats, with some research suggesting that saturated fats aren\'t as bad as once thought, most dieticians and health experts are generally pleased with the recommendation to limit saturated fat intake to no more than 10 percent of daily calories. (Related: ""Is Fat Our Friend?"") \n \n The committee members ""don\'t move at all on the issue of what kinds of fats to eat. They continue to recommend limiting saturated fat and supporting polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats,"" Steven Nissen, chair of Cleveland Clinic\'s Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, told Time magazine. ""I would have liked the guidelines to be a little more neutral on saturated fat."" \n \n What\'s Next \n \n The public is invited to comment on the guidelines through April 8. The USDA will likely issue the final 2015 dietary guidelines by the end of this year.']",2,"– Fashion designer and icon Oscar de la Renta died yesterday at 82, after a yearslong battle with cancer, the New York Times reports. His illness, the paper notes, didn't slow him down: He designed Amal Alamuddin's dress for her wedding to George Clooney just last month, and his business expanded by 50% in the eight years he faced the disease. The Dominican Republic-born designer's clientele ranged from first ladies—including Jackie Kennedy, Nancy Reagan, and Michelle Obama, Vanity Fair reports—to Oscar winners. ""You want to know who my customer is?” he once asked. ""All the women who can afford to buy my clothes!"" He began work in fashion design in the 1950s in Spain, when the wife of the then-US ambassador saw his drawings and sought a dress for her daughter. His career moved him to Paris and eventually the US in 1963. By the 1970s, de la Renta and his first wife, Françoise de Langlade, were ""the Social Lions of New York,"" André Leon Talley writes in Vogue. The Times notes that the couple were central to the rise of designers as the social elite. But de la Renta didn't see his work as particularly ""heavy. Somebody might ask, 'What is Oscar de la Renta?' And you could say, 'It's a pretty dress.'"""

The 25-year-old singer is approaching the 54-year-old industry veteran\'s record for the most No. 1 songs on Billboard\'s Dance/Club Play Songs chart. \n \n Rihanna\'s recent hit ""Right Now"" topped the dance chart this week, giving Rih her 20th No. 1 song in the category, according to Billboard. Rih beat out Janet Jackson with this total, who was formerly in second place with 19 entries on the chart. With hits including ""Pon De Replay,"" ""Only Girl (In the World),"" and ""We Found Love,"" Rihanna now holds the number two spot, only falling behind Madonna. \n \n Madonna shouldn\'t be too worried -- the iconic pop star currently holds the title for most No. 1 songs on the dance chart with 43, more than double Rihanna\'s take. While Rihanna nabbed her first No. 1 for the category in 2005, Madonna charted her first dance hit in 1983. \n \n In typical Rihanna-style, the singer could be seen wearing highly risque getups celebrating Crop Over festivities in Barbados.

""Right Now"" hung out in the lower region of the chart for 10 weeks, peaking at No. 33, until it fell off the chart in late April. \n \n Then, when official remixes of ""Right Now"" were released and promoted to club DJs last month, the track re-entered the chart at No. 44. It jumped to No. 1 six weeks later. \n \n ""Right Now"" was remixed for club floors by the likes of by Dyro, Sick Individuals, Justin Prime and Ralphi Rosario. \n \n ""Where Have You Been"" followed a similar trajectory last year.

There are no U.S. plans at this time. \n \n ""If our customers occasionally like to have their cake and eat it, why wouldn\'t they want to have their cup and eat it, instead? poses KFC spokeswoman Jocelyn Bynoe. She says KFC has been experimenting with edible packaging for some time to see if it could be a feasible product to bring to market in limited quantities. \n \n No specifics, yet, on how many calories will be stuffed into the edible cup. \n \n In concept, edible fast-food containers could appeal to consumers on several levels, says branding expert Tracey Riese. ""It could fit with any number of brand positions from \'fast\' (no bussing); to \'green\' (no waste) to \'fun\' (at least, it seems fun.),"" she says. \n \n But this is mostly aimed at environmentally-minded Millennials, who want products and packaging to leave a smaller footprint. There\'s a huge market for new packaging technologies that are better for the environment. \n \n Last year, Stonyfield, the environmentally conscious organic yogurt maker, took its first baby step towards ultimately eliminating the plastic yogurt container. It rolled out a product dubbed Stonyfield Frozen Yogurt Pearls -- frozen yogurt sold inside edible, fruit-flavored packaging skins -- at a handful of Whole Foods stores in the Boston area. \n \n One environmentalist group says it\'s a potential fan of edible packaging. The U.S. has an overall recycling rate of 34.5% and 51% rate of packaging recycling -- much lower than many other developed countries, says Darby Hoover, senior resource specialist at the Natural Resources Defense Council. \n \n ""Companies that make these packages have an obligation to help ensure those packages aren\'t wasted,"" she says. ""Edible packaging has the potential to be a meaningful part of that opportunity."" \n \n The company making the KFC edible cups is the Robin Collective, a London-based food science specialist. The company also has worked on infusing aroma into other cups, including some that smell like coconut, fresh-cut flowers or freshly mown grass. \n \n The edible cup concept is not a perfect fit for KFC, says Riese, but, she adds, ""it\'s not off-brand, either."" She sees it more as a ""promotion novelty"" than a brand-building strategy. \n \n But Riese says KFC has to make absolutely sure of one thing before rolling out the edible cup to any stores: it must work perfectly every time. \n \n ""An icky experience,"" she says, ""would hurt any brand that brought it to market."" \n \n Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1BuCy3l']",2,"– UK customers who buy a cup of coffee at Kentucky Fried Chicken soon won't have to throw their cups away—they'll just eat them.

""You need a certain saturation to have an impact."" \n \n All eyes in the food world have been on California\'s hotly contested genetically modified (GMO) food labeling proposal, which was defeated this morning by a significant margin — 53 percent of the state\'s voters opposed and 47 percent in favor. \n \n It would have required that most foods containing genetically modified ingredients carry a ""Made with GMO"" label on the box. Given the prevalence of genetically engineered corn and soy in processed foods, those labels would have been nearly ubiquitous in the middle aisles of the grocery store. And, given the size of California\'s market, and manufacturers\' opposition to distribute two versions of packaging, the California law could have morphed into de facto national policy as well. \n \n The news was well-received in the No camp, which had argued that the proposal would be expensive and confusing. ""We said from the beginning that people should take a close look at 37, that it\'s not as simple as it seems from the surface,"" Kathy Fairbanks with the No on 37 campaign, which didn\'t hold a public party, told us last night when it appeared the measure would be defeated. ""The more voters learned about 37, the more they realized they didn\'t like it."" \n \n But supporters were unbowed. In fact, they say, even though Proposition 37 lost, a grass-roots movement came together with a clear purpose (unlike the Occupy movement, Grist snarks) to focus on what\'s on our plates. ""Don\'t mourn, #organize!"" is a popular Twitter update from supporters today. \n \n ""Californians and all Americans deserve the right to know what\'s in their food,"" said Jean Halloran, director of food policy initiatives for Consumers Union, in a statement released this morning. ""Unfortunately, Proposition 37 was defeated by a wildly deceptive smear campaign financed by Monsanto, DuPont and other industry opponents of the public\'s right to know,"" she said. \n \n So about that campaign. The No on 37 camp, which opposed GMO labeling, raised $45.9 million, thanks in large part to biotech giant Monsanto, along with a familiar roster of big-supermarket brands: Kraft, Heinz, Sara Lee, Pepsico, etc. The main message? Your groceries will cost more. \n \n Meanwhile, Yes on 37 brought in $9.4 million from a far crunchier lineup, including tiny-print soap makers Dr. Bronner\'s, Whole Foods and the Illinois-based nutritional supplement maker Joseph Mercola. Oh, and Hollywood: Gwyneth Paltrow single-handedly raised $80,000 for the Yes camp after endorsing the campaign on her Facebook page. Danny DeVito and Dave Matthews pitched in for a TV ad. And, said Malkan, ""Sting\'s people were calling us last night, asking what they could do to help."" \n \n But it was too little, too late, she added. Despite an initially hefty lead by the pro-labeling folks, Proposition 37 support took a dive soon after the No on 37 ads hit the airwaves. Within two weeks, support for 37 dropped 9 percentage points, according to one poll from Pepperdine University and the California Business Roundtable. \n \n The No camp also got a boost from a series of high-profile endorsements, including one from the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the country\'s largest science organization. \n \n Proposition 37 and other labeling propositions ""are not driven by evidence that GM foods are actually danger\xadous,"" wrote the AAAS board of directors. ""Indeed, the science is quite clear: Crop improvement by the modern molecular techniques of biotechnology is safe."" \n \n As we reported earlier this summer, some legal experts raised concerns about how the proposal was written and suggested that it would add confusion — not clarity — to food labels. And, several of the state\'s big newspapers — the Los Angeles Times, San Francisco Chronicle and San Jose Mercury News — all came out against the labeling proposal for similar reasons. \n \n Other states have proposed similar labeling measures.', 'A human foot was found on a Jordan River beach Thursday morning, sparking an investigation by the B.C. Coroners Service. \n \n A man walking his dogs made the discovery about 8 a.m., said Sooke RCMP Staff Sgt. Jeff McArthur. The foot was in a shoe with part of the leg attached. \n \n The man called Sooke RCMP, and Mounties attended with a coroner. \n \n The body part was seized and the area was searched, McArthur said. \n \n The investigation has been turned over to the B.C. coroner, which investigates all unnatural, sudden and unexpected, unexplained or unattended deaths in the province. \n \n “Our early analysis suggests these are human remains and we will do further investigation and testing to help to determine identification in the coming weeks,” said Andy Watson, a spokesman for the coroners Service. \n \n The coroner will work to determine the identity of the deceased, when, where and how the person died, the cause of death, and whether any recommendations can be made to prevent similar deaths in the future. \n \n This is the 14th disembodied foot to wash up on B.C.’s coastline since 2007. Ten of those feet have been identified as belonging to seven people who died by accident or suicide. One foot was linked to a man who had gone missing 25 years earlier when his boat overturned near Port Moody. \n \n The last foot to wash up on Vancouver Island was on Feb. 7, 2016, near Port Renfrew. The coroners service determined the foot would have naturally separated from the body after a prolonged period in the water. \n \n There have also been some hoaxes. \n \n In June 2008, a foot reportedly washed up near Campbell River. It was determined that someone placed animal bones in a sock and packed it inside a sneaker with seaweed. In September of that year, someone placed a plastic foot in a runner on an East Vancouver beach. \n \n Victoria police investigated after five child-sized shoes were found at the Clover Point beach area in 2012. Three of the shoes were stuffed with flesh and bones, but tests revealed that they weren’t human. \n \n kderosa@timescolonist.com \n \n Click here to read more stories from The Victoria Times Colonist.']",3,"– Californians voted yesterday in a pair of hot-button referendums, passing a law mandating that porn stars wear condoms while striking down another that would require the food industry to label genetically modified foods. The former means that adult performers in LA County not only have to wrap up, reports the LA Times, but producers will also have to get a public health permit, like tattoo parlors, something AIDS activists say is a major step forward. That bill passed with a 59% majority. The bill that would require foods containing genetically modified ingredients to bear a label reading ""Made with GMO"" was struck down by a 53% to 47% margin, reports NPR. Opponents said the labels would be expensive and confusing to consumers, not to mention ubiquitous in grocery stores, since many items include GMO corn and soy products. The so-called Frankenfood bill's popularity dropped off a cliff after Monsanto waged a $46 million ad war against it; supporters of the bill vow to continue fighting for the labels."

87,"['SINGAPORE/BEIJING Flamboyant former basketball star Dennis Rodman arrived in North Korea on Tuesday for a five-day visit, his second this year, but said he had no plans to negotiate the release of a jailed American missionary. \n \n There had been speculation that Rodman, who met North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in March, would secure the release of Kenneth Bae, who was jailed for 15 years for trying to overthrow the North Korean government. \n \n ""I\'m not going to North Korea to discuss freeing Kenneth Bae,"" Rodman told Reuters in a telephone interview before he left Beijing for Pyongyang. ""I\'m just going there on another basketball diplomacy tour."" \n \n Kim, the third of his line to rule North Korea, is a basketball fan and appeared to get on well with Rodman on the earlier visit, with the two of them pictured laughing, eating and drinking together and watching an all-star basketball match. \n \n Rodman\'s latest trip is being sponsored by Irish bookmaker Paddy Power. His arrival was announced on North Korean news agency KCNA, which did not provide any further details of the trip. \n \n Wearing his trademark dark sunglasses, the 6-foot 7-inch (2.01 meter) Rodman pushed through a throng of journalists at Beijing\'s international airport, a common waystation for travelers to North Korea. \n \n ""I\'m just trying to go over there to meet my friend Kim, the Marshal,"" Rodman said. ""Try to start a basketball league over there, something like that."" \n \n North Korea cancelled a visit by Robert King, U.S. special envoy on North Korean human rights issues, to Pyongyang last week on what the U.S. State Department said was a ""humanitarian mission"" to negotiate the release of Bae. \n \n King\'s trip was initially seen as a signal that relations between Washington and Pyongyang might start to improve. North Korea said it withdrew the invitation because of annual military drills last week by the United States and South Korea. \n \n Rodman drew fire for his earlier trip to Pyongyang at a time when North Korea was threatening the United States, South Korea and Japan with missile strikes. \n \n He called Kim, 30, who rules unchallenged in a country where there are an estimated 150,000-200,000 prisoners in work camps, ""an awesome kid"". \n \n Bae, a Korean American who had been working as a Christian missionary in China and North Korea, was arrested in the northeast port city of Rason late last year. \n \n The North Korean supreme court said it sentenced him to 15 years of hard labor for plotting to overthrow the state. It said he had secretly brought ""propaganda materials"", including a National Geographic documentary on life in North Korea, into the isolated country. \n \n Bae, who had trained with missionary organization Youth With a Mission, ran a tour group called Nation Tours in China that specialized in trips to North Korea. In a video of a 2009 sermon to a Korean-American church in St. Louis, Bae said he planned to bring fellow Christians into Rason. \n \n North Korea says it permits religious freedom, but religious expression is tightly controlled in a state that acknowledges total loyalty to the Kim dynasty that has ruled for three generations. North Korea lands at the bottom of most independent surveys of freedom. \n \n Bae\'s family has acknowledged his deeply held religious beliefs but has suggested that his sympathy for North Korean orphans may have been behind his arrest. \n \n (Additional reporting by Jumin Park; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan)', 'Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 1, 2017 \n \n [image via Shutterstock] \n \n —— \n \n Follow Josh Feldman on Twitter: @feldmaniac \n \n Have a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com', 'April Fools\' Day is the only ""fake news"" day that\'s almost welcome. Almost. And one of the longstanding masters of the tech prank, Google, is at it again with a fresh batch of trickery. \n \n This year, the jokes are more obviously fake this time around in what appears to be an effort to avoid anyone actually thinking these products actually exist. \n \n Nevertheless, some of these products would be kind of cool, despite how wildly impractical they are. \n \n Here\'s the running list of what Google\'s ""rolled out"" today so far: \n \n Google Gnome \n \n Although the name rhymes with the very real Google Home, this imagined Google digital assistant is instead designed to sit outdoors and help you out with all matters related to weekend backyard lounging and the occasional bit of garden work. \n \n Delivering information bits about weather, edible plant life and a surprisingly dark array of opinions, Google Gnome is what Google Home would be like if it showed up in an episode of Black Mirror — helpful, but just a tad too ominous with its robot apocalypse leanings. \n \n Haptic Helpers \n \n The quickest way to get a tech-centric laugh nowadays is to show some idiot fumbling around while blinded by yet another new VR headset. But Google smartly goes in another direction and actually addresses an issue that has yet to be solved in virtual reality: haptics. \n \n Haptic Helpers actually brings human Google workers into your home to assist you with your VR experience by providing you with all of the other sensory input that you can\'t otherwise get on current VR Systems. From smell, to taste, and even touch, Haptic Helpers show us the next best solution for full VR immersion until we actually have holodeck-level sensory input. \n \n Google Wind \n \n Stepping up the April Fools\' Day game to a new level, Google\'s team in the Netherlands came up with an imaginary system called Google Wind that links the country\'s 1,170 windmills together using ""machine learning [that] enables all the mills to collaborate."" Once those windmills are linked, they are able to literally blow clouds out of the sky to allow the country to have more sun-filled days. \n \n Somehow, as ridiculous as this one looks, it\'s reminiscent of the very real weather modification initiatives that have been documented in years past. Nevertheless, the special effects showing people being blown away by the power of the windmill mechanisms adds just the right amount of whimsy to let you know that Google is in fact just playing around with yet another wild ""what if"" idea. \n \n Google Puchi Puchi Keyboard \n \n Also getting in on the international prank fun is Google Japan, whose team came up with perhaps the most ingenious fake gadget in a keyboard made of bubble wrap. The Puchi Puchi keyboard (in Japanese, ""puchi puchi"" translates as bubble wrap), allows the user to simultaneously enjoy the feeling of popping those tiny plastic bubbles included in packing materials while typing out a message. \n \n Once the message has been popped out, a Puchi Puchi reader rolls over the popped material to decipher the message. Yes, this is stupid. But for some reason, I actually want this. They even added a special version of the Puchi Puchi Keyboard that releases pleasant fragrances when you pop the bubbles, including air from places like Hawaii. \n \n Someone please actually make this. \n \n Google Cloud on Mars \n \n Definitely one of the biggest pranks on the list is Google\'s claim that it is launching a data center on Mars in 2018. The data center, named ""Ziggy Stardust,"" is designed as an off-world backup in case Earth experiences some sort of catastrophe. \n \n Image: google \n \n ""By opening a dedicated extraterrestrial cloud region, we\'re bringing the power of Google’s compute, network, and storage to the rest of the solar system, unlocking a plethora of possibilities for astronomy research, exploration of Martian natural resources and interplanetary life sciences,"" reads the very long and detailed blog post accompanying the April Fools\' gag. \n \n They even went as far as creating a data center location on Google Maps that you can explore. \n \n And while this may be a joke now, it\'s not unrealistic to imagine a very real Google data center on Mars in the decades ahead as companies like SpaceX work to colonize the red planet. \n \n Google Maps Ms. Pac-Man \n \n Finally, Google updated an old Google maps twist from 2015 by re-introducing its Pac-Man Google Maps game. In the current updated version on Android and iOS, you play Ms. Pac-Man using a map from anywhere in the world. \n \n Image: GOOGLE \n \n It\'s obvious why Google decided to rehash this one, it\'s incredibly addictive and deserves another look. Find your own neighborhood and try playing ""just one"" game and putting it down. \n \n So far, this looks like all the April Fools\' Day weirdness Google has up its collective sleeve, but we’ll keep our eyes open out for any new ones and add them as we find them.', 'In a year when every day feels like a cruel joke, it isn\'t really the time for April Fools\' Day. \n \n Maybe brands subconsciously realize that, because their April Fools\' Day pranks this year are pretty tame. At least they\'re amusing themselves with fake ways to watch TV and hail cars. \n \n Here are the notable ones so far: \n \n Amazon Petlexa \n \n Petlexa: Alexa, for your cat. Petlexa, ""allows dogs, cats, and other animals to communicate with Alexa just like you do."" Great! \n \n Netflix Live \n \n Image: screenshot/netflix \n \n Netflix uploaded its April Fools\' Day prank a day early and then canceled it the day of. \n \n Netflix Live starred Will Arnett narrating footage of microwaves and copiers. Even though the joke is under the category ""Recently Canceled by Netflix,"" you can still watch it. \n \n Hulu\'s Hu \n \n Hulu went with a commentary on patience this April Fools\' Day. Hu: TV Abbreviated shows you ""your favorite shows, all in eight seconds or less."" \n \n Click on the banner introducing the service to watch condensed clips of The Mindy Project, Seinfeld, Empire and other shows Hulu has streaming rights to. \n \n Lyft\'s Mono \n \n A few days early, Lyft rolled out Mono — a wearable that hails a Lyft for you when you raise your hand in the air (like raising your hand would do if you were hailing an actual taxi). \n \n Lyft quickly admitted the wearable was a prank, but the company did get Bella Hadid to try one out. #GetMono \n \n Learn Emoji with Duolingo \n \n Duolingo, the app that promises to teach you a language in five minutes a day, has a pretty fun proposition for April Fools. Today, the app will teach you how to speak emoji. \n \n If you have family members who are all over the place with their emoji usage (or don\'t use them at all), maybe they should check it out. Take a break from the Japanese lessons! \n \n Google \n \n Google has so many April Fools\' Day jokes it needs its own list. \n \n So far, you can play Ms. Pac-Man on Google Maps, get a ""Google Gnome"" instead of a Google Home, and control the weather with windmills if you\'re using Google Netherlands.', 'Live long and prank them. \n \n ""Star Trek"" star George Takei had everyone fooled early Saturday morning when he tweeted that he was running for Congress in California against Devin Nunes in 2018. \n \n ""Well, the cat\'s out of the bag it seems.

The young mind,"" he tweeted in September – but that didn\'t stop the comedian from reviving the Shazaam myth for April Fools\' Day. \n \n ""It was my first time directing and the studio wasn’t happy with the project,"" Sinbad said in a statement after College Humor unearthed an alleged Shazaam VHS from a shuttered Blockbuster. ""It was pulled from theatrical release. I would prefer if we all just pretended this never happened."" \n \n College Humor said in a statement, ""Like most Americans, we had weird memories of this movie existing, but just thought we were confused. Then, one of our producers found this VHS in a box behind a shut-down Blockbuster. It’s quite damaged, and most of it has been recorded over, but what’s there is classic cinema and movie magic. We\'re excited to share it with audiences at large.""', 'Rejoice, cord-cutters. HBO has announced it will launch its own online video streaming service next year, no cable TV subscription needed. \n \n Until now, HBO\'s streaming service, HBO GO, has required users to have an HBO subscription, but in an investor meeting on Wednesday, HBO chairman and CEO Richard Plepler acknowledged that this model excludes the some 10 million homes in the U.S. that are now broadband-only. And that number is only expected to grow. ""That is a large and growing opportunity that should no longer be left untapped,"" Plepler said. ""It is time to remove all barriers to those who want HBO."" \n \n For those who have been watching the cord-cutter revolution, HBO\'s move is a long time coming. The HBO GO subscription model has always felt like a half-baked attempt at the over-the-top TV market. Plus, a poorly kept secret about HBO GO has always been that you don\'t really need a subscription to watch unlimited HBO content online. You just need to know someone—or know someone who knows someone—with a subscription and is willing to share his password. That means that a whole lot of us are basically getting full access to HBO without paying a penny. With a standalone service, in other words, HBO will finally be able to collect on all that binge Game of Thrones watching you\'ve been doing on your cousin\'s boyfriend\'s roommate\'s account. \n \n What\'s most unusual about this change in events, though, is the fact that many consumers are actually ready and willing the pay HBO for this kind of thing. Two years ago, a site called TakeMyMoneyHbo.com launched, and asked people how much they\'d pay for a standalone service. The site got more than 163,000 visitors in the first 48 hours and found that the average person would pay around $12 a month. \n \n Consumers wanted this service because, with so many options for watching traditional television online—from Netflix to Hulu to Amazon Prime Instant Video—access to HBO has been one of the last remaining reasons to stick with cable. Better to pony up the $12 a month than fork over $120 or more for cable. \n \n So, why then did HBO take so long to break away from cable? The answer may be that HBO was under tremendous pressure from cable companies, who are finding themselves struggling to compete with the emergence of low-cost services like Netflix. Angering them could potentially jeopardize HBO\'s relationship with the cable companies, who could then slap HBO with higher fees for carrying their content. \n \n But in recent years, the power seems to have shifted. As HBO has become more and more beloved and cable companies have become more and more reviled, the odds of HBO winning a fight against a massive cable company are much higher. Many people still subscribe to cable to get HBO, meaning if say, Comcast, were to hit HBO with higher fees or terminate its service, Comcast might very well lose customers, too. \n \n Meanwhile, another new cultural trend may also be adding to the pressure HBO is feeling to launch such a service. It\'s not cord cutting, per se, but ""cord shaving,"" a phenomenon recently explored by The Wall Street Journal, in which consumers are keeping cable, but cutting add-on channels like ESPN or the Food Network. As more HBO-quality content emerges from companies like Netflix and Amazon, it\'s possible that this cord-shaving trend could hit HBO particularly hard if it doesn\'t act fast. \n \n HBO already tiptoed toward the unbundled future earlier this year, announcing a deal that would give Amazon Prime members unlimited access to some older HBO content. Now, it seems HBO is ready to fully take the plunge. Details on the new service\'s name, how much it will cost, and what content will be available are still unclear, but one thing is sure: cable companies should be very, very afraid.']",9,"– Need some election interference?

89,"[""A new study suggests the biblical account of the commanded annihilation of the ancient Canaanite people at the hands of the invading Israelites was a bit premature, claiming their descendants are still living just up the road, across the Lebanese border. \n \n New genetic research from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute has found that far from being destroyed, the Canaanites morphed into the inhabitants of modern Lebanon. \n \n Scientists in the United Kingdom-based genetic research center sequenced the genomes of five 4,000-year-old Canaanite individuals and compared them to other ancient and present-day populations, including a sample of 99 modern Lebanese. \n \n Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Free Sign Up \n \n The results, published July 27 in the American Journal of Human Genetics, show that 93 percent of the ancestry of modern Lebanese ancestry comes from the Canaanites. \n \n Had they been destroyed by the Israelites, who were commanded by God to annihilate them, it would have been a form of patricide. According to the study, the Canaanites were the common ancestor for several ancient peoples who inhabited the Levant during the Bronze Age, such as the Ammonites, Moabites, and Israelites. \n \n “Each achieved their own cultural identities but all shared a common genetic and ethnic root with Canaanites,” according to the authors of the new study. \n \n “For the first time we have genetic evidence for substantial continuity in the region, from the Bronze Age Canaanite population through to the present day. These results agree with the continuity seen by archaeologists,” said Dr. Claude Doumet-Serhal, co-author and director of the Sidon excavation site in Lebanon. \n \n The Canaanites, like the Israelites a Semitic-speaking people, were at the center of Bronze Age civilization and “inhabited an area bounded by Anatolia to the north, Mesopotamia to the east, and Egypt to the south, with access to Cyprus and the Aegean through the Mediterranean,” according to the study. \n \n Mystery surrounds the fate of the Canaanites, who later came to be known as the Phoenicians, as they appear in scant historical records. Although they introduced several innovations into society, including the first alphabet, other than in the Hebrew Bible — where their annihilation is clearly commanded — there are a few mentions in ancient Egyptian and Greek texts. \n \n As reported in Science, Greek legend has it that the Canaanites originally came from the East. \n \n According to the study, the Canaanite-related ancestry “derived from mixture between local Neolithic populations and eastern migrants genetically related to Chalcolithic Iranians.” The scientists estimate, “using linkage-disequilibrium decay patterns,” that the genetic mixture took place between 6,600–3,550 years ago, “coinciding with recorded massive population movements in Mesopotamia.” \n \n Further, the Eurasian ancestry in the modern Lebanese genetic samples was not present in Bronze Age Canaanites or earlier Levantines. “We estimate that this Eurasian ancestry arrived in the Levant around 3,750–2,170 years ago during a period of successive conquests by distant populations,” write the scientists. \n \n Did a Canaanite genocide occur? \n \n In Deuteronomy 20:16, the ancient Israelites are commanded by God to completely wipe out the several Canaanite peoples after the death of the Hebrew leader Joshua. \n \n “But in the cities of these peoples that the Lord your God gives you for an inheritance, you shall save alive nothing that breathes, but you shall utterly destroy them, the Hittites and the Amorites, the Canaanites and the Perizzites, the Hivites and the Jebusites, as the Lord your God has commanded.” \n \n However, according to the report, archaeological evidence does not support widespread destruction of Canaanite cities between the Bronze and Iron Ages. For example, coastal cities such as Sidon and Tyre “show continuity of occupation until the present day.” \n \n In one of the later books of the Bible, the Canaanite’s continuity is detailed, in spite of the earlier commandment for their annihilation. In Judges 3:1-3, it is described how the commandment was given so that the Israelites may learn warfare, but that remnants of the Canaanite peoples were allowed to exist, including “the five lords of the Philistines and all the Canaanites and the Sidonians and the Hivites who lived on Mount Lebanon…” \n \n The analysis of the DNA from five Canaanite skeletons found in Sidon who lived 4,000 years ago, and comparison with modern day Lebanese, paint a picture much different than the annihilation recorded in the Bible. \n \n “It was a pleasant surprise to be able to extract and analyze DNA from 4,000-year-old human remains found in a hot environment, which is not known for preserving DNA well,” said Dr. Marc Haber, from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. Haber said the team overcame the climate’s challenge by taking samples from the petrous bone in the skull, which is a very tough bone with a high density of ancient DNA. \n \n “Genetic studies using ancient DNA can expand our understanding of history, and answer questions about the likely origins and descendants of enigmatic populations like the Canaanites, who left few written records themselves,” said Dr. Chris Tyler-Smith, from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute. \n \n “The overlap between the Bronze Age and present-day Levantines suggests a degree of genetic continuity in the region,” according to the study."", ""When people in a business negotiation share not just a meal but a plate, they collaborate better and reach deals faster, according to new ... \n \n A new study found workplace incivilities has the potential to not only negatively affect an employee's sleep but their partner's as ... \n \n Less data-sharing among firms can actually lead to more collusion, economists ... \n \n Men with dyslexia have altered structural connections between the thalamus and auditory cortex on the left side of the brain, new research reveals.

Anthony Weiner rejected Democratic leaders’ private and public calls for his resignation Saturday, choosing instead to take a leave of absence from the House to seek professional treatment amid an online sex scandal that the head of the party called a “sordid affair.” \n \n Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, (D-Fla.), House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Rep. Steve Israel, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, turned on Weiner the day after it was revealed he had contacted a 17-year-old Delaware girl through social media. Though Weiner, Delaware police and the girl’s family say there was nothing indecent in the back-and-forth, the development added intrigue to the New York Democrat’s confession on Monday that he sent sexually charged text messages and photographs to six women over the past three years. \n \n Text Size - \n \n + \n \n reset VIDEO: Weiner’s teary presser POLITICO 44 \n \n For now, his vow to remain in office stands, but he didn’t appear dug in: He left open the possibility, for the first time, of leaving, with a statement that suggested he needs to be in a better mental position to make a decision about his future. \n \n “Congressman Weiner departed this morning to seek professional treatment to focus on becoming a better husband and healthier person,” Weiner’s office said in a statement provided to POLITICO. “In light of that, he will request a short leave of absence from the House of Representatives so that he can get evaluated and map out a course of treatment to make himself well. Congressman Weiner takes the views of his colleagues very seriously and has determined that he needs this time to get healthy and make the best decision possible for himself, his family and his constituents.” \n \n But the mass abandonment from party leaders means Weiner will go it alone if, after reflection and treatment, he believes he can salvage a once-promising career in which he used bombastic floor speeches, frequent cable television appearances and, ironically, an understanding of the power of social media to become an icon for national progressives. The story of Weiner’s political career hasn’t yet reached its conclusion, but the onetime protagonist is now cast as the antagonist. \n \n The decision to seek treatment buys Weiner time, but the statement from his aides suggests he might still quit rather than return to Congress after his leave of absence. \n \n Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), the former DCCC chairman and top Democrat on the House Budget Committee, added his name to the list of Democratic officials who have called on Weiner to resign. “Anthony Weiner’s repeated violation of the public trust is unacceptable,” Van Hollen said. “He can best advance the issues he fought for by resigning immediately.” \n \n In addition to Wasserman Schultz, two former DNC chairmen, Ed Rendell and Tim Kaine, have said Weiner should step down, as have several of Weiner’s rank-and-file congressional colleagues. \n \n However, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), the No. 3 Democrat in the Senate, and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) both approved of Weiner’s decision to seek treatment and did not call for his resignation. \n \n Schumer, Weiner’s former boss, said: “I am heartbroken. For those of us who are longtime friends of Anthony Weiner, his wrongful behavior is distressing and saddening. It’s clear he needs professional help, and I am glad he is seeking it.” \n \n Gillibrand said: “My heart is with Anthony’s wife and family. My office will work to ensure all the constituents of the 9th congressional District are fully served during any leave of absence by Congressman Weiner.” \n \n On Friday, FOX News reported that Wilmington-area police had visited a Delaware teenager to discuss Weiner’s electronic exchange with her. \n \n Though Weiner and the girl’s family have told news outlets that there was no sex-related communication, the revelation that he carried on a discussion of any kind with a 17-year-old girl pumped more life into a scandal that has now spanned three weekends.', 'Associated Press Condoleezza Rice\'s inclusion on the Republican ticket would scramble the race in ways few other candidates could. \n \n A new round of speculation about Mitt Romney\'s running-mate deliberations ensued after a media report mentioned an unconventional choice: former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. \n \n The Drudge Report website set Washington ablaze in another round of the vice-presidential guessing game Thursday night by posting an item attributed to ""sources"" naming her as one of the top contenders to be the presumptive Republican nominee\'s running mate. \n \n The item mentioned a fundraising email Ms. Rice, 57 years old, sent Thursday night on Mr. Romney\'s behalf as part of the campaign\'s ""Meet the VP"" drive, an initiative intended to increase the number of small-dollar donors in which the winners get to meet the candidate and his eventual running mate. \n \n A new round of speculation about Mitt Romney\'s running-mate deliberations ensued after a media report mentioned an unconventional choice: former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.

But it\'s possible the item was a trial balloon from the campaign attempting to gauge the reaction to Ms. Rice as a possible pick. \n \n The report caused outsize fanfare because Romney campaign manager Matt Rhoades has a close working relationship with Matt Drudge, who launched the site in the 1990s and made his preference for the former Massachusetts governor clear during the Republican primary. \n \n Mr. Rhoades sent an email to supporters late Thursday night alerting them to the campaign\'s latest fundraising push, telling the recipients, ""Sometime between now and the Republican convention, Mitt will be announcing his choice for VP."" \n \n Earlier this week, Mr. Romney told a crowd in Grand Junction, Colo., ""I can tell you…the person I choose, you will look at and say, well, that\'s a person who could be president, if that were necessary."" He said, ""And that, for me, is the most important single criteria."" \n \n Ms. Rice\'s assets are obvious: She\'s a woman; she\'s black; she has extensive foreign-policy experience; and her inclusion on the ticket would scramble the race in ways few other candidates could. \n \n Her liabilities are also easy to cite: She has favored abortion rights, a position Mr. Romney has moved away from; she has never run for elected office; she waged frequent battles with former Vice President Dick Cheney; and many conservatives believe she was soft on Iran and North Korea policies during the George W. Bush administration. \n \n Her tenure in that administration would also feed Democratic criticism that Mr. Romney represents another four years of Mr. Bush. \n \n Still, in a CNN poll of Republicans in April, Ms. Rice drew the highest levels of support as a possible running mate. \n \n Twenty-six percent of the respondents picked her, compared with 21% for former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum and 14% for both New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. The poll showed Ms. Rice to have an approval rating of 80%. \n \n Who Might Be a Romney Running Mate?

Per a study in the American Journal of Human Genetics, researchers from the UK's Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute sequenced the genomes of five 4,000-year-old Canaanites, as well as 99 people now residing in Lebanon—DNA evidence that enabled the scientists to establish ancestry. The study results show an overwhelming majority of the genetic makeup (93%) of today's Lebanese can be traced back to the Canaanites, per the Times of Israel. Study co-author Chris Tyler-Smith calls that percentage ""quite surprising,"" given the ""enormously complex history of this region,"" per ScienceDaily. The Bible's Book of Deuteronomy lays out what was to happen to the Canaanites: ""Completely destroy them ... as the Lord your God has commanded you. Otherwise, they will teach you to follow all the detestable things they do."" But some Bible verses contradict the story of total annihilation, and the researchers write that ""no archaeological evidence has so far been found to support widespread destruction of Canaanite cities between the Bronze and Iron Ages."" The Canaanites made a major cultural impact during the Bronze Age, including introducing what's believed to have been the first alphabet. This new discovery sheds a bit more light on the rather mysterious group, who didn't leave much in the way of written records. (This find could reveal the truth about Goliath's people.)"
90,"['Dr. Kazdin promotes a program called the ABCs, which stands for antecedents, behaviors and consequences. The antecedent is the setup, telling a child, specifically, what you want them to do before you want them to do it. Behaviors are where the behavior is defined and shaped, modeled by the parent. And the consequence involves an expression of approval when that behavior is performed, an over-the top Broadway-style belt-it-to-the-back-row expression of praise with an accompanying physical gesture of approval. \n \n So instead of yelling at your kid every night for the shoes strewn across the floor, ask him in the morning if he can put his shoes away when he comes home. Make sure when you come home that you put your own shoes away. And if your child puts his shoes away, or even puts them closer to where they’re supposed to be, tell him that he did a great job and then hug him. \n \n The ABC method of praise is a highly specific technique. You have to be effusive, so you actually have to put a big dumb smile on your face and even wave your hands in the air. Next thing is you have to say, in a very high, cheerful voice, exactly what you’re praising. And then the third part is you have to touch the child and give him some kind of nonverbal praise. The silliness is a feature, not a bug. It makes the kid notice the praise that accompanies correct behavior. And that’s the point. \n \n “We want to build habits,” Dr. Kazdin said. “The practice actually changes the brain, and in the process of that, the behaviors that you want to get rid of, having all kinds of temper tantrums and all the fights, all that just disappears.” Furthermore, he noted, “as a side effect, when you do these things, the parents’ depression and stress in fact go down and family relations pick up.” \n \n If our kids behave better, then we won’t feel like yelling. And if we don’t yell, our kids will behave better.', ""Abstract Bacterial and viral infections are often clinically indistinguishable, leading to inappropriate patient management and antibiotic misuse. Bacterial-induced host proteins such as procalcitonin, C-reactive protein (CRP), and Interleukin-6, are routinely used to support diagnosis of infection. However, their performance is negatively affected by inter-patient variability, including time from symptom onset, clinical syndrome, and pathogens. Our aim was to identify novel viral-induced host proteins that can complement bacterial-induced proteins to increase diagnostic accuracy. Initially, we conducted a bioinformatic screen to identify putative circulating host immune response proteins. The resulting 600 candidates were then quantitatively screened for diagnostic potential using blood samples from 1002 prospectively recruited patients with suspected acute infectious disease and controls with no apparent infection. For each patient, three independent physicians assigned a diagnosis based on comprehensive clinical and laboratory investigation including PCR for 21 pathogens yielding 319 bacterial, 334 viral, 112 control and 98 indeterminate diagnoses; 139 patients were excluded based on predetermined criteria. The best performing host-protein was TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) (area under the curve [AUC] of 0.89; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.86 to 0.91), which was consistently up-regulated in viral infected patients. We further developed a multi-protein signature using logistic-regression on half of the patients and validated it on the remaining half. The signature with the highest precision included both viral- and bacterial-induced proteins: TRAIL, Interferon gamma-induced protein-10, and CRP (AUC of 0.94; 95% CI, 0.92 to 0.96). The signature was superior to any of the individual proteins (P<0.001), as well as routinely used clinical parameters and their combinations (P<0.001). It remained robust across different physiological systems, times from symptom onset, and pathogens (AUCs 0.87-1.0). The accurate differential diagnosis provided by this novel combination of viral- and bacterial-induced proteins has the potential to improve management of patients with acute infections and reduce antibiotic misuse. \n \n Citation: Oved K, Cohen A, Boico O, Navon R, Friedman T, Etshtein L, et al.

Antibiotic underuse due to delayed or missed diagnosis is also common (24%-40% of all bacterial infections) [3–6], and may result in prolonged disease state and medical complications [7–10]. A major cause of antibiotic overuse and underuse is the difficulty of distinguishing between bacterial and non-bacterial (mostly viral) etiologies [3,11]. While routinely used microbiological diagnostic tests such as culture, serology, and more recently nucleic acid based tests (e.g., RT-PCR) can assist the clinician in the etiological determination of the underlying infectious process, several challenges remain. These include: (i) pathogen detection in cases where the infection site is not readily accessible (e.g., pneumonia), or is unknown (e.g., fever without source); (ii) time to microbiological laboratory results may be lengthy (hours or days); (iii) interpreting whether a detected bacteria is the disease causing agent or a mere colonizer [12–14], and (iv) identification of a virus does not preclude the possibility that an undetected bacteria may be the cause of the underlying illness (i.e. a case of mixed infection with both virus and bacteria) [15,16]. An approach that has the potential to address these challenges relies on monitoring the host's immune-response to infection, rather than direct pathogen detection [17]. Recent studies examining host-RNA signatures in response to different infections show promising results [17–21]. However, quantitative and rapid measurements (within minutes) of multiple host-RNAs in the clinical setting remain a technical challenge, especially at the point-of-care where most antibiotics prescriptions are made. Circulating host-proteins are an attractive alternative as they can be rapidly measured at the point of need. Proteins that are routinely used to support diagnosis of infection include procalcitonin, C-reactive protein (CRP), and Interleukin-6 (IL-6) [22]. However, these markers are sensitive to inter-patient variability, including time from symptom onset, clinical syndrome, and pathogen species [22–27]. For example, multiple studies found that procalcitonin is valuable for guiding antimicrobial therapy duration and for predicting disease severity [28–30], however its diagnostic accuracy for detecting bacterial etiology in cases such as sepsis and pneumonia has been challenged [23,31–34]. Elevated CRP levels are suggestive of a bacterial infection [35], but similar levels may be observed in patients with some viral strains (e.g., adenovirus and influenza) [36], and inflammatory diseases. While IL-6 rises quickly in response to a bacterial trigger, its utility is dampened by a limited window of opportunity for measurement due to its rapid decay within approximately 36 hours [37]. To improve the performance of individual host-proteins, combinations of several proteins into a single predictive score have been proposed [11,38–43]. However, to date, in most studies these combinations provided only limited-to-moderate diagnostic improvement over individual proteins. This may be explained by the predominant focus on bacterial-induced proteins (e.g., procalcitonin, IL-6, IL-8, SAA, CRP and sTREM), which share biological pathways, and are thus inherently sensitive to the same factors. Therefore, we reasoned that the combination of unrelated host-proteins participating in different pathways may improve diagnostic accuracy. In particular, the inclusion of new host-proteins that are up-regulated in viral infections may be an innovative complement to bacterially-induced proteins in current clinical use. Accordingly, the aims of the present study were threefold: to perform a large-scale screen of novel and traditional host-proteins; to integrate the findings into a computational signature for accurate diagnosis of acute bacterial (or mixed) versus viral infections; and to validate the signature on an independent cohort of patients. \n \n Materials and Methods Ethics Statement We prospectively recruited 1002 patients between August 2009 and November 2013 from Hillel-Yaffe and Bnai-Zion Medical Centers, Israel (NCT01917461). The study was approved by the Hillel-Yaffe Medical Center Institutional Review Board (approval ID 0071–10-HYMC), and the Bnai-Zion Medical Center Institutional Review Board (approval ID 0084–12-BNZ). The study was conducted according to the guidelines and recommendations of Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant or legal guardian, as applicable. Study population Pediatric patients (≤18 years) were recruited from pediatric emergency departments, pediatric wards and surgical departments, and adults (>18 years) from emergency departments, internal medicine departments and surgical departments. Inclusion criteria for the infectious disease cohort included: clinical suspicion of an acute infectious disease, peak fever >37.5°C since onset of symptoms, and duration of symptoms ≤12 days. Inclusion criteria for the control group included: clinical impression of a non-infectious disease (e.g., trauma, stroke and myocardial infarction), or healthy subjects. Exclusion criteria included: evidence of acute infection in the two weeks preceding enrollment; congenital immune deficiency; treatment with immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapy; active malignancy; and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1, or hepatitis B/C virus infection (Fig. 1A). Importantly, in order to enable broad generalizability, antibiotic treatment was not an exclusion criterion.

A nasal swab was obtained for microbiological investigation including two multiplex-PCR diagnostic assays (Seeplex RV15 [n = 713; 16 viral strains] and Seeplex PB6 [n = 633; six bacterial strains]), and a blood sample was obtained for host-protein measurements. Additional samples were obtained as deemed appropriate by the physician (e.g., urine [n = 420], stool [n = 66] and blood [n = 420] samples in cases of suspected urinary tract infection [UTI], gastroenteritis [GI] and bacteremia respectively) (S1 Data). Radiological tests were obtained at the discretion of the physician (e.g., chest X-ray for suspected lower respiratory tract infection [LRTI]). Thirty days after enrollment, disease course and response to treatment were recorded. Establishing the reference standard For determining the infectious etiology we created a rigorous expert panel reference standard [44], which follows the broadly accepted recommendations of the Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy (STARD)[45], and the NHS Health Technology Assessment (NHS-HTA) for evaluation of diagnostic tests [46]. First, we performed a thorough clinical and microbiological investigation for each patient as described above. This was followed by a review of the data collected throughout the disease course by a panel of three physicians. For adult patients the panel included the attending physician and two infectious disease specialists, while for children it included the attending pediatrician, an infectious disease expert and a senior attending pediatrician. Each panel member assigned one of the following diagnostic labels to each patient: (i) bacterial; (ii) viral; (iii) no apparent infectious disease or healthy (controls); and (iv) indeterminate. Patients diagnosed by the panel as having mixed infections (bacteria and virus) were labeled as bacterial because they are managed similarly. The panel members were blinded to the labeling of their peers to prevent group pressure or influential personality bias as recommended by NHS-HTA [46]. Importantly, they were blinded to the results of the signature. Final diagnosis was determined by panel majority (i.e. at least two of the three panel members assigned the same label) (Fig. 1A). To examine the generalizability of the results it is recommended to examine whether alternative reference standard strategies affect performance [44,46]. Thus, two additional strategies were applied: (i) Unanimous sub-cohort: Patients were assigned the same label by all three panel members; and (ii) Microbiologically confirmed sub-cohort: Bacterial labeled patients were unanimously diagnosed by all three panel members and had one of the following microbiological confirmations: bacteremia (with positive blood culture), bacterial meningitis (with positive CSF culture), lower UTI (with positive urine culture), upper UTI (with positive urine culture and ultrasound demonstration of renal involvement) or peritonsillar abscess (proven by surgical exploration or computerized tomography). Viral labeled patients were unanimously diagnosed by panel members and had at least one laboratory detected virus. Samples, procedures and protein measurements Venous blood samples were stored at 4°C for up to 5 hours, subsequently fractionated into plasma, serum and total leukocytes, and stored at -80°C. Nasal swabs and stool samples were stored at 4°C for up to 72 hours and subsequently transported to a certified service laboratory for multiplex PCRs. In the screening phase, host-proteins were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent-assay (ELISA), Luminex, protein-arrays and flow-cytometry. The three proteins used in the final signature were measured as follows: CRP using either Cobas-6000, Cobas-Integra-400/800, or Modular-Analytics-P800 (Roche); TRAIL and IP-10 using commercial ELISA kits (MeMed Diagnostics). Statistical analysis Primary analysis was based on AUC, Sensitivity (TP/P), Specificity (TN/N), Positive likelihood ratio (LR+ = Sensitivity/[1-Specificity]), Negative likelihood ratio (LR− = [1–Sensitivity]/Specificity) and Diagnostic odds ratio (DOR = LR+/LR−), where P, N, TP and TN correspond to positives (bacterial patients), negatives (viral patients), true positives, and true negatives, respectively. Sample size calculations are presented in S2 Data. Half of the patients in the study were randomly assigned to the training-set (used for protein screening and model development), and the remaining half to a mutually exclusive validation-set (used to assess model performance). Importantly, none of the validation-set patients were used to train the algorithms, or to select the proteins (Fig. 1). A multinomial logistic regression model was used to integrate the levels of multiple proteins into a bacterial likelihood score. Patients whose probability of bacterial infection was intermediate, between 0.35 and 0.55, were flagged. We use the term 'equivocal immune response' to describe these patients because their profile borders between bacterial and viral host-responses. Statistical analysis was performed using MATLAB (MathWorks). \n \n Discussion The host-protein signature presented here addresses several challenges of current microbiological testing. (i) The difficulty of diagnosing patients whose infection site is inaccessible or unknown. The signature accurately diagnosed such cases, including LRTI (AUC 0.95±0.03, n = 153) and fever without source (AUC = 0.97±0.03, n = 123). (ii) Prolonged time to results (hours to days). The signature measures soluble proteins, which can be quantitated using an ELISA format. Moreover, these proteins are readily amenable to rapid measurement (within minutes) using hospital-deployed automated immunoassay machines and point-of-care devices. (iii) Identification of a virus does not exclude the possibility of mixed infection involving an undetected bacteria [15,16]. The signature classifies mixed infections with pure bacterial infections, thus prompting physicians to manage both groups similarly with regard to antibiotic treatment. (iv) A significant drawback of microbiological tests, PCRs in particular, is the detection of potential colonizers in subjects with non-bacterial diseases [12–14]. The signature performance was unaffected by the presence or absence of potential colonizers. The proteins included in the signature are not limited to well-established bacterial biomarkers. Six hundred host-proteins were screened (Fig. 1B), which to the best of our knowledge, is the largest quantitative proteome screening of patients with acute infection to date. Bioinformatics analysis was then used to identify a combination of three proteins with complementary dynamics: (i) We found that TRAIL was induced in response to a wide range of viral infections and surprisingly, also exhibited significantly reduced levels in bacterial infected patients (Fig. 2 and 4). Such opposing dynamics make TRAIL particularly suitable for distinguishing between bacterial and viral infections. The increase in viral patients may be related to TRAIL's role in programed cell death, which is a mechanism of infected cells to inhibit the virus from spreading [47]. The underlying reason for its reduction in bacterial infections warrants further studies. (ii) IP-10 levels were highly elevated in viral patients and less elevated in bacterial patients (Fig. 2 and 4). (iii) CRP levels were highly elevated in bacterial patients and less elevated in viral patients (Fig. 2 and 4). While the utility of increased CRP levels to suggest bacterial infections is well established [49], viral-induced proteins such as TRAIL are not used in clinical practice. The combination of novel viral-induced proteins that complement routinely used bacterial-induced proteins, substantially contributed to the signature’s robustness across a wide range of subgroups.

TRAIL, IP-10 and CRP participate in different signaling pathways and exhibit complementary dynamics in response to bacterial (B) and viral (V) infections. PAMPs—pathogen-associated molecular patterns; PGN—peptidoglycan; LPS—lipopolysaccharide. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0120012.g004 Currently, there is no single perfect reference standard for diagnosing bacterial and viral infections in a large fraction of the patients with symptoms of an acute infection. Several strategies can be applied, each with strengths and limitations [46]. Clinical suspicion confirmed by positive microbiological lab results is often used as a reference standard. However, limitations include false-positives due to technical issues (e.g., culture contamination [50,51] and uncertainty due to viral and bacterial carriage [12–14]). Moreover, these patients may represent the more severely ill, and potentially easier to diagnose cases, leading to overly optimistic performance. The expert panel diagnosis is another widely used approach [44,46]. It has the advantage of capturing a wider spectrum of illness severities including difficult-to-diagnose cases, and is therefore likely to generalize well to clinical practice [44,46]. However, the absence of a microbiological confirmation may lead to higher rates of mislabeling. Since these methods complement each other we applied both. A microbiologically confirmed reference standard was used for proof-of-principle on a sub-cohort of the patients yielding particularly high performance (AUC = 0.96±0.02), and the expert panel reference standard was used to generalize the results to the entire patient cohort (AUC = 0.94±0.02). The latter results are more conservative and likely to represent the performance of the signature in the real clinical setting. A potential limitation of the current study is the heterogeneity of the patient cohort (multiple clinical syndromes, pathogen species, and time from onset of symptoms). We deliberately selected a diverse cohort in order to identify a signature that is insensitive to the inter-patient variability typically encountered in clinical settings. However, this diversity makes it more challenging to control for confounding factors. Although we did not identify significant confounders, follow-up studies on homogenous subgroups are warranted. Finally, the present signature has broader applications beyond the scope of the present study that warrant further investigation. Future studies should seek to replicate our findings with patients of different ethnic populations, particularly in countries with a high prevalence of endemic chronic pathogens (e.g. Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Plasmodium and HIV). Follow-up time course studies that assess whether the signature can predict response to treatment and patient prognosis are also warranted. Despite advances in infectious disease diagnosis, timely identification of bacterial infections remains challenging, leading to antibiotic misuse with its profound health and economic consequences. To address the need for better treatment guidance, we developed and validated a signature that combines novel and traditional host-proteins for differentiating between bacterial and viral infections. Our finding in a large sample size of patients is promising. The translational benefit could have a broad impact on the diagnosis and management of patients with acute infections. \n \n Acknowledgments We thank Harel Todar and Dr. Mira Peled Kamar for logistic support, Mr. Carlos G.

Parents have figured out that there's a better way than spanking—and now it's time for yelling to experience that same reckoning. Most parents today yell at their kids, and in the New York Times, Stephen Marche calls the practice ""the most widespread parental stupidity around today."" Studies have found that shouting at kids can lead to increases in anxiety, stress, depression, and behavioral problems and decreases in self-esteem. It makes parents look out of control and weak, and all it accomplishes is teaching kids to yell themselves. ""Yelling, even more than spanking, is the response of a person who doesn’t know what else to do,"" Marche writes—before explaining what else you can do. He highlights the ABCs of parenting, a process that does require advance planning: A: antecedents. Instead of yelling at your children every time they leave their shoes strewn around the room, clearly explain to them what you want them to do—before you want them to do it. In this case, talk to them in the morning about putting their shoes away when they come home from school. B: behaviors. Define, shape, and model the behavior you want. Put your own shoes away, and help your kids understand what to do. C: consequences. When your child puts his or her shoes away, or even gets them closer to where they're supposed to go, go over-the-top with praise, both verbal and nonverbal (touching). ""The beauty of having a system is that instead of reacting after your kids do something bad, instead of waiting for them to mess up and then getting angry, you have a conscious plan,"" writes Marche. His full explanation of the system is here."

She\'s walked around the country and will end her petition in Washington, D.C. \n \n MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: \n \n This week, thousands of Americans are getting ready to visit Washington, D.C., to attend the inauguration or protests or other events. But we want to introduce you to a woman from Fort Worth, Texas, who\'s planning a special visit to the nation\'s capitol for a different reason. \n \n OPAL LEE: I kept telling family and friends that wanted to do it, and I think they thought, well, she\'s delusional. \n \n MARTIN: That\'s Opal Lee. She is on a quest to make June 19 a federal holiday. If you know your American history, then you know that June 19 is known as Juneteenth. It marks the day in 1865 when Union soldiers arrived in Galveston, Texas, and brought news that slavery had been abolished some two and a half years earlier. Oh, and let me just mention Opal Lee is 91 years old. \n \n LEE: I just thought if a little, old lady in tennis shoes was out there walking, somebody would take notice. \n \n MARTIN: It started out as a simple walk around her church in Fort Worth. \n \n LEE: But I got together some people here. We had a rally, and so after the rally, the people walked with me, and we\'ve been going ever since. \n \n MARTIN: Now she\'s made her Juneteenth walk throughout the country from Texas to Colorado to Illinois. Her last stop is the steps of the U.S. Capitol. Even though, some 45 states recognize Juneteenth in some way or another, she says the holiday is so important it should be recognized as a federal holiday. \n \n LEE: Slaves didn\'t free themselves. There were abolitionists and people of all persuasions that worked untiringly to have slavery abolished. \n \n MARTIN: Opal Lee has been trying to get President Obama to make Juneteenth a national holiday before he leaves office. But as that date draws near, she says, she hasn\'t gotten any sign that the president\'s onboard. But she\'s not discouraged. \n \n LEE: I have no idea, but I\'ll be trying. \n \n MARTIN: And she says she will keep pushing to make Juneteenth a national holiday when Donald Trump becomes president. \n \n Copyright © 2017 NPR.

Opal Lee, 90, set out from her home in Fort Worth, Texas, in September with a single goal: a long walk, with a final stop in Washington, DC, where she wants to present her petition to President Obama calling for a federal holiday on June 19. That's the day—""Juneteenth""—that Union soldiers came to Texas in 1865 with the news that slavery had been abolished more than two years earlier. What started out as a stroll around Lee's church last August mushroomed into something bigger. ""The people walked with me, and we've been going ever since,"" Lee tells NPR. ""I just thought if a little, old lady in tennis shoes was out there walking, somebody would take notice."" She was right. Invitations started coming, and Lee was happy to take them—in states ranging from Colorado and Ohio and Pennsylvania and Virginia, in a quest to add 100,000 signatures to her petition. ""I walk wherever I’m invited,"" Lee told CBS Pittsburgh during a stop in November. ""Two and a half miles in the morning and two and a half in the afternoon to symbolize that slaves were later told that they were free."" Lee, who collects donations on GoFundMe, is due in the nation's capital next week, where she hopes to make her case to Obama and lawmakers. Although 45 states count Juneteenth as a holiday, Lee says federal recognition is important. ""It would be the oldest holiday of significance for black people in these United States, so it needs to be observed and celebrated,"" she tells Fox4. ""Slaves didn't free themselves,"" she adds, per NPR. ""There were abolitionists and people of all persuasions that worked untiringly to have slavery abolished."" And if her pitch falls short next week? There's a new president coming and Lee plans to keep pushing with him. (Dallas once voted on slavery reparations.)"

93,"['(HealthDay News) -- Babies process and preserve memories during those many naps they take during the day, a new study suggests. ""We discovered that sleeping shortly after learning helps infants to retain memories over extended periods of time,"" said study author Sabine Seehagen, a child and adolescent psychology researcher with Ruhr University Bochum in Germany. ""In both of our experiments, only those infants who took an extended nap for at least half an hour within four hours after learning remembered the information."" The study doesn\'t definitively confirm that the naps themselves help the memories stick, but the researchers believe that is happening. ""While people might assume that infants learn best when they are wide awake, our findings suggest that the time just before infants go down for sleep can be a particularly valuable learning opportunity,"" Seehagen said. Scientists have long linked more sleep to better memory, but it\'s been unclear what happens when babies spend a significant amount of time sleeping. \n \n In the new study, researchers launched two experiments. In each one, babies aged 6 months or 12 months were taught how to remove mittens from animal puppets. Then some of the babies took a nap for a half-hour and some didn\'t. A total of 216 babies were tested. \n \n Then the researchers tested the babies to see if they remembered how to remove the mittens either four or 24 hours later. \n \n The researchers found that only the babies who\'d taken naps after learning actually remembered what they\'d learned, especially after 24 hours. \n \n Study author Seehagen said it\'s ""quite unlikely"" that the babies who didn\'t nap remember less because they were tired. Still, she said more research is needed to confirm the results. \n \n So, how many naps do babies need and how long should they be? \n \n ""The small number of studies makes it difficult to make firm recommendations to parents,"" said Angela Lukowski, an assistant professor of psychology and social behavior at the University of California, Irvine. \n \n However, ""the lesson for parents seems to be that napping after learning may help infants remember information over time,"" she said. She added that naps of at least 30 minutes seem to be helpful, although there hasn\'t been much, if any, research into shorter naps. \n \n As for adults, don\'t worry about napping as a memory aid. ""There are many studies in the literature showing the benefit of naps for adults, but adults do not need to nap to retain new memories,"" said Rebecca Gomez, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Arizona. \n \n The new study is published in this week\'s issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. \n \n More information \n \n Visit Harvard Medical School\'s Healthy Sleep website for more about sleep, learning and memory.', 'Because most babies at those ages are not yet talking, the researchers had to find a nonverbal way to measure how the timing of sleep influenced the strength of a memory. Four furry puppets--two resembling mice and two resembling rabbits, each wearing a detachable felt mitten on one hand--helped researchers infer whether or not a baby had successfully committed his or her experience with the puppets to memory and stored that information for later use.', 'The potential benefits of infant sleep for memory processing are largely unexplored. Here we show evidence that having an extended nap (≥30 min) within 4 h of learning helps 6- and 12-month-old infants to retain their memories for new behaviors across a 4- and 24-h delay. These results suggest that infants rely on frequent naps for the formation of long-term memories. \n \n Abstract \n \n Human infants devote the majority of their time to sleeping. However, very little is known about the role of sleep in early memory processing. Here we test 6- and 12-mo-old infants’ declarative memory for novel actions after a 4-h [Experiment (Exp.) 1] and 24-h delay (Exp. 2). Infants in a nap condition took an extended nap (≥30 min) within 4 h after learning, whereas infants in a no-nap condition did not. A comparison with age-matched control groups revealed that after both delays, only infants who had napped after learning remembered the target actions at the test. Additionally, after the 24-h delay, memory performance of infants in the nap condition was significantly higher than that of infants in the no-nap condition. This is the first experimental evidence to our knowledge for an enhancing role of sleep in the consolidation of declarative memories in the first year of life.', 'Recently, in teenage internet circles, the phrase “Netflix and chill” has been inescapable. \n \n It’s a phrase that means, roughly, “hooking up.” But it’s a lot more complicated than that. “Netflix and chill” is a classic case of social media-fueled semantic drift. It began as a plain, descriptive phrase (“Can’t wait to leave work so I can watch Netflix and chill!”), and stayed that way for several years before acquiring a loose sexual connotation (“Wanna come over for Netflix and chill? ;)”) and, eventually becoming a known code phrase (“He said he loves me, but I know he just wants to Netflix and chill”). \n \n As with most recent internet slang, “Netflix and chill” seems to have originated on Black Twitter before migrating to Instagram, Tumblr, Vine, and the outer reaches of Memeland.

Now new research in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences suggests that naps help babies form new memories, and that when a nap directly follows a new activity the baby is far likelier to recall it the next day than if that child doesn't nap until four hours after the activity, reports the Los Angeles Times. ""In both of our experiments, only those infants who took an extended nap for at least half an hour within four hours after learning remembered the information,"" the study's lead author tells HealthDay News. To test a baby's recall, researchers studied 216 babies ages 6 months and 12 months. They demonstrated how to remove mittens from animal puppets, and found that those who then took naps at least 30 minutes long (and typically more like 80) were better able to recall how to remove the mittens 24 hours later than those who didn't nap until four hours later. Whether a baby napped just before the experiment made no difference. The authors also hypothesize that because the hippocampal region—key to memory formation—is so small in babies, it may only be able to store smaller chunks of information, hence the need for frequent sleep early in life. (Other research shows a newborn's brain grows 1% a day.)"

In the exchange, police tell NBC10 the doctor returned fire with his own gun, critically wounding the suspect. NBC10\'s George Spencer has the latest on the investigation. (Published Thursday, July 24, 2014) \n \n A female case worker was killed and a doctor shot when a psychiatric patient opened fire on them Thursday in a wellness center on the campus of a Delaware County, Pennsylvania, hospital, officials say. \n \n Officials say that patient was then shot by the doctor, who returned fire from his own gun. \n \n The shootout took place around 2:20 p.m. Thursday inside a doctor\'s office in the psychiatric unit at the Sister Marie Lenahan Wellness Center, officials say. The center is located along the 1500 block of Lansdowne Avenue in Darby, Pa. That\'s located across from Mercy-Fitzgerald hospital, on its campus. \n \n The gunman, identified as Richard Plotts, of Upper Darby, had come to the unit with his caseworker, 53-year-old Theresa Hunt of Philadelphia, according to Delaware County District Attorney Jack Whelan. They then went behind closed doors in a doctor\'s third floor office when a confrontation occurred. \n \n IMAGES: Mercy-Fitzgerald Hospital Shooting \n \n “A worker did confirm that he heard some loud arguing going on. They came in and they actually opened the door and saw him pointing a gun at the doctor. They did not notice the case worker at that point. They shut the door very quietly and one immediately called 911,"" Whelan said. \n \n The DA said a short time went by and then gunfire erupted from Plotts\' gun. Plotts has had run-ins with the doctor\'s and hospital staff in the past, Whelan said. \n \n Both the doctor, identified as Dr. Lee Silverman, and the case worker were hit by the gunfire. The woman was fatally shot in the small office, and the doctor was grazed in the head, Whelan said. \n \n Silverman also pulled out his weapon and fired upon the suspect, the preliminary investigation showed. Plotts was hit three times in the torso, Whelan said. \n \n Other doctors and case workers then rushed into the room and tackled the man to the ground, wrestling with him for the weapon. \n \n “We’re not exactly sure what had occurred and what might have precipitated this particular incident,"" Whelan said.

In 2008, he bought a 53-acre section of Martins Beach near Half Moon Bay, about 30 miles south of San Francisco. \n \n In California, all beaches are open to the public up to the “mean high tide line”, broadly defined as the portion of the beach where the sand is wet. \n \n To honor this, the previous owners of the land had given members of the public access to the beach via a private road, charging a fee for parking. It was a popular spot for fishing, picnicking and surfing. \n \n Silicon Valley billionaire demands $30m to restore access to former public beach Read more \n \n When Khosla took over the property, he initially continued to allow public access, but in 2010 he closed the gate and painted over the billboard welcoming people to the beach. This prompted multiple lawsuits from campaign groups seeking continued access to Martins Beach and the introduction of new state legislation. \n \n Khosla’s lawyers have now filed a suit against the California coastal commission, state lands commission and San Mateo County, claiming that state and local officials have unfairly and irrationally targeted Khosla to force him to either keep the beach road open year-round for a small entrance fee or apply for a permit to close the beach. \n \n Filed on 30 September, the complaint argues that both commissions and San Mateo County have engaged “in an intentional course of conduct to harass, coerce and single out” the owners of the land and “frustrate their legitimate private property rights for purely personal and political reasons”. Such conduct violates Khosla’s constitutional rights, the complaint states. \n \n Khosla’s lawyers point out that the Deeney family, which owned the property from the 1900s to 2008, was not subject to the same scrutiny. It was the Deeney family who installed a fence, locked gate and “no trespassing” signs, and they would lock the gate to close the road to the beach “any time they felt like it”. \n \n “It was routinely closed for private events and in the winter. They did not apply for a permit and were never told by any public official or entity that a permit was required,” said Khosla’s attorney, Dori Yob, in a statement. \n \n “However, when the subsequent owner continued these practices they were met with threats and harassment in an attempt to coerce them to forfeit their private property rights and allow public access to the property on terms of the County and Coastal Commission’s choosing,” she added. \n \n Yob also said there had been “extensive misreporting” in the media about the case, including the assertion, first made in the New York Times, that Khosla offered to sell access rights to the beach for $30m. “There was never an offer to sell,” she said. \n \n Yob points out that the Deeney family sold the property because it was unprofitable and that the state had an opportunity to buy it but decided not to. “Now it wants for free what they did not want to pay for,” Yob said. \n \n The Surfrider Foundation, a group that has campaigned to restore public access to the beach, disagrees with Yob’s interpretation of events. \n \n “To allege unfair treatment is absurd,” said the foundation’s legal director, Angela Howe, in a statement. “Khosla is merely being asked by the county, state lands commission and coastal commission to follow the law and honor the beach access rights of California citizens.” \n \n “I don’t know how state agencies could harass and coerce such a powerful man,” she added in a phone interview. “It’s almost laughable.” \n \n The Deeneys wanted people to enjoy the beach and worked with local officials to make that possible, she said. Khosla is being treated differently than the Deeney family because he acted very differently – with “total disregard” for the public’s right to access and enjoy the beach. \n \n “Martins Beach is part of the fabric of the community of Half Moon Bay and has been open for generations to the public,” said Howe. \n \n “As San Francisco is becoming gentrified, you are getting a lot of money from Silicon Valley taking away public resources. This makes it especially offensive to the everyman.”']",2,"– Police near Philadelphia say a psychiatric patient opened fire inside his doctor's office today, killing his caseworker and injuring the doctor—but the doctor then pulled a gun of his own and shot the patient three times, reports the Philadelphia Inquirer.

""We're not sure exactly what happened,"" says the Delaware County DA of today's incident at the Sister Marie Lenahan Wellness Center in Darby.

96,"['Mark Lane, the defense lawyer, social activist and author who concluded in a blockbuster book in the mid-1960s that Lee Harvey Oswald could not have acted alone in killing President John F. Kennedy, a thesis supported in part by the House Select Committee on Assassinations in 1979, died on Tuesday at his home in Charlottesville, Va. He was 89. \n \n The cause was a heart attack, his friend and paralegal Sue Herndon said. \n \n The Kennedy assassination, one of the manifest turning points of the 20th century, was the pivotal moment in Mr. Lane’s life and career. He would go on to raise the possibility of conspiracy in the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. five years later, but it was his Kennedy inquiry that made his name. \n \n Before the president’s murder on Nov. 22, 1963, Mr. Lane was a minor figure in New York’s legal and political circles. He had organized rent strikes, opposed bomb shelter programs, joined the Freedom Riders, took on civil rights cases and was active in the New York City Democratic Party. He was elected a State Assemblyman in 1960 and served one term. \n \n After the Kennedy murder, Mr. Lane devoted much of the next three decades to its investigation. Almost immediately he began the Citizens’ Committee of Inquiry, interviewed witnesses, collected evidence and delivered speeches on the assassination in the United States and in Europe, where he befriended Bertrand Russell, the British philosopher, who became an early supporter of Mr. Lane’s efforts.', 'A champion of the second-shooter conspiracy theory behind the John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theory has died — just a year before all records of the president’s death are to be made available to the public. \n \n Mark Lane, died of a heart attack Tuesday night at his home in Charlottesville, Virginia, a publicist’s statement said. He was 89. \n \n Lane was most known for his 1966 bestseller “Rush to Judgment,” which criticized the Warren Commission’s report on the assassination. The book pointed out inaccuracies and suggested a second gunman, in addition to Lee Harvey Oswald, fired at Kennedy on Nov. 22, 1963 in Dallas, from what Lane called the “grassy knoll.” \n \n The Commission\'s report will be completely released to the public in 2017. \n \n Remembering John F. Kennedy \n \n Lane\'s book sparked theories that JFK was killed as part of a conspiracy — something the House committee on Assassinations admitted was likely true in 1979. \n \n The committee also concluded that it was highly possible that a second shooter was at the scene, though no other gunman has ever been identified. \n \n The pivotal conspiracy book was later made into a documentary in 1967, and turned into the film “Executive Action” in 1973. \n \n Lane believed that there was a shooter on the grassy knoll that helped assassinate JFK in 1963, and that Lee Harvey Oswald did not act on his own. (AP) \n \n Lane was born in Brooklyn on Feb. 24, 1927, and went on to earn his law degree from Brooklyn College in 1951. \n \n The politically active author also served one term in the New York State Assembly, starting in 1960. \n \n Lane went on to investigate the Martin Luther King Jr. assassination, and was a lawyer for the civil rights leader\'s killer, James Earl Ray. \n \n In Mark Lane\'s breakout novel ""Rush to Judgment,"" he criticized the Warren Commission\'s report for inaccuracies on JFK\'s assassination. \n \n After Ray’s death in 1998, Lane still maintained his former client\'s innocence, accusing the Tennessee and Federal Bureaus of Investigation of suppressing evidence that would have acquitted Ray. \n \n “The death of James Earl Ray effectively ends any hope that the courts might provide a new trial for him and the truth for the American people,” Lane said in 1998. \n \n Lane also represented Jim Jones, the suspected cult leader who orchestrated a mass suicide in 1978. He detailed his experience with the “Peoples Temple” cult leader in his 1980 novel, “The Strongest Poison.” \n \n Lane also represented Martin Luther King, Jr.\'s killer James Earl Ray (r.) in front of the House Assassinations Committee in 1978. (Anonymous/AP) \n \n Lane was still publishing about the JFK assassination conspiracy in 2011. His book, ""Last Word,"" accused the CIA of plotting the president\'s death. \n \n “He always believed in the power of Americans to understand the problems faced by our country and to stand up to them with their voices and actions,” a tribute posted by Lane’s Facebook page wrote. “Most of you know him through his work with the Kennedy Assassination, which really was the tip of the iceberg of a lifetime of service to the search for truth.” \n \n Sign up for BREAKING NEWS Emails privacy policy Thanks for subscribing!', 'Republican candidate insists friendly forum in Sandown, New Hampshire is not a rehearsal for Sunday’s debate with Hillary Clinton \n \n Donald Trump prepared for Sunday’s town hall-style debate with Hillary Clinton by insisting he wasn’t preparing for it. \n \n \n \n At a town hall in Sandown, New Hampshire, questions were written down by an invited audience and then read by moderator Howie Carr, a pro-Trump talk show host in New England. \n \n There was even a timer that kept Trump from talking for more than two minutes at a time. \n \n But the Republican nominee insisting he wasn’t preparing for his next bout with Hillary Clinton. “This has nothing to do with Sunday,” Trump insisted. \n \n He even complained about the media hype around his debate preparations. “Even tonight they said ‘Donald Trump is going to New Hampshire to practice for Sunday’ … it’s like they make you into a child. \n \n “You really think Hillary Clinton is debate prepping for three or four days?

On Thursday, Real Clear Politics showed the former secretary of state with an advantage of just over four percentage points. \n \n Sunday’s debate at Washington University in St Louis represents a critical opportunity for Trump to try and turn the tide. He was neck and neck in the polls with Clinton prior to the first debate. \n \n In Sandown, Trump looked back on that contest. First he blamed the microphone, but later told a questioner: “I did hold back.” \n \n Still, he wouldn’t attack Clinton’s personal life on Sunday. “I’d much rather it be on policy. I didn’t like it getting into the gutter.” \n \n \n \n The spectre of Hurricane Matthew hung over both campaigns on Thursday as the storm menaced Florida’s Atlantic coast.

97,"['(Washington Post Staff Photo/Andrea Bruce) \n \n Just one glass of wine or other alcoholic drink a day significantly raises the risk of breast cancer, while vigorous exercise such as running and bicycling reduces it, according to an expansive review of research on the effects of diet, nutrition and physical activity on the disease. \n \n The report, which was issued Tuesday, concluded that drinking the equivalent of one small glass of wine, beer or other alcohol a day — about 10 grams of alcohol — is linked to an increased cancer risk of 5 percent for pre-menopausal women and 9 percent for post-menopausal women. A standard drink has 14 grams of alcohol. \n \n ""This suggests there is no level of alcohol use that is completely safe in terms of breast cancer,"" said Anne McTiernan, a cancer-prevention researcher at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle and one of the report\'s lead authors. ""If a woman is drinking, it would be better if she kept it to a lower amount."" \n \n The review, by the American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) and the World Cancer Research Fund, evaluated research in 119 studies encompassing data on 12 million women from around the world. It is the first such review since 2010, the groups said. \n \n For the first time, researchers concluded evidence is strong that vigorous exercise reduces breast-cancer risk. Pre-menopausal women who were the most active had a 17 percent lower risk of developing malignancies compared to the least active women, while post-menopausal women had a 10 percent decreased risk. \n \n [For women, heavy drinking has been normalized. That\'s dangerous.] \n \n The researchers noted that many things influence cancer risk and that women can\'t control factors such as a family history of cancer. But, McTiernan said, ""having a physically active lifestyle, maintaining a healthy weight throughout life and limiting alcohol — these are all steps women can take to lower their risk."" \n \n At the same time, she said, a healthy lifestyle is not a guarantee. Rather, it\'s more like wearing a seat belt. Many women will do everything they can to reduce their risks of breast cancer but still get diagnosed. ""That\'s unfortunate, but that\'s what happens,"" she said. \n \n Researchers were not able to calculate the degree to which vigorous exercise might cut the risk of alcohol consumption. What happens, for example, if a regular drinker also runs daily? \n \n ""The mechanism suggests that it could be helpful,"" McTiernan said. Alcohol increases estrogen, which is linked to increased breast-cancer risk, while physical activity reduces it.

T (Photo: Monica Maschak, AP file) \n \n Those of you tanning or burning your skin this summer should stop — seek the shade, wear a hat and some sunscreen and, whatever you do, stay out of indoor tanning salons. It\'s a familiar skin-cancer prevention message, but it\'s coming from a new source: the office of the U.S. Surgeon General. \n \n The call to action from acting Surgeon General Boris Lushniak, released Tuesday, says that skin cancer is a ""major public health problem"" and that too much exposure to indoor and outdoor ultraviolet light is a major cause. It comes just two months after the Food and Drug Administration announced it will soon require labels on tanning beds and lamps warning against use by anyone younger than 18. \n \n But more action is needed, because skin cancers in the United States, unlike many other cancers, continue to rise, the new report says. Nearly 5 million people in the United States are treated for skin cancer each year, at a cost of $8.1 billion, the report says. About 63,000 cases are the most serious kind, melanoma, and about 6,000 of those cases are directly linked to indoor tanning, the report says. \n \n The report says ultraviolet radiation exposure from indoor tanning is ""completely avoidable."" \n \n In an interview, Lushniak, who is a dermatologist, said it is time for additional states to join the several that have banned indoor tanning by minors and the 44 with some kind of restrictions. \n \n TIPS: Preventing skin cancer \n \n MORE: Best and worst sunscreens for summer \n \n The report also calls for individuals — of all skin colors — to follow the usual advice for minimizing sun exposure, including using sunscreen, hats, sunglasses and shade. It also says everyone from schools to businesses to urban planners have roles to play in providing shady spaces and making it easier for people to protect themselves. \n \n The report does not say we should all live in caves. ""Enjoy the great outdoors,"" Lushniak says, ""but take steps to protect your skin."" \n \n There\'s some evidence some people are listening to some of the warnings: Indoor tanning use by teens dropped in recent years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC says 12.8% of teens younger than 18 admitted to indoor tanning in 2013, down from 15.6% in 2009. \n \n The World Health Organization called indoor tanning devices cancer-causing in 2009. \n \n The report ""is a major step forward in the fight against the epidemic of skin cancer, but the value of this step will be measured in the follow-up,"" says Tim Turnham, executive director of the Melanoma Research Foundation. The foundation was among several health groups, including the American Academy of Dermatology and the American Cancer Society, praising the report. \n \n SUNSCREEN: Consumer Reports warns against spray-ons for kids \n \n An industry group, the Indoor Tanning Association, said in a statement that tanning critics ""always exaggerate the risks of exposure to ultraviolet light in order to get the attention of the public, the media and the government."" The group says ultraviolet radiation from a sunbed is no worse than that from the sun and that both are healthful in moderation, as long as skin doesn\'t get burned – ideas Lushniak disputed in a press conference to release the report. \n \n ""Tanned skin is damaged skin,"" he said. \n \n The industry group also has said that use by teens should be up to parents, not government. \n \n Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1mXbWKN']",4,"– Just one alcoholic drink per day—even a teeny one—may not bode well for women on the breast cancer front, reports the Washington Post. That's the conclusion of a large-scale review by the American Institute for Cancer Research and the World Cancer Research fund that took a closer look at 119 studies involving more than 12 million women globally, and the impact of nutrition, diet, and physical activity on breast cancer risk. Although a typical alcoholic beverage contains 14 grams of alcohol, the report finds that even a small glass of wine, beer, or spirits (one with as little as 10 grams of alcohol) is tied to a 5% increased cancer risk in pre-menopausal women and 9% in post-menopausal women, indicating there may be ""no level of alcohol use that is completely safe"" when it comes to breast cancer, Ann McTiernan, one of the study's lead authors, tells the Post. Some good news: Researchers also found exercise plays a role in one's risk level—specifically, ""vigorous"" exercise on a regular basis cut the risk of breast cancer for both pre-menopausal women (a 17% reduction) and post-menopausal women (a 10% cut). So what if you like to throw one back but also often hit the gym? McTiernan notes alcohol increases estrogen levels, which has been tied to breast cancer risk, and that exercise can tamp those levels down—though that doesn't necessarily mean it will cancel out alcohol's effects. Although a healthy lifestyle doesn't offer complete assurance that cancer will stay away—McTiernan compares it to wearing a seatbelt, per the Post—the AICR estimates that a third of US breast cancer cases could be avoided if women kept to a healthy weight, exercised regularly, and didn't drink. (Alcohol has been tied to at least half a dozen types of cancer.)"

Read more \n \n Researchers trained 29 rats on two different challenges: rats which successfully carried out the more difficult task earned two sugar pellets; those which carried out the easier task earned just one. \n \n Rats usually preferred the harder, but more rewarding, task. But after being dosed with THC, the same rats picked the easier task. \n \n CBD, which does not cause a high and is believed to have medicinal benefits such as relieving pain and the symptoms of epilepsy, had no impact on the rats’ cognitive behaviour. It also did not mitigate the cognitive impact of THC in the rats. \n \n \n \n The THC did not make the rats less intelligent – just lazier, said the study’s lead author, Mason Silveira, a PhD candidate in psychology at the University of British Columbia. \n \n \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest UBC researchers test effects of THC on rats \n \n “When rats were given THC – the active ingredient in cannabis or marijuana – we found that they were less likely to exert the mental energy needed to do more difficult tasks,” he said. \n \n \n \n “What’s particularly interesting is though they were less likely to do these more difficult tasks they were still able to. There’s this distinction between THC’s ability to affect your cognition versus your willingness to actually use your cognitive abilities.” \n \n \n \n Silveira said his work underscores the need for more research to determine the impact of THC on the human brain, to explore how any of those potential negative effects could be mitigated, and to look into the effect of other marijuana compounds other than CBD on THC’s impact. \n \n \n \n “Our research highlights that, yes, cannabis itself may be beneficial for a variety of things, but can maybe lead to these impairments in cognition that you might want to consider,” he said. \n \n \n \n A 2012 report by the Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse said there was “sound evidence” from both animal and clinical trials that medicinal marijuana can offer relief of nausea and vomiting and certain types of pain, but warned there was a lack of research documenting the risks associated with the medical use of cannabis.', 'Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive. Flowing in every day, these data are added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period.', 'THC makes rats lazy, less willing to try cognitively demanding tasks: UBC study \n \n New research from the University of British Columbia suggests there may be some truth to the belief that marijuana use causes laziness— at least in rats. \n \n The study, published today in the Journal of Psychiatry and Neuroscience, found that tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, makes rats less willing to try a cognitively demanding task. \n \n “Perhaps unsurprisingly, we found that when we gave THC to these rats, they basically became cognitively lazy,” said Mason Silveira, the study’s lead author and a PhD candidate in UBC’s department of psychology. “What’s interesting, however, is that their ability to do the difficult challenge was unaffected by THC. The rats could still do the task— they just didn’t want to.” \n \n For the study, researchers looked at the effects of both THC and cannabidiol (CBD) on rats’ willingness to exert cognitive effort. \n \n They trained 29 rats to perform a behavioural experiment in which the animals had to choose whether they wanted an easy or difficult challenge to earn sugary treats. \n \n Under normal circumstances, most rats preferred the harder challenge to earn a bigger reward. But when the rats were given THC, the animals switched to the easier option, despite earning a smaller reward. \n \n When they looked at the effect of CBD, an ingredient in marijuana that does not result in a high, researchers found the chemical did not have any effect on rats’ decision-making or attention. CBD, which is believed to be beneficial in treating pain, epilepsy and even cancer, also didn’t block the negative effects of THC. \n \n “This was surprising, as it had been suggested that high concentrations of CBD could modulate or reduce the negative effects of THC,” said Catharine Winstanley, senior author of the study and an associate professor in UBC’s department of psychology. “Unfortunately, that did not appear to be the case.” \n \n Given how essential willingness to exert cognitive effort is for people to achieve success, Winstanley said the findings underscore the importance of realizing the possible effect of cannabis use on impairing willingness to engage in harder tasks. \n \n While some people view marijuana as a panacea that can cure all ailments, the findings also highlight a need for more research to determine what THC does to the human brain to alter decision-making. That could eventually allow scientists to block these effects of THC, allowing those who use medical marijuana to enjoy the possible benefits of cannabis without the less desirable cognitive effects. \n \n METHOD \n \n At the beginning of each behavioural experiment, rats chose between two levers to signal whether they wanted an easy or hard challenge. \n \n Choosing the easy challenge resulted in a light turning on for one second, which the rats could easily detect and respond to by poking it with their nose, receiving one sugar pellet as a reward. In the more difficult challenge, the light turned on for only 0.2 seconds, rewarding the rat with two sugar pellets if they responded with a nose poke.', 'Story highlights Virginia Gov.

99,"['Charlie Sheen, who likes to say, “I’m an F-18, bro,” was moving at a decidedly subsonic speed Tuesday evening as he motored to Washington from Dulles International Airport. Still, 80 mph in a sport-utility vehicle is pretty fast. \n \n At the time, Sheen was running nearly an hour late for his stage show, “Violent Torpedo of Truth: Defeat Is Not an Option,” at DAR Constitution Hall. \n \n But you might wonder: Who authorized the D.C. police escort — at least two marked cars with emergency lights blazing — that helped the fired sitcom star and his entourage hurry into the District? \n \n How important or famous must one be — how much tiger blood and Adonis DNA must one possess — to rate a police motorcade in the nation’s capital? \n \n How is such a thing arranged? And what does it cost? \n \n You’ll have to wonder awhile longer: As of Thursday, 48 hours after Sheen had come and gone, no one in his camp or the police department would publicly explain the deployment of law enforcement resources. \n \n “Citizens of the District don’t want to see their police force used to escort private citizens and that Charlie Sheen, of all people, is getting a personal escort,” said D.C. Council member Phil Mendelson (D-At Large), chairman of the committee that oversees police. \n \n Police Chief Cathy L. Lanier did not reply to e-mailed questions. Sheen’s publicist and tour promoter said they had no answers. And a spokeswoman for Constitution Hall said the venerable venue had nothing to do with the actor’s commute. \n \n “This entire matter is under investigation,” D.C. police spokeswoman Gwendolyn Crump said Thursday, declining to answer questions about the escort. \n \n Such a murky affair. Try to follow along. . . . \n \n Although the D.C. police Web site describes how the department deals with visiting dignitaries, nothing could be found on it explaining how, say, a Hollywood celebrity running late for a stage gig can arrange a high-speed motor escort. \n \n “From what I know right now, I have asked internal affairs to investigate,” Lanier told reporter Paul Wagner of WTTG-TV (Channel 5) outside the city’s John A. Wilson Building. “Because, from what the allegation is, it is not something that’s authorized by the Metropolitan Police Department.” \n \n The department provides police escorts in “limited circumstances . . . based on security needs, and there are protocols to be followed,” the chief said. “We don’t do escorts for celebrities.” \n \n The department’s special events branch works on “planning, developing and executing escort and security support,” but only for “distinguished guests of the federal and municipal governments,” the site says. \n \n The phone in the special events branch rang and rang Thursday. No one answered, and there was no voice mail. The branch is part of the police homeland security bureau, which is commanded by Assistant Chief Lamar Greene. \n \n Greene said Thursday that he had not personally looked into the Sheen matter. “I know, of course, there’s a lot of inquiries floating around about it,” he said, adding that the department “has put together a fact sheet that will pretty much answer any- and everything you guys need to know.” \n \n Was the escort proper? “Oh, yes,” Greene said without elaborating. \n \n Asked about the fact sheet, Crump said: “Oh, that’s an internal document. That’s not something we’re putting out. . . . It’s part of our investigation.” \n \n Sheen, who was busy in Los Angeles with two court hearings Tuesday morning, including a child-custody dispute with estranged wife Brooke Mueller, arrived at Dulles that night on a private jet. It was still unclear Thursday whether the escort began at the airport in suburban Virginia. \n \n Mendelson said Lanier told him that the escort started outside the city. He said the chief was “very clearly caught off-guard” by news of Sheen’s ride. \n \n “[I]n car with Police escort in front and rear!” Sheen, 45, said in a message posted to his Twitter account (@charliesheen) as he and his posse were headed to the city in two SUVs. “[D]riving like someone’s about to deliver a baby! Cop car lights #Spinning!” \n \n Accompanying the tweet, which appears to have been deleted, was a photo taken in the SUV carrying Sheen, showing the speedometer needle at 80 mph, with the flashing strobe lights of the lead police car visible through the windshield. Sheen was quick to tell reporters about his fast ride into the city when he arrived at Constitution Hall. \n \n The show, scheduled to start at 8 p.m., was delayed for 57 minutes. “I just landed,” he told the waiting news media at the stage door. “We had a police escort, and we ran more red lights than Brooke Mueller heading to a pawn shop.” \n \n On Wednesday, when asked about the police cars, Crump described the deployment as routine. “This escort was handled as a reimbursable detail,” she said in an e-mail. “This means the government was reimbursed for the services provided.” \n \n The department’s Web site defines a “reimbursable detail” as one in which on-duty officers are posted at public events such as festivals and parades to direct traffic, control crowds and “ensure the safety of public patrons.” \n \n An event organizer is required to sign a letter of agreement beforehand, promising to reimburse the department for the cost of deploying officers. \n \n When Crump was asked how a TV star’s drive into the city from an airport fit the definition of “reimbursable detail,” she would only say that the matter is being investigated. \n \n Bren Landon, a spokeswoman for Constitution Hall, suggested that questions about the escort might best be put to Sheen’s handlers. \n \n “Constitution Hall operates under a four-wall rental, which means a promoter rents the venue, books the act, and then is responsible for all aspects of the show, including security, ticketing, ushering, etc.,” she said in an e-mail. \n \n Sheen’s tour promoter, Joey Scoleri of Live Nation, had no answers. “Please deal with Larry,” he said in an e-mail referring to Sheen’s publicist, Larry Solters. \n \n Solters was also no help. He said he was in Los Angeles on Tuesday. “I am in LA and was not aware of any arrangements,” his e-mail said. “Will check with our on site reps.” \n \n Then later: “Haven’t been able to get any info on this.” \n \n The mystery endures. \n \n Tuesday’s Washington performance marked the halfway point of Sheen’s 20-city show tour. On Thursday night, he was set to rant at the Fox Theatre in Atlanta. It wasn’t clear how fast he got to the stage door. An Atlanta police spokesman said the department “has not been asked to provide any escorts.”', ""The following is an excerpt from Blood Sport: Alex Rodriguez, Biogenesis and the Quest to End Baseball's Steroid Era, by Tim Elfrink and Gus Garcia-Roberts. Published by arrangement with Dutton, a member of Penguin Group (USA) LLC. Copyright 2014 by Tim Elfrink and Gus Garcia-Roberts. \n \n This story appears in the July 7-14, 2014 issue of Sports Illustrated. To read a digital version of the magazine, go here. \n \n As had been the case in the years after he joined the Rangers in 2001, Alex Rodriguez’s first four seasons in the Bronx were marked by incredible individual statistics and disappointing team results. The Yankees failed to make the World Series from 2004 to ’07 -- but Rodriguez did win the second and third MVP awards of his career, in ’05 and ’07. The latter year was particularly impressive: He hit 54 home runs, including the 500th of his career, becoming, at 32, the youngest player to reach that milestone. He also drove in 156 runs and scored 143 -- both career highs—and led the majors with a 1.067 OPS. It all added up to an easy choice when voters filled out their American League MVP ballots. Rodriguez received 26 of 28 first-place votes. \n \n What hasn’t been reported until now is that Rodriguez won that MVP with permission from Major League Baseball to use performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs). \n \n From his junior year of high school there had been suspicions -- and, in the case of his 2003 MVP season, proof by way of a failed steroid test that came to light six years later -- that Rodriguez used PEDs. In August 2013, Major League Baseball suspended Rodriguez for 211 games for multiple violations of its PED policy, a decision he appealed last fall. A transcript of a confidential arbitration hearing obtained by the authors of this book suggests that Rodriguez put up those monster numbers in 2007 with the help of a powerful anabolic steroid. \n \n Under baseball’s performance-enhancing drug policy, players can apply for a so-called therapeutic use exemption (TUE) to take certain medical substances otherwise banned by MLB. A doctor appointed by both sides—the independent program administrator (IPA) -- reviews all applications. Baseball also has an expert medical panel to advise the IPA. If an exemption is granted, the player cannot be punished for using that substance. The exemption is good for one year. \n \n Before the 2007 season, Rodriguez asked for permission to use testosterone, which has been banned by baseball since 2003. The IPA in '07 was Bryan W. Smith, a High Point, N.C., physician. (Baseball did not yet have the advisory medical panel.) On Feb. 16, 2007, two days before Rodriguez reported to spring training, Smith granted the exemption, allowing Rodriguez to use testosterone all season. \n \n The exemption was revealed in a transcript of Rodriguez’s fall 2013 grievance hearing. During that proceeding, MLB entered into evidence several exemptions applied for by Rodriguez during his Yankees tenure. In his testimony, MLB chief operating officer Rob Manfred called testosterone “the mother of all anabolics” and said that exemptions for the substance are “very rare,” partly because “some people who have been involved in this field feel that with a young male, healthy young male, the most likely cause of low testosterone requiring this type of therapy would be prior steroid abuse.” \n \n Statistics requested in 2008 by Massachusetts congressman John Tierney as part of a government probe into baseball’s PED problem reveal how rare testosterone exemptions are. In 2007, of the 1,354 players subjected to testing, 111 were granted a TUE. Only two, apparently including Rodriguez, received an exemption for “androgen deficiency medications,” the category that would include testosterone. The other exemptions that year involved treatments for baldness, hypertension and -- predominantly -- attention deficit disorder. The alarmingly high number of exemptions for the latter was Tierney’s main concern. “I think it begs a question: Are people using this as a loophole?” said Tierney. “Are they taking these because they are perceived as a performance-enhancing drug, or do they have a legitimate medicinal purpose?” \n \n ***** \n \n During the 2007 World Series, as the Red Sox were sweeping the Rockies for their second championship in four seasons, Rodriguez hijacked the headlines by opting out of his contract with the Yankees. Six weeks later, the team signed him to a 10-year deal that guaranteed him $275 million to stay in pinstripes until '17. In addition, the Yankees added $6 million-a-pop clauses for each all-time home run leader he passed, starting with Willie Mays at 660 and ending with Barry Bonds at 762. \n \n Even after securing his latest windfall, Rodriguez wasn’t done seeking exemptions that allowed him to boost his testosterone levels with banned substances. In January 2008, according to the arbitration hearing transcripts, he requested two exemptions. Rodriguez wanted to use clomiphene citrate (Clomid), a drug designed to increase fertility in women. It is also prescribed to men who suffer from hypogonadism -- a testosterone deficiency -- to block the production of estrogen in their bodies. The drug is popular with bodybuilders at the end of steroid cycles because it can also stimulate the body to make more testosterone. \n \n Rodriguez also requested permission to use human chorionic gonadotropin, a hormone known as HCG, popularly -- and misguidedly -- used for weight loss and also to produce testosterone. Both HCG and clomiphene citrate were banned with the 2008 season. Smith approved Rodriguez’s use of clomiphene citrate that year. The exemption for HCG was denied, but according to the transcript of Manfred’s arbitration testimony, that denial was “more of a recordkeeping thing than anything else.” Rodriguez’s physician communicated with Smith, and “in their back-and-forth the physician informed Dr. Smith that the player was no longer using [HCG],” Manfred testified. \n \n With permission to use clomiphene citrate, Rodriguez was once again one of the few players allowed to take medicine designed to increase testosterone levels. In 2008, three major leaguers were granted exemptions to take drugs to treat hypogonadism. In fact, from the 2006 season through 2013, only 15 were granted for androgen deficiencies and hypogonadism, the conditions that under MLB’s drug policy could require a medical testosterone boost. \n \n By 2008, Rodriguez had played at least a significant portion of his career -- including, at a minimum, two of this three MVP seasons -- with the apparent help of anabolic steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs. He was by far the richest man in MLB, which was finally coming to terms with its steroid problem. Rodriguez had a guaranteed contract until the age of 42. The only wise thing to do would be to ride out that contract while continuing to apply for dubious exemptions but staying on the right side of baseball law. \n \n But Rodriguez wasn’t the type for laurel-resting. \n \n ***** \n \n The handshake that was both Tony Bosch’s biggest break and the beginning of his downfall came late on a sweltering night in Tampa. It was July 30, 2010, and Bosch was flanked by a friend, Jorge (Oggi) Velazquez. To the ballplayer they both called Cacique, or boss, they could have seemed a comical couple as they walked into his hotel room: Velazquez, a short, hard-eyed former liquor-store owner from South Florida with an intense temper, Bosch a twitchy, ingratiating character everybody called Dr. T. \n \n This guy is the best at what he does, Velazquez promised Rodriguez, laying the salesmanship on thick. He can provide you with everything you need. \n \n If the ballplayer had any misgivings, he didn’t show it. Instead, Bosch later said, the first words out of Rodriguez’s mouth were, “What were you giving Manny Ramirez?” \n \n The inquiry was rooted in both envy and concern. In 2008, Ramirez, who was traded from the Red Sox to the Dodgers during the season, had at age 36 seemed to rejuvenate his health and his swing, playing in all but nine regular-season games and almost doubling his home run output from the previous season, from 20 to 37. \n \n Of course, in 2009 Ramirez had been nabbed by baseball’s PED police -- he had been caught taking HCG and served a 50-game suspension. Bosch’s name had surfaced in the investigation: His father, Dr. Pedro Bosch, had written the HCG prescription for Ramirez, who did not have a therapeutic-use exemption from MLB. \n \n Bosch explained to Rodriguez that Ramirez had been busted because he hadn’t followed instructions. Getting caught, Bosch explained, was just Manny being Manny. It was “nearly impossible” for Bosch’s clients to test positive if they followed his protocol, he said. He would provide diagnostic blood testing, proper dosing and exact times at which the drugs should be administered. \n \n Rodriguez was sold. Bosch detailed the testosterone creams, growth hormone and other substances he would be recommending, and they made plans to meet again. Soon afterward, the nickname Cacique started appearing in Bosch’s notebooks. Other times, Bosch wrote AER next to his new client’s phone number. The initials stood, of course, for Alexander Emmanuel Rodriguez. \n \n The 2010 meeting between Bosch and Rodriguez was one part luck, one part cosmic inevitability and all parts Yuri Sucart, a cousin of Rodriguez’s who was the slugger’s frequent companion and unofficial personal assistant. In 2009 or early '10, Sucart, who was friends with Velazquez, had a weight-loss consultation with Bosch. Sucart, who had carried around extra pounds since childhood, was nearing obesity in his late 40s. Bosch put Sucart on a pounds-shedding regimen of supplements and hormones. \n \n Sucart doted on, and was employed by, his younger cousin. Sure, Rodriguez had burned Sucart by outing him as his steroid source to investigators and reporters when the slugger admitted in '09 to using PEDs from 2001-03 while with the Rangers. That cost Sucart access to MLB facilities, but it had also given him a salary bump. Sucart, who made under $60,000 from Rodriguez in 2006, saw his pay rise to $100,000 over the next five years. Rodriguez even had the Yankees make an extra 2009 championship ring, worth thousands of dollars, for his banned-from-MLB cousin. \n \n During his treatments with Bosch, Sucart wore Yankees hats and shirts and that championship ring. He also told Bosch that he worked for Rodriguez. Among the supplements Bosch gave Sucart were his signature “gummies,” fast-acting testosterone troches. Sucart told Bosch that he thought the troches packed an “unbelievable sense of energy recovery.” He added that he had given one to Rodriguez and that his cousin “loved it because of its explosive effect,” according to the arbitration decision. \n \n The long-distance flirtation between Bosch and Rodriguez lasted for months, until the superstar finally decided to take the plunge in late July 2010. After losing much of the '09 season to a hip injury, Rodriguez had stayed mostly healthy through the first four months of the '10 season. His numbers were unremarkable but steady: He had 14 home runs by the All-Star break, and against the Royals at Yankee Stadium on July 22, he swatted his 599th homer. Five days shy of his 35th birthday, he was about to become the youngest player to join the 600 club. \n \n When he next came to the plate, the umpire threw the pitcher a specially marked ball to deal to Rodriguez. Umps would continue to do this until he hit his next home run; the mark would be used to authenticate the milestone ball. But Rodriguez didn’t homer in that game. In fact, he didn’t clear the fence through the three games remaining in the home stand. \n \n The Yankees left for a seven-game road trip on July 26, and Rodriguez failed to connect during four games in Cleveland. For any other hitter, a two-week home run drought would barely register. But what began as a celebratory chase was turning torturous. As sellout crowds followed his every game, Rodriguez complained that stadiums of flashing cameras on each swing never let him forget the looming milestone. \n \n Even without the power drought, Rodriguez might have hooked up with Bosch eventually. Despite his enormous talent, Rodriguez spent his career seeking a synthetic edge, especially when struggling to meet mile-high expectations. Taken as a whole, Rodriguez’s greatest baseball achievements were inseparable from his use of PEDs. Now his body was corroding due to age. But all he needed was one more push to knock down those historic milestones and place himself among the all-time greats. \n \n The call came to Velazquez in late July, and he relayed the inquiry to Bosch: Rodriguez wanted to talk about becoming a client. They met at a Tampa hotel following a road loss to the Rays; Rodriguez, still stuck on 599, had gone 0-for-4. Sucart, who despite MLB’s ban had remained Rodriguez’s shadow, joined his cousin, Velazquez, and Bosch in the hotel room. \n \n The foursome met often. In early August, they gathered again, this time at Rodriguez’s $30,000-per-month apartment on Central Park West, a building that Denzel Washington and Sting also called home. Bosch insisted on drawing blood to design an appropriate protocol for Rodriguez. He then flew back to Miami with Rodriguez’s plasma, knowing the vial contained the opportunity of his career. \n \n Bosch consulted with a urologist, according to the arbitration decision. He also had lengthy conversations about Rodriguez’s medical history with Sucart. Bosch dreamed up an elaborate doping protocol that would take Rodriguez into December, built around testosterone, HGH, and growth-hormone-producing peptides. Less than a week later, Bosch traveled to see Rodriguez in New York; his luggage was packed with preloaded syringes. \n \n On Aug. 4, Rodriguez finally connected on a pitch and made a sold-out Yankee Stadium erupt. Home run No. 600 flew into Monument Park, the museum beyond centerfield honoring Yankees greats. As he rounded the bases, Rodriguez lifted his palms coyly. His teammates streamed out of the dugout to congratulate him, and he took a curtain call for the roaring crowd. \n \n At that point, fans knew only about Rodriguez’s positive steroid test back in 2003. That was still enough to mark Rodriguez forever as a cheater. But this moment was a step toward redemption and leadership in the eyes of the fans and his team. The previous October, he had finally earned a championship ring. Now No. 600 was out of the way. \n \n Rodriguez wasn’t on Bosch’s regimen yet. But even as he circled the bases, and after the game as his colleagues were praising him for succeeding without steroids -- “That’s a chapter of his life I think he’s turned the page on,” said hitting coach Kevin Long -- Rodriguez knew he’d found the man who would help energize the latter stage of his career. He was one week past his 35th birthday, and he was determined to collect every one of those milestone bonuses in his contract. He wanted to be the lone member of the 800 home run club, Bosch would later say. To do that would take a nature-defying power surge in his late 30s of the sort Barry Bonds had pioneered. \n \n On Aug. 14— -- even days after his down-to-the-minute regimen with Bosch began -- Rodriguez slammed three home runs in Kansas City. Afterward, he admitted for the first time that his lagging power production had bothered him. “I haven’t really hit for any power this year, so it’s been frustrating,” he said. “Being stuck at 599 was really a microcosm of what’s happened all year. I’ve been able to drive in runs and hit some doubles here and there, but overall I’ve hit for no power.” \n \n But now, Tony Bosch had a believer. \n \n To purchase a copy of Blood Sport, go here.""]",2,"– Charlie Sheen stirred up another controversy while in Washington, DC, on Tuesday night: He somehow managed to snag a police escort so he could book it at 80mph to his show, for which he was running almost an hour late.

102,"['Watching President Barack Obama play the race card late last week in the matter of the Zimmerman trial reminded me that the guy from Chicago has truly amazing powers. \n \n He stood in the White House briefing room, and through the magic of his own silky rhetoric and skill with metaphor, he was able animate the body of a slain African-American teenager, Trayvon Martin. \n \n Obama pronounced the killing as racially motivated, though he didn\'t use the words. He didn\'t have to, such is his prowess. It was so smooth that few noticed. He put the killing in a racial context, and that was enough. \n \n ""You know, when Trayvon Martin was first shot, I said that this could have been my son. Another way of saying that is Trayvon Martin could have been me, 35 years ago,"" Obama told reporters at the White House on Friday, addressing last weekend\'s acquittal of Martin\'s shooter, George Zimmerman. \n \n Could Obama have been Trayvon Martin 35 years ago? \n \n Perhaps. If so, then any of us could have been Trayvon Martin. And I could have been Trayvon Martin. Racial motives weren\'t established at trial. And reportedly, the FBI still hasn\'t found racial motives in George Zimmerman, who is Hispanic. \n \n Race was established by the president of the United States, and by other political and media actors. It\'s a cynical business, about money and power, about keeping divisions between American tribes. There are the black tribes that see Martin in the context of the old civil rights struggles and leverage, and white tribes that see Martin being used to pummel them with racial guilt. \n \n The algebra of all of this is as old as some musty textbook in your uncle\'s garage. We\'ve seen it before. We\'ve heard the lines, the formulations, the slogans, and some of us recite them the way we recite phrases from television commercials. We\'re given just enough evidence and we\'re told we must choose a side. \n \n Yet none of this tribalism has anything to do with what happened the night Martin was killed. Politicians don\'t worry about that. They\'re experts at the game of tribes, and a tribal America is what nourishes them. \n \n Americanism should be about something more than tribes and groups. Americanism should instead be about individuals, about individual promise, individual accomplishment. \n \n Only an individual can give another respect. Tribes can\'t. What tribes do is battle other tribes over the spoils of government. This has nothing to do with individual respect. It has everything to do with group leverage. \n \n Clearly, Martin and Zimmerman didn\'t give each other respect. Each one could and should have walked away, and didn\'t. Many homicides happen that way, with bad choices and stupidity and anger. Homicides are never political at the beginning. They become so only after the body is cold, when the political actors approach and heat things up. \n \n The rest of the president\'s commentary was quite touching, describing how young African-American men are followed in department stores, and how he was one of those followed, or how motorists lock their doors, how women clutch their purses when a black man enters an elevator. \n \n It was compelling talk for a president who avoids discussing race almost as much as he avoids discussing all those young African-American men shot down in Chicago every year in the street gang wars. \n \n But first came the sound bite in which he became Trayvon Martin. He knew what he was delivering. It was no accident. The rest of it was the cover. Many will applaud him for initiating sensitive discussion about race in America, and many will miss completely what he did. \n \n He played the race card and they didn\'t see it coming. He attributed racial motive to a homicide even though the race angle was never established in court. And he\'ll be praised. That\'s skill. That\'s power. \n \n Despite Obama\'s assertion that he could have been Martin, the jury did not believe that the teenager was killed because he was black. \n \n Many in the news media clearly believed the race angle, which reinforces American tribalism. Perhaps the worst of many violators was NBC News. That network\'s cynical editing of Zimmerman\'s 911 emergency call should cost them millions in damages. \n \n By saying he could have been Trayvon Martin, President Obama bypassed the evidence and established his own motive. Only a maestro could accomplish this. \n \n ""I think it\'s going to be important for all of us to do some soul searching,"" Obama said, and I hope he included himself in the search. \n \n ""There has been talk about should we convene a conversation on race,"" he continued. ""I haven\'t seen that to be particularly productive. When politicians try to organize conversations they end up being stilted and politicized, when folks are locked into the positions they already have."" \n \n They get locked into positions with help from those who would ostensibly lead them away from ignorance and anger and fear. No one wins the game of tribes but the leaders. \n \n * * * \n \n The Sunday Tribune is full of interesting and compelling stories, but one I certainly hope you read was written by William Lee. You know him as ""Old School,"" the reporter who helps me with the column. Will Lee has written the story of Sylvester Washington, aka Two-Gun Pete, the Chicago cop with the pearl-handled revolvers who left many men dead and is a legend on the South Side. If you want to know about the real heart of Chicago, then read about Two-Gun: CLICK HERE. \n \n jskass@tribune.com \n \n Twitter @John_Kass', 'This story is updated at the bottom with a response from Rich Benjamin \n \n When people hold their breath for your imminent words, isn’t it exasperating when you open your mouth, but don’t say much? \n \n Finally the president has spoken about George Zimmerman’s acquittal. Even as the country waited for his singular response – the nation’s leader and a law professor who once looked like Trayvon Martin – the president danced around the issues. And what a dramatic anti-climax, listening to the president refuse to say anything insightful or profound about the acquittal. In signature professorial style, the president gave us the “context” to the episode and to black people’s “pain.” But he didn’t offer a meaningful opinion on the episode’s hot molten core: racial profiling, vigilantism, and “Stand Your Ground” laws. \n \n Meanwhile, Attorney General Eric Holder delivered trenchant thoughts on the acquittal, demanding action. Before an audience of supporters, Holder recently called for a full investigation of Martin\'s death after Zimmerman\'s acquittal. Holder vowed that the Justice Department will act “in a manner that is consistent with the facts and the law. We will not be afraid."" \n \n “We must stand our ground,” he told supporters. \n \n Some of us have an Inner Child. Others have an Inner Nigger. Is Holder the president’s conscience? Or his Inner Nigger? \n \n Is Holder the president’s aggressive internal mind and voice -- willing to speak truth to power, but unbothered with appearing like an angry black man? \n \n In 2007, when candidate Obama gave that infamous speech in Philadelphia, distancing himself from Reverend Jeremiah Wright, the nation and media responded with enthralled appreciation. It was, indeed, a heartwarming speech. When Holder gave his NAACP speech this past Tuesday, much of corporate-owned cable media —FOX, CNN, and MSNBC—aborted any speech coverage, in favor of their own cranky commentary. \n \n Apparently, Holder wasn’t giving America the race speech it wants to hear. \n \n From guns to gays, here is a man always ready to speak truth to power. (Well, except to the NSA). Little wonder the right has been actively trying to drive him from office, even more so than it does Obama. \n \n From a tactical standpoint, it’s wise for the president to avoid discussing race and Trayvon Martin. Many white Americans don’t want that discussion. Many whites avoid that discussion due to their sincere ethical desire to wash the stain of racial differentiation from our nation; they see themselves as Reverend King’s color- blind disciples. Still others avoid the topic because they suffer from racial fatigue. They feel harassed and hectored by so-called race hustlers. Enough with that: They want to focus on the technical and legal aspects of Zimmerman’s acquittal. \n \n Where Trayvon Martin is concerned, the president is also wise to sweep a racial discussion under the rug, because that discussion tarnishes his political capital. Politically, he seeks to run-up his party’s Latino support, by burnishing his reputation for historic inclusion and racial reconciliation. In discouraging too much diversity talk or racial gripe, the president’s image management promotes him as a racial icon with no racial agenda. His image management shrewdly polishes his racial identity even as it downplays it. \n \n Then there’s Obama’s Dark Doppelganger. Don’t you remember? Holder’s first speech in office as Attorney General set headlines afire because he branded America “a nation of cowards” for skirting frank conversations about race. Holder’s remarks piqued white Americans who lauded their own forward thinking in voting for Obama, only to be called “coward” by Obama’s chief lawyer. (So much for racial catharsis!) \n \n In that 2009 speech, Holder scolded America for “retreating to our race protected cocoons, where much is comfortable and where progress is not really made.” He darkly warned that if Americans continue to avoid meaningful racial debate, “the coming diversity that could be such a powerful, positive force will, instead, become a reason for stagnation and polarization.” His 2009 insight seems painfully prescient to Zimmerman’s acquittal and our present confusion. \n \n The Secret Service calls the president “Renegade,” his agency nickname. It seems, these days, that Holder is the real renegade. The country\'s Rogue Negro. And the president’s repressed Black Id. \n \n Who can blame Obama for not intelligently confronting race in this horrific dilemma? But we shouldn’t blame his top cop for doing so, either. \n \n UPDATE, Saturday morning \n \n Since Salon and I have received a lot of feedback, some of it very upset, about this article, I’d like to take the time to respond. \n \n First I want to express my extreme admiration for the president and for the attorney general, which I have stated publicly and to them personally. My autographed copy of ""Dreams from My Father: A Story of Race and Inheritance"" is one of my most cherished possessions. \n \n Major thinkers, from Carl Jung to W.E.B. DuBois to Franz Fanon, have written about the internalized split or hybridized consciousness that conflicts humans. As such, what black person doesn’t understand duality and double consciousness, especially when s/he speaks to multiple publics and circulates in multiple contexts? This question of internal and externalized conflicts, to my thinking, becomes particularly poignant and urgent in this instance: Two of our country’s most powerful black leaders are speaking to multiple audiences in reaction to a horrific race-related event. \n \n To speak of a person’s “inner child” is not to call that person a child. To speak of a person’s “inner diva” is not to call that person a diva. To speak of a person’s “inner nigger” is not to call that person a nigger. It is merely to wonder what aspect of that person’s outlook that person strategically covers. In his brilliant work ""Covering: The Hidden Assault on our Civil Rights,"" New York University Law Professor Kenji Yoshino asks to what extent leaders “downplay a disfavored trait so as to blend into the mainstream, [because] all of us possess stigmatized attributes, we all encounter pressure to cover in our daily lives.” As Yoshina brilliantly illustrates, mostly in the context of LGBT rights, “covering” one’s reportedly negative “minority traits” has an insidious and detrimental effect on the long-term prospects of civil rights. My Salon article asks to what extent the president covers his race-based thoughts, and whether Mr. Holder is a surrogate, or an active proponent, of the president’s potentially more controversial, but productive, viewpoints. Does Mr. Holder provide the president “cover” for the president to express his opinions on this volatile topic, but in softer terms? Eric Holder has been much more vocal and active on issues of race during this administration; I do not “blame” anyone for this, but I do point it out. \n \n Some Salon readers were upset by my use of the word “nigger.” I am not the first to use this term in public discussion, nor will I be the last. The term is in wide circulation in the streets, in private homes, in popular culture, in black-generated rap music, and in thoughtful scholarship, most notably in Harvard Law Professor Randall Kennedy’s exceptional tome, ""Nigger: The Strange Career of a Troublesome Word."" My use of the word isn’t haphazard or gratuitous. Language is central to race. Language has been central to Martin’s tragic death and to Zimmerman’s acquittal. Language is central to our implicit and explicit racial biases. As a writer, evaluating speeches, by two capable and eloquent public servants, I use the word “nigger” with deep understanding of its long, complicated existence. \n \n As someone who has traveled the country extensively talking to people about their racial viewpoints, and in turn has conversed with people about race and those findings, I’m sensitive to the complexity that such discussions bring. As someone who has been called “nigger” affectionately and violently, I do understand firsthand readers\' concerns with that term. \n \n At any rate, this is an important debate, and I am grateful for the feedback, the better to contribute to the discussion.', 'President Obama did something Friday that he hardly ever does — and no other president could ever have done. He addressed the racial fault lines in the country by laying bare his personal anguish and experience in an effort to help white Americans understand why African-Americans reacted with frustration and anger to the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting of Trayvon Martin. \n \n Mr. Obama’s comments during a surprise appearance at the White House press briefing crystallized the dissonance around this case. In the narrow confines of the trial, all talk of race was excluded, and the “stand your ground” element in Florida’s self-defense law was not invoked by Mr. Zimmerman’s lawyers. But in the broader, more profound and more troubling context of Mr. Martin’s death, race and Florida’s lax gun laws are inextricably interwoven. \n \n On the first, Mr. Obama said: “The judge conducted the trial in a professional manner. The prosecution and the defense made their arguments.” The jurors, he added, “were properly instructed that in a case such as this reasonable doubt was relevant, and they rendered a verdict.” \n \n But on the broader context, Mr. Obama eloquently rebutted those — like Representative Andy Harris, a Republican, with his dismissive “get over it” remark on Tuesday — who said that the verdict should have ended discussion of the case, especially talk about race and gun laws. \n \n “Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago,” Mr. Obama said, adding that “it’s important to recognize that the African-American community is looking at this issue through a set of experiences and a history that doesn’t go away.” \n \n He said there are “very few African-American men in this country who haven’t had the experience of being followed when they were shopping in a department store” or “the experience of getting on an elevator and a woman clutching her purse nervously and holding her breath until she had a chance to get off.” \n \n “That,” he said, “includes me.” \n \n Mr. Obama said African-Americans are also acutely aware that “there is a history of racial disparities in the application of our criminal laws — everything from the death penalty to enforcement of our drug laws.” \n \n He said it would be naïve not to recognize that young African-American men are “disproportionately both victims and perpetrators of violence.” But using those statistics “to then see sons treated differently causes pain,” he said. \n \n Mr. Obama called on the Justice Department to work with local and state law enforcement to reduce mistrust in the policing system, including ending racial profiling. He also called for an examination of state and local laws to see whether they “are designed in such a way that they may encourage the kinds of altercations and confrontations and tragedies that we saw in the Florida case.” \n \n Mr. Obama raised questions about the message that “stand your ground” laws send, telling a citizen that he “potentially has the right to use those firearms even if there’s a way for them to exit from a situation.” \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Mr. Obama noted that Mr. Zimmerman did not invoke that defense. But he said it was still relevant. In one of the most powerful parts of his remarks, he said: “I’d just ask people to consider, if Trayvon Martin was of age and armed, could he have stood his ground on that sidewalk? And do we actually think that he would have been justified in shooting Mr. Zimmerman, who had followed him in a car, because he felt threatened?” \n \n If the answer is “at least ambiguous,” Mr. Obama said, “we might want to examine those kinds of laws.” \n \n Mr. Obama said Americans needed to give African-American boys “the sense that their country cares about them and values them and is willing to invest in them.” \n \n He said he was not talking about “some grand, new federal program” or even a national “conversation on race,” which he said often ends up being “stilted and politicized” and reaffirms pre-existing positions. \n \n In a way, Mr. Obama began that conversation with these remarks, while speaking directly to African-Americans who have longed to hear him identify with their frustrations and their anger. \n \n It is a great thing for this country to have a president who could do what Mr. Obama did on Friday. It is sad that we still need him to do it.', ""Full transcript of President Obama's remarks on race and the Trayvon Martin case, Friday, July 19, 2013, in the White House press briefing room, as released by the White House: \n \n \n \n THE PRESIDENT: I wanted to come out here, first of all, to tell you that Jay is prepared for all your questions and is very much looking forward to the session. The second thing is I want to let you know that over the next couple of weeks, there's going to obviously be a whole range of issues -- immigration, economics, et cetera -- we'll try to arrange a fuller press conference to address your questions. \n \n The reason I actually wanted to come out today is not to take questions, but to speak to an issue that obviously has gotten a lot of attention over the course of the last week -- the issue of the Trayvon Martin ruling. I gave a preliminary statement right after the ruling on Sunday. But watching the debate over the course of the last week, I thought it might be useful for me to expand on my thoughts a little bit. \n \n First of all, I want to make sure that, once again, I send my thoughts and prayers, as well as Michelle's, to the family of Trayvon Martin, and to remark on the incredible grace and dignity with which they've dealt with the entire situation. I can only imagine what they're going through, and it's remarkable how they've handled it. \n \n The second thing I want to say is to reiterate what I said on Sunday, which is there's going to be a lot of arguments about the legal issues in the case -- I'll let all the legal analysts and talking heads address those issues. The judge conducted the trial in a professional manner. The prosecution and the defense made their arguments. The juries were properly instructed that in a case such as this reasonable doubt was relevant, and they rendered a verdict. And once the jury has spoken, that's how our system works. But I did want to just talk a little bit about context and how people have responded to it and how people are feeling. \n \n You know, when Trayvon Martin was first shot I said that this could have been my son. Another way of saying that is Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago. And when you think about why, in the African American community at least, there's a lot of pain around what happened here, I think it's important to recognize that the African American community is looking at this issue through a set of experiences and a history that doesn't go away. \n \n There are very few African American men in this country who haven't had the experience of being followed when they were shopping in a department store. That includes me. There are very few African American men who haven't had the experience of walking across the street and hearing the locks click on the doors of cars. That happens to me -- at least before I was a senator. There are very few African Americans who haven't had the experience of getting on an elevator and a woman clutching her purse nervously and holding her breath until she had a chance to get off. That happens often. \n \n no previous page \n \n next"", 'BBC Scotland\'s Kenneth Macdonald talks to Professor Peter Higgs, the Edinburgh University physicist who proposed the existence of a new particle which would become known as the Higgs Boson. \n \n It was an idea that changed the Universe - or at least how we look at it. \n \n Here, in his own words, Higgs explains how ""incompetence"" in the lab led to him pursuing theoretical physics, how it should be the Goldstone boson and why he does not like the ""God particle"" label. \n \n Early years \n \n ""What kind of pupil was I? Well, I was a swot, but I was allowed to be without any ill effects by my contemporaries because I was excused from games, due to my asthma. So being a swot was something to compensate for not being to play football. \n \n Image caption Higgs said he was not hugely interested in the physics he was taught at school \n \n I was already, I think, at the age of 18, showing signs of being incompetent in the lab. \n \n My recollection of the higher school certificate, which involved a practical exam in physics, was being confronted with an experiment involving a sort of barometer arrangement, wondering why I couldn\'t make it work. \n \n That sort of set the scene for me and when I chose to go to university, which was Kings College London, I continued to show all sorts of symptoms of incompetence in the lab while I was a student there. So very early on, I was heading towards the theoretical end of physics as the only kind of thing I was competent in."" \n \n Working in Edinburgh \n \n ""I liked Edinburgh as a university in a way that I\'d never enjoyed King\'s College London. I realised after I came to Edinburgh that perhaps it was a mistake to have gone to a college which was bang in the centre of a vast city. It had a bad effect on the social life of the students because a lot of them were commuting from outer London. \n \n Edinburgh was much better as a place to live. If I\'d been a student there I would have had far more friends than I ever had in London. \n \n When I moved back to Edinburgh I\'d been doing work in quantum gravity but I couldn\'t see any useful way of extending it at the time, I was sort of at a dead end. I didn\'t know what I was going to do so first of all, in Edinburgh, in the summer of 1960, I was roped into the organisation of the first Scottish university summer school in physics at Newbattle Abbey College, before taking up the lectureship in October. \n \n In my first year of teaching in Edinburgh I began to do more reading and on things which I hadn\'t thought about in the last few years. By the end of my first year, I had read papers by Yoichiro Nambu and that was when I was converted to the ideas that Nambu had formulated. I thought that this was a good way of formulating field theories for elementary particles and that I would work in that area myself."" \n \n His discovery \n \n ""It shouldn\'t be a Higgs field. If it\'s anybody\'s it should be Goldstone field, I think. When Nambu wrote his short paper in 1960, Jeffrey Goldstone of Cambridge University, who was visiting Cern, heard about it. He then wrote a paper which was conceptually similar to what Nambu had done, but a simpler model. \n \n Image caption The hunt for the Higgs has been compared by some to the Apollo programme that reached the Moon \n \n The one thing which was missing at that time, in 1960-61, was that in formulating the models intended for the strong interactions of elementary particles, Nambu and Goldstone ignored electromagnetism. For some reason they didn\'t include it in the basic dynamics. Like everyone else, they thought electromagnetism was a small effect. We\'re after a theory of the strong particle interactions. So they left out electromagnetism and what did they get instead? They got what were called Goldstone Bosons, a set of particles with no spin and no mass. And that spoilt the theory. \n \n There was a period of about two years in which people argued about it in the literature. Then, in 1964, my realisation of what the answer was simply came over a weekend, after I\'d read a paper which seemed to shut the door on any exceptions to this theorem. I got very upset over that paper."" \n \n \'The God particle\' \n \n ""That name was a kind of joke, and not a very good one. An author, Leon Lederman, wanted to call it \'that goddamn particle\' because it was clear it was going to be a tough job finding it experimentally. His editor wouldn\'t have that, and he said \'okay, call it the God particle\', and the editor accepted it. I don\'t think he should\'ve have done, because it\'s so misleading."" \n \n First visit \n \n ""My first visit to the Large Hadron Collider was in April 2008, before it started up, and Cern had some open days. They were slightly shocked by the end of it because I think they got something like 50,000 visitors. The group from Edinburgh were slightly privileged and went through on a conducted tour just before the mob arrived. And it was extremely impressive. \n \n Image caption Higgs was stunned by the scale of the Atlas detector during his first visit \n \n I knew about the scale of the machine, the circumference of the tunnel and so on, so that wasn\'t surprising. But the size of the detectors was the really amazing thing. I mean, the Atlas detector, which is the one that the Edinburgh and Glasgow groups are involved in, is said to be bigger than Salisbury Cathedral. It\'s really amazing. \n \n I was a bit unhappy about the way it was being sold. Not because I didn\'t think they should go after the Higgs Boson, of course, but I thought they should have educated people more about the breadth of the programme of the machine, and not concentrated on this so much. It seemed to me they were taking a risk that when they found the thing, then a lot of people would say \'oh well, that\'s it, isn\'t it? Why do we still want this machine?\'"" \n \n The announcement at Cern \n \n ""By the evening of July 3rd, it was clear there were people camping outside the lecture theatre in the hope of getting a seat the next morning. Apparently during the night there was a fire alarm, the fire brigade were called and the people camping refused to move. When the time came on the Wednesday morning, I had to have a sort of bodyguard to get me through the crowd outside the lecture theatre. \n \n Media caption Scientists involved in the Cern describe the moment they were told a new particle consistent with the Higgs boson had been discovered \n \n I think I got the worst of it because of the way the publicity is concentrated on my name, but there were three other people there out of the six of us who did the work in \'64. \n \n I\'d never been in a scientific meeting like that before, because people got up and cheered and it was a completely new experience. \n \n I didn\'t accept it was me that they were cheering. I regarded it as cheers for the home team, as at a football match, and the home team were the two experiments, Atlas and CMS, with 1,500 members each. That\'s what it was really about. Maybe they were cheering me too but that was a minor issue."" \n \n BBC Scotland Investigates: Peter Higgs: Particle Man will be broadcast on BBC1 Scotland at 22:35 on Wednesday 17 April, and for a week later on the BBC iPlayer.', 'Yahoo admitted to the world—on a news day dominated by a guy called Trump—that some of its employees were aware that it had suffered a breach shortly after a ""state-sponsored actor"" hacked into the ailing Web firm\'s systems in 2014. \n \n In a filing to the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday, Yahoo said that a panel of independent experts was looking at how much knowledge employees at the company had of the incident shortly after the massive breach had occurred. \n \n Yahoo has previously stated that it only became aware of the hack attack following a ""recent investigation."" As Ars reported previously, Yahoo confirmed in September that at least half a billion of its user accounts had been breached. \n \n The company, in its latest filing, has revealed more details about the attack—which ransacked Yahoo usernames and associated e-mail addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, hashed passwords, and some encrypted and unencrypted security questions and answers. It said: \n \n In late July 2016, a hacker claimed to have obtained certain Yahoo user data. After investigating this claim with the assistance of an outside forensic expert, the company could not substantiate the hacker’s claim. Following this investigation, the company intensified an ongoing broader review of the company’s network and data security, including a review of prior access to the company’s network by a state-sponsored actor that the company had identified in late 2014. Based on further investigation with an outside forensic expert, the company disclosed the Security Incident on September 22, 2016, and began notifying potentially affected users, regulators, and other stakeholders. \n \n The key bit in that statement is the disclosure that at least some employees at Yahoo were aware of the attack two years ago. \n \n It added that an independent committee of the firm\'s board was investigating ""among other things, the scope of knowledge within the company in 2014 and thereafter regarding this access, the Security Incident, the extent to which certain users’ account information had been accessed, the company’s security measures, and related incidents and issues."" \n \n Yahoo said that forensic experts were also probing evidence that suggested an intruder—understood to be the same state-sponsored actor—created cookies that potentially inserted a password bypass flaw, thereby granting access to some user accounts or account details. \n \n It also revealed that cops had recently begun ""sharing certain data that they indicated was provided by a hacker who claimed the information was Yahoo user account data."" Yahoo said that it would analyse the hacker\'s claim. \n \n To date, the company has been hit with 23 class action lawsuits from angry consumers, both at home and abroad. \n \n Yahoo has so far notched up $1 million (£800,000) in losses related to the megabreach—however, its latest quarter ended September 30 is yet to reveal the true pain to its bottom line. \n \n This post originated on Ars Technica UK']",6,"– President Obama's surprise comments yesterday on the George Zimmerman verdict—""Trayvon Martin could have been me""—continue to resonate today.

His important, eloquent words went beyond the specifics of the trial and ""crystallized the dissonance around this case."" It's great we have a president who can do that, but it's ""sad that we still need him to do it."" Jonathan Chait, New York: It was ""instantly historic,"" he writes. ""Obama understands that interjecting himself into a racialized controversy carries risks, but he also believes that the electorate of the future is on his side. His remarks are probably aimed not at the present but at posterity."" John Kass, Chicago Tribune: All the people praising the speech are missing something, Kass argues. Obama ""played the race card and they didn't see it coming. He attributed racial motive to a homicide even though the race angle was never established in court."" His ""silky rhetoric"" helped him get away it—the president ""bypassed the evidence and established his own motive. Only a maestro could accomplish this."" Rich Benjamin, Salon: He calls the speech a ""dramatic anti-climax,"" arguing that Obama didn't say anything ""insightful or profound."" But Benjamin, who is black, raised a ruckus when he compared Obama's response unfavorably to Eric Holder's ""trenchant"" remarks. ""Some of us have an Inner Child. Others have an Inner Nigger.

What did you say? How much did you drink? \n \n Instead of asking: Why did he think he had license to rape? \n \n We will speak out against those who seek to engage in plausible deniability. Those who know that this is happening, but don\'t want to get involved. Who believe that this ugly crime is ""complicated."" \n \n We will speak of you — you who remain anonymous not only to protect your identity, but because you so eloquently represent “every woman.” \n \n We will make lighthouses of ourselves, as you did — and shine. \n \n Your story has already changed lives. \n \n You have helped change the culture. \n \n You have shaken untold thousands out of the torpor and indifference towards sexual violence that allows this problem to continue. \n \n Your words will help people you have never met and never will. \n \n You have given them the strength they need to fight. \n \n And so, I believe, you will save lives. \n \n I do not know your name — but I will never forget you. \n \n The millions who have been touched by your story will never forget you. \n \n And if everyone who shared your letter on social media, or who had a private conversation in their own homes with their daughters and sons, draws upon the passion, the outrage, and the commitment they feel right now the next time there is a choice between intervening and walking away — then I believe you will have helped to change the world for the better.', ""WASHINGTON — Rep. Ted Poe called today for the removal of a California judge who sentenced a former Stanford athlete convicted of sexual assault to six months in prison. \n \n Poe, a former prosecutor and criminal court judge, took to the House floor and blasted Judge Aaron Persky’s sentence as “pathetic,” saying: “The punishment for rape should be longer than a semester of college.” \n \n Poe, R-Humble, said that Brock Turner — a 20-year-old champion swimmer convicted of assaulting an unconscious woman behind a dumpster in 2015 — should face tougher penalties. \n \n Brock was convicted last week of three counts of sexual assault and, in addition to six months in prison and three years’ probation, will have to register as a sex offender. \n \n Turner was not convicted of rape because, under California law, rape is defined as someone using “physical force, intimidation, duress, or threats to persuade the victim to engage in intercourse.” \n \n Witnesses and testimony determined that Turner penetrated his victim with a foreign object, not a sexual organ. \n \n The case has ignited a fierce debate about victims’ rights and how the court system treats upper-middle-class white men. \n \n “This judge got it wrong. There is an archaic philosophy in some courts that sin ain’t sin as long as good folk do it,” said Poe. “The judge should be removed. The rapist should do more time for the dastardly deed he did that night.” \n \n Poe has no authority to remove Persky from the bench but urged an appeals court to overturn Turner’s sentence and for California voters to petition for his ouster. \n \n Turner will be serving an even shorter sentence than what Persky gave him, Mic reports. The Santa Clara County’s Department of Corrections website lists Turner’s release as Sept. 2 — three months after his booking date, June 2. \n \n In addition to being outraged by the judge’s sentence, many have expressed frustration over comments from Turner’s father, who called prison “a steep price to pay for 20 minutes of action.” \n \n “The judge said: ‘A prison sentence would have a severe impact on him.’ Isn’t that the point?” Poe said. \n \n At Turner’s sentencing, his unnamed victim read him a letter. \n \n Poe on Thursday read portions of the victim’s 7,000-plus word letter, which explained in graphic detail the impact of the assault on her life. The assault was reportedly halted by two students passing by on bicycles while the woman was still unconscious. \n \n A rape victim’s message to a former Stanford swimmer | @DMNOpinion https://t.co/ElLVkVhB84 pic.twitter.com/5kkovNakiu — Dallas Morning News (@dallasnews) June 8, 2016 \n \n In an interview with The Dallas Morning News, Poe called the woman’s missive “the Bible on what happens to sexual assault victims.” \n \n “For many victims, rape is a fate worse than death,” Poe said. “Because rape victims say after being raped, they die emotionally many times. And with homicide, one dies only once.” \n \n Vice President Joe Biden issued his own open letter to the victim Thursday afternoon which began: \n \n “I do not know your name — but your words are forever seared on my soul. Words that should be required reading for men and women of all ages. Words that I wish with all of my heart you never had to write.” \n \n Poe, co-chairman of the Congressional Victims Rights Caucus, said he felt compelled to speak out after becoming incensed at the lenient sentence. \n \n “The judge excused [Turner's] conduct, even saying he was concerned about the defendant’s future,” Poe said. “That’s nothing. Auto thieves in Texas get more for stealing cars.” \n \n The congressman ended his speech Thursday morning by with a personal note as he asked for the victim’s entire letter into the official Congressional record. \n \n “As a grandfather, I want to know that my granddaughters are growing up in a society that has zero tolerance for this criminal conduct,” he continued. “No means no.” \n \n Staff writer Hannah Wise contributed to this report."", 'Tom Williams/Getty Images Rep.

Another photo showed the victim making a sexually provocative gesture. \n \n The judge allowed the images to be shown to the jury in the civil case after the defense argued that they would help prove that the young woman was not, as she claimed, suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. \n \n “Did you have PTSD when you did the acts shown in these pictures?” one defense attorney asked the woman in court, according to the San Jose Mercury News. \n \n Barbara Spector, one of the attorneys for the alleged victim, who was known as Jane Doe, said that she felt at the time the images “were irrelevant”. \n \n \n \n “The impact was very definitely prejudicial for Jane Doe and had a positive impact for the defendants on the jury,” she said. \n \n \n \n Four of the defendants settled, three had charges dismissed and two went through the trial and were found not liable by the jury. \n \n Persky is now facing international scrutiny, after the victim in the Stanford case released a viral statement on the trauma of her assault, prompting messages of support from vice-president Joe Biden and actor Lena Dunham. \n \n Critics have also launched a recall campaign against Persky over his decision to sentence Turner to six months in county jail – a punishment that is much more lenient than the two years in prison prescribed by law. \n \n Persky, who has reportedly faced death threats in the wake of the backlash has, however, received support from an unlikely source: the public defenders who represent indigent defendants in his Santa Clara county. \n \n Several have told the Guardian the judge has a reputation for being fair to their clients and his apparent leniency in the Stanford swimmer case was in-keeping with his general approach to criminal cases. \n \n However his role in the De Anza civil trial is likely to raise further questions about his handling of sexual assault cases. \n \n On the night of 4 March 2007, three members of the De Anza women’s soccer team barged into the bedroom of an off-campus house during a birthday party. They claimed that they found a 17-year-old girl unconscious and being sexually assaulted by a group of men. \n \n The witnesses testified that they tried to get inside the room, but men initially prevented them from entering. Inside, they said they saw a man thrusting on top of the woman. \n \n The female soccer players were later hailed as heroes by the San Jose city council. \n \n Stanford sexual assault case: victim impact statement in full Read more \n \n Eight members of the baseball team were quickly suspended by the community college’s athletics department, but no arrests were made, even after a second woman came forward to say that she too had been sexually assaulted by De Anza college baseball players. \n \n Two and a half months later, the Santa Clara County district attorney announced that she would not file criminal charges in the case, despite the fact that the sheriff, whose department investigated the case, stated publicly that she believed “a crime occurred”. \n \n “The bottom line is it’s not about what we believe happened or think happened. It’s about what we can prove happened,” the district attorney, Dolores Carr, told the San Francisco Chronicle at the time, in the face of intense criticism of her decision not to prosecute. \n \n The outcry against Carr in 2007 has been echoed by the torrent of anger directed at Persky since his sentencing of Turner. \n \n “It sent a message to victims that they can’t find justice in Santa Clara County,” Irene Weiser, an advocate for victims of assault, told the Chronicle at the time of the De Anza case. “It also sent a message to perpetrators and would-be perpetrators. It gave them a green light.” \n \n One year after the alleged 2007 assault took place, the young woman sought another avenue to have her day in court: a civil lawsuit seeking damages from her alleged attackers. \n \n Looking at the most recent case, it seems that [Persky’s] ruling was rooted in something different Monica Burneikis, attorney \n \n The case finally went in front of Persky and a jury in March 2011, following three years of legal wrangling overseen by a different judge. As a civil case, the plaintiff and her attorneys were tasked not with proving guilt, but with proving liability and culpability. \n \n The photographs of Jane Doe at a party less than a year after the alleged assault were allowed by Judge Persky after defense attorneys argued that they contradicted the plaintiff’s claims about how the alleged gang rape had harmed her emotionally and psychologically. \n \n At the time of the De Anza case, the plaintiff’s other lawyer, Monica Burneikis, speculated that at least one of Persky’s controversial rulings may have been because he was inexperienced in civil cases, but the Stanford case has changed her mind. \n \n “Looking at the most recent case, it seems that [Persky’s] ruling was rooted in something different,” Burneikis said. \n \n ‘Nail in a coffin’ \n \n Jane Doe’s lawyers said the photographs were not the only evidence that Persky unfairly permitted. \n \n Another controversy related to Persky’s handling of the case stemmed from his decision over testimony from the alleged attackers. \n \n Four of the baseball players invoked fifth amendment rights not to self-incriminate during the discovery phase of the litigation. \n \n According to Burneikis, that was a critical juncture: preventing the young woman’s team from obtaining evidence that could have helped them pursue their case. \n \n The original judge in the case ruled in 2010 that the defendants could stay silent, but that would also mean that they would be prohibited from testifying in a later part of the case. \n \n \n \n That ruling was, however, overturned by Persky, a move that Jane Doe’s attorneys now say undermined her case. \n \n Persky, taking over the trail in 2011, allowed one of the defendants, Christopher Knopf, to enter evidence that the woman’s lawyers believed should have been covered by the earlier judge’s order. \n \n “It was shocking to see judge Persky disregard that order,” Burneikis said. “One judge completely disregarding an order that another judge has entered: yes, that was unusual.” \n \n “It was devastating,” she continued. “I can remember how I felt the moment the ruling came down and it was like a nail in a coffin. I could not comprehend it.” \n \n Persky did not respond to requests for comment. Alison Crane, attorney for the defendants, who asked the woman about the questionable photos, also did not respond to requests for comment. \n \n Persky’s defenders \n \n Persky was only in the position to influence the outcome of the De Anza case because it was brought in civil, rather than criminal, court, after prosecutors did not bring charges. Such an outcome is indicative of a criminal justice system which, advocates for survivors of sexual assault say, fails to hold perpetrators accountable. Research has repeatedly shown that only a small fraction of rape cases lead to prosecution. \n \n The Stanford rape case: a white privilege cake with vanilla frosting on top Read more \n \n Persky’s critics have argued that his actions in the De Anza case and the Stanford assault reflect a lack of empathy for victims, noting that the judge himself was a former Stanford athlete. \n \n But defenders of the judge have come forward in recent days and argued that it’s critical for judges to have discretion and that he should be applauded for avoiding overly harsh sentences. \n \n “Persky has a reputation for being a thoughtful jurist and he has been fair and decent to our clients, many of whom come from poor socioeconomic backgrounds,” said Jennifer Redding, a public defender in Santa Clara. \n \n “Based on my experience and knowledge of judge Persky’s reputation I do not believe that he granted [Turner] probation because the defendant reportedly came from a privileged background,” said Andy Gutierrez, deputy public defender for Santa Clara county. \n \n Gutierrez noted that it can be especially challenging for judges to issue appropriate sentences when the crimes are violent or horrendous. But sometimes, he said, it’s the right thing to do. \n \n “In notorious cases, whether it involves a sexual assault, a child molestation, or even a gang crime, there is often public clamor for a heavy sentence. A judge must resist the temptation to be swallowed by such public sentiment. That is one of the toughest things for a judge to do.” \n \n This article was amended on 9 June 2016.

Citing #JudgePersky as hardship. 20 let go yesterday. @CBSSF — Len Ramirez (@lenramirez) June 9, 2016 \n \n The prospective jurors were there for an unrelated misdemeanor case involving a woman accused of receiving stolen goods. \n \n Persky has faced intense scrutiny for sentencing Brock Turner to six months for sexually assaulting a woman outside a fraternity house. An attorney for the public defender’s office said Persky and his family have been receiving threatening phone calls. A recall effort has also been launched against the judge. \n \n ALSO READ: \n \n The case gained worldwide attention after the victim’s emotional court statement addressing her attacker was posted online. \n \n Outrage over the case was also stoked by statements issued in Turner’s defense by his father and one of his childhood friends. \n \n KPIX 5 was in Persky’s courtroom on Thursday when the judge asked 17 potential jurors if they could be impartial in the case, and they all said yes. A short time later, Persky empaneled 12 of them, plus two alternates. \n \n Dr. Kulsoom Khan was excused for unknown reasons. She had no idea about the Turner case at all, and said it wasn’t brought up in her jury pool. Had she known about the controversy surrounding the judge, things would have gone much differently. \n \n Khan told KPIX 5 that she would have brought it up. “I didn’t know anything about it, but if I knew I probably would be biased,” she said. \n \n KPIX 5 Legal Analyst LaDoris Cordell said the turn of events was unprecedented to her knowledge. \n \n “I have never heard of potential jurors, people in the jury pool, boycotting a judge,” said Cordell. \n \n Cordell, who presided over criminal cases for 20 years as a Santa Clara County judge, said the turn of events could impact the juror pool. \n \n “The significance is that if this were to continue, word gets out that, Hey, if you don’t want to serve or don’t like a judge, just refuse to go in the courtroom, it could catch on and that would be bad, said Cordell. We rely on our jurors in order to make the system work.” \n \n Friday in San Francisco, activists will deliver about one million signatures to the California Commission on Judicial Performance demanding that Persky leave the bench. \n \n However, the judge is not without his supporters. A powerful voice in Santa Clara County is coming to his defense. \n \n “I think the sentence is fair,” said Santa Clara County Public Defender Molly O’Neal \n \n O’Neal may be one of very few people to believe that the sentence was the right call. \n \n “This was a rough decision for Judge Persky to make. But Mr. Turner is, in fact, going to go to jail, said O’Neal. He’s a convicted felon. He will have to register as a sex offender for the rest of his life.” \n \n But even one of Persky’s most outspoken critics, prosecutor Alaleh Kianerci, believes that is taking things too far. \n \n “He was absolutely neutral during the trial,” said Kianerci. “We just don’t agree with his sentence. But I don’t thing being a Stanford grad or a former athlete has anything to do with it.” \n \n While enormous attention has been focused on how much time turner will spend behind bars — likely three months of a six-month sentence — O’Neal said the judge almost certainly considered the implications of having to register as a sex offender. \n \n “I think Judge Persky heard all the testimony — weighed all of the considerations he’s required to by law — and arrived at a sentence through a fair process,” said O’Neal.', ""Image copyright AFP Image caption Mexican troops have been guarding the location where the bodies were found \n \n Investigators in Mexico are working to identify 28 bodies retrieved from a grave near the southern town of Iguala. \n \n The grave is located in an area where 43 protesting students went missing after clashing with police last month. \n \n Inaky Blanco, the chief prosecutor of Guerrero state, said identification could take two weeks. \n \n The students disappeared after taking part in a protest over teachers' rights.

""We\'ll take a look at mental health, schools. We know issues of gun safety will be an element of it."" \n \n In the past any effort at gun law reform has been viewed as an encroachment of the Second Amendment, Obama said, so he\'s looking for a thoughtful approach. \n \n ""There\'s a big chunk of space between what the Second Amendment means and having no rules at all,"" he said. ""That space is what we\'re going to be working on to see if we can find some common ground."" \n \n Not all gun violence can be prevented, Obama said, ""but that can\'t be an excuse not to try."" \n \n Reform will require Americans from across the political and cultural spectrum to work together. \n \n ""If we\'re going to change things, it\'s going to take a wave of Americans … standing up and saying, \'Enough,\' on behalf of our kids."" \n \n In addition to reforming laws concerning military-style semi-automatic rifles and high-capacity magazines, Congress should close a loophole that allows gun sales at gun shows without a background check, Obama said. \n \n He also emphasized the need to improve access to mental health care. \n \n ""We need to make access to mental health care at least as easy as access to a gun,"" he said. \n \n ""This time, the words need to lead to action."" \n \n Biden was the author of the 1994 crime bill that led to a ban on assault weapons, a ban that Obama noted was supported by all living former presidents at the time, including Ronald Reagan. \n \n ""There\'s already a growing consensus for us to build upon,"" Obama said. The majority of Americans already support banning the sale of assault weapons and high-capacity clips, as well as [requiring] background checks before any gun purchases, he said. \n \n Meanwhile, as detectives continue to comb through evidence and talk to people who witnessed Friday\'s mass murder at Sandy Hook Elementary School, the state\'s chief medical examiner Dr. H. Wayne Carver has asked a geneticist at the University of Connecticut to join in his investigation of the killings. \n \n Carver is awaiting toxicology testing results for gunman Adam Lanza, 20, and information that may help answer the question of why Lanza gunned down 20 first-graders and six women at Sandy Hook. \n \n ""I\'m exploring with the department of genetics what might be possible, if anything is possible,"" Carver said Tuesday. ""Is there any identifiable disease associated with this behavior?"" \n \n Carver said he does not know whether Lanza had Asperger\'s syndrome — a possibility that has been raised — but he said Asperger\'s ""is simply not on the menu, in terms of what is wrong with this kid. Asperger\'s is not associated with behavior patterns that are violent."" \n \n Determining why Lanza went on a rampage that apparently ended only when fast-arriving police prompted him to kill himself may be difficult. Lanza destroyed a hard drive from his computer, which authorities had hoped would reveal clues about what he did, and he killed his mother as she slept. \n \n Carver said that Nancy Lanza died of four gunshots to the head from a .22-caliber rifle. She was in bed when her son killed her, and likely still asleep, Carver said. The rifle was left at the house. \n \n Mary Ellen O\'Toole, a retired FBI profiler and behavioral scientist, said seeking an answer in Adam Lanza\'s biology is worthwhile. \n \n ""I think it\'s great to consider if there\'s something here that would help people understand this behavior,"" O\'Toole said. \n \n There will be other important clues contained in the reports that detectives prepare about the crime scene and their interviews with witnesses, O\'Toole said. Some of that information may help behavioral scientists answer the key question: why? \n \n One thing is apparent from the evidence made public so far, she said. The assault on Sandy Hook Elementary ""was not an impulsive act,"" she said. ""This was well thought out."" \n \n The planning could have gone on for days, weeks or months, she said. \n \n State police Lt. J. Paul Vance has repeatedly described the investigation as a process during which Newtown and state police detectives will peel back the layers of the case. Just how much of the story detectives will finally be able to tell remains unknown, but it will not be a fast process. \n \n ""It\'s going to take months,"" Vance said. \n \n Gov. Dannel P. Malloy has declared Friday a day of mourning and has asked that people observe a moment of silence at 9:30 a.m. He has also asked houses of worship and government buildings with bells to ring them 26 times in honor of the victims. \n \n ""Let us all come together collectively to mourn the loss of far too many promising lives at Sandy Hook Elementary School,"" Malloy said. ""Though we will never know the full measure of sorrow experienced by these families, we can let them know that we stand with them during this difficult time."" \n \n Malloy has also asked governors throughout the nation to join Connecticut ""during this time of reflection and mourning."" \n \n ""Mourning this tragedy has extended beyond Newtown, beyond the borders of Connecticut, and has spread across the nation and the world,"" Malloy said. ""On behalf of the state of Connecticut, we appreciate the letters and calls of support that have been delivered to our state and to the family members during their hour of need."" \n \n Meanwhile, in Washington, D.C., Connecticut\'s senators thanked their colleagues for a resolution of condolence and support for Newtown and urged Congress to never let such a tragedy occur again. \n \n ""Criminal and deranged people should not be able to get their hands on firearms,\'\' said Democrat Richard Blumenthal, who called for ""a meaningful and thoughtful debate. ..

KPIX reports that on Wednesday, some 20 potential jurors refused to serve on a jury in an unrelated stolen-goods case under Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge Aaron Persky. ""I can't believe what you did,"" one woman told Persky, referring to his lenient sentence for Stanford sex attacker Brock Turner, the San Jose Mercury News reports. In other developments: Lawyer Barbara Spector tells the New York Daily News that in a 2011 civil trial over the alleged gang rape of a 17-year-old girl, she felt Persky sided with the group of baseball players accused of raping the girl. Spector says Persky allowed lawyers for the defendants to show Facebook photos of the girl wearing revealing clothing months after the incident because they argued the photos showed she did not have PTSD. Persky has his defenders, who say he is fair-minded and not a man known for issuing harsh sentences—or bowing to public pressure. He has ""a reputation for being a thoughtful jurist and he has been fair and decent to our clients, many of whom come from poor socioeconomic backgrounds,"" a public defender in Santa Clara tells the Guardian. In an open letter to Turner's victim published on BuzzFeed, Joe Biden praises her ""breathtaking"" bravery and ""solid steel spine."" ""Your story has already changed lives,"" he writes. ""You have helped change the culture. You have shaken untold thousands out of the torpor and indifference towards sexual violence that allows this problem to continue."" Rep. Ted Poe, a former prosecutor and judge from Texas, read portions of the victim's searing court statement in the House yesterday and called for voters to recall Persky, the Dallas Morning News reports. ""This judge got it wrong. There is an archaic philosophy in some courts that sin ain't sin as long as good folk do it,"" said Poe, a Republican. ""The judge should be removed. The rapist should do more time for the dastardly deed he did that night."" The Huffington Post reports that on the evening of June 15, lawmakers from both parties will spend an hour reading the Stanford victim's statement in full in the House.

104,"['By Staff Sgt. Benjamin W. Stratton, 7th Air Force Public Affairs / Published March 24, 2017 \n \n OSAN AIR BASE, South Korea (AFNS) -- South Korea and U.S. military forces participated in an annual command and control exercise called Key Resolve (KR17) held across the Korean Peninsula March 8 to 23, 2017. \n \n \n \n From its start, the exercise highlights the longstanding and enduring partnership and friendship between the two nations and their combined commitment to the defense of South Korea and regional stability. \n \n \n \n Approximately 12,800 U.S. forces along with 10,000 South Korean military personnel joined dozens of augmentation forces and multinational representatives from the United Nations Command including Australia, Canada, Denmark, France and Great Britain. \n \n \n \n Lt. Gen. Thomas Bergeson, the Air Component Command, South Korea/U.S. Combined Forces Command and 7th Air Force commander, explained the significance of exercises like Key Resolve and the combined U.S. and U.N. commitment to South Korea. \n \n \n \n “Our mission is first and foremost to deter any aggression from North Korea,” he said. “If that deterrence fails then we are in a position to defend the Republic of Korea. And if we defend, we are going to defeat the enemy and win.” \n \n \n \n The general went on to explain how vitally important this region of the world is to all nations. \n \n \n \n “Over 20 percent of the world’s economic output comes from Northeast Asia,” he continued. “This is a very vital portion of the world and so it’s extremely important not just to the United States but to the rest of the world as well.” \n \n \n \n KR17 is conducted in accordance with the South Korean-U.S. Mutual Defense Treaty, signed Oct. 1, 1953. The exercise strengthens the two nation’s regional security cooperation essential for addressing the growing threat from North Korea. A strong defense relationship among the U.S., CFC and South Korea serves as the anchor of stability in the region. \n \n \n \n “Allies are critical to the United States,” Bergeson said. “Our friends and our allies, we share common values: democracy, respect for human rights and laws, and so we want to work together to try to retain peace and security throughout this region.” \n \n \n \n The defense treaty further emboldens Koreans and Americans alike in their collective desire “to strengthen the fabric of peace in the Pacific area.” \n \n \n \n Exercises like KR17 afford both U.S. and South Korean service members an opportunity to work side-by-side in the same way they would operate if actually going to war. Senior Airman Ivan Cooper, with the 15th Operations Support Squadron at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, Hawaii, explains how this experience not only makes him a better Airman, but a more effective weather forecaster. \n \n \n \n “Key Resolve has really opened my eyes to new ways of handling difficult situations,” he said. “It helps improve our communication skills not only internally with other Americans, but especially with the Koreans as well.” \n \n \n \n Cooper’s weather forecast counterpart in the South Korean air force, 1st Lt. Jaewon Yoo with the Osan Weather Squadron, echoed his partner’s sentiment saying the opportunity to work side-by-side with U.S. forecasters has been an extremely enriching experience. \n \n \n \n “This is very important because the way we forecast is different from the way the Americans forecast,” Yoo explained. “Key Resolve has brought us closer together and helped us understand how we can work as a unified team to deter the enemy and make a difference.” \n \n \n \n That feeling reaches up and down the ranks, from airman basic through the general officers, and only emboldens U.S. and South Korean forces in their deterrence mission as the common ground. \n \n \n \n “We’re not going to fight wars alone,” said Capt. Abi Oilar, an air battle manager with the 612th Air Operations Center at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona. “Back at home station, I’m used to operating at the tactical level, whereas here, I’ve had to do more critical thinking and approach the scenarios from a different perspective. Working alongside the (South Korean air force) has opened my eyes to new ways of approaching the situations that I’ll be able to take back with me and share with others in my home command.” \n \n \n \n But it takes more than air power to win a war and according to Bergeson, the Korean Air Power Team is made up of the U.S. Air Force, the South Korean air force as well as the 35th Air Defense Artillery Brigade and U.S. Army and liaisons from the U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Navy that all bring together their air components into what the general calls the Korean Air Power Team. \n \n \n \n “The Air Component is responsible for any of the operations in air, space and cyberspace,” the general said. “The other components are responsible for operations in their domains, whether on land or in the sea, or with the Marines who are doing amphibious operations. So we coordinate with them every day by having liaison officers who work in all different command centers.” \n \n \n \n One such liaison officer, U.S. Army Maj. Tony Wrice, with the 3rd Battlefield Coordination Detachment at Osan AB, said it’s “amazing what we can do when we come together as one unified team.” \n \n \n \n “This exercise has been a really great experience working together with our Air Force, the (South Korean air force) and (South Korean) army, and all the UNCs,” Wrice said. “I’m responsible for ensuring our artillery and other ground forces don’t conflict with the needs and operations of the air component. Every day I’m working with (South Korean air force) and (South Korean) army counterparts to make sure we can communicate each component’s needs, de-conflict any issues and meet objectives.” \n \n \n \n Although Army personnel are greatly outnumbered in this exercise, their necessity to mission success remains as evident today as during the Korean War nearly 70 years ago. \n \n \n \n “To be able to bring all our resources together and really focus on winning the fight is incredible,” Wrice continued. “Key Resolve makes it all happen.” \n \n \n \n The exercise is about more than sharpening South Korea’s defense, it’s about assembling a team by building on old friendships with a renewed focus on freedom and prosperity across the Indo-Asia-Pacific region. \n \n \n \n “The team has done extraordinarily well,” the general said. “This is a difficult exercise, we want it to be difficult, and so we are learning lessons as we go along. Some things we’re not doing perfectly but that’s why you do it; that’s why you practice. You practice to make it very difficult so that if you were ever to have to do this for real, you’re prepared for it.” \n \n \n \n Similarly, South Korean air force Lt. Gen. Won In Choul, the Air Component Command deputy commander, said he couldn’t be prouder of the brave men and women who daily put their lives on the line in defense of South Korea. \n \n \n \n “Forged in the blood spilled by the Korean War, six decades of ROK-U.S. alliance has developed and fortified each nation’s military, economy and diplomacy,” he said. “(Our combined) planning and preparation allowed this to be the most realistic exercise in history. I’m grateful for the dedication and passion of not only ROK and U.S. Airmen but also Soldiers, Sailors and Marines.” \n \n \n \n “I wish safe travels for the augmentees who participated in the exercise from outside the Korean theater of operations,” Choul added. “Thank you.”', 'OSAN AIR BASE, South Korea — With the stakes on the Korean peninsula as high as they have ever been, life for the men and women here with the U.S. Air Force\'s 51st Fighter Wing is lived in a state of constant alert. \n \n South Korea has no nuclear weapons, so it relies on the United States\' nuclear umbrella to deter North Korea and its erratic leader, Kim Jong Un. \n \n That makes Osan — less than 50 miles from the Demilitarized Zone separating the mortal enemies and home to a large proportion of the 28,500 U.S. military personnel in South Korea — the leading edge of the shield that protects the South from the North. \n \n Hence the base\'s slogan: ""Ready to Fight Tonight."" \n \n Play Facebook \n \n Twitter \n \n Embed U.S. Military in North Korea: \'Ready to Fight Tonight\' 3:08 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog \n \n NBC Nightly News Exclusive: Lester Holt anchors from South Korea on Monday and Tuesday, April 3 and 4, at 6:30pm ET. \n \n Patriot missile batteries are poised to defend the base from North Korean ballistic missiles.

(Associated Press) \n \n The ministry said Friday that police were at the scene outside its mission, which neighbors Germany\'s Sudan embassy in Khartoum East. \n \n ""We can confirm an ongoing demonstration outside the British Embassy in Khartoum. Sudanese police are at the scene,"" the ministry said in a statement. \n \n The ministry could not immediately confirm how many staff were inside the mission, or whether they are all accounted for. \n \n THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. Check back soon for further information. AP\'s earlier story is below. \n \n Egyptian riot police clashed with protesters angry over an anti-Islam film blocks away from the U.S. Embassy in Cairo as the president went on state TV and appealed to Muslims to protect embassies, trying to patch up strained relations with the United States. \n \n Several hundred protesters massed in Cairo\'s Tahrir Square after weekly Muslim Friday prayers and tore up an American flag, waving a black, Islamist flag. When protesters tried to move toward the embassy, several blocks away, they were confronted by lines of police who fired tear gas. \n \n ""With our soul, our blood, we will avenge you, our Prophet,"" they chanted. \n \n Ahead of the clashes, Islamist President Mohammed Morsi spoke for more than seven minutes on state TV, his most direct public move to contain protests since an angry crowd assaulted the embassy Tuesday night, scaling its walls and tearing down the American flag. \n \n ""It is required by our religion to protect our guests and their homes and places of work,"" Morsi said. ""So I call on all to consider this, consider the law, and not attack embassies, consulates, diplomatic missions or Egyptian property that is private or public."" \n \n He denounced the killing of the American ambassador in Libya, who died in an attack Tuesday night on the U.S. Consulate in the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi along with three other Americans. \n \n ""This is something we reject and Islam rejects. To God, the attack on a person to Allah is bigger an attack on the Kaaba,"" he said, referring to Islam\'s holiest site in Mecca. \n \n The region is bracing itself for more protests after traditional mid-day Friday prayers over the anti-Islam film produced in the United States called ""Innocence of Muslims."" The movie ridicules the Prophet Muhammad, portraying him as a fraud, a womanizer and a child molester. \n \n Morsi\'s own Muslim Brotherhood group has called for peaceful protests to denounce the film. \n \n A firebrand cleric with the beard of a Salafi Muslim, known for their ultraconservative views, blasted the film and in his sermon in Cairo\'s Tahrir Square said it was upon Muslims to defend Islam and its prophet. \n \n Protesters have been clashing in Cairo with police since the unrest Tuesday night. More than 240 people have been injured in the clashes, including a number of policemen, and 31 people have been arrested. \n \n In Sudan, a prominent sheikh urged people on state radio to protest outside the main mosque in Khartoum. Sheikh Mohammed Jizouly said protesters would then move to the German Embassy in the city center to protest alleged anti-Muslim scrawling on mosques in Berlin and then to the US embassy, just outside the capital, to protest the film. \n \n ""America has long been an enemy to Islam and to Sudan,"" Jizouly said. \n \n In Israel, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said police have boosted the number of officers patrolling east Jerusalem and Jerusalem\'s old city to thwart potentially violent protests following Muslim prayers at the Al-Aqsa mosque, Islam\'s third holiest site. Protesters are expected to march to the U.S. consulate in Jerusalem. \n \n A small, peaceful demonstration was held Friday outside the U.S. Embassy in the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur. \n \n A prominent cleric in Indonesia has urged Muslims there to remain calm despite their anger about the film. But Hizbut Tahrir Indonesia, a branch of the international network that advocates a worldwide Islamic state, on its website blamed the U.S. government for allowing the film to be produced and released, calling it ""an act of barbarism that cannot go unpunished."" \n \n Meanwhile, a Libyan airport official said all flights to and from the eastern city of Benghazi were canceled due to security concerns. The nearest airport is 200 kilometers away. The airport official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to release the information. \n \n Benghazi is where the attack on the U.S. consulate took place Tuesday. \n \n ___ \n \n Additional reporting by Esam Mohamed in Tripoli, Ahmed Al-Haj in Sanaa, Yemen, Daniel Estrin in Jerusalem and Niniek Karmini in Jakarta, Indonesia.']",3,"– Osan Air Base may not be a name you're familiar with, but it's a US Air Force base that sits in a prime location: fewer than 50 miles from the Demilitarized Zone that separates North and South Korea.

105,"['Remember the California couple who found $10 million in gold coins on their property? They’re probably going to end up with NOTHING in the final analysis, as breaking news from San Francisco reveals that the source of the mystery gold has been discovered: \n \n A story that describes a gold heist from the San Francisco Mint at the turn of the century could explain the source of the gold coins worth $10 million that were found last month in California’s Mother Lode country. The published news item was discovered in the Haithi Trust Digital Library and was provided by Northern California fishing guide Jack Trout, who doubles as a historian and collector of rare coins. \n \n The details of the 1899 heist — $30,000 face value of uncirculated gold coins stolen from the San Francisco Mint in 1899 — matches every known fact about the gold coins found recently in the Sierra foothills, which were nearly $30,000 in face value of uncirculated mint condition coins mostly made at the San Francisco Mint in the late 1800s. \n \n If, as is almost certainly the case, this explains the origin of the found coins, then the couple who found them will not merely have to pay taxes on them — they’ll have to turn them over entirely back to the federal government, since the coins’ status has changed from “treasure trove” to “stolen goods”: \n \n Treasure trove is any gold or silver in coin, plate, or bullion that is hidden by an unknown owner in the earth or other private place for an extended period. The property is not considered treasure trove unless the identity of the owner cannot be determined. Under early common law, the finder of a treasure trove took title to it against everyone but the true owner. The U.S. law governing treasure trove has been merged, for the most part, into the law governing lost property. In the absence of a contrary statutory provision, the title to treasure trove belongs to the finder against all others with the exception of the true owner. \n \n It was a nice story while it lasted. \n \n UPDATE \n \n Just to clarify: \n \n The finders will EITHER have to hand over all the coins back to the government, OR pay taxes on them (on the off-chance they win the legal battle to retain ownership of the coins). Under no circumstance (of which I am aware) would they have to pay taxes AND return the coins. \n \n UPDATE II \n \n A few of the coins in the hoard were from different U.S. Mints and from earlier in the 19th century. It could be the case that the Federal Government might only be able to prove that the coins amongst the hoard which can be confirmed as coming from the San Francisco Mint in 1899 must be returned, while the finders could contest that the remaining coins were not part of that robbery and thus not necessarily stolen property. It’s entirely possible that the person who originally buried the hoard mixed in coins from more than one different sources (or crimes). In this case, the finders and the government would split ownership. \n \n UPDATE III \n \n According to the 1906 edition of the official Hearings Before the Subcommittee of the House Committee on Appropriations, a mint clerk named W.N. Dimmick was caught and convicted of stealing $30,000 in gold coins from the San Francisco Mint — although in the description of the case no mention is made of whether Dimmick ever revealed the location of the stolen coins, or whether they were ever recovered. \n \n Here is the full text of the relevant minutes from the House Hearings: \n \n \n \n \n \n Note that there is a discrepancy in the date of the supposed crime: Was it 1899, or 1901? A few pages later in the same minutes is this passage revealing that there may have been many other thefts from the mint as well, due to a plague of dishonest mint employees: \n \n Also note that one of the coins found in the hoard was an ultra-rare 1866 Liberty $20 gold piece missing the phrase “In God We Trust” — a coin which was never released to the public and which must have been produced and kept within the mint itself. \n \n This link to an article in the July 9, 1901 edition of the San Francisco Chronicle has more details about the Dimmick theft.', 'A California couple who found a stash of buried gold coins valued at $10 million may not be so lucky after all. The coins may have been stolen from the U.S. Mint in 1900 and thus be the property of the government, according to a published report. \n \n The San Francisco Chronicle\'s website reported that a search of the Haithi Trust Digital Library provided by Northern California fishing guide Jack Trout, who is also a historian and collector of rare coins, turned up the news of the theft. \n \n WATCH: $10M Gold Coins May Be Linked to Heist \n \n Play \n \n The California couple, who have not been identified, spotted the edge of an old can on a path they had hiked many times before several months ago. Poking at the can was the first step in uncovering a buried treasure of rare coins estimated to be worth $10 million. \n \n ""It was like finding a hot potato,"" the couple told coin expert Don Kagin from Kagin\'s, Inc. The couple hired the president of Kagin\'s, Inc. and Holabird-Kagin Americana, a western Americana dealer and auctioneer, to represent them. \n \n The coins are mostly uncirculated and in mint condition, and they add up in face value to $27,000. ""Those two facts are a match of the gold heist in 1900 from the San Francisco Mint,"" the newspaper reported. \n \n Jack Trout told the paper that an 1866 Liberty $20 gold piece without the words ""In God We Trust"" was part of the buried stash, and the coin may fetch over $1 million at auction because it\'s so rare. \n \n ""This was someone\'s private coin, created by the mint manager or someone with access to the inner workings of the Old Granite Lady (San Francisco Mint),"" Trout told the newspaper. ""It was likely created in revenge for the assassination of Lincoln the previous year (April 14, 1865). I don\'t believe that coin ever left The Mint until the robbery. For it to show up as part of the treasure find links it directly to that inside job at the turn of the century at the San Francisco Mint."" \n \n Mint spokesman Adam Stump issued this statement when contacted today by ABC News: ""We do not have any information linking the Saddle Ridge Hoard coins to any thefts at any United States Mint facility. Surviving agency records from the San Francisco Mint have been retired to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), under Record Group 104. Access to the records is under NARA\'s jurisdiction: http://www.archives.gov/."" \n \n Last week, when news of the stash first broke, coin dealer Kagin spoke about the rarity of such a find. \n \n ""Since 1981, people have been coming to us with one or two coins they find worth a few thousand dollars, but this is the first time we get someone with a whole cache of buried coins... It is a million to one chance, even harder than winning the lottery,"" Kagin told ABCNews.com. \n \n The couple is trying to remain anonymous after finding the five cans of coins last spring on their Tiburon property in northern California and conducted an interview with Kagin. \n \n WATCH: $10M Gold-Coin Surprise Uncovered in Calif. \n \n ""I never would have thought we would have found something like this. However, in a weird way I feel like I have been preparing my whole life for it,"" the couple said. \n \n ""I saw an old can sticking out of the ground on a trail that we had walked almost every day for many, many years. I was looking down in the right spot and saw the side of the can. I bent over to scrape some moss off and noticed that it had both ends on it,"" they said. \n \n It was the first of five cans to be unearthed, each packed with gold coins. \n \n ""Nearly all of the 1,427 coins, dating from 1847 to 1894, are in uncirculated, mint condition,"" said Kagin told ABCNews.com. \n \n He said that the couple plan to sell most of the coins, but before they do, they are ""loaning some to the American Numismatic Association for its National Money Show, which opens Thursday in Atlanta."" \n \n ""Some of the rarest coins could fetch as much as $1 million apiece,"" said Kagin. He also said that they wish to sell 90 percent of the collection through Amazon.com and on the company\'s website. \n \n ""We\'d like to help other people with some of this money. There are people in our community who are hungry and don\'t have enough to eat. We\'ll also donate to the arts and other overlooked causes. In a way it has been good to have time between finding the coins and being able to sell them in order to prepare and adjust. It\'s given us an opportunity to think about how to give back,"" said the couple. \n \n Kagin and his colleague David McCarthy, senior numismatist and researcher at Kagin\'s, met with the couple last April, two months after the hoard was found. \n \n When McCarthy and Kagin told the couple that their bonanza will be in the annals of numismatic stories for quite some time, the couple said, ""It would have been quite a pity not to share the magnitude of our find. We want to keep the story of these coins intact for posterity.""', 'Joanna Weiss is a writer based in Boston and a former television critic for the Boston Globe. \n \n In the first episode of “Roseanne,” the ’90s sitcom that launches a revival run on ABC on Tuesday, we learn that Roseanne Conner and her sister Jackie haven’t spoken in a year, on account of the 2016 election. Roseanne, played by the outspoken comedian Roseanne Barr, voted for Donald Trump. Jackie, played by Laurie Metcalf, did not. “Not only did she vote for the worst person on Earth,” Roseanne says, “but she was a real jerk about it, too.” Jackie shows up at the house wearing a pink pussy hat and a “Nasty Woman” T-shirt. After a tense dinner, the sisters shout and parry; Roseanne explains her vote—“He talked about jobs, Jackie. He said he’d shape things up”—and Jackie tells Roseanne what she was really thinking on Election Day, and whom she really voted for. No one switches sides, but they declare a truce and return to their default relationship, loving but comically strained. \n \n It’s the most overtly political exchange in the episode, and in the nine-episode season overall, says executive producer Bruce Helford. But the way he describes it, it’s also a metaphor for the series and its overarching goals. Barr herself is a vocal Trump supporter, and has talked about how meaningful it felt to place one of TV’s quintessential working-class families in Year Two of the Trump administration. So I asked Helford, who also worked on the original show, about the producers’ intention. Was it to appeal to Trump voters, who might finally see themselves in sympathetic TV characters? To explain the Trump-voter mind-set to coastal elites? To bridge the gap between two sides? \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n Helford responded by talking about conversations. As ever-present as politics might be in people’s lives today, he notes, we often avoid tough discussions, in real life, with people on the opposite side. \n \n “There are lots of families that are divided. It’s like a civil war,” Helford says, recounting some of his own family gatherings, where people steered away from political topics because they knew things would get too heated or cruel. “What’s really important to ‘Roseanne,’ and for all of us, is to put the whole discourse out in the open,” he says. “We’re hoping we can bring a kind of dialogue back.” \n \n The idea that a sitcom could change American discourse feels like something between a tall order and a self-aggrandizing Hollywood pipe dream. But it’s also not entirely far-fetched. A sitcom, after all, is TV’s best approximation of your own extended family—a group of characters you examine, understand and invite into your living room on a regular basis. And the Conners have been a proxy family for millions of Americans. They sniped at each other, reconciled and hugged for nearly a decade, from 1988 to 1997, consistently landing at or near the top of the Nielsen ratings. They reached millennials through reruns on Nick at Nite and TV Land. \n \n The Conners happen to fit the stereotype of the white exurban Trump voter. They live in fictional Lanford, Illinois—loosely based on the city of Elgin—struggle with money and chronic underemployment and blink in disbelief at the pace of social change. And they return at a time when countless media outlets have sent reporters into the heartland, with the inquisitive zeal of foreign correspondents, to uncover the hopes and fears of the white working class. (Some artists have tried to cross the divide—notably, Sarah Silverman, whose fall Hulu show “I Love You, America” sent its liberal star to kibbitz with real people with opposing politics.) \n \n The results of these well-meaning inquiries are filtered through the echo chamber, with predictable results. Depending on your perspective, you might mistrust that earnest mainstream-media feature because it comes from a Fake News purveyor, or view it from a distance, detachedly, like an anthropological study. The “Roseanne” revival lands in this polarized world, and it’s unclear how it will be received. Barr’s outspoken pro-Trump views, and her pugnacious Twitter feed, have turned off some potential viewers; this winter, activists tried to launch a boycott movement to persuade ABC to drop the show. \n \n Still, anticipation has been high, driven by nostalgia and genuine affection for the characters. Those are powerful forces, says Dannagal Young, a professor of communications at the University of Delaware who studies the interplay between politics and humor. And they give the show a chance to reach an audience that journalism can’t. \n \n The academic term for this phenomenon, Young says, is “parasocial relationship.” We have a natural tendency to empathize with fictional characters and distant celebrities. And as we’re drawn into their narratives, we’re forced to imagine life from their perspective. That’s how some of the other sitcoms currently undergoing revivals have, if not created social change, at least greased the gears that propel it forward: “Will and Grace,” now running on NBC, helped pave the way for gay rights and gay marriage. “Murphy Brown,” which is returning for a 13-episode run on CBS next season, advanced the conversation about women and mothers in the workplace. \n \n “Once you tap into that empathy and you put yourself in the shoes of someone who’s experiencing those issues,” Young says, “then you have your guard down, and you’re exploring this issue without the reflexive partisanship that seems to invade everything these days.” \n \n But “Roseanne” isn’t just trying to explain the Conners’ perspective to outsiders. It’s also one of few TV series that has focused on the working-class white experience, allowing a demographic that’s psychologically distant from Hollywood to see itself in a positive, nonjudgmental light. “There’s something really important about visibility and representation, and we know that because we’ve heard it from minority groups for years,” Young says. At a time when viewership is fractured and even NFL football gets swept up into the partisan divide, this feels like a rare opportunity: a show that people of different perspectives might actually watch together. \n \n Hanging out with the Conners, 20 years after they first left the air, requires some willing and winking suspension of disbelief to erase some casting shifts and abandoned plot points. (Most notably: Roseanne’s husband, Dan, played by John Goodman, was killed off in the series finale in 1997, and now is very much alive.) \n \n But the central themes of the show, like the afghan on the couch in the Conners’ living room, haven’t changed much since the original. “Roseanne” was always about the stops and starts of a family that couldn’t keep up with the economy, and it remains a study of downward mobility. The Conners’ younger daughter, Darlene—played by Sara Gilbert, an executive producer and driving force behind the revival—is now a struggling single parent who has moved back in with Roseanne and Dan. Their older son, D.J., is a military veteran whose wife is still serving overseas. Their older daughter, Becky, is widowed, works as a waitress, and intends to become a surrogate mother—because, she tells her family, the $50,000 she’d earn would allow her to pay off her credit cards and possibly buy a house. ($50,000 “just for having a baby?” Roseanne quips when she hears the news. “Dan, you owe me $200,000.”) \n \n Many of the painfully specific dilemmas the family faces, Helford says, unfolded naturally as the writers imagined how the characters would live and act. Barr had a knee injury before the shooting began, he says; she thought at one point that she’d have to perform in a wheelchair, and wound up with a demonstrable limp. The writers realized they needed to write her injury into the show. And a storyline flowed logically from there: They imagined that she’d be on painkillers, that some of her supply might not come from her doctor, and that she thus gets swept up into the country’s deepening opioid crisis. What she really needs is surgery—which is out of reach because the family health care plan has a $3,000 deductible. “We just took the next step and the next step and the next step,” Helford says. “We really tried to get into the heart of what a family would be dealing with.” \n \n That extends to other issues of the day, economic and otherwise. Darlene’s son, Mark, is an elementary-school-aged boy who likes to dress in girls’ clothes—and wants to attend his new school wearing frilly boots and a sparkly skirt. Dan objects: “May the winds fill his sails and carry him to the boys section of Target,” he says at one point. But it’s not that he reflexively disapproves; he’s mostly afraid the boy, whom he loves desperately, will be picked on by other kids. The characters talk it out, as they will later in the season, Helford says, when the Conners encounter illegal immigrants from Mexico: Are they hurting the current residents or—as the character Roseanne will contend—being exploited themselves? \n \n That sense of hashing it out, rather than simply declaring judgment, is consistent with a show that always wrestled with social issues, from gender dynamics to gay rights. “The Conners were a very accepting group of people. They were very much about being open to people who were different from them,” Helford says. And the writers still assume that, regardless of their politics, the characters think and act with good intention. “We write it from the point of view that working-class people are the nobility of this country,” Helford says, “and not that they’re rednecks or hillbillies.” \n \n That representation is achieved in part, he says, by deliberately filling the writers room with people who have experienced working-class life. (Helford, for his part, grew up poor in Chicago.) And the old-fashioned format, a multi-camera comedy filmed before a live studio audience, gives the characters space and time to express their views. A single-camera show—the format for most prestige comedies today—requires tight dialogue and short takes: “If you’re in a scene for more than two pages, you’re bored,” Helford says. “If you’re in a multi-cam, you’re sitting there for eight pages for a scene. And the words become more important and the thoughts become more important.” \n \n In “Roseanne,” that can mean awkward silences and deeply serious themes; there are jokes, lots of them, but there also are moments when this feels like the saddest show on television. But then, a lot of long-running sitcoms, once they earned viewers’ trust, have had the power to take on dramatic issues with credibility and power. Young points to a famous scene from a 1994 “Fresh Prince of Bel-Air” episode—in which Will Smith’s character confronts his deadbeat father—that has become indelible for a generation of TV viewers.“We share their lives with them week to week,” Young says. “And it wouldn’t be as authentic an experience if we didn’t also share moments of hardship.” \n \n Helford contends that the country still has an appetite for honest and tough conversations, softened by levity—even if the underlying issues aren’t resolved, even if we’ve taken to unfriending foes on Facebook and retreating to like-minded Twitter feeds. “America had no problem inviting Norman Lear’s shows into their homes as guests,” he says. “America likes a good, tough discussion.” \n \n Of course, it all depends on whether America tunes in. When it airs at 8 p.m. Tuesday, “Roseanne” will be up against “NCIS,” “The Voice,” everything on Netflix, Hulu and YouTube, and, of course, the cable networks that filter politics through the old tropes of opposition, anger and judgment. Time will tell whether Helford’s theory holds, and whether viewers like what they see. But Young has hope. For a course on politics and entertainment, she recently gave her college students an assignment: Imagine that you’re working to reduce political polarization through the development of a film or TV series. How would you produce psychological empathy? What content would you create? \n \n They took to the project with gusto, she says. And the imaginary show they came up with often centered on average families, stocked with liberals and conservatives who were forced to experience things together: the death of a loved one, the stress over financial hardship, the overcoming of shared obstacles. In other words, they sounded a lot like “Roseanne.” \n \n This article tagged under: Television \n \n Culture Club', 'Image copyright AFP Image caption There are fears that the latest moves could lead to unrest in Catalonia \n \n Spain is to start suspending Catalonia\'s autonomy from Saturday, as the region\'s leader threatens to declare independence. \n \n The government said ministers would meet to activate Article 155 of the constitution, allowing it to take over running of the region. \n \n Catalonia\'s leader said the region\'s parliament would vote on independence if Spain continued ""repression"". \n \n A referendum outlawed by Spain was held earlier this month. \n \n Of the 43% who voted, 90% were in favour of independence. \n \n Some fear the latest moves could spark further unrest after mass demonstrations before and since the ballot on 1 October. \n \n Spain\'s supreme court declared the vote illegal and said it violated the constitution, which describes the country as indivisible. \n \n Article 155 of the constitution, which cemented democratic rule three years after the death of dictator General Francisco Franco in 1975, allows Madrid to impose direct rule in a crisis but it has never been invoked. \n \n BBC Madrid correspondent Tom Burridge says that for Madrid this is about upholding the rule of law in Catalonia, protecting the Spanish constitution and disciplining what it sees as an unruly, disobedient devolved government. \n \n However, the central government wants to minimise the risk of large-scale demonstrations, our correspondent says.

Lending credence to the theory: The unearthed 1,427 gold coins, dated 1847 to 1894, were mostly uncirculated and in chronological order, suggesting they hadn't entered the public realm. And though they are worth millions today, their face value is $27,000, which roughly syncs with what was taken from the mint. Trout also points to the buried stash's 1866 Liberty $20 gold piece not emblazoned with ""In God We Trust""; he suspects it was a private coin created by a mint manager that never left the mint. ""For it to show up as part of the treasure find links it directly"" to the mint heist, he says. But the couple's coin broker is no fan of the mint robbery theory, telling the Chronicle he'd expect the haul would have included coins dated closer to the heist date. But a former SF Mint detective sees it as plausible: ""Downstairs, we had vaults where we kept old coins that hadn't been put into circulation."" PJMedia further digs up a 1906 congressional report that indicates mint clerk W.N. Dimmick was convicted of the mint theft, but the document doesn't state whether Dimmick revealed the coins' location, or if they had been recovered. ABC News notes that if the coins are indeed purloined government property, the couple may owe Uncle Sam more than a heck of a lot in taxes: They may have to turn over the entire haul, and get a finder's fee in return."
106,"['The Community of Christ\x92s USA National Conference has recommended policy changes that would allow for the ordination of gay people and marriages or covenant commitment services of gay couples. \n \n The conference held last weekend attracted about 2,000 people, including about 1,500 delegates, to the Community of Christ Auditorium in Independence, said Kendra Friend, a member of the church\x92s communications and media relations team. \n \n The delegates, by more than the required majority, recommended that the sacrament of marriage be extended to members of the same sex where legal in the United States. \n \n In areas where it\x92s not legal, the conference delegates recommended that the church recognize covenant commitment services for gay couples. \n \n The conference delegates also recommended the church ordain people to the various offices of priesthood regardless of their sexual orientation and relationship. \n \n Offices of priesthood in the church are deacon, teacher, priest, elder, seventy and high priest, Friend said. \n \n The changes will need to be approved by the First Presidency and Council of Twelve Apostles. \n \n Friend said it was her understanding that they would follow the recommendations of the National Conference. \n \n The process of developing, approving and implementing interim policies could take up to one year, she said. Any changes would apply only to the United States. \n \n The Community of Christ, formerly formerly known as the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, is based in Independence and has about 250,000 members.', 'From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia \n \n The Community of Christ (formerly the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS Church)) and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) are two denominations that share a common heritage in the Church of Christ founded by Joseph Smith on April 6, 1830. Since Smith\'s death in 1844, they have evolved separately in belief and practices. The LDS Church is headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, and claims more than 15 million members worldwide;[1] the Community of Christ is headquartered in Independence, Missouri, and reports a worldwide membership of approximately 250,000.[2] \n \n Community of Christ transformation since 1960 [ edit ] \n \n Significant doctrinal, organizational, and attitudinal changes in the Community of Christ since 1960 have narrowed the similarities that remain between it and the LDS Church. While the doctrine and belief system of the LDS Church is highly centralized, systematic, and static, the Community of Christ has adopted an adaptive, decentralized, and progressive approach to doctrine. In 1997, the Community of Christ initiated a three-year period of transformation entitled “Transformation 2000,” that was seen by its president W. Grant McMurray as the culmination of a series of changes dating back to 1960.[3] McMurray identified these changes as a movement away from a belief that the denomination was ""the restored church"" and towards a position within mainstream Christianity. At the World Conference of 2000, by vote of 1,979 to 561, the name of the church was changed from the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints to Community of Christ. In so doing, the church was attempting to distance itself from comparisons with the LDS Church and in the process transform itself into a unique body among mainstream Christian denominations. \n \n McMurray was the first president of the Community of Christ who was not a direct descendant of Joseph Smith. He sought to formalize developments in thinking about prophetic leadership, the historical basis of the Book of Mormon, and the concept that priesthood authority had been restored in the 1820s and 1830s after centuries of apostasy. During his presidency, the church moved from a closed to an open communion and McMurray began to open the door to priesthood ordination for LGBT individuals, something which he acknowledged was already occurring. At the time, negative membership response to this issue forced McMurray to reaffirm the official policy prohibiting the ordination of sexually active gays and lesbians. The church allowed those who were ordained against policy to continue in their priesthood offices. Since 2010, gay rights have been formalized in Community of Christ doctrine.[4] \n \n Prior to 1960, the RLDS Church\'s identity was primarily tied to its differences with the larger LDS Church, which RLDS Church members usually referred to as the ""Utah Church"" or ""Mormon Church"". McMurray cited a 1960 world tour by former president W. Wallace Smith as a pivotal event impacting the evolution of RLDS Church beliefs. Leaders such as Roy Cheville had already been teaching a new generation of church members a more ecumenical and open-minded system of beliefs. But it was the church\'s proselytizing of cultures in countries outside North America that knew little about Christianity, much less Mormonism, that forced a reassessment of denominational practices and beliefs. RLDS apostle Charles Neff, a leading church missionary, pushed fellow leaders and field ministers towards a relativistic doctrinal viewpoint motivated by a combination of practical missionary concerns and an attitude of theological openness. These significant moves of the Community of Christ towards alignment with liberal Protestant doctrine were influenced in part by many in church leadership who pursued theological studies at St. Paul School of Theology in Kansas City, Missouri. While the RLDS Church had long been known for its strong anti-polygamy stance, its outreach efforts amongst the Sora people in India brought a re-examination even on this issue. \n \n Church president Wallace B. Smith’s 1984 call for the ordination of women to the priesthood was a milestone in the doctrinal evolution of the church towards progressive Christianity. During his term in office, greater attention was brought to peace and justice issues. The call to dedicate the Independence Temple to the ""pursuit of peace"" is widely regarded as both symbolic and practical evidence of the differences between the two denominations. While the LDS Church has a set of highly standardized temple rituals and regards temples as sacred space for the creation of covenants, the Community of Christ understands temples to be a less formalized center for spirituality, ministerial education, and church administration. \n \n These changes constituted a broad shift in theology of the Community of Christ from Restorationism to mainline Protestant Christianity. They also widened the scope of long-standing doctrinal differences between it and the LDS Church. Nearly all of the traditional differences between the two groups can be seen as aligning the Community of Christ more closely with traditional Christian teaching and neo-orthodoxy, which further isolates the LDS Church within Christianity as a whole. \n \n Historical differences between the churches [ edit ] \n \n The RLDS Church was founded by the confederation of a number of smaller groups that declined to migrate with Brigham Young to Utah Territory or follow any of the others vying to become the successor to Joseph Smith. Prior to the 1860 Amboy Conference, in which the church was formally ""reorganized"" into the RLDS Church, numerous doctrinal differences were espoused by the leaders of the various splinter groups. Following the reorganization, these differences were solidified into a litany of what might now be called ""wedge issues"" that would distinguish it from Young\'s LDS Church in Utah.[5] \n \n The differences enumerated below characterize the major differences between the Community of Christ and the LDS Church.[6] \n \n Scriptures [ edit ] \n \n Both churches believe in an open canon of scripture founded upon the Bible, the Book of Mormon, and revelations of God to the church recorded in the Doctrine and Covenants. \n \n Bible [ edit ] \n \n The Inspired Version of the Bible is part of the Community of Christ\'s canon of scripture,[7] although it does not mandate a single translation of the Bible.[8] \n \n The LDS Church has officially adopted the Authorized King James Version for English speakers, and has produced its own edition which is extensively footnoted with clarifications from the Inspired Version. The LDS Church refers to the Inspired Version as the ""Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible."" For Spanish-speaking members, the LDS Church publishes a slightly modified version of the Reina-Valera version, including footnotes and annotations comparable to those found in its official King James Version. For other languages, the LDS Church recommends usage of specific traditional translations that are selected based on doctrinal integrity with the other official standard works. \n \n Book of Mormon [ edit ] \n \n Title page of the first edition of the Book of Mormon (1830). \n \n Both the Community of Christ and LDS Church accept the Book of Mormon as a second canon of scripture[9] and views it as an additional witness of Jesus Christ that complements the Bible. The Community of Christ publishes two versions of the book through its official publishing arm, Herald House. The Authorized Edition is based on the original printer\'s manuscript and the 1837 Second Edition (or ""Kirtland Edition"") of the Book of Mormon. Its content is similar to the Book of Mormon published by the LDS Church, but the versification is different[10] The Community of Christ also publishes a 1966 ""Revised Authorized Edition"", which attempts to modernize some of the language.[10] \n \n The LDS Church publishes a single version of the Book of Mormon, which is extensively footnoted to the church\'s other standard works. Its chapter and versification is based upon the 1879 edition edited by Orson Pratt. \n \n At a 2007 World Conference, Community of Christ President Stephen M. Veazey ruled that a resolution to ""reaffirm the Book of Mormon as a divinely inspired record"" was out of order.[9] He stated that ""while the Church affirms the Book of Mormon as scripture, and makes it available for study and use in various languages, we do not attempt to mandate the degree of belief or use. This position is in keeping with our longstanding tradition that belief in the Book of Mormon is not to be used as a test of fellowship or membership in the church.""[9] The LDS Church regularly emphasizes the importance of the Book of Mormon and encourages its members to read from it daily. \n \n Doctrine and Covenants [ edit ] \n \n Both churches publish a book called the Doctrine and Covenants and accept it as scripture.[11][12] The Community of Christ has removed several early sections[13] and has regularly added new revelations and other inspired documents to the book since the death of Joseph Smith. The LDS Church has added some material to the Doctrine and Covenants since Smith\'s death, but less than that of the Community of Christ. The Community of Christ version currently contains 166 documents, 51 of which were produced after the death of Joseph Smith. The LDS Church version currently contains 140 documents, five of which were produced after Smith\'s death. \n \n Pearl of Great Price [ edit ] \n \n The LDS Church includes the Pearl of Great Price as part of its standard works. The Community of Christ has never published or considered this book to be scripture.[11] However, the Community of Christ does accept two portions of the Pearl of Great Price—the Book of Moses and Joseph Smith–Matthew—as scripture: \n \n Chapters 2–8 of the Book of Moses are included within the Book of Genesis in the Community of Christ\'s Inspired Version of the Bible; \n \n Chapter 1 of the Book of Moses is accepted as section 22 of the Community of Christ\'s Doctrine and Covenants; \n \n In addition to appearing in the Inspired Version of the Bible, chapter 7 of the Book of Moses is accepted as section 36 of the Community of Christ\'s Doctrine and Covenants; and \n \n Joseph Smith–Matthew is accepted as part of the Book of Matthew in the Inspired Version of the Bible. \n \n Portions of the Pearl of Great Price that are not accepted as scripture by the Community of Christ are the Book of Abraham, Joseph Smith–History, and the Articles of Faith. \n \n Presidential tenure and succession [ edit ] \n \n Joseph Smith III, the successor to Joseph Smith as the Prophet-President of the Community of Christ \n \n Both the Community of Christ and the LDS Church are headed by a President of the Church, a position created and held by Joseph Smith. In the LDS Church, succession to the presidency has been based on apostolic seniority. In the Community of Christ, the president has the power to appoint a successor; if the outgoing president does not appoint a successor, the Council of Twelve Apostles nominates a successor. \n \n After Smith, the next three presidents of the Community of Christ served as President of the Church until their deaths. In 1978, W. Wallace Smith broke this tradition and retired from the presidency, designated himself as ""president emeritus"", and appointed Wallace B. Smith as his successor. Wallace B. Smith and his chosen successor—McMurray—also retired from the position. In the LDS Church, every President of the Church has served until his death and none have selected a successor prior to death. \n \n The first five[14] successors to Joseph Smith in the presidency of the Community of Christ were direct descendants of Smith.[15] McMurray was the first president of the church who was not a member of the Smith family.[15] While never formally accepting a principle of lineal succession, the denomination teaches that Smith had designated his son, Joseph Smith III, as his successor.[16] In 1996, the appointment of McMurray by retiring president Wallace B. Smith was the justification used by schismatic groups that abandoned the Community of Christ. This schism led to the creation of the Remnant Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. The president of the Remnant Church, Frederick Niels Larsen, is a maternal great-great-grandson of Joseph Smith. \n \n The LDS Church determines its presidential successor by principles of apostolic seniority combined with inspiration from God.[17] When a church president dies, the member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles who has been an apostle the longest—the President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles—becomes the new president of the church.[17] Prior to making the succession official, the apostles individually and collectively pray for divine guidance and confirmation of their proposed action.[17] \n \n While this is an area that marked a traditional difference between the two denominations, a 2004–05 succession crisis prompted the Council of Twelve Apostles of the Community of Christ to utilize an inspiration-seeking procedure similar to that adopted by the apostles of the LDS Church.[18] When McMurray stepped down as president in 2004, he chose not to name a successor, as previous retirees from the position had done. In 2005, Stephen M. Veazey—who was president of the Twelve, but not the senior member—was selected as successor by the Council of Twelve.[18][19] \n \n Godhead [ edit ] \n \n The Community of Christ teaches about the Trinity, which they define God as a community of three persons.[20] The LDS Church teaches that the Godhead is composed of three physically distinct personage Gods who are united—or ""one""—in purpose.[21][22] \n \n Exaltation [ edit ] \n \n The LDS Church teaches the principle of exaltation;[23] this doctrine is not accepted by the Community of Christ.[5] \n \n Adam–God doctrine [ edit ] \n \n According to Brigham Young, the Adam–God doctrine was first taught by Joseph Smith before his death in 1844. However, the evidence that Smith originated the doctrine consists only of Young\'s own assertions,[24] an 1877 recollection of Anson Call,[25] and some circumstantial evidence collected by Mormon fundamentalist writers.[26] LDS Church President Spencer W. Kimball officially denounced the Adam–God doctrine in 1976.[27][28] \n \n Because the Community of Christ was founded by the confederation of a number of smaller groups that declined to accept Young\'s leadership, the Adam–God doctrine has never been a part of Community of Christ teachings, and it has maintained that the doctrine was first enunciated by Young, not Smith.[5] \n \n Priesthood eligibility [ edit ] \n \n Both churches have a tradition of bestowing the priesthood on adult male members of the church. The priesthood of the Community of Christ has always been open to persons of all races,[29] and was opened to women in 1984.[30] The LDS Church\'s priesthood is open to males only[31][32] and from the mid 1800s until 1978 was not open to people of black African descent,[31] who were sometimes characterized as ""descendants of Cain"".[33][34] The LDS Church routinely gives its Aaronic priesthood to boys 12 years of age and older, while the Community of Christ generally restricts its priesthood to adult men and women.[35] \n \n Temples [ edit ] \n \n Both the Community of Christ and the LDS Church operate temples, which for both groups are separate and distinct from church chapels or meetinghouses. The Community of Christ operates two temples, the Kirtland Temple and the Independence Temple, while the LDS Church has more than 140. \n \n The Community of Christ does not practice and has traditionally objected to the idea of sacraments or rituals being performed in its temples.[5] The Community of Christ\'s temples are open to the public[36] and are dedicated to the pursuit of peace, spiritual learning, and church history and administration. LDS Church temples are open only to approved members and are primarily used for the performance of rites such as the endowment, celestial marriage, and baptism for the dead; these ordinances have never been embraced by the Community of Christ.[5] \n \n Historically, the Community of Christ did include documents in its Doctrine and Covenants[37] which sanctioned baptism for the dead and other temple rites.[5] However, the Community of Christ considers that the institution of baptism for the dead was made conditional on the completion of the Nauvoo Temple in a reasonable amount of time.[38] Because the membership of the church failed to complete the temple during Smith\'s lifetime, the Community of Christ teaches that the right to perform baptisms for the dead was withdrawn and has not been reinstituted.[38] \n \n The 1970 World Conference of the Community of Christ concluded that sections 107, 109, and 110 (regarding baptism for the dead and temple rites) had been added to the 1844 edition of the Doctrine and Covenants without proper approval of a church conference. Thus, the conference removed[13] those sections to a historical appendix.[13] The World Conference of 1990 subsequently removed the entire appendix from the Doctrine and Covenants.[13] \n \n Use of cross and other symbols [ edit ] \n \n The Community of Christ utilizes the symbol of the Christian cross on its buildings and temples.[39] The LDS Church currently does not use the cross[40] on the grounds that ""because the Savior lives, we do not use the symbol of His death as the symbol of our faith"",[41] although this aversion to the cross only became dominant in the 20th century.[42][43] \n \n Most temples of the LDS Church include a statue of the Angel Moroni on a spire,[44] but the church does not consider Moroni to be an official symbol and ""has no policy regarding the use of statues of the angel Moroni atop temples"", but rather includes or excludes a statue from each temple based on local circumstances.[45] The Community of Christ does not use the Angel Moroni as a symbol. \n \n In the United States, the Veterans Affairs (VA) emblem for headstones for LDS Church members is a stylized Angel Moroni. For the Community of Christ, the VA emblem is a stylized representation of a child standing between a lion and a lamb, which is an official logo of the Community of Christ. \n \n Polygamy [ edit ] \n \n In the 19th century, the differences between the LDS Church and the RLDS Church regarding polygamy was the principal distinction between the two churches. The LDS Church openly practiced plural marriage from 1852 to 1890 and taught that the practice was instituted by Joseph Smith and taught in secret to members of the church before his death. For many years, the leaders of the RLDS Church were vocal critics of the LDS Church\'s polygamy and argued that the practice had been introduced by Brigham Young and falsely attributed to Smith after Smith\'s death. Polygamy was frequently denounced by RLDS leaders and the practice was never accepted by the church.[46] Smith\'s son Joseph Smith III and widow Emma Smith repeatedly taught that Smith opposed the practice and was not a polygamist.[47][48][49] \n \n Today, although the Community of Christ has no official position on whether Smith was a polygamist,[46] some members now accept the historical consensus that Smith had multiple wives. Some members have argued that Smith was wrong to introduce polygamy;[46] in any case, most Community of Christ members continue to reject polygamy.[5][46] Today, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints opposes the practice of polygamy, its church presidents have repeatedly emphasized that the Church and its members are no longer authorized to enter into plural marriage.[50] \n \n Tithing [ edit ] \n \n Traditionally, the Community of Christ taught that tithing should be calculated as one-tenth of a member\'s discretionary income.[51] The LDS Church teaches that it is ten percent of one\'s annual income,[52] with it left to the member to determine how to calculate it (e.g., what constitutes ""income"" and whether it is ten percent of income after or before tax).[53] Recently, the Community of Christ has adopted a program known as Disciples\' Generous Response, which encourages financial generosity as a response to God rather than as a set calculated obligation.[51] \n \n Apostasy and Restoration [ edit ] \n \n The LDS Church teaches that Joseph Smith restored the fullness of the gospel after a centuries long period known as the great apostasy.[54][55] The LDS Church therefore characterizes itself as a restoration of fallen Christianity and the one true church that exists.[54] In contrast, the Community of Christ has abandoned its traditional tenet that it is the one true church and has adopted a viewpoint that all faith traditions can offer a pathway to spiritual enlightenment.[56] Barbara McFarlane Higdon has called the Community of Christ a ""unique member of the body of Christ, the universal community of believers.""[57] Higdon also suggests that prior claims that the church had been ""restored"" were tantamount to idolatry. The Community of Christ has therefore moved towards ecumenism and inter-faith dialogue. Nevertheless, the Community of Christ ""steadfastly affirms the primacy of continuing revelation instead of creedal rigidity"". The Community of Christ\'s Doctrine and Covenants continues to contain documents that declare that the church is the one true church.[58] \n \n Today, the Community of Christ generally refers to Joseph Smith\'s First Vision as the ""grove experience"" and takes a flexible view about its historicity,[59] emphasizing the healing presence of God and the forgiving mercy of Jesus Christ felt by Smith.[60] In contrast, the LDS Church strongly affirms the reality of the First Vision and emphasizes its role as the beginning of the restoration of the gospel through God\'s chosen prophet. \n \n Summary chart [ edit ] \n \n Notes [ edit ]', 'Play Facebook \n \n Twitter \n \n Embed Russia\'s Syrian Policy is Doomed to Fail, Ash Carter Says 0:56 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog \n \n There has been at least one close encounter between a Russian aircraft and a U.S. aircraft over Syria, forcing the U.S. to re-route that aircraft to avoid a conflict, the Pentagon confirmed on Wednesday. \n \n Moscow\'s unexpected move to launch airstrikes in Syria has brought the greatest threat of an accidental clash between Russian and Western forces since the Cold War.

107,"[""But the Fed’s hair is manifestly not on fire, nor do most politicians seem to see any urgency about the situation. These days, the best — or at any rate the alleged wise men and women who are supposed to be looking after the nation’s welfare — lack all conviction, while the worst, as represented by much of the G.O.P., are filled with a passionate intensity. So the unemployed are being abandoned. \n \n Photo \n \n O.K., about the Obama plan: It calls for about $200 billion in new spending — much of it on things we need in any case, like school repair, transportation networks, and avoiding teacher layoffs — and $240 billion in tax cuts. That may sound like a lot, but it actually isn’t. The lingering effects of the housing bust and the overhang of household debt from the bubble years are creating a roughly $1 trillion per year hole in the U.S. economy, and this plan — which wouldn’t deliver all its benefits in the first year — would fill only part of that hole. And it’s unclear, in particular, how effective the tax cuts would be at boosting spending. \n \n Still, the plan would be a lot better than nothing, and some of its measures, which are specifically aimed at providing incentives for hiring, might produce relatively a large employment bang for the buck. As I said, it’s much bolder and better than I expected. President Obama ’s hair may not be on fire, but it’s definitely smoking; clearly and gratifyingly, he does grasp how desperate the jobs situation is. \n \n But his plan isn’t likely to become law, thanks to Republican opposition. And it’s worth noting just how much that opposition has hardened over time, even as the plight of the unemployed has worsened. \n \n Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

First, they argued that we should rely on monetary policy rather than fiscal policy — that is, that the job of fighting unemployment should be left to the Fed. Second, they argued that fiscal actions should take the form of tax cuts rather than temporary spending. \n \n Now, however, leading Republicans are against tax cuts — at least if they benefit working Americans rather than rich people and corporations. \n \n And they’re against monetary policy, too. In Wednesday night’s Republican presidential debate , Mitt Romney declared that he would seek a replacement for Ben Bernanke , the Fed chairman, essentially because Mr. Bernanke has tried to do something (though not enough) about unemployment. And that makes Mr. Romney a moderate by G.O.P. standards, since Rick Perry , his main rival for the presidential nomination, has suggested that Mr. Bernanke should be treated “pretty ugly.” \n \n So, at this point, leading Republicans are basically against anything that might help the unemployed. Yes, Mr. Romney has issued a glossy, well-produced “jobs plan,” but it might best be described as 59 bullet points with nothing there — and certainly nothing to justify his assertion, bordering on megalomania, that he would create no fewer than 11 million jobs in four years. \n \n The good news in all this is that by going bigger and bolder than expected, Mr. Obama may finally have set the stage for a political debate about job creation. For, in the end, nothing will be done until the American people demand action."", 'First reactions to the president’s big jobs speech: \n \n 1) Qua speech, it was excellent – clear, focused, unrhetorical. \n \n The core concept – stressing past Republican approval of the major elements of the proposal – ingeniously put Republicans into an awkward spot. And in fact, the maneuver has had some immediate effect. Speaker Boehner and Leader Cantor told Politico tonight that they would approve important elements of the bill. \n \n The speech was tricked out with items cleverly intended to catch the ears of people who might not normally support the president: the promise to pay federal contractors faster, for example, and payroll tax cuts for smaller businesses worth up to $80,000. \n \n 2) Qua economics, the proposal looks a lot better than the 2009 stimulus. This new measure is not larded up with the Democratic wish lists and obsolete campaign promises that made such a mess of Stimulus 1. There are no tax rebates here, no Pell grants, only the basic material of a counter-cyclical program: investment tax credits, continuing payroll tax relief, and infrastructure spending. \n \n 3) Qua politics? Obama’s re-election proposition remains pretty bad, but it’s marginally less bad tonight than it was this morning. No, he has not restored the country to prosperity. But he does again at least look like he’s trying and like he’s defending Medicare and Social Security in the process. If Obama cannot run as the recovery and prosperity candidate, he will try to run as the stability and security candidate against opponents whom he will seek to depict as radical and reckless. Many of his opponents are enthusiastically cooperating with that strategy, including the current Republican presidential front-runner.', 'If President Obama\'s economic policies have had a signature flaw, it is the conceit that by pulling this or that policy lever, by spending more on this program or cutting that tax for a year, Washington can manipulate the $15 trillion U.S. economy to grow. With his speech last night to Congress, the President is giving that strategy one more government try. \n \n This is not to say that Mr. Obama hasn\'t made any intellectual progress across his 32 months in office. He now admits the damage that overregulation can do, though he can\'t do much to stop it without repealing his own legislative achievements. He now acts as if he believes that taxes matter to investment and hiring, at least for the next year. And he now sees the wisdom of fiscal discipline, albeit starting only in 2013. \n \n Yet the underlying theory and practice of the familiar ideas that the President proposed last night are those of the government conjurer. More targeted, temporary tax cuts; more spending now with promises of restraint later; the fifth (or is it sixth?) plan to reduce housing foreclosures; and more public works spending, though this time we\'re told the projects really will be shovel-ready. \n \n We\'d like to support a plan to spur the economy, which is certainly struggling. Had Mr. Obama proposed a permanent cut in tax rates, or a major tax reform, or a moratorium on all new regulations for three years, he\'d have our support. But you have to really, really believe in hope and change to think that another $300-$400 billion in new deficit spending and temporary tax cuts will do any better than the $4 trillion in debt that the Obama years have already piled up. \n \n We\'ve had the biggest Keynesian stimulus in decades. The new argument that the 2009 stimulus wasn\'t big enough isn\'t what we heard then. Americans were told it would create 3.5 million new jobs and unemployment would stay below 8% and be falling by 2011. It is now 9.1%. But this stimulus we are told will make all the difference. \n \n Mr. Obama spoke last night as if he is a converted tax-cutter, asking Republicans to expand and extend the payroll tax cut that expires in December for one more year. Along with tax credits for certain businesses that hire new employees, he says this will cut unemployment, and no doubt it will lead to some more hiring. \n \n But what happens in 2013 when those tax rates expire and Mr. Obama pledges to hit thousands of those same small businesses with higher tax rates on income, capital gains and dividends? He seems to think businesses operate only in the present and will ignore the tax burdens coming at them down the road. This is the same reasoning that assumed that postponing ObamaCare\'s tax and regulatory burdens until 2014 would have no effect on business hiring in the meantime. \n \n The same logic applies to Mr. Obama\'s claim that everything in his new proposal is ""paid for."" Yes, but only according to the usual 10-year Washington budget window that pushes all of the hard choices into the future, in this case after the election. So Mr. Obama gets to spend more now while promising to save later. This is also how the Administration claimed that a new $1 trillion health-care entitlement would reduce the deficit. It also means he can put more money in the pockets of dues-paying teachers unions and government workers. \n \n The larger political subtext of Mr. Obama\'s speech is that if Congress doesn\'t pass his plan, he\'ll then campaign against Republicans as obstructionist. Thus his speech mantra that Congress should ""pass it right away."" This ignores that Mr. Obama has been the least obstructed President since LBJ in 1965 or FDR in 1933, which is how we got here. \n \n He passed $830 billion in stimulus, $3 billion for cash for clunkers, $30 billion in small business loans, $30 billion for mortgage modification, the GM-Chrysler bailouts, ObamaCare, Dodd-Frank, credit card price controls, Build America Bonds, jobless benefits for a record 99 weeks, and more. \n \n The only priorities that a Democratic Congress blocked were cap-and-tax and union card check, and both of those would have further damaged growth and jobs. Even last December, after Republicans had retaken the House, Mr. Obama won his one-year payroll tax cut, more jobless benefits and most of what he wanted. \n \n The unfortunate reality is that even if Republicans gave Mr. Obama everything he wanted, the impact on growth would be modest at best. Washington can most help the economy with serious spending restraint, permanent tax-rate cuts, regulatory relief and repeal of ObamaCare. What won\'t help growth is more temporary, targeted political conjuring.', '7.57 pm. This was also a speech aimed directly at his own party - rallying the troops, creating a framework for the campaign ahead, betting that things are bad enough that the infrastructure spending and the tax cuts will not alienate debt-concerned independents. In style, the last thing it was was professorial. This was a blunt, potent, confident attempt to win back the hearts of a disillusioned base, while appealing to the center in ways Republicans may feel a little leery of rejecting, given their already deep reputation for obstructionism. \n \n Game on, in other words. Except this isn\'t a game. And any politician who acts like it is in the next year or so will pay a price. \n \n 7.49 pm. This was indeed a speech directed at independents and also at those who fear that America is in terminal decline. It was rooted in patriotism; it was framed to portray Obama as the pragmatic centrist he actually is. And it was not dishonest - these are the choices, short-term and long-term, that we have to make. And we should not be required to wait for another year and a half for action. \n \n One key will be how it\'s paid for. It seems that Obama is simply insisting that the super-committee should add $450 billion to its remit for long-term spending reductions, including Medicare. I cannot imagine the House GOP agreeing to that. Another key is exactly what infrastructure projects are indeed ""shovel-ready"" enough to help in the next year or two. But the general idea of building permanent infrastructure as a way to use currently idle labor seems appealingly simple to me - and a classic Depression era maneuver. \n \n 7.46 pm. Wow. A threat to take this vision across the country if the GOP doesn\'t cooperate now. That\'s Truman-speak. After months of mild attempts to get Republicans to agree, he hasn\'t caved, and he hasn\'t demonized them. But he has now upped the ante, and has new fire in his belly. If he can succeed in getting a bulk of the jobs bill through and if the super-committee doesn\'t fail, we have a chance to turn this economy around. \n \n 7.42 pm. Now we get the full-throated defense of government action as part of American history, Republican and Democrat. I think this speech could well turn his own party base around - and frame the coming year on terms more favorable to him than the Republicans. \n \n 7.39 pm. The impassioned line to be used against Perry if he\'s the candidate: \n \n We shouldn’t be in a race to the bottom, where we try to offer the cheapest labor and the worst pollution standards. America should be in a race to the top. And I believe that’s a race we can win. \n \n 7.34 pm. This is the moment when Obama, rather than the GOP, ups the ante. This is what you might call aggressive conciliation. And here\'s what I\'m also hearing: a very stirring appeal to patriotism, to the idea that America can be far better than we have become today. The repetitive comparison between America and China - the appeal to global competitiveness - is one of the best ripostes to the Big Lie that this president isn\'t somehow in love with this country. \n \n 7.29 pm. My own view is that this blend of short term stimulus balanced by serious long term entitlement reform is so obviously the sanest, smartest way forward it will sink in with most Americans. And complementing it with tax reform to give taxpayers a fair shake is the icing on the cake. What\'s now clear is that he is betting big in the nest year. This is more aggressive than I have seen him since he got elected. There is a steely impatience here that is obviously designed either to get something done now, or, if not, to run a Truman-style anti-Congress presidential campaign. \n \n 7.24 pm. After small businesses, a proposal for veterans. This is a cooptation of Republican erogenous zones with strong government action. It is the message he was elected on. He\'s bringing red ideas and blue ideas for jobs. And now he\'s touting more tax cuts - daring the GOP to oppose tax cuts for the middle classes. Brilliant line: \n \n I know some of you have sworn oaths to never raise any taxes on anyone for as long as you live. Now is not the time to carve out an exception and raise middle-class taxes, which is why you should pass this bill right away. \n \n He\'s rocking it. \n \n 7.23 pm. A simple message: these are proposals previously backed by Democrats and Republicans. How many times has he now quite sternly said ""Pass This Bill""? \n \n 7.20 pm. A direct challenge for infrastructure investment - a patriotic challenge. Remember what I said about him staying on the ropes before he comes out swinging? This is not a milque-toast speech or a milque-toast proposal. It\'s a big bet on the country\'s desire for action, not debate. And so far, it sounds like something a sane Republican would be happy to support. \n \n 7.17 pm. An appeal to pragmatic bipartisanism in the current crisis - effective, and in the details, much more radical than I expected. And the message is even blunter: ""You should pass this bill right away."" And first off, it\'s all about tax cuts. Tax cuts. But we haven\'t quite gotten to the ""all of it is paid for"" have we? \n \n 7.13 pm. A late start. A warm reception. And a poignant admonition to the political and media class about their pettiness and narcissism. An immediate attempt to break through the usual political blah. \n \n He\'s on tonight. \n \n 7.07 pm. A new nugget from the debate last night: Rick Perry physically grabbing Ron Paul and jabbing a pointed finger in his face in a commercial break. A nasty little image for a nasty little man. \n \n 6.54 pm. A treat beforehand: Biden and Boehner talking about recent golf games. Yep, they talk about that kind of thing. Biden\'s expressions were classic, though. There is something about the way he interacts with people that makes me feel at home. I think it\'s his Catholic Irish character - even when he screws up, even when he can\'t shut up, even when he\'s pretty much unbearable. While I\'m on this Catholic kick, I should note that culturally speaking, I think Rick Perry is just not going to wear well with white Catholics. The death penalty insouciance and the healthcare callousness will hurt him with that demographic. \n \n I can\'t say I dislike Boehner either. So far, the Speaker with that wonderful tanned, drinking, smoking face has emerged as personally far more likable than Pelosi. \n \n (Photo: Alex Wong/Getty.)', 'The former bassist in the all-female teenage rock group has described being drugged and raped at an aftershow party in 1975 \n \n Jackie Fuchs, formerly the bassist in all-female rock band the Runaways, has spoken for the first time about an incident in which she was allegedly raped by the group’s then manager, Kim Fowley. \n \n In a report published in the Huffington Post titled The Lost Girls, Fuchs describes a New Year’s Eve gig in Orange County, California, in 1975, when she was aged 16. \n \n According to the bassist, who performed under the name Jackie Fox, Fowley took the band to a hotel near the club after the show, where they started celebrating with friends. Witnesses claim she was given a number of Quaalude sedatives, before Fowley allegedly asked if one of the roadies at the party would like to have sex with Fuchs. \n \n “You don’t know what terror is until you realise something bad is about to happen to you and you can’t move a muscle,” Fuchs is reported as saying. “I can’t move. I can’t speak. All I can do is look him in the eye and do the best I can do to communicate: please say no ... I don’t know what it looked like from the outside. But I know what was going on inside and it was horror”. \n \n The roadie declined Fowley’s offer, but Fuchs says she then started to slip in and out of consciousness. \n \n “I remember opening my eyes, Kim Fowley was raping me, and there were people watching me,” said Fuchs. \n \n According to the article, Fuchs said she was unwilling to make her alleged rape public until the recent number of high-profile sexual assault cases involving prominent individuals such as Bill Cosby and Kesha’s producer Dr Luke. Kesha has accused Dr Luke of drugging and assaulting her, while he has countersued, accusing her of lying to get out of her contract. Meanwhile, it emerged on 6 July that Cosby obtained Quaaludes with the intent of giving them to young women he wanted to have sex with. \n \n Fowley, who died in January, had previously denied any sexual impropriety with members of the band. The Huffington Post cites a passage in the Runaways’ 2013 band biography: “They can talk about it until the cows come home but, in my mind, I didn’t make love to anybody in the Runaways nor did they make love to me.” \n \n Fuchs left the group in 1977. In the same year, Fowley and the group parted ways amid disagreements about money.']",5,"– Pundits handed out good grades aplenty for President Obama's new jobs proposal last night, with generally positive feedback from liberals like Paul Krugman—but also from conservatives like David Frum and Andrew Sullivan. Krugman writes in the New York Times that he was ""favorably surprised by the new Obama jobs plan, which is significantly bolder and better than I expected."" Still, ""it's not nearly as bold as the plan I’d want in an ideal world. But if it actually became law, it would probably make a significant dent in unemployment."" Of course, Krugman holds out little hope that the GOP will let it pass. It was a ""cunning speech,"" muses David Frum on FrumForum. Economically, it's better than the 2009 stimulus, and, politically, it helps Obama's re-election chances, he adds. But the strongest aspect was using proposals Republicans had previously advocated, which ""ingeniously put Republicans into an awkward spot,"" Frum writes. ""This was a blunt, potent, confident attempt to win back the hearts of a disillusioned base, while appealing to the center in ways Republicans may feel a little leery of rejecting,"" writes Andrew Sullivan.

108,"['Bernie Sanders (2nd row down, center) liked what he heard. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst \n \n Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) was the lone Democratic presidential hopeful -- and the only Jewish contender -- in the House chamber for Pope Francis\'s speech. When he left, he was beaming, as the pope had cited an American Catholic whom Sanders had plenty of praise for. \n \n ""The name Dorothy Day has not been used in the United States Congress terribly often,"" said Sanders in a short interview. ""She was a valiant fighter for workers, was very strong in her belief for social justice, and I think it was extraordinary that he cited her as one of the most important people in recent American history. This would be one of the very, very few times that somebody as radical as Dorothy Day was mentioned."" \n \n Pope Francis says Abraham Lincoln, Martin Luther King Jr., Dorothy Day and Thomas Merton embody the spirit of America. (AP) \n \n Day was arguably the least famous of the four Americans Francis cited in the speech, but she was a vital and controversial figure on the American left. Like Martin Luther King -- also cited by Francis -- she had a thick FBI file, compiled by agents tracking her support for democratic socialism and opposition to foreign wars. ""We need to change the system,"" Day wrote in 1956. ""We need to overthrow, not the government, as the authorities are always accusing the Communists \'of conspiring to teach [us] to do,\' but this rotten, decadent, putrid industrial capitalist system which breeds such suffering in the whited sepulcher of New York."" \n \n [Who were Dorothy Day and Thomas Merton?] \n \n Recent support for Day\'s possible canonization has angered some conservatives. ""Vatican archives are filled with reports of Christians martyred under the regimes that Dorothy Day supported,"" wrote Virginia State Senator Dick Black in a 2013 letter to Francis\'s predecessor, Pope Benedict. ""I am revolted by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops’ support for the canonization of a woman whose views supported the violent extermination of Christians throughout the world."" \n \n In Pope Francis\' address to Congress, he praised Dorothy Day, founder of the Catholic Worker Movement for her ""passion for justice."" The Rev. James Martin explains in this excerpt from ""Dorothy Day: Who Cares About the Saints?"" (The Rev. James Martin and Loyola Productions) \n \n Sanders, well aware of Day\'s views and her critics, considered it bold and telling that Francis would praise her. ""He is willing to identify with an extraordinarily courageous woman whose life was about standing with the poorest people in America, and having the courage to stand up to the very powerful,"" he said. ""You know, her newspaper was the Catholic Worker, and she stood with the workers of America and fought for justice."" \n \n The Vermont senator was less concerned by Francis\'s glancing mentions of other issues that animate progressives, such as climate change and gay rights. ""He knew where he was speaking,"" said Sanders. ""I think he does not want to be rude, as a guest. But I think his calling out for social justice, his talking about income and wealth inequality, his talking about creating an economy and a culture that works for everybody, not just a few, is a very, very powerful message.""', ""An avowed democratic socialist and a conservative Republican senator running for president both loved Pope Francis' historic speech to Congress on Thursday morning—for very different reasons. \n \n Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders praised the pope's message of economic justice and call to fix “environmental deterioration caused by human activity.” \n \n “I have long believed that the pope is playing an extraordinary role on this earth as one of the great moral leaders,” said Sanders, whose underdog bid for the Democratic nomination has generated great enthusiasm nationally. “That's been his constant theme—to make sure we are not worshipers of money, worshipers of wealth, that we don't live our lives just to make as much money as possible.” \n \n “Pope Francis has been a powerful voice for life at a time when life is profoundly threatened in America.” Senator Ted Cruz \n \n He was pleased with the pope's “rather extraordinary” praise for Dorothy Day, a Catholic-convert activist described in her time as radical in her pacifism and strident in her criticism of capitalism, which she considered an oppressive force against the poor. Capturing the cross-ideological appeal of the pope's overall message, she was also a fierce opponent of birth control and abortion. \n \n Huddling with reporters as Sanders walked by Statuary Hall, which connects the House and Senate wings, was Texas Senator Ted Cruz. He praised the pope's message as “powerful” when it came to protecting the family unit, religious liberty, and protecting and defending “human life at every stage” of development. \n \n “Pope Francis has been a powerful voice for life at a time when life is profoundly threatened in America,” Cruz said. “Pope Francis has been a powerful voice for marriage at a time when five unelected judges are seeking to tear down marriage laws across this country. And Pope Francis has been a powerful voice for religious liberty at a time when the Obama administration is waging a relentless war against religious liberty.” \n \n Cruz said the speech should make President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden “awfully nervous” as it relates to religious liberty as well as the debate about whether to defund Planned Parenthood, a group that provides women's health services, including abortion. (Bloomberg Philanthropies provides financial support for Planned Parenthood.) \n \n “It was striking, and heartbreaking, to see so many congressional Democrats sitting stone-faced, arms crossed, when the pope urged us all to defend human life,” Cruz said. \n \n Cruz needled the press for writing “amusing and slanted” stories suggesting the pope's visit to the United States was good for Democrats. \n \n The Texas senator, an outspoken critic of illegal immigration, sounded less moved by Pope Francis' impassioned call to be compassionate toward people who “travel north in search of a better life,” a reference to the recent wave of undocumented immigrants to the U.S., many of whom have fled violence in Central America. \n \n “When we speak of welcoming immigrants, I believe that should refer to legal immigrants,” said Cruz, who noted that he's the “son of an immigrant who came from Cuba legally.” He added that “we should celebrate legal immigrants” and “show compassion to people across the globe.” \n \n In his long section on immigration, Pope Francis, a son of Italian immigrants to Argentina, said, “We the people of this continent are not fearful of foreigners, because most of us were once foreigners. I say this to you as the son of immigrants, knowing that so many of you are also descended from immigrants.” \n \n One presidential candidate who was visibly moved by that remark was Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, a son of Cuban immigrants, who smiled and wiped away a tear as he watched in the House chamber. \n \n https://twitter.com/sahilkapur/status/647067850486759424"", 'Story highlights Bernie Sanders said Pope Francis\' decision to highlight Dorothy Day underscores the Pontiff\'s emphasis on helping the poor \n \n Sanders called the Pope \'one of the great moral and religious leaders of our time\' \n \n Washington (CNN) Vermont Sen.

112,"['House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi speaks during a news conference at the U.S. Capitol last week. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images) \n \n First, Pelosi said of the deal: “We all may not be able to support it, or none us may be able to support it.” Then, later in the evening she folowed up with this lukewarm comment: “I look forward to reviewing the legislation with my caucus to see what level of support we can provide.” \n \n Pelosi, a savvy political operator, understands that the bill — backed by all of the other major congressional leaders and President Obama — will pass. \n \n Her reaction then is best understood as equal parts caucus politics and message-sending to the White House. \n \n There’s no question that liberals in the House — of which Pelosi is very much one — are not happy with the deal. \n \n The idea of more than $1 trillion in immediate cuts with no tax or revenue increases to offset them had the progressive caucus and the black caucus up in arms. \n \n Missouri Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, called the deal “a sugar-coated Satan sandwich” — a sentiment reflected (if not so colorfully) in a number of public comments from liberals Sunday \n \n That’s not insignificant to Pelosi’s own politics because liberals comprise an even larger chunk of the Democratic caucus in the House than they did two years ago thanks the destruction of moderate and conservative Blue Dogs in the 2010 election. \n \n The key to Pelosi’s success in the House — demonstrated in her ability to hold on as leader after Democrats lost the majority in 2010 — is her strength among liberals in the caucus. \n \n Looking as though she happily and quickly signed off on a deal that will leave many House liberals deeply unhappy would badly undermine Pelosi’s appeal to her base. And she’s smart enough not to do that. \n \n There’s also some history — dating back to before the 2010 election — between the White House and Pelosi/House Democrats that explains her comments about the compromise. \n \n Democrats in the lower chamber have fumed, mostly privately, about what they believe is a not only a dismissive attitude toward them from the White House but also a favoritism toward the Senate. \n \n Pelosi wants to make a point here — that the White House can cut all the deals it want but that she and the Democratic House caucus won’t immediately fall in line if it’s not in their own political or policy interests to do so. \n \n Ultimately, Pelosi is a team player and won’t urge her Democratic colleagues to rob President Obama of the deal he desperately wants/needs heading into 2012. \n \n But that doesn’t mean Pelosi won’t take her time — or maybe even vote against the compromise deal. \n \n “I think she will not let it die even if in the end she votes against it,” predicted one Pelosi confidante. \n \n Priorities USA leans on single donor: A new super PAC started by former Obama aides raised $3.2 million in the first half of 2011, with most of it coming from just one donor, according to documents filed with the Federal Election Commission on Sunday. \n \n DreamWorks CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg accounted for $2 million of the total raised by Priorities USA Action. Another $1 million came from Chicago businessman Fred Eychaner and the Service Employees International Union’s PAC, who gave half a million each. Most of the other $160,000 came from 23 donors. \n \n As a whole, Priorities USA Action and its nonprofit arm, Priorities USA, raised $5 million. The Fix reported Friday that Priorities USA and several other Democratic-aligned outside groups combined to raise $10 million in the first six months of this year. \n \n Compared to the $20 million that a Republican-leaning group associated with the American Crossroads super PAC just spent on its summer ad blitz, and Democrats are still fighting from behind when it comes to outside groups. \n \n Meanwhile, hedge fund manager John Paulson and hotel executive J.W. Marriott gave $1 million and $500,000, respectively, to a super PAC supporting Mitt Romney for president. It was previously reported that the group, Restore Our Future PAC, raised more than $12 million so far this year. \n \n Fixbits: \n \n Obama hasn’t given up on phasing out the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy. \n \n Herman Cain wins a straw poll in Denver. \n \n Sen.

Just because Obama has House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) in agreement, the vote on the plan, scheduled for Monday, is not necessarily a done deal. \n \n Not only will Boehner have to convince more than half of the House’s 240 Republican members to vote in favor of the bill, but problems lurk within the chamber’s blue seats as well. \n \n House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said that she would have to speak to her members and look at the deal more closely before assuring votes. \n \n “We all may not be able to support it — or none of us may be able to support it,” she told Bloomberg. \n \n The Progressive Caucus and the Black Caucus have scheduled a press conference for Monday to outline why they are opposed to the deal, which would raise the debt ceiling and cut around $1 trillion in spending over the next decade. \n \n “This deal does not even attempt to strike a balance between more cuts for the working people of America and a fairer contribution from millionaires and corporations,” Progressive Caucus leader Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-AZ) said in a statement Sunday night. “I will not be a part of it.” \n \n The Black Caucus Sunday released a letter urging Obama to invoke the 14th Amendment and take the debt crisis into his own hands, something the president had said he was unwilling to do. \n \n In a floor speech Sunday prior to the deal announcement, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) encouraged the same. \n \n Trouble also lurks, more familiarly, to Obama’s right. \n \n “This isn’t the greatest deal in the world,” Boehner said in a statement Sunday night, urging a vote as soon as possible. “But it shows how much we’ve changed the terms of the debate in this town.” \n \n Boehner and other conservatives have faced resistance from those Republicans who represent tea party ideals. Tomorrow’s vote is sure to be another tea party standoff. \n \n “I’m afraid this is not going to fix the problem, and that’s the one reason I came here,” Sen. Ron Johnson (R-TX), who was elected by tea party constituents. \n \n Obama, for one, realized that the vote has not happened yet, and encouraged Americans to continue to contact their members of Congress to express support for the plan. \n \n “We’re not done yet,” he said Sunday night.', 'President Barack Obama’s rightward lurch to reach a $3 trillion deficit reduction deal with no guarantee of additional revenues had liberals fuming and Republicans all but declaring victory Sunday afternoon. \n \n With time running out to reach an agreement to raise the debt ceiling before Tuesday’s default deadline, Obama moved dramatically in the direction of the GOP, according to Senators and aides in both parties. \n \n As details trickled out Sunday, the deal framework appeared to give Republicans most of what they were seeking — with about $3 trillion in guaranteed spending cuts but no tax increases, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said Sunday. \n \n “We are going to deal with this problem the American people sent us here to deal with, which is that the government has been spending too much,” the Kentucky Republican said on CNN. \n \n In return, Obama, whose poll numbers are at all-time lows, gets to avoid another debt ceiling battle before voters head to polls in November 2012, and he will be able to argue that he was willing to compromise to help save the country from a default crisis. \n \n Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) also signed off on the deal late Sunday afternoon, “pending caucus approval,” said his spokesman, Adam Jentleson. \n \n But first, the president and Democratic leaders could face a backlash from liberals angry that they appear to have agreed to a revenue-free debt ceiling bill that includes a “trigger” only for automatic cuts in defense, Medicare and other programs if a second deficit reduction package isn’t enacted by the end of this year. \n \n Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, said early reports of the new deal appeared to be “a sugar-coated Satan sandwich.” The Missouri Democrat said the CBC hadn’t yet made a formal declaration that the group would oppose it, “but this is a shady bill.” \n \n “This deal trades people’s livelihoods for the votes of a few unappeasable right-wing radicals, and I will not support it,” ripped Rep. Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.), co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, before House Democrats had even been briefed. “The lesson today is that Republicans can hold their breath long enough to get what they want.” \n \n For weeks, liberals have feared that Obama would give in to Republican demands for trillions in spending cuts without a guarantee of “sacrifice” from the wealthy. In a last-ditch effort to stop such a deal, progressive lawmakers amped up their calls that Obama simply ignore the debt ceiling and use the 14th Amendment as a justification. \n \n The White House tried to tamp down the liberal unrest by making it clear that Obama still wants revenue in a final deficit reduction package later this year. That deal would be crafted by a new joint committee, which would be created under the tentative agreement. \n \n National Economic Council Director Gene Sperling said on CNN that Obama would still insist on a balanced package that includes tax reform, and he noted that the president still does not support anything that would cut benefits for seniors without asking the wealthy to sacrifice as well. \n \n But there is no guarantee that Republicans will give an inch on revenues. \n \n One senior House Democratic aide said the deal appeared to be so bad for the Democrats that it might get fewer than 50 votes from their side. That could force Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) to corral the vast bulk of the votes from his Conference. \n \n Rep. Kurt Schrader, a member of the Blue Dog Coalition, predicted more optimistically that 80 Democrats would back it. \n \n “While we’re a very diverse Caucus, at the end of the day, we’re not going to put our ideology ahead of the good of the country,” the Oregon Democrat said. \n \n Still, Obama may have some persuading to do in order to get his Democratic colleagues on board. \n \n “I think the president will come in here and sell whatever agreement he comes to,” Schrader predicted. \n \n Selling the package to House Republicans, meanwhile, could be a lot easier given that the deal builds off of Boehner’s own bill. The package that was emerging Sunday afternoon would eliminate the requirement that a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution be passed and sent to the states — but it would include at least a vote on such a proposal in both chambers. \n \n Sen. Carl Levin said the president did not appear to be willing to make the sustained argument that the wealthy pay their fair share but would at least have another chance next year when the Bush tax cuts are set to expire and the nation’s credit rating isn’t on the line. \n \n “The question is how hard he will fight,” the Michigan Democrat said. \n \n Several Senate Democrats appeared resigned to backing a revenue-free deal, even as the details were still being ironed out. \n \n “I think not having revenues is a mistake, but it may be all we can do at this point,” Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.) said. \n \n Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said, “I’m not pleased with having it happen this way.” She added she would probably back it “because I think the worst possible thing is for us not to pay our bills.” \n \n Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) also said on CNN that Democrats would still push to have revenue included in a final package to be negotiated later by a new 12-person joint deficit reduction committee. That committee would be empowered to send a package without amendment to the House and Senate floors for up-or-down votes by Thanksgiving. \n \n Some Democrats said the political consequences of the joint committee failing to act would hit the GOP more than on the president’s party. Talks on the details of a trigger, which several Senators and aides said was still being tweaked Sunday, included accommodations that would make it more palatable to Democrats. \n \n Though the trigger would force cuts to Medicare, those cuts would come from Medicare providers rather than beneficiaries directly, Democratic Senators and aides said. And large defense cuts are intended to bring the GOP to the table to compromise. \n \n Levin said that if the trigger affected Medicare benefits directly, very few Democrats could support it. \n \n One advantage of such a trigger is that it would create a large array of powerful interests — from defense contractors to health care providers — who would have a huge stake in the passage of a second deficit reduction plan. \n \n And there is also a political advantage to the trigger for Democrats as well. If Republicans opted to pull the trigger rather than agree to any tax increases, Democrats could blast them in the 2012 campaign as hurting seniors to protect millionaires and billionaires. \n \n “That gives a political argument, but in the meantime, there’s a hell of a lot of damage done to average people in this country,” Levin said. \n \n Some Democrats were still looking to sweeten the deal Sunday afternoon, with Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (Ill.) saying he hopes the package will extend the payroll tax cut for another year. \n \n The joint deficit committee inspired fear in both parties. Some liberal groups think it has too much power to slash entitlements, while some conservatives are afraid it could be a way to force through a tax increase. \n \n But Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) dismissed such concerns. A tax increase would “never pass the House,” he said. \n \n Reid, who conceived the committee idea, said “it will be essential to choose members with open minds willing to consider every option — even when those options are tough pills to swallow for both parties. Cooperation is the only way forward.” \n \n Jessica Brady, Meredith Shiner and John Stanton contributed to this report.', ""Mystery solved. \n \n The “angel priest” who appeared at the scene of a Missouri car crash, anointed and prayed with the teenage victim, then vanished has been identified as Rev. Patrick Dowling of the Jefferson City Diocese. \n \n ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT \n \n A press release provided to FoxNews.com by the diocese said Father Dowling had been travelling Highway 19 between Mass assignments in northern and central Missouri when he arrived near the crash scene Aug. 4. \n \n The arrival of the unidentified priest, who seemed to come out of nowhere, then attend to the victim before disappearing just as mysteriously, touched off nationwide speculation about the identity of the “angel” cleric. \n \n Dowling actually identified himself in a comment posting on a story about his actions on the National Catholic Register website Friday night. The posting, one among many, appeared to go unnoticed for several days. \n \n “I had Mass in Ewing MO as the regular priest was sick,” he wrote. “As I was returning, I arrived at the scene. The authorities were redirecting traffic. I waited till it was possible to drive up closer. I parked behind a large vehicle about 150 yards from the scene. I asked the Sheriff’s permission and approached the scene of the accident. \n \n “I absolved and anointed Katie, and, at her request, prayed that her leg would not hurt. Then I stepped aside to where some rescue personnel and the (rescue helicopter) pilot were waiting, and prayed the rosary silently. \n \n “I left when the helicopter was about to take off, and before I got to my car…” \n \n The Archdiocese said Dowling, a native of Kilkenny, Ireland, was ordained a priest of the Diocese of Jefferson City, Mo., in 1982. He has served at parishes in Moberly, Monroe City, Indian Creek, Milan, Unionville and Eldon, Mo., and in the diocese’s mission parishes in Marcona and Nasca, Peru. \n \n He is currently serving in prison ministry and in parish ministry to Spanish-speaking Catholics. \n \n Family and friends of the victim, 19-year-old Katie Lentz of Quincy, Mo., had said they hoped to find the priest and thank him. \n \n Rescuers told Fox4KC said a 26-year-old driver crossed the center lane and hit Lentz' car head-on. Authorities spent about 45 minutes trying to cut her out of the car, but the metal on her older car dulled the equipment. \n \n She asked the rescuers to pray with her and at that point the priest appeared. \n \n Adding to the mystery, Fire Chief Raymond Reed said the department took 80 photos of the scene and the priest did not appear in any of them.""]",4,"– Liberals are just a wee bit unhappy with the deal President Obama struck to increase the debt ceiling. The Progressive Caucus and the Black Caucus will hold a press conference today to announce their opposition to the deal, Raw Story reports. Black Caucus Chairman Emanuel Cleaver delivered the real money quote yesterday, telling Roll Call that based on early reports, the pact looked like “a sugar-coated Satan sandwich.” Rep. Cleaver stood by the quote in an MSNBC interview, saying the bill was “antithetical to everything the great religions of the world teach, which is take care of the poor, take care of the aged.” He said he still needed to review the details, “but on the surface, it looks like a Satan sandwich.” Nancy Pelosi meanwhile darkly hinted that “We all may not be able to support it, or none us may be able to support it.” But Washington Post sources say Pelosi is just firing a warning shot past a dismissive White House, and won't actually block the bill."

114,"['The Obama administration reaffirmed Wednesday its decision to designate polar bears as a ""threatened,"" not ""endangered,"" species, in defiance of the wishes of conservationists who say the bears are in danger of extinction because their arctic hunting grounds are melting. \n \n The administration was under a court-imposed deadline to decide whether it would upgrade the bears\' status to ""endangered."" \n \n The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service told a U.S. District Court judge Wednesday that the threatened designation will not change because polar bears were not considered to be in danger of extinction at the time of the listing in 2008. \n \n ""The Service explained how its biologists had concluded in 2008 that the polar bear was not facing sudden and catastrophic threats [and] was still a widespread species that had not been restricted to a critically small range or critically low numbers,"" the agency said in a statement. \n \n Threatened species receive most of the same regulatory protections as those listed under the Endangered Species Act, including a requirement that federal agencies refrain from actions that might jeopardize their existence or destroy or harm their habitat. \n \n Kassie Siegel, director of the Climate Law Institute at the Center for Biological Diversity, called the administration\'s decision ""a huge disappointment."" Arctic ice, the bears\' hunting ground, is melting and bears are starving to death, she said. \n \n ""It\'s a wasted opportunity to do the right thing,"" Siegel said. ""The government\'s own studies show about an 80 percent chance of extinction of two-thirds of the world\'s polar bears in the next 40 years.""', 'Obama gives \'lump of coal\' to polar bears: activists \n \n WASHINGTON — Environmental groups on Thursday accused US President Barack Obama\'s administration of failing to ensure the survival of polar bears after it stopped short of listing the animals as endangered. \n \n Kassie Siegel of the Center for Biological Diversity, who has led legal efforts to protect the polar bear, said that the Obama administration ""sacrificed sound science for political expediency."" \n \n ""The Obama administration delivered a lump of coal to the polar bear for Christmas,"" she said in a statement. \n \n The US Fish and Wildlife Service, responding to a legal suit, agreed Wednesday that climate change posed ""serious threats"" to the polar bears by melting their Arctic habitat in the northernmost state of Alaska. \n \n But the service said the threat was ""in the foreseeable future"" and that polar bears were not ""in danger of extinction."" A listing as endangered would likely lead to federal protection of areas rich in oil and gas. \n \n Andrew Wetzler of the Natural Resources Defense Council questioned the administration\'s logic, saying: ""I guess if a wrecking ball is barreling down on your house, you are just \'threatened.\'"" \n \n The decision left in place a 2008 ruling under president George W. Bush, whose administration was much less eager than predecessors to protect animals under the Endangered Species Act. \n \n The Obama administration has pledged to become more active in fighting climate change, and it incurred the wrath of the oil industry on Thursday by announcing it would regulate greenhouse gas emissions by power plants. \n \n Last month, the Fish and Wildlife Service set aside 187,000 square miles (484,000 square kilometers) off Alaska\'s northern shore as a bear habitat, which means any project that could impact the animals\' way of life must undergo careful review. \n \n The northern polar cap has shrunk between 15 and 20 percent over the last 30 years. But a recent study in the British journal Nature said that the melting was not inevitable and could be reversed. \n \n Copyright © 2013 AFP. All rights reserved. More »', 'Ignoring calls from environmentalists to revisit the status of the polar bear, the Obama administration outlined yesterday its legal reasoning for why it should be listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. \n \n The Fish and Wildlife Service was responding to a court order requiring it to further explain why polar bears should be considered threatened rather than endangered, which is a higher threat level. \n \n Environmentalists argue that the bear should be listed as endangered, while industry groups say it shouldn\'t be listed at all. \n \n Last month, in the court case arising from the dispute over the bear\'s status, U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan of the District of Columbia ordered FWS to provide a more detailed legal basis for its position, which is in line with the stance taken by the George W. Bush administration when it first listed polar bears as threatened in 2008 (E&ENews; PM, Nov. 4). \n \n There was never any indication from the government that it planned to change its position, although environmental groups challenging the listing, including the Center for Biological Diversity, had hoped that it would. \n \n The memorandum filed with the court focused on the phrase ""in danger of extinction,"" which is used in the ESA to define what constitutes an endangered species. Sullivan said the meaning of the phrase was unclear. \n \n Under Supreme Court precedent, when the meaning of a statutory phrase is not easily discernible, government agencies have discretion to interpret the law, within certain boundaries. \n \n Environmentalists have presented evidence that they say shows that the bear is in danger of extinction, but FWS maintains that, under its interpretation of the statute, a species is only endangered when it is ""currently on the brink of extinction in the wild."" \n \n When analyzing the polar bear, the agency found that the species ""has not been restricted to a critically small range or critically low numbers, and has yet to suffer any substantial reduction in numbers or range,"" the memorandum says. \n \n The polar bear does ""face a serious threat"" and is ""likely to become an endangered species in the foreseeable future,"" the government concedes. \n \n The findings justify a listing as threatened, which is defined in the ESA as a species ""which is likely to become an endangered species in the foreseeable future,"" the agency added. \n \n The court case has implications beyond the polar bear because environmentalists would like to see the Endangered Species Act used as a tool for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. \n \n If the polar bear were listed as endangered, the government could be required to act to curb emissions to protect its habitat. \n \n As long as the bear is listed as threatened, that cannot happen because of a Bush-era regulation, retained by the Obama administration, that states that a finding that polar bears were covered by the ESA could not be used as grounds for reducing greenhouse gas emissions nationwide. The regulation only applies to a threatened listing. \n \n Andrew Wetzler, an attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council, conceded he hadn\'t expected the government to change its position, but he said it was a lost opportunity for the administration. \n \n ""One would hope that the growing scientific consensus about the warming of the Arctic would have spurred them into action,"" he added. \n \n The legal fight is not yet over. All the parties challenging the listing will have a chance to respond to the government\'s filing before Sullivan holds another hearing on Feb. 23. \n \n Copyright 2010 E&E; Publishing.

Civil servants and government lawyers have thought long and hard about what measures to adopt and when and how they should be implemented. \n \n A slow game \n \n By Katya Adler, BBC Europe editor \n \n The Catalan crisis is reaching breaking point but we have to be careful here. Nothing will happen from one day to the next. \n \n Political rhetoric aside, both the Spanish government and Catalan regional leaders know sentiments are running so high across Spain at the moment, that millions are poised to take to the streets. \n \n Once the shopping list of measures has been decided, the Catalan leader has the right of reply and we\'re told there is no legal window of opportunity for him to do so, meaning this could take days or weeks. \n \n Finally, the Spanish Senate needs to approve the measures. \n \n Read more from Katya \n \n What is Madrid\'s position? \n \n Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy had set a deadline of 10:00 local time (08:00 GMT) for Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont to offer a definitive answer on the independence question, and called on him to ""act sensibly"". \n \n When it passed, the Spanish government accused the Catalan authorities of seeking confrontation. \n \n ""The Spanish government will continue with the procedures outlined in Article 155 of the Constitution to restore legality in Catalonia\'s self-government,"" it said. \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Why is there a Catalan crisis?

We do not know how the powers of the Catalan government could be affected."" \n \n Where does this leave the Catalan leader? \n \n Mr Puigdemont said in a letter to Mr Rajoy on Thursday morning that the independence declaration remained suspended but this could change. \n \n ""If the government continues to impede dialogue and continues with the repression, the Catalan parliament could proceed, if it is considered opportune, to vote on a formal declaration of independence."" \n \n But he faces an uphill struggle - it is likely that senior figures in charge of internal security in Catalonia could be dismissed, and control of the region\'s police force could pass to Madrid. \n \n The regional parliament could also be dissolved. \n \n Image copyright Reuters Image caption Tough choices: How will Carles Puigdemont (L) answer Mariano Rajoy\'s ultimatum? \n \n One Spanish newspaper has reported that Mr Puigdemont might nominally remain in his job but Madrid would aim to take control of many of his duties and powers. \n \n Ultimately the process could end in regional elections but the Spanish constitution does not impose any time limit.']",4,"– Not everybody's heaping praise on the Obama administration this week: Environmentalists are fuming that the Fish and Wildlife Service decided not to ramp up protection of polar bears by changing their status from ""threatened"" to ""endangered.""

Wednesday\'s vote to refer the matter to the Justice Department was 23-14, with all Republicans voting in favor and all Democrats voting against. \n \n Democratic leaders said the vote was a political stunt designed to fire up the Republican base in an election year. They noted that the Justice Department is already investigating whether any crimes have been committed. \n \n ""It now seems clear that Republican members of the Ways and Means Committee have decided that they do not want to be left behind in the Republican campaign to declare this a scandal and keep it going until November,"" said Rep.

The House Oversight Committee has scheduled a vote for Thursday on whether to hold Lerner in contempt of Congress for refusing to answer questions at two congressional hearings. \n \n At both hearings, Lerner invoked her constitutional right against self-incrimination. House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa, R-Calif., said Lerner had effectively waived her Fifth Amendment right not to answer questions by providing an opening statement at a hearing last year. \n \n Taylor and Democrats on the oversight committee disagree. \n \n Lerner is an attorney who joined the IRS in 2001.

Its nonprofit arm spent about $70 million.', 'The House Ways and Means Committee on Wednesday accused former IRS official Lois Lerner of targeting the prominent GOP group Crossroads GPS and urged the Justice Department to take a fresh look at whether she should be prosecuted. \n \n The rare step by the tax-writing panel comes as congressional Republicans are turning up the heat on the IRS, and a day before Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) and the House Oversight Committee are expected to vote to hold Lerner in contempt of Congress. \n \n In a referral to Attorney General Eric Holder, Republicans make the case that Lerner took an “aggressive and improper” interest in Crossroads GPS, the group co-founded by Karl Rove that spent tens of millions of dollars in the 2010 and 2012 election cycles. \n \n The committee voted to send that referral to Holder after a session conducted mainly behind closed doors and on a 23-14, party-line vote. \n \n Lerner, who headed an IRS division overseeing exempt organizations, pushed to deny Crossroads GPS’s application for tax-exempt status and to audit the group, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp (R-Mich.) says in his letter to Holder. \n \n Lerner showed no such interest in liberal groups, the letter adds, despite concerns by campaign finance reform groups. Ways and Means also alleges that Lerner misled federal investigators about when she first became aware of the IRS’s improper scrutiny of Tea Party groups, and that she recklessly handled confidential taxpayer information. \n \n [READ THE LETTER.] \n \n Camp told reporters after Wednesday’s vote that the committee and Congress needed to stand up to an immensely powerful agency that “can strike the fear of God” into average taxpayers. \n \n “We have to make sure that the signal goes out that this can’t happen again,” Camp told reporters. “If we don’t stand up for people’s constitutional rights on behalf of the American people, who else will?” \n \n The Ways and Means vote was the latest wrinkle in the controversy, now 11 months old, that erupted when Lerner apologized in May 2013 for the IRS’s treatment of Tea Party groups seeking tax-exempt status. The referral could also broaden the congressional investigations, which have largely focused on more grassroots organizations. \n \n Lerner, who has since retired from the IRS, is expected to face another legal headache on Thursday, when Issa begins contempt proceedings. House GOP leaders who said Wednesday that they supported the Ways and Means referral are also on record backing contempt charges. \n \n Issa has said that Lerner, who has twice refused to answer questions in front of the Oversight panel, is the most important figure in his IRS investigation. \n \n Ways and Means Democrats accused Camp and their GOP colleagues of taking a page out of Issa’s playbook and playing politics by releasing taxpayer information. \n \n Rep. Sandy Levin (Mich.), the panel’s top Democrat, said Camp was undermining the panel by making it into “an arm of any campaign committee.” Democrats later said Republicans merely wanted to “promote and protect” GOP moneymen like Rove. \n \n “The way it should have been handled was to simply forward any documentation over there and indicate the full cooperation of the committee,” said Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas). \n \n Lerner’s attorney, Bill Taylor of Zuckerman Spaeder, called the timing of Wednesday’s vote “odd,” and said he had not heard from the Ways and Means Committee about its referral. \n \n “The committee’s referral affects nothing. The Department of Justice is already investigating the IRS. This is just another attempt by Republicans to vilify Ms. Lerner for political gain,” Taylor said in a statement to reporters. \n \n But Steven Law, Crossroads GPS’s chief executive, said the Ways and Means referral “confirms that there was an organized high-level effort within the IRS to subvert the agency’s own standards and procedures in order to harass law-abiding conservative advocacy groups like Crossroads GPS.” \n \n Law said in a separate statement that the group was still waiting for a final decision from the IRS on its application, which it first asked for in 2010. \n \n The group can continue to operate as tax-exempt until that IRS ruling. Under the current IRS rules, 501(c)(4) groups need to make promoting social welfare their primary purpose.

But the final decision on whether to prosecute lies with Holder, who has also been held in contempt by House Republicans and has a generally toxic relationship with GOP lawmakers. \n \n Emily Pierce, a Justice Department spokeswoman, would only say Wednesday that “there is already an active, ongoing investigation into the IRS’s handling of applications by tax-exempt organizations.” \n \n “It remains a high priority of the department,” she added. \n \n — Updated at 8:37 p.m.']",3,"– Last year's IRS scandal is back in the headlines.

Republicans on the committee pushed the vote through, alleging that emails show Lerner sought to deny tax-exempt status to conservative groups, particularly Crossroads GPS, while letting liberal ones slide. Democrats, meanwhile, accused the panel of political theatrics ahead of the midterms, given that the Justice Department already is conducting an investigation into the matter, reports AP. Some dueling quotes: Republican Dave Camp: ""We think there's reason to believe that laws were broken, that constitutional rights were violated,"" said the committee's chairman. ""We have to make sure that the signal goes out that this can't happen again."" Democrat Sander Levin: ""Making this committee an arm of any campaign committee does a deep disservice to the proud traditions and legacy of this committee. I don’t understand why you are doing this, Mr. Chairman.” Lerner's attorney: “Ms. Lerner has done nothing wrong. She did not violate any law or regulation. She did not mislead Congress. She did not interfere with the rights of any organization to a tax exemption. Those are the facts.” This isn't the only House panel investigating the issue. Tomorrow, Darrell Issa's House Oversight Committee will vote on whether to hold Lerner in contempt of Congress for refusing to answer questions, reports Politico."

118,"['Abstract and Introduction \n \n Abstract \n \n In 1994 the National Football League (NFL) initiated a comprehensive clinical and biomechanical research study of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI), a study that is ongoing. Data on mild TBIs sustained between 1996 and 2001 were collected and submitted by NFL team physicians and athletic trainers, and these data were analyzed by the NFL\'s Committee on Mild Traumatic Brain Injury. At the same time, analysis of game videos was performed for on-field mild TBIs to quantify the biomechanics involved and to develop means to improve the understanding of these injuries so that manufacturers could systematically improve and update their head protective equipment. The findings and analysis of the Committee have been presented in a series of articles in Neurosurgery. \n \n Introduction \n \n In 1992 Al Toon, who was a wide receiver for the New York Jets, was the first NFL player known to have retired because of postconcussion syndrome.[2] The year after Mr. Toon\'s retirement, another player, Merrill Hoge of the Chicago Bears, retired because of the same problem. Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, team physicians, and many others raised questions: was this a new problem or a misdiagnosed or unrecognized one? Was this a statistical anomaly or the beginning of an epidemic? \n \n It was decided that a rigorous, scientific approach was necessary to gather the data to answer these questions for this high-profile professional sports league. In 1994, Commissioner Tagliabue approved the creation of the NFL\'s Committee on Mild Traumatic Brain Injury.[12] The Committee was composed of experts inside and outside the NFL. It was decided by the Committee that protection against in jury as well as collection and analysis of injury data would be critical to the success of their mission. For the study, a reportable mild TBI was defined as a traumatically induced alteration in brain function manifested by an alteration of awareness and consciousness, including but not limited to an LOC, a ""ding,"" a sensation of being dazed or stunned, a sensation of ""wooziness"" or ""fogginess,"" a seizure or amnesic period, and by symptoms commonly associated with postconcussion syndrome, including persistent headaches, vertigo, lightheadedness, loss of balance, unsteadiness, syncope, near-syncope, cognitive dysfunction, memory disturbances, hearing loss, tinnitus, blurred vision, diplopia, visual loss, personality change, drowsiness, lethargy, fatigue, and inability to perform usual daily activities.[10] The research summarized here was developed, supervised, and completed in response to the stated goals of the NFL\'s Committee on Mild Traumatic Brain Injury.', 'Penalty run-ups are just getting ridiculous ... \n \n Deliberate, yes? We think so. Look at the replay from side on. Look at the cheeky glimpse he gives the referee. Look at the way he\'s not clutching his face in agony and/or shame. \n \n Rather incredibly, this wasn\'t even a friendly. This was in a penalty shootout, following the 3rd/4th place playoff of the AFC Challenge Cup, a tournament held by the Asian Football Confederation for ""emerging nations"". Sadly for our penalty taker, Afghanistan went on to lose the shootout 8-7. Congrats to the Maldives. \n \n Now, who\'s going to try this in Brazil?', ""INTRODUCTION: \n \n This study aimed to use video analysis techniques to determine the velocity, impact force, angle of impact, and impulse to fracture involved in a video-recorded bicycle accident resulting in facial fractures. Computed tomographic images of the resulting facial injury are presented for correlation with data and calculations. To our knowledge, such an analysis of an actual recorded trauma has not been reported in the literature. \n \n MATERIALS AND METHODS: \n \n A video recording of the accident was split into frames and analyzed using an image editing program. Measurements of velocity and angle of impact were obtained from this analysis, and the force of impact and impulse were calculated using the inverse dynamic method with connected rigid body segments. These results were then correlated with the actual fracture pattern found on computed tomographic imaging of the subject's face. \n \n RESULTS: \n \n There was an impact velocity of 6.25 m/s, impact angles of 14 and 6.3 degrees of neck extension and axial rotation, respectively, an impact force of 1910.4 N, and an impulse to fracture of 47.8 Ns. These physical parameters resulted in clinically significant bilateral mid-facial Le Fort II and III pattern fractures. \n \n DISCUSSION: \n \n These data confer further understanding of the biomechanics of bicycle-related accidents by correlating an actual clinical outcome with the kinematic and dynamic parameters involved in the accident itself and yielding a concrete evidence of the velocity, force, and impulse necessary to cause clinically significant facial trauma. These findings can aid in the design of protective equipment for bicycle riders to help avoid this type of injury."", 'View this post on Instagram \n \n Thank you @givenchyofficial Thank you @riccardotisci17 It was an honor working with you on your last Givenchy Haute Couture #Oscar dress. #EmmaStone #17 #Givenchy #LaLaLand #1700hoursinthemaking']",4,"– Kids have a word for it when you land face-first: ""fail."" As an Internet meme, it's called faceplanting. But what really happens when people use their face for brakes? At BoingBoing, Maggie Koerth-Baker looks at the physical results—which aren't pretty—and takes a glimpse at the related field of injury biomechanics. She starts with a paper by a mechanical engineer about a classic faceplant: young man tries to ride bike along a board from shoreline to dock, misses board, lands face-first. (See the video here.) He endured Le Fort II and III fractures, his face cracking in a triangle shape starting at the top of the nose and going down both sides to the upper jaw. Sadly, other researchers say this particular video won't advance the field because the frame-rate is poor; real experiments analyze the 10-20 milliseconds in which injuries occur. So Koerth-Baker delves deeper into injury biomechanics, starting with John Stapp, an Air Force flight surgeon who endured a sudden stop in a rocket sled at 46.2 g's of force in 1954. He broke nearly all the capillaries in his eyes, Ejection Site reports, but his work helped the Air Force design pilot ejector-seats. More recently, studies on NFL concussions have shown that hits from the side or back cause more concussions than hits on the crown of the helmet. Which leaves faceplanters where, exactly? Well, getting seriously injured as we laugh and learn. At least this one, at SBNation, faceplanted on purpose in an effort to help his team. (Click to check out some less painful memes.)"

120,"['WARSAW — President Andrzej Duda said on Tuesday that he would sign into law a bill making it illegal to accuse “the Polish nation” of complicity in the Holocaust and other Nazi atrocities, a measure that has roiled relations with Israel and the United States, and spurred claims that the nationalist government is trying to whitewash one of the bloodiest chapters in Poland’s history. \n \n Opponents have predicted that the law — which prohibits, among other things, the phrase “Polish death camp” — would stifle free speech and put questions of historical accuracy into the hands of judges and prosecutors who may be more motivated by politics than scholarship. Despite weeks of ferocious criticism from other nations and from independent scholars, Mr. Duda’s right-wing Law and Justice Party pressed ahead with the bill. \n \n Mr. Duda said in a speech broadcast on Polish television and radio that he would sign the measure, while asking the Constitutional Court to determine whether the law violated free-speech protections and to make clear specifically what kinds of speech could be prosecuted. He said that the government wanted to be sure that survivors of war crimes felt free to tell their stories without fear. \n \n But a judicial review is unlikely to placate those who have accused the Law and Justice Party of dangerous revisionism. It is unclear when the high court, which is controlled by judges appointed by Mr. Duda’s party, might act; the law would remain in effect at least until then.', 'Columnist \n \n The Streisand effect is one of the curious byproducts of the Internet age. Named for the singer — who tried to suppress a photograph of her Malibu mansion, only to have the picture seen far more widely as a result — it occurs when an attempt to hide, remove or censor something from public view backfires badly. \n \n The Streisand effect is now in full swing in Poland, where a simultaneously incompetent and malevolent government has passed a law — rapidly, in the middle of the night — intended among other things to criminalize the term ""Polish death camps"" and other expressions implying that the Polish nation was responsible for Auschwitz and other camps built by German Nazis. The national dislike of this term goes back many years and is shared widely by all political groups, for understandable reasons. Millions of Polish citizens, including many who were not Jewish, died in these camps, among them university professors and Catholic priests, both groups deliberately targeted for extinction. Unlike in France, Belgium, Italy and most other European countries, there was no fascist, pro-German or collaborationist government in Poland during the war, and no Polish SS formation. The Nazi occupiers intended to destroy Poland as a nation, to Germanize a large chunk of the country and to turn the rest of it into a German agricultural colony. \n \n Nevertheless there were individual Poles who did terrible things to Jews during the war and afterward, just as there were individual Poles who did heroic things. The debate about how much Poland, as a nation, bears responsibility for these individual crimes has gone on for a long time and has had depressing as well as uplifting aspects. At times the conversation has been ill-tempered. But for a quarter century, dedicated Polish historians, diplomats, politicians and curators have also tried to reconcile different memories and heal wounds; one of the results was Poland\'s superb museum of Jewish history, jointly built by the international Jewish community and the Polish state. Another result was the hitherto excellent Polish-Israeli relationship, which has had big cultural as well as political benefits. Every summer, for example, a Jewish festival in Warsaw (there are others in other cities too) brings Israeli pop singers to a square near my apartment, and the concerts are always packed. \n \n The imposition, now, of a three-year prison penalty for anyone who participates in the conversation about the past in ways that irritate the current ruling party is simply ludicrous, even laughable. Will the long arm of the Polish state reach out to academic conferences in Tokyo or Buenos Aires if someone uses an incorrect phrase? Will people be punished for politically incorrect memoirs? In a pompous speech the Polish prime minister gave supporting the law, an automatic translation service made it appear as if he himself said that ""camps where millions of Jews were murdered were Polish."" Should he go to prison, too? Should Google Translate? The very stupidity and unenforceability of this law is what has brought on the Streisand effect: Beginning in Israel but moving quickly across all forms of social media around the world, the use of the phrase ""Polish death camps"" has suddenly spiked and has now been used many more times than ever before in history. \n \n To Poland\'s anti-pluralist ruling party that doesn\'t matter, because the real purpose of the law was never Poland\'s international image. In a sharp break with all previous democratic governments of the left, right and center, going back to 1989, this government does not care how isolated or ridiculous the country becomes. On the contrary, foreign criticism offers another chance to solidify the support of ""patriots"" who oppose the ""slander"" of the country, against ""traitors"" who do not. One pro-government journalist gave the game away when he declared that the criticism of the law in Israel was an element in an international conspiracy against the Polish government. On cue, Polish social media has been saturated with the howls of anti-Semites defending their country against this terrible attack. \n \n I have no doubt that the Israeli government is also using this nasty little controversy for its own purposes. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not been disturbed by the Hungarian government\'s long-standing and well-funded campaign — on billboards, in the noisy state and pro-government media — against billionaire George Soros, with its clear anti-Semitic overtones, since he dislikes Soros\'s philanthropic support for liberal causes. His decision to make an issue of this absurd Polish law instead no doubt gives him a chance to solidify his domestic support as well. Taking a stand on the past is so much easier than dealing with the complex present. \n \n The irony is that none of the protagonists of this story can actually remember World War II, or the terror that it brought to the Jews and to Poland. But that is part of the explanation: As genuine memories of the horror recede, cartoon versions of history, easily manipulated, have come to replace them. This illiterate ""debate"" is one of the more sordid results. \n \n Read more from Anne Applebaum\'s archive, follow her on Twitter or subscribe to her updates on Facebook.', 'Polish President Andrzej Duda ratified a law making it illegal to blame his country for any part in the German Nazis’ systematic murder of millions of Jews during World War II, bowing to pressure from his ruling allies and amid rallies by far-right protesters. \n \n Despite mounting international criticism, ruling Law & Justice party leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski urged Duda to sign the legislation. The president complied Tuesday, a day after dozens of activists chanted anti-Semitic slogans at a rally in front of his presidential palace in central Warsaw, with one banner reading: “Take off your yarmulke and sign the bill.” \n \n Andrzej Duda on Feb. 6. Photographer: Janek Skarzynski/AFP via Getty Images \n \n Both Israel and the U.S. have called on Poland to halt the so-called Holocaust bill, which they say curbs free speech and may be an attempt to rewrite history. Duda said that while he approved the legislation, he’s also sending it to be vetted by the Constitutional Tribunal, a court that may ask lawmakers to change part or all of the legislation. \n \n “This guarantees Polish interests, such as our dignity and the historical truth -- that we will be fairly evaluated in the world,” Duda told reporters in Warsaw, taking no questions. “On the other hand, my decision takes into account the sensitivity of people for whom the historical truth and the truth about the Holocaust is extremely important.” \n \n ‘Rewritten Narrative’ \n \n Israel’s Foreign Ministry said that it hopes the tribunal’s pending review will allow it to work on amendments with Polish authorities. \n \n The controversy represents the latest conflict for the Law & Justice party, which over two years in power has battled its partners in the European Union over allegations that it’s backtracking on democratic values. Once seen as a model of transformation from communism, Poland is “squandering the great gains” it has achieved since 1989, according to Judy Dempsey, a Berlin-based fellow at Carnegie Europe, a think-tank. \n \n Poland’s main political objective since embracing democracy was to anchor itself in the EU and NATO, helped by “rapprochement and reconciliation” with Germany, Ukraine and Israel, Dempsey wrote on Tuesday. “But now, because of this legislation, the Polish narrative is being rewritten in a way that it is becoming seeped in patriotism, victimhood, and revenge.” \n \n ‘A Single Jew’ \n \n Poles say they’re unfairly held complicit in German Nazi war crimes during a period when their country was occupied and an estimated 2.7 million non-Jewish civilians were killed, including a large number of resistance fighters. Only 380,000 of Poland’s 3 million Jews -- Europe’s largest pre-war Jewish community -- survived the Holocaust, according to Israel’s Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial. \n \n While some Polish civilians participated in the murder of Jews or turned them over to Nazis to avoid being executed for hiding them, others resisted. Yad Vashem has commemorated 6,700 Poles for rescuing Jews, the largest number of “Righteous Gentiles” in any country. \n \n The law would impose fines or up to three years in jail for public claims that Poland or the Polish nation bears responsibility for crimes against humanity committed on its soil. Works of art and science are exempt. \n \n “We don’t have any intention to prosecute someone who says that somewhere a single Jew or a family were murdered,” Kaczynski told public radio on Feb. 3. “Such events took place and we never denied this.” \n \n Ukrainian Objection \n \n Last week, Israeli legislators drew up a bill defining any attempt to deny or minimize the crimes of Nazi collaborators as Holocaust denial, which carries a five-year prison sentence in the Jewish state. It would provide state backing for any Holocaust survivor or educator prosecuted under the Polish bill. \n \n Neighboring Ukraine also criticized the Polish law, which widened the government’s mandate to prosecute crimes committed by “Ukrainian nationalists and members of Ukrainian formations collaborating with the Third Reich” from 1925 to 1950. Lawmakers in Kiev passed a resolution Tuesday saying they were “deeply concerned” the law could pave the way for “the strengthening of anti-Ukrainian tendencies.” \n \n — With assistance by Konrad Krasuski, Daryna Krasnolutska, and Alisa Odenheimer', 'President Barack Obama’s rightward lurch to reach a $3 trillion deficit reduction deal with no guarantee of additional revenues had liberals fuming and Republicans all but declaring victory Sunday afternoon. \n \n With time running out to reach an agreement to raise the debt ceiling before Tuesday’s default deadline, Obama moved dramatically in the direction of the GOP, according to Senators and aides in both parties. \n \n As details trickled out Sunday, the deal framework appeared to give Republicans most of what they were seeking — with about $3 trillion in guaranteed spending cuts but no tax increases, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said Sunday. \n \n “We are going to deal with this problem the American people sent us here to deal with, which is that the government has been spending too much,” the Kentucky Republican said on CNN. \n \n In return, Obama, whose poll numbers are at all-time lows, gets to avoid another debt ceiling battle before voters head to polls in November 2012, and he will be able to argue that he was willing to compromise to help save the country from a default crisis. \n \n Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) also signed off on the deal late Sunday afternoon, “pending caucus approval,” said his spokesman, Adam Jentleson. \n \n But first, the president and Democratic leaders could face a backlash from liberals angry that they appear to have agreed to a revenue-free debt ceiling bill that includes a “trigger” only for automatic cuts in defense, Medicare and other programs if a second deficit reduction package isn’t enacted by the end of this year. \n \n Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, said early reports of the new deal appeared to be “a sugar-coated Satan sandwich.” The Missouri Democrat said the CBC hadn’t yet made a formal declaration that the group would oppose it, “but this is a shady bill.” \n \n “This deal trades people’s livelihoods for the votes of a few unappeasable right-wing radicals, and I will not support it,” ripped Rep. Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.), co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, before House Democrats had even been briefed. “The lesson today is that Republicans can hold their breath long enough to get what they want.” \n \n For weeks, liberals have feared that Obama would give in to Republican demands for trillions in spending cuts without a guarantee of “sacrifice” from the wealthy. In a last-ditch effort to stop such a deal, progressive lawmakers amped up their calls that Obama simply ignore the debt ceiling and use the 14th Amendment as a justification. \n \n The White House tried to tamp down the liberal unrest by making it clear that Obama still wants revenue in a final deficit reduction package later this year. That deal would be crafted by a new joint committee, which would be created under the tentative agreement. \n \n National Economic Council Director Gene Sperling said on CNN that Obama would still insist on a balanced package that includes tax reform, and he noted that the president still does not support anything that would cut benefits for seniors without asking the wealthy to sacrifice as well. \n \n But there is no guarantee that Republicans will give an inch on revenues. \n \n One senior House Democratic aide said the deal appeared to be so bad for the Democrats that it might get fewer than 50 votes from their side. That could force Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) to corral the vast bulk of the votes from his Conference. \n \n Rep. Kurt Schrader, a member of the Blue Dog Coalition, predicted more optimistically that 80 Democrats would back it. \n \n “While we’re a very diverse Caucus, at the end of the day, we’re not going to put our ideology ahead of the good of the country,” the Oregon Democrat said. \n \n Still, Obama may have some persuading to do in order to get his Democratic colleagues on board. \n \n “I think the president will come in here and sell whatever agreement he comes to,” Schrader predicted. \n \n Selling the package to House Republicans, meanwhile, could be a lot easier given that the deal builds off of Boehner’s own bill. The package that was emerging Sunday afternoon would eliminate the requirement that a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution be passed and sent to the states — but it would include at least a vote on such a proposal in both chambers. \n \n Sen. Carl Levin said the president did not appear to be willing to make the sustained argument that the wealthy pay their fair share but would at least have another chance next year when the Bush tax cuts are set to expire and the nation’s credit rating isn’t on the line. \n \n “The question is how hard he will fight,” the Michigan Democrat said. \n \n Several Senate Democrats appeared resigned to backing a revenue-free deal, even as the details were still being ironed out. \n \n “I think not having revenues is a mistake, but it may be all we can do at this point,” Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.) said. \n \n Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said, “I’m not pleased with having it happen this way.” She added she would probably back it “because I think the worst possible thing is for us not to pay our bills.” \n \n Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) also said on CNN that Democrats would still push to have revenue included in a final package to be negotiated later by a new 12-person joint deficit reduction committee. That committee would be empowered to send a package without amendment to the House and Senate floors for up-or-down votes by Thanksgiving. \n \n Some Democrats said the political consequences of the joint committee failing to act would hit the GOP more than on the president’s party. Talks on the details of a trigger, which several Senators and aides said was still being tweaked Sunday, included accommodations that would make it more palatable to Democrats. \n \n Though the trigger would force cuts to Medicare, those cuts would come from Medicare providers rather than beneficiaries directly, Democratic Senators and aides said. And large defense cuts are intended to bring the GOP to the table to compromise. \n \n Levin said that if the trigger affected Medicare benefits directly, very few Democrats could support it. \n \n One advantage of such a trigger is that it would create a large array of powerful interests — from defense contractors to health care providers — who would have a huge stake in the passage of a second deficit reduction plan. \n \n And there is also a political advantage to the trigger for Democrats as well. If Republicans opted to pull the trigger rather than agree to any tax increases, Democrats could blast them in the 2012 campaign as hurting seniors to protect millionaires and billionaires. \n \n “That gives a political argument, but in the meantime, there’s a hell of a lot of damage done to average people in this country,” Levin said. \n \n Some Democrats were still looking to sweeten the deal Sunday afternoon, with Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (Ill.) saying he hopes the package will extend the payroll tax cut for another year. \n \n The joint deficit committee inspired fear in both parties. Some liberal groups think it has too much power to slash entitlements, while some conservatives are afraid it could be a way to force through a tax increase. \n \n But Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) dismissed such concerns. A tax increase would “never pass the House,” he said. \n \n Reid, who conceived the committee idea, said “it will be essential to choose members with open minds willing to consider every option — even when those options are tough pills to swallow for both parties. Cooperation is the only way forward.” \n \n Jessica Brady, Meredith Shiner and John Stanton contributed to this report.']",4,"– The US and Israel pitched a fit, but it ultimately wasn't enough to fully stop Poland from moving ahead with its controversial Holocaust law. Polish President Andrzej Duda on Tuesday announced he would sign a bill that prohibits speech that states or suggests his nation was complicit in Nazi Germany's crimes. In a concession to critics, though, Duda will have the Constitutional Tribunal examine the law; Bloomberg reports the court has the power to force lawmakers to alter the law's language in whole or part. The New York Times quotes Duda as saying he's adding that step because the ""very painful, delicate issue"" needs to be handled thoughtfully, though the Times sees the move as doing little to assuage those who say it could curtail free speech and whitewash the role some Poles played in the killing of Jews during World War II. Duda said that should the court clear the law, he'd like to see it specify exactly what type of speech is subject to prosecution. As it stands now, using the phrase ""Polish death camp"" to refer to Auschwitz and other Nazi-constructed concentration camps within the country can result in a prison term; claiming the Polish nation ""is responsible or co-responsible for Nazi crimes"" is punishable by up to three years. In a Washington Post column, Anne Applebaum writes of the law's ""ludicrous"" potential: ""Will the long arm of the Polish state reach out to academic conferences in Tokyo or Buenos Aires if someone uses an incorrect phrase? ... In a pompous speech the Polish prime minister gave supporting the law, an automatic translation service made it appear as if he himself said that 'camps where millions of Jews were murdered were Polish.' Should he go to prison, too? Should Google Translate?"""

Also released was a letter that he wrote describing the shooting. \n \n At first the teenagers turned down the music in their car, as he had asked, but then he wrote that he could hear one of the passengers in the back seat shouting that he should kill Dunn. \n \n ""He bends forward and picked something up with both hands,"" Dunn wrote. ""As he\'s doing this, he says \'yeah-I\'m going to f****** kill you!"" and now I can tell what he\'s picked up, as he just laid a gun barrel against the window sill. I can see about four inches of the barrel sticking up and it looks thick enough to be a 12 gauge maybe a 20 gauge shotgun."" \n \n At first he was paralyzed by fear by the sight of the shotgun, he wrote. \n \n ""Something happened inside of me when he advanced towards me and my paralysis left me,"" he wrote. ""Between fear, adrenaline and muscle-memory, I grabbed my pistol from the glove box. As I was doing so, I shouted, ""You\'re not going to kill me you son of a b****!"" \n \n Dunn, who is white, testified that he fired in self-defense. \n \n \n \n But no weapon was found in the SUV and Davis\' friends said they did not hear him threaten Dunn. The state\'s medical examiner testified that the trajectory of Dunn\'s bullets into Davis\' body showed that Davis was sitting down when he was shot. \n \n Authorities said that Dunn became enraged about the music and the argument. One person walking out of the store said he heard Dunn say, ""You are not going to talk to me like that."" \n \n The state attorney, Angela Corey, has said her office will seek a retrial of Dunn on the first-degree murder charge. \n \n Dunn\'s defense attorney, Cory Strolla, has said he plans to appeal. \n \n In another telephone call, Dunn\'s father told him of the shooting, ""This thing is viral.

Jurors found Dunn guilty on four of five charges for shooting at Davis\' friends, who were also in the car, as well as firing a gun into a car in the 2012 incident. However, jurors could not agree on the first-degree murder charge for shooting Davis, prompting a mistrial on that count. \n \n The recordings mirror statements Dunn made in trial in which he stated that he believed his life was in danger, thus leaving him little choice but to shoot.

Elijah went into anaphylactic shock and was taken to the Pediatric ER at Harlem Hospital, where, tragically, they were unable to save him. Elijah leaves behind his heartbroken mother, Dina, father, Thomas, and his 5-year-old brother Sebastian, as well as dozens of friends and family members who all mourn the loss of his precious young life. Elijah was three years old. \n \n \n \n Right now, our family is immersed in our grief, but we are also facing an overwhelming list of financial and practical matters, all related to Elijah’s untimely death.

Here’s why we need it: at this moment, it is unclear where responsibility for Elijah’s death will fall between the pre-k and the hospital itself. There are protocols that both the hospital and preschool must follow. We want to find out exactly what caused Elijah’s death and that will mean sorting out exactly where, if any, breakdowns may have occurred at either the school or the hospital.

123,"['Research suggests that the ratio of the lengths of the index finger and the ring finger in males may be predictive of a variety of disorders related to disturbed hormonal balance. When the index finger is shorter than the ring finger, this results in a small 2D:4D ratio, pointing to a high exposure to testosterone in the uterus. \n \n In a new study of 103 male patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and 100 matched healthy male individuals, investigators found that the 2D:4D ratio may be an effective predictor of schizophrenia--there were significant differences between schizophrenia and control groups concerning the ratio of the lengths of the second digit to the fourth digit, as well as its asymmetry, in both hands. \n \n ""Asymmetry index showed moderate discriminatory power and, therefore asymmetry index has a potential utility as a diagnostic test in determining the presence of schizophrenia,"" said Dr. Taner Oznur, co-author of the Clinical Anatomy study. \n \n ###', 'The production of androgens (mostly testosterone) during the early fetal stage is essential for the differentiation of the male brain. Some authors have suggested a relationship between androgen exposure during the prenatal period and schizophrenia. These two separate relationships suggest that digit length ratios are associated with schizophrenia in males. The study was performed in a university hospital between October 2012 and May 2013. One hundred and three male patients diagnosed with schizophrenia according to DSM‐IV using SCID‐I, and 100 matched healthy males, were admitted to the study. Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS), Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) and Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) were used to assess schizophrenia symptoms. The second digit (2D) and fourth digit (4D) asymmetry index (AI), and the right‐ and left‐hand 2D:4D ratios were calculated. All parametric data in the groups were compared using an independent t‐test. The predictive power of the AI was estimated by receiver operating characteristics analysis. The 2D:4D AI was statistically significantly lower in the patient group than the healthy control comparison group. There were significant differences between the schizophrenia and the control groups in respect of left 2D:4D and right 2D:4D. There was no correlation between AI, left, or right 2D:4D, BPRS, or SAPS in the schizophrenia group. However, there was a negative correlation between left 2nd digit (L2D):4D and the SANS score. Our findings support the view that the 2D:4D AI can be used as a moderate indicator of schizophrenia. Even more simply, the right or left 2D:4D can be used as an indicator.

In the journal Clinical Anatomy, researchers write that others have previously suggested a link between androgen exposure in the womb and schizophrenia; they take that one step further, hypothesizing the ratio could be predictive of schizophrenia in males. Then they set out to test that hypothesis: In their small study, researchers analyzed the finger lengths of 103 Turkish male patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and 100 healthy male controls. They found ""significant differences between schizophrenia and control groups concerning the ratio ... in both hands,"" the researchers report in a press release. The findings occupy opposite ends of the spectrum: The right-hand 2D:4D ratio was ""significantly higher"" among the schizophrenia group and the left-hand ratio was ""significantly lower""—suggesting the two are opposites, perhaps because testosterone ""affects finger ratios differently as it acts in different ways on the left and right hemispheres of the brain,"" per the study. As for those ratios, the researchers found the size of the ratio in the left hand could indicate the severity of negative symptoms in patients. (A recent study found that schizophrenia isn't actually one disease.)"

Lehmkuhl was elected to the position in 2012, but things have since grown frosty between the city official and the town, with the Contra Costa Times reporting that the 34-year-old was accused of taking no minutes during city council meetings in her entire first year, and instead tweeting her way through them—under a city account, and in a very opinionated way, the city charged. Some residents called for her to step down (she refused, and the San Francisco Chronicle notes that she did later produce minutes for some meetings), and the council in March announced a November ballot item would seek to change the position to an appointed one, reports the AP. The moves, as it turns out, were unnecessary: Lehmkuhl quit on Monday, in fiery fashion, to take a job in Washington, DC. In an email to the mayor and city manager, she wrote that ""this has been an atrocious, incredibly depressing, and mind-numbingly inane experience I would not wish on anyone. I wish the City the best of luck in finding some schmuck eager to transcribe every last misogynistic joke, self-indulgent anecdote, and pathetic pandering attempt by Council.""

The medical advancement is being touted as the first of its kind in the world. It happened last June when doctors in London, Ont., used a functional magnetic resonance imaging machine (fMRI) to analyze brain activity patterns in Scott Routley. Photograph by: Miguel Alvarez , AFP/Getty Images \n \n TORONTO - For more than a decade, Scott Routley has been living in a vegetative state. \n \n He can\'t talk. He can\'t move. And although his eyes are open, no one is sure whether he can see. \n \n But now, for the first time, doctors caring for the 39-year-old London, Ont., man say they know he\'s not in pain. \n \n And they learned it from Routley himself, by analyzing his brain waves when they asked him. \n \n ""This was a landmark moment for us because for the first time, a patient can actually tell us information, important information about how they\'re feeling and their current situation,"" said lead researcher Dr. Adrian Owen on Tuesday. \n \n The medical breakthrough, believed to be the only time a severely brain injured patient has been able to relay clinically relevant information to their doctors, is being touted as a new way to possibly improve their quality of care. \n \n Owen, who is the head of the Brain and Mind Institute at the University of Western Ontario, says research published online last year in The Lancet shows that one in five of these patients are conscious, but essentially trapped in their bodies because they\'re unable to communicate verbally or physically. \n \n His team has been working for the past year trying to determine whether Routley, who became vegetative following a car crash 12 years ago, had any ""residual brain activity"" and how much he was able to understand them. \n \n Last June, the doctors employed a functional magnetic resonance imaging machine (fMRI) to see if they would be able to analyze his brain patterns. \n \n They told Routley that they wanted him to imagine that he was playing tennis if he wasn\'t in pain or imagine that he was walking around his house if he was in pain. \n \n The thought process involved in playing a complex sport like tennis triggers the part of the brain that controls motor skills, while thinking about walking around your house triggers visual associations — contained in a separate area of the brain. \n \n With the fMRI, doctors were able to measure the activity in Routley\'s brain and conclude he was trying to tell them he was free of pain. \n \n Owen says for now, this technology is effective in determining responses to simple yes or no questions but may eventually pave the way for vegetative patients to communicate on a regular basis using a computer-assisted interface. \n \n ""We can use this type of technology to ask them what sort of entertainment they want to be exposed to? Do they want to watch TV or do they want to listen to music? What type of music? What time would they like to be fed... activities of daily living which are entirely under the control of these people around them, the people caring for them,"" he said. \n \n ""We can now ask the patients about these things and give them a role in the decision making that governs their life."" \n \n Neurologist Dr. Bryan Young says Routley\'s family has always been ""convinced"" that he was awake and aware in his state. \n \n He says this technology has the potential to become an instrumental tool for the medical community to assess whether a vegetative patient wants to live or die. \n \n But Young warned that it would only be helpful if there was a reliable test available to determine if the patient was psychologically sound, and able to make and convey their wishes. \n \n ""One has to establish, though, that apart from these simple responses to these simple commands, they are able to think in a deeper and more profound way about their quality of life and their wishes and goals and what they would prefer,"" he said. \n \n Routley, who is currently living at the Parkwood Hospital in London, is among several vegetative Canadian and British patients featured in a documentary airing Tuesday on the BBC.', 'Tom Hanks, Alec Baldwin, Steve Martin, Dan Aykroyd and Chevy Chase were just some of the guest stars that celebrated Timberlake\'s fifth time at the center of the action. \n \n Note: We will post videos as soon as they are made available online. \n \n It almost didn’t matter what happened after Justin Timberlake’s Saturday Night Live opening monologue, because by that time the episode was already the biggest of 2013. \n \n It was the musician-actor’s fifth time hosting, which gave him access to the exclusive “five-timer\'s club.” Timberlake was ushered off the stage and into the inner sanctum, where he encountered a slew of SNL vets who had all hosted or performed as the musical guest at least five times. \n \n PHOTOS: 12 \'SNL\' Sketches Made Into Movies \n \n Paul Simon greeted Timberlake, as did a pipe-smoking Steve Martin, who was a tad suspicious of the club’s new member, scoffing when he learned Timberlake couldn\'t play the banjo. \n \n ""He can\'t do everything,"" Martin remarked.

Shortly after, Candice Bergen appeared to demand the other members put the toilet seat down after using it. \n \n In its cold open SNL took on the death of Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez. Timberlake played Elton John, who tailored “Candle in the Wind"" to fit the late president. Among the salient Chavez moments highlighted included the socialist leader calling President George W.

Better yet, the message delivered by the patient was a great one: I'm not in pain. The Canadian Press and the BBC explain that doctors studied the patient's brain waves as they voiced a command: he should think about playing tennis if he were not in pain or about walking around the house if he were. The activities trigger different parts of the brain—motor skills vs. visual associations—and the man's brain waves suggested he was pain-free.

This time, the White House aide was discussing video the administration shared of the interaction between CNN reporter Jim Acosta and a White House press intern who tried to take a mic away from him during a combative exchange with the president, footage experts have confirmed was altered to speed up the motion of Acosta’s arm. \n \n Host Chris Wallace broached the subject of the now-infamous confrontation first: “I want to ask you about two responses by the White House. First, to tweet a video that was clearly altered to make it look like it was more of a physical confrontation that it really was… And second, to pull Acosta’s pass to get into the White House and to threaten to do that to other reporters.” \n \n “Well, Chris, first of all,” Conway responded, “What do you mean by edited, or as others are saying, ‘doctored video?’ He either put his hands on her and grabbed the mic back or he did not, and he clearly did.” \n \n “The video was altered, and there are experts who have looked at it,” Wallace said. \n \n This is where Conway went into ultimate spin mode. \n \n “By that do you mean sped up? Oh, well that’s not altered, that’s sped up,” she said. “They do it all the time in sports to see if there’s actually a first down or a touchdown, so I have to disagree with the, I think, overwrought description of this video being doctored as if we put somebody else’s arm in there.” \n \n There’s a lot to unpack here. First, let’s consult the dictionary for a definition of “altered.” To alter something means “to make different in some particular, as size, style, course, or the like; modify.” Speeding up a video sure seems to fall under that definition. \n \n Second, sports. It’s blatantly untrue that sports broadcasters speed up footage to show where the ball should be marked or a touchdown. If anything they slow the footage to see it more clearly. But, apparently, in Kellyanne’s world, where up is down, black is white and cats and dogs are besties, sports broadcasts actually speed up plays that they are trying to analyze. \n \n Third, no one is saying they “put somebody else’s arm” in the video. It’s a strawman argument, one of Conway’s favorite tactics. \n \n The exchange between Acosta and the intern, fueled by the White Houses’s mischaracterization of the interaction, has become such a cultural talking point it was parodied on Saturday Night Live, with Cecily Strong playing the determined intern trying to take the mic from Weekend Update host Colin Jost.', 'Play Facebook \n \n Twitter \n \n Embed Underwater Skeleton Party Found By Sheriff\'s Department 1:30 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog \n \n The scene is more ""Weekend at Bernie\'s"" and less Ouija board seance, but two fake skeletons relaxing in armchairs on the bed of the Colorado River initially had Arizona authorities diving to find human remains. \n \n A snorkeler first spotted the skeletons near a boat launch in Cienaga Springs and alerted authorities of possible human remains around 10:00 a.m. on Monday.

The Bahraini authorities must ensure her conviction and prison sentence are quashed. She should not be punished in any way for peacefully exercising her right to freedom of expression.” \n \n Laws that prohibit insults or the disrespect of heads of state or other public officials are contrary to international human rights law and standards. Amnesty International has repeatedly called on the Bahraini authorities to repeal articles in its Penal Code that criminalize freedom of expression. \n \n Zainab Al-Khawaja is the daughter of prominent activist and prisoner of conscience Abdulhadi Al-Khawaja, who is currently serving a life sentence for his peaceful role in anti-government protests in 2011. \n \n In addition to facing a year in prison, she was fined 3,000 BD (nearly $8,000), a sum she may not to be able to afford. If the fine is not paid her prison term will be extended by around a year and a half. \n \n Zainab Al-Khawaja has been arrested and released several times since December 2011 and has previously spent almost a year and a half in prison. \n \n She is also appealing three other convictions against her, including a four-month sentence for two charges of “destroying public property” for ripping up photos of the King of Bahrain in May 2012 and a one-year sentence for “insulting a public officer” after she spoke out to defend another prisoner who was insulted and humiliated by a prison guard in June 2013. The verdicts on the appeal of those convictions will be issued on 3 December. \n \n On 17 November, she will appeal a nine-month sentence related to ""entering a restricted area"" and ""insulting a public official"", when she sought to visit her father who was on hunger strike in Jaw prison in August 2014. \n \n Zainab Al-Khawaja is one of several human rights or political activists in Bahrain recently imprisoned for peacefully expressing their opinion. \n \n “The Bahraini authorities’ persistent persecution of human rights activists and other government critics is a glaring example of their abject failure to deliver on promised reforms. To prove they are serious about upholding human rights, they need to immediately and unconditionally release all prisoners detained in Bahrain solely for peacefully expressing their views,” said James Lynch.', 'ALLENTOWN, Pa. - The Lehigh County Humane Society has come to the rescue of 71 beagles.

128,"['Some consular staff of the real US Embassy in Ghana would be sacked after security officials discovered and shut down a fake Embassy that has been operating for 10 years and issuing genuine US visas in the country at a cost of $6000. \n \n Genuine visas can only be issued when there is an inside job. \n \n The fake embassy also reportedly issued visas to other European countries, as well as counterfeit documents. \n \n It is not clear when the criminals were busted but the information was posted on the Department of State’s website on November 2, 2016, the news however, went viral only after ghanabusinessnews.com broke it Friday evening December 2. \n \n While US Embassy officials won’t comment because they say investigation of the matter is ongoing, ghanabusinessnews.com can say on authority that some staff of the consular section would be fired. \n \n A source familiar with Department of State processes told ghanabusinessnews.com that employees found culpable in the crime would simply be recalled and no reasons would be assigned, and Embassy staff wouldn’t even know about it. \n \n It appears that’s how diplomatic missions handle offences by staff. Ghanabusinessnews.com is familiar with a similar incident at the Embassy of a European country in Ghana. There was a visa scandal at this Embassy in 2012, and the Ambassador was quietly recalled, and no reason was assigned. Some staff didn’t even know why. \n \n A source who wasn’t authorized to speak to the media told ghanabusinessnews.com that employees at the said Embassy apparently were engaged in illegal issuance of visas, and the travellers were arrested at the country’s entry point. The travellers were caught because that country had joined a new visa system, and had changed its visas. But these travellers had the visa from the old system. \n \n In an unprecedented move in 2006, Switzerland recalled its entire diplomatic staff including the ambassador from its Karachi mission when it was discovered that there was a massive visa fraud in its Islamabad Embassy, and visas for Pakistanis were halted at that time. \n \n The fake US Embassy operating somewhere in Accra, was issuing genuine visas, the security team that closed it down said. They also found that a Ghanaian immigration lawyer working with some Turkish and other Ghanaian citizens was involved with the active connivance of Ghana law enforcement officers, who were apparently bribed to look the other way. \n \n Visa acquisition in Ghana \n \n Applying for visas in Ghana is a dreadful experience for any prospective traveller. The consular sections of almost all Embassies demand for proofs like birth certificate, bank statements, invitation letters, some with additional photocopies of hosts, and in some instances even their bank statements. \n \n After providing all these, the Embassies demand that prospective travellers submit their applications in person and in most cases go through an interview, and yet many known qualified prospective travellers with no intention of remaining in these countries are denied visas. \n \n There was a famous case of a medical professional that was invited to present a paper at a conference in Spain but was denied visa on the flimsy excuse that he didn’t satisfy the conditions for a visa, which in most cases means that the applicant is not likely to return to Ghana. \n \n This medical expert then responded by writing a copious open letter to the Spanish Embassy in Ghana. \n \n Connection men \n \n Due to the frustrating experience in acquiring a visa to travel, especially to Europe and the US, the phenomena of connection men has sprung up. While anyone familiar with visa issuance processes would disbelieve the effectiveness of these connection men to whom prospective travellers pay huge sums of money for visas, these incidents of the fake US Embassy and the example of the European country’s embassy in Ghana emphatically confirm that insiders work with these connection men to issue visas. \n \n Human trafficking \n \n This fake US Embassy that operated for 10 years, which category of travellers was it serving? Could they have issued visas to human traffickers? Because $6000 is a colossal amount that very few ordinary travellers can afford. It would therefore, not be out of place to assume that most of the clients of this criminal gang were human traffickers. \n \n The crime of human trafficking is a lucrative illegal business generating an amount of $150 billion every year for traffickers. \n \n By Emmanuel K.

(Courtesy of the State Department) \n \n For a decade, an American flag flew outside a battered pink building in Ghana’s capital city, welcoming out-of-town visitors who, once inside, found a photo of President Obama hanging on the wall. Signs confirmed to travelers — who had been bused in from the most remote parts of West Africa — that they had arrived at the U.S. Embassy in Accra. \n \n The “consular officers” working there were not Americans, but they spoke English and Dutch and issued official-looking visas and identification papers. They charged their customers $6,000. \n \n Billboards and fliers advertised the official services. \n \n But there was nothing official about them. The real U.S. Embassy in Accra is white, not pink, and it sits on a large piece of land inside security fences in one of the city’s wealthiest neighborhoods. \n \n The battered building with the flag and Obama picture was a fake — ran by Ghanaian and Turkish organized crime rings and a Ghanaian lawyer practicing immigration and criminal law, the State Department said in a statement. \n \n “For about a decade it operated unhindered,” the statement said. “The criminals running the operation were able to pay off corrupt officials to look the other way, as well as obtain legitimate blank documents to be doctored.” \n \n Officials said they shut down the fraudulent operation during the summer after an informant tipped off the assistant investigator for the Regional Security Office. The investigation in Ghana stemmed from a larger State Department initiative, Operation Spartan Vanguard, which was created by the RSO to “address trafficking and fraud plaguing the U.S. Embassy and the region,” according to the statement. \n \n \n \n The real U.S. Embassy in Ghana. (Courtesy of the State Department) \n \n The State Department released information about the investigation Nov. 2, but the news is being widely reported only now. The story seems to have been first reported by Ghanaian media last week, and it cites the statement from one month ago on the State Department website. The information was not contained in a news release from the State Department or its Bureau of Diplomatic Security, but in a “behind the scenes” article written by diplomatic security staff. \n \n In it, officials did not say how many people, if any, may have entered the United States illegally with documentation from the fake embassy or how the crime ring got hold of what the state department called “fraudulently obtained, legitimate U.S. visas.” \n \n State Department officials in Ghana deferred questions to the media office in Washington, which did not immediately respond to a request for more information. \n \n The sham embassy, authorities said, did not allow walk-in appointments but instead recruited customers from remote parts of West Africa and even targeted people in the neighboring countries of Ivory Coast and Togo with billboards and fliers. They would shuttle customers to Accra, rent them rooms in a nearby hotel and then shuttle them to the fake embassy, which only operated on Monday, Tuesday and Friday, from 7:30 a.m. to noon. \n \n The Turkish citizens posing as “consulate officers,” officials said, issued U.S. work visas, counterfeit visas and false Ghanaian identification papers, such as bank and education records and birth certificates. \n \n \n \n Fake passports and documentation obtained in the raids. (Courtesy of the U.S. State Department) \n \n The RSO investigator, with officers from the Ghana Police Force, verified the initial informant tip and then formed an international task force that included the Ghana Detective Bureau, Ghana SWAT and Canadian Embassy officials. \n \n They exposed the shabby pink building as the crime ring’s central hub and discovered two other locations — a dress shop and an apartment building — that were satellite operators. \n \n A raid at the dress shop derailed the investigation when the “corrupt Ghanaian attorney” lied to local police, officials said, telling law enforcement they could not enter the shop because it was involved in a different court case. \n \n That court case, though, did not exist — it was a decoy meant to buy time for “corrupt officials” to find money and bail out of jail members of the crime ring, officials said. The group then moved the document-production facility — including a purported industrial sewing machine that bound the fake passports — outside Accra and exported the fraudulent documents from the dress shop to Europe and other parts of Africa. \n \n “Several suspects” were arrested during the raids, State Department officials said, but they did not specify how many. Warrants have been issued for the suspects who escaped and Ghanaian police plan to pursue them. Officials said the investigation is ongoing. \n \n Evidence collected during the raids included a laptop computer, smartphones, counterfeit-identity documents, 150 passports from 10 countries, and legitimate and counterfeit visas from the United States, the Schengen area of Europe, India and South Africa. \n \n The creation of fraudulent documents has decreased by 70 percent since Operation Spartan Vanguard commenced, officials said, but called this “only the beginning.” \n \n In Africa, many people seek visas for Western countries such as the United States, making production of fake documents at steep prices a profitable business model for crime rings, Reuters reported. \n \n Similar operations have been busted in Accra, including one in January that had been making and selling fake documents for 13 years. In that investigation, authorities found 190 passports, three printers, one camera, 75 different rubber stamps, two lamination machines and a laptop, Modern Ghana reported.

It wasn’t the U.S. Embassy, however. \n \n It was not operated by the United States government, but by figures from both Ghanaian and Turkish organized crime rings and a Ghanaian attorney practicing immigration and criminal law. The ""consular officers"" were Turkish citizens who spoke English and Dutch. \n \n \n \n One of several buildings used by the disrupted fraud ring in Accra, Ghana. (U.S. Department of State photo) \n \n For about a decade it operated unhindered; the criminals running the operation were able to pay off corrupt officials to look the other way, as well as obtain legitimate blank local documents to be doctored or counterfeited. \n \n This past summer the assistant regional security officer investigator (ARSO-I) at the real U.S. Embassy in Accra, in cooperation with the Ghana Police Force, Ghana Detectives Bureau, and other international partners, shut down this “fake embassy.” \n \n \n \n Exterior of the legitimate U.S. Embassy in Accra, Ghana (U.S. Department of State photo) \n \n This investigation is a small part of the broader “Operation Spartan Vanguard"" initiative. ""Operation Spartan Vanguard"" was developed by Diplomatic Security agents in the Regional Security Office (RSO) at U.S. Embassy Ghana in order to address trafficking and fraud plaguing the U.S. Embassy and the region. \n \n During the course of another fraud investigation in ""Operation Spartan Vanguard"" an informant tipped off the ARSO-I about the fraudulent document operation, as well as a fake Netherlands embassy operating in Accra. \n \n After receiving the tip, the ARSO-I, who is the point person in the RSO shop for ""Operation Spartan Vanguard"" investigations, verified the information with partners within the Ghanaian Police Force. The ARSO-I then created an international task force composed of the aforementioned Ghana Police Force, as well as the Ghana Detective Bureau, Ghana SWAT, and officials from the Canadian Embassy to investigate further. \n \n The investigation identified the main architects of the criminal operation and several satellite locations (including a dress shop and an apartment building) used for operations. The “fake embassy” did not accept walk-in visa appointments; instead, they drove to the most remote parts of West Africa to find customers, advertising their services through flyers and billboards to cultivate customers from Ghana, Cote d\'Ivoire, and Togo. They would shuttle the customers to Accra, and rent them a room at a hotel nearby. The Ghanaian organized crime ring would shuttle the victims to and from the fake embassies. Locating the document vendor within the group led investigators to uncover the satellite locations and key players. \n \n When the task force conducted raids, they arrested several suspects and collected evidence that included a laptop computer; cell smart phones; counterfeit identity documents; and 150 lost, stolen, or purchased passports from 10 countries. A small number of these passports contained expired U.S. visas. The criminals would either chemically wash and doctor expired visas or use them as a blueprint in an attempt to create counterfeit visa foils. The fraud ring sold these expired and counterfeit visas and other false identification documents (including bank records, education records, birth certificates, and others) for a cost of $6,000. \n \n The dress shop acted as both a front for the operation—it was open to the general public for alterations and the purchase of dresses—as well as housing some of the document production. It was purported to house an industrial sewing machine they would use to re-create the binding on the fake passports. \n \n During the raid on the dress shop the corrupt Ghanaian attorney lied to Ghanaian detectives by telling them they were not allowed to access the shop because it was involved in an additional court case. \n \n The ""additional court case"" was determined to be fallacious, but it bought enough time for corrupt officials to arrange for bail for members of the organized crime group so that they could move the document production facility outside of Accra. Many of the documents also were exported elsewhere in Africa and to Europe through the dress shop. \n \n Several suspects remain at large, but Ghanaian police have warrants for their arrest and plan to pursue them. The investigation and search for the Turkish organized crime group is ongoing. \n \n After the operation was complete, both Interpol and the Bureau of Consular Affairs were sent the information collected to enter into their databases. At the request of the Ghana Police, DS Computer Forensic Lab will be assisting with forensic evaluation of the computer equipment seized in the operation. \n \n Successful interagency operations like this are an essential part of investigating and stopping the well-connected criminal networks perpetrating passport and visa fraud. The regional security officer in Ghana reports that as a result of this and other raids in “Operation Spartan Vanguard,” the export of fraudulent documents have decreased by 70 percent in West Africa, criminal leaders no longer have the political cover they once had, and multiple other investigative avenues have opened to DS and other law enforcement partners, and this is only the beginning.', 'Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC\'s Jim Muir says unverified footage purports to show the aftermath of an attack on a funeral procession \n \n Syrian troops have been mobilised in a drive to oust armed rebels from parts of Damascus, a day after a bomb attack that killed three top regime figures. \n \n Tanks, artillery and helicopters have been deployed and clashes reported south-west and north-east of the city. \n \n In a first public appearance since the bomb, President Assad was shown on TV swearing in the new defence minister. \n \n Russia and China have vetoed a UN Security Council resolution calling for tougher sanctions on Syria. \n \n Under the Western-backed plan, the Damascus government would have been threatened with non-military sanctions under Chapter 7 of the UN Charter if it failed to move troops and heavy weapons from populated areas. \n \n It is the third time that Moscow and Beijing have vetoed sanctions against Syria. \n \n With sporadic battles breaking out for control of Damascus, international envoy Kofi Annan has pushed the international community to take urgent and decisive action. \n \n The Security Council must also decide whether to renew the mandate of a UN mission in Syria, due to end on Friday. \n \n The whole city is shaken.

What wasn't fake: the US visas they got their hands on and doled out for the past decade. ""The criminals running the operation were able to pay off corrupt officials to look the other way, as well as obtain legitimate blank documents to be doctored,"" the US State Department said in a Nov. 2 statement (per the Washington Post, the news is only being widely reported now). A visa could be had for $6,000 from ""consular officers"" who were really Turkish citizens speaking English and Dutch; customers could also get other documents, including phony birth certificates and bank statements. The ""embassy,"" only open three days a week, advertised itself on billboards and in fliers in Ghana and other West African countries. The process of obtaining a visa legally in Ghana is a ""dreadful experience,"" per the Ghana Business News, which is how these con operations flourish. This initiative was discovered after an informant tipped off an investigator involved in a larger trafficking and fraud probe in the area; the fraudulent business was shuttered over the summer. Officials aren't saying how workers acquired the real US visas, or how many people were actually able to enter the US using them or other fake paperwork.

129,"[""Fifteen-year-old Kenneth Shinozuka of New York City won the $50,000 Scientific American Science in Action Award in August for his invention of a wearable sensor for Alzheimer's patients. The prize, part of the Google Science Fair, recognizes a teen for an innovation that can make a practical difference by addressing an environmental, health or resources challenge. \n \n Shinozuka's creation—a small pressure sensor that can be attached to a foot or a sock—notifies caregivers via their smartphones if a patient who should be sleeping gets out of bed. His grandfather, who has Alzheimer's disease, served as inspiration. “I don't think I will ever forget my shock at seeing Grandfather in his pajamas, accompanied by a policeman who found him wandering on a nearby freeway in the middle of the night,” Shinozuka says. He designed the sensor to keep his grandfather safe and to provide much needed relief to his aunt, the primary caregiver. Shinozuka recently demonstrated the technology at a local chapter of the Alzheimer's Association and a number of care facilities. He has obtained a U.S. patent for his invention."", 'Existing technologies did not provide a solution to my problem. For instance, widely used GPS tracking devices do not work indoors. More recent real-time locating systems based on radio-frequency (RF) ID tags are neither accurate nor quick enough to detect patients’ leaving bed. Initially, I considered attaching pressure sensors to the legs of a bed, but the system would be expensive and could trigger a false alarm from my grandmother, who was sleeping on the same bed as my grandfather. \n \n One night, I was looking after my grandfather and saw him step out of bed. The moment his foot landed on the floor, a light bulb flashed in my head. Why don’t I put a pressure sensor on the heel of his foot? The moment he steps onto the floor, the sensor would detect the pressure caused by his body weight, and the signal could wirelessly trigger an audible alert in my aunt’s Smartphone. This would enable my aunt to sleep much better at night without worrying about Grandfather. \n \n I immediately put down my thoughts in a sketch (Fig. 1) and started research. First, I had to find a pressure sensor that was thin and flexible enough not to affect the comfort of walking. An extensive literature search led me to a film sensor printed with pressure-sensitive ink. When pressure is applied, the ink becomes more electrically conductive. The pressure can thus be calculated by measuring the conductivity. I also thought about creating a sensor out of conductive rubber, but found it difficult to make such a sensor thin enough after testing material samples. \n \n My second challenge was designing a wearable circuit to acquire signal from the pressure sensor and wirelessly trigger an alert in a remote Smartphone when the pressure exceeds a certain threshold. The circuit needed to be compact, lightweight and human-friendly. However, the energy-consuming wireless transmission requires large, heavy batteries. A search of state-of-the-art wireless systems led me to Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), a rapidly-evolving, revolutionary wireless technology that has recently enabled the creation of many novel wearable systems. Implementing BLE required a significant amount of expertise, which I had to acquire through extensive studying and testing of BLE modules. After months of research, I was able to design a circuit that would integrate such a module with my film sensor and be powered by a coin battery. \n \n In addition, I needed to design apps to transform a Smartphone into a caretaker’s monitor. I took online courses and tutorials to learn coding for the most widely-used Android and iOS phones. With the help of a mentor, I deepened my knowledge about the core Bluetooth framework, which enabled me to establish communications between the BLE circuit and Smartphone while minimizing energy consumption. \n \n This research convinced me of the feasibility of my proposed wearable sensor system, thanks to the recent advances in Smartphones and BLE wireless technologies. I made a one-year project plan with five major tasks to realize my proposed sensor system (Table 1).', 'Ο χρήστης Donald J.

If that patient gets out of bed, his or her caretaker is alerted via smartphone, Scientific American reports. Shinozuka has won the magazine's $50,000 Science in Action Award for the device via Google's Science Fair. ""My grandfather is one of the 5.2 million Alzheimer’s patients in the U.S., 65% of whom wander,"" the teen writes at the Science Fair's site. His research shows the invention works: ""A six-month trial on my grandfather validated my hypothesis: the systems detected 100% of the 437 known cases of his wandering and issued alerts within one second of his stepping out of bed."" As for future plans, he's been testing the device on other patients, and he tells NBC News that he hopes it ""will ultimately reach out to the tens of millions of wandering patients around the world and also relieve the burdens on their caregivers.""

Will you be O.K. if I take the reporting to this magazine?’” Mr. Oppenheim said. “And we granted him permission to do so.” \n \n Soon after that mid-August conversation, however, Mr. Farrow, whom NBC described as a nonexclusive contributor, requested the use of an NBC camera crew for the interview in Los Angeles. That request seemed to suggest that he was open to staying on the story for the network. Mr. Oppenheim shot down the request, severing the network’s relationship with the reporter. \n \n Mr. Oppenheim recalled the conversation: “We said: ‘You’ve asked for permission to go elsewhere. You can’t use an NBC camera crew for another outlet. You can do whatever you want to do. And you don’t work for us.’” \n \n Mr. Farrow implied that the network had mishandled his work during an appearance on Rachel Maddow’s MSNBC program that aired shortly after the publication of his first Weinstein article. “I walked into the door at The New Yorker with an explosively reportable piece that should have been public earlier,” he said. \n \n On Twitter last fall, Mr. Farrow praised Mr. McHugh, saying he had “refused to bow to pressure to stop, through numerous shoots, even when it meant risking his job.” He also called him an “unsung hero of this entire story.”', 'The producer who worked alongside Ronan Farrow at NBC News on his Harvey Weinstein investigation quit in protest earlier this month. \n \n Rich McHugh tendered his resignation on Friday, Aug. 17, a year to the day that the Weinstein story left with Farrow. Since then, Farrow has won a Pulitzer Prize for a series of articles that revealed allegations of sexual harassment and assault—and questions have lingered about why the network gave up on the story that helped launch the #MeToo movement. \n \n NBC News has long insisted the Weinstein exposé wasn’t ready to run on air or online, contrary to Farrow’s claims that it was. Farrow’s story, which ultimately ran in The New Yorker, was part of a series that ultimately won the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service, earned him in the prestigious George Polk Award for National Reporting, and garnered near-universal praise from his colleagues. \n \n The Daily Beast has uncovered new details of how the process went awry, including alleged threats from NBC, back-biting inside the network about who was truly responsible, and a previously unreported ultimatum by Weinstein’s attorneys. \n \n According to multiple sources familiar with the matter, NBCUniversal deputy general counsel Susan Weiner made a series of phone calls to Farrow, threatening to smear him if he continued to report on Weinstein. \n \n A spokesperson for NBC News, speaking on the condition of anonymity, vigorously denied those allegations. “Absolutely false,” the spokesperson told The Daily Beast. “There’s no truth to that all. There is no chance, in no version of the world, that Susan Weiner would tell Ronan Farrow what he could or could not report on. \n \n “The sole point of the Susan Weiner’s conversation with Farrow, roughly a month after he had left NBC, was to make sure he wasn’t still telling sources that he was working on the story for NBC since he had moved on to The New Yorker.” \n \n In February 2015, Farrow lost his daytime show on MSNBC and began working with NBC News’ investigative unit. In November 2016, Farrow and a producer named Rich McHugh decided they wanted to do a story about Hollywood’s “casting couch,” the longtime practice of producers and other powerful men exchanging sex with women for film roles, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter. The story was timed to be released around the Academy Awards, these sources said. \n \n They presented the idea to NBC News President Noah Oppenheim, who suggested the team look into a October 2016 tweet by actress Rose McGowan that she was raped by a Hollywood executive, according to two sources with knowledge of the investigation. \n \n Over the next several months, Farrow collected evidence that suggested Weinstein had a pattern of inappropriate behavior toward women, according to the sources and previous reporting by The Daily Beast, HuffPost, and The New York Times. Weinstein has repeatedly denied all allegations of non-consensual sex. Sources familiar with the matter previously told The Daily Beast that at least eight women accusing Weinstein had agreed to go on camera, including two alleged victims with their names and faces. \n \n In an interview with The New York Times published Thursday night, McHugh accused “the very highest levels of NBC” of later stopping the reporting. \n \n “There was not one single victim or witness to misconduct by Harvey Weinstein who was willing to go on the record. Not one,” the spokesperson told The Daily Beast. \n \n By February, according to the sources, Farrow had secured an on-the-record interview with McGowan in which the actress said she had been sexually harassed by a powerful producer, though she did not name Weinstein. (McGowan subsequently named Weinstein during the NBC investigation, according to a source with knowledge of the story, but reportedly pulled her interview after being legally threatened by Weinstein, who had reached a $100,000 settlement with her in 1997 after she accused him of sexual assault.) \n \n Farrow and McHugh also obtained a bombshell audio recording from a NYPD sting in which Weinstein admitted to groping Filipina-Italian model Ambra Battilana Gutierrez in 2015. (The Battilana audio was subsequently published by The New Yorker.) \n \n “The tape on its own was color, it added to an already known accusation,” an NBC spokesperson said. While it was “absolutely significant” to hear Battilana’s voice, the spokesperson said, the tape alone would not expose Weinstein as serial sexual predator, as has been alleged. \n \n NBC’s reluctance stoked Farrow and McHugh’s concerns about NBC’s commitment to the story, the sources said. Farrow did not respond to a request for comment. Ari Wilkenfeld, McHugh’s attorney, told The Daily Beast that his client “has no comment.” \n \n In spring 2017, according to the sources, Farrow played Oppenheim the audio of Weinstein with Battilana admitting that he was “used to” groping women’s breasts. At one point during their meeting, according to two sources, Oppenheim had asked if people still cared about Weinstein. \n \n “ Farrow played Oppenheim the audio of Weinstein with Battilana admitting that he was ‘used to’ groping women’s breasts. According to two sources, Oppenheim asked if people still cared about Weinstein. ” \n \n “That is absolutely false,” a NBC spokesperson said, “and it is clearly contradicted by the fact that Oppenheim assigned the story on Harvey Weinstein in the first place. Obviously he understood him to be and believed him to be a newsworthy figure.” \n \n Farrow had begun to suspect that Oppenheim—who moonlighted as a Hollywood screenwriter—was potentially communicating with Weinstein directly about the story, according to the sources. \n \n During a meeting in summer 2017, Oppenheim mentioned to Farrow that Weinstein had raised objections to Farrow’s reporting—even though Farrow had not yet asked Weinstein to comment on the allegations, according to individuals briefed on the meeting. \n \n “Externally, I had Weinstein associates calling me repeatedly,” McHugh told the Times. “I knew that Weinstein was calling NBC executives directly. One time it even happened when we were in the room.” \n \n HuffPost reported last year that Oppenheim had relayed concerns from Weinstein’s lawyers that Farrow could not report the story because the producer had worked with his estranged father, director Woody Allen. “No, absolutely not, and Noah Oppenheim never had a conversation with Harvey Weinstein about the content of NBC News’ investigation,” the network spokesperson said. \n \n By August 2017, Farrow was prepared to fly to California to interview a woman who was going to claim in silhouette on camera that Weinstein had raped her, according to the sources. Farrow wanted to publish this interview and what he had already gathered, but network higher-ups said he needed more and would not allow Farrow to use an NBC News crew for the interview, according to a person familiar with the matter. \n \n “Three days before Ronan and I were going to head to L.A. to interview a woman with a credible rape allegation against Harvey Weinstein,” McHugh told the Times, “I was ordered to stop, not to interview this woman. And to stand down on the story altogether.” \n \n In an interview with the Times, Oppenheim recalled telling Farrow, “You can’t use an NBC camera crew for another outlet. You can do whatever you want to do. And you don’t work for us.” \n \n Farrow went ahead with the interview anyway, paying for a camera crew out of his own pocket, according to sources. \n \n “The reason the reporting stopped here is because Ronan asked to take it elsewhere because NBC News’ determination at the time was that you don’t have it yet,” the network spokesperson told The Daily Beast. \n \n Dejected, Farrow approached longtime New Yorker media writer Ken Auletta seeking advice about what to do with his reporting and where to take the story. Farrow had interviewed Auletta, who had twice previously attempted to report news about Weinstein’s alleged behavior, for the NBC story the previous month. Auletta suggested bringing the story to The New Yorker and called Editor in Chief David Remnick, who accepted the idea. \n \n According to multiple sources, Weinstein attorney Charles Harder claimed in legal threats to Farrow and others that NBC News gave them written assurances that Farrow would not use any reporting he obtained about Weinstein during his time at the network. Harder did not respond to The Daily Beast’s request for comment. \n \n “We immediately were clear with Weinstein’s legal team that we disputed the characterizations,” the NBC spokesperson told The Daily Beast. \n \n Despite letters from Weinstein’s attorneys, Farrow and The New Yorker decided to press on and eventually published the piece just days after The New York Times released its own bombshell report about Weinstein’s history of alleged sexual misconduct and the use of settlements and nondisclosure agreements to silence accusers. \n \n Immediately after Farrow published his bombshell at The New Yorker, top figures at NBC began pointing fingers at each other, two sources said. \n \n While Oppenheim told staffers at a division-wide town hall meeting that he took responsibility for the decision to let the story go, he privately told at least one colleague that NBC News Chairman Andrew Lack and Senior Communications Vice President Mark Kornblau had made him a scapegoat. \n \n “He said to me, ‘It wasn’t my decision,’” said the colleague who spoke to Oppenheim after Farrow’s story was published at The New Yorker. “‘Mark Kornblau and Andy Lack are trying to throw me under the bus when it was Andy’s decision,’” the colleague recalled Oppenheim saying. \n \n “This conversation is made up out of whole cloth, never happened. There is no daylight between Andy and Noah,” the spokesperson said. \n \n While multiple higher-ups at NBC have repeatedly attempted to dismiss criticism of the network’s failure to publish the Weinstein story, questions about NBC’s decision are likely to cause more headaches in the coming months. \n \n Earlier this year, publisher Little, Brown announced it was publishing a book by Farrow entitled Catch & Kill, in which he is expected to share his recollection of NBC’s decisions around the Weinstein story and report more broadly on the conspiracy of silence that protects powerful men. \n \n — with additional reporting by Lloyd Grove \n \n Correction: A previous version of this article misstated Weiner’s title.

After the election of Donald Trump, that legacy was no longer secure and Ta-Nehisi Coates started thinking about the Obama years in a different way. His new piece in The Atlantic is called ""My President Was Black: A History Of The First African-American White House And Of What Came Next."" Coates told me that in some ways Barack Obama was naive about the role race would play in his presidency and the election of Donald Trump. \n \n TA-NEHISI COATES: I think President Obama deeply underestimated the force of white supremacy in American life. I want to be really, really clear about this. It doesn\'t mean that everyone or even the majority of people who voted for Donald Trump are racist or white supremacists or anything like that. But what it means is that it\'s not a mistake that Trump began his campaign with birthersism (ph). \n \n That\'s not an accident that he didn\'t begin with, say, trade or jobs or anything, that he actually began by otherizing (ph) the first African-American president of the United States. And from that, you know, went on to, you know, otherize Muslims, otherize Latinos, otherize women (laughter), you know, that he built out from that. And it can be true that a unique, you know, individual like Barack Obama can succeed in spite of that and still be the case that that force is quite, quite strong. \n \n MARTIN: Is his misreading, as you say, of the power of certain racist tendencies in our culture, how much of that had to do with who Barack Obama is at his core? You say he is an unfailing optimist. \n \n COATES: Yeah, I think there\'s a sort of, you know, very thin way of reading this that says, well, Barack Obama is biracial thus that gives him some understanding of both white America and black America, but that\'s not really it. What it is is that Barack Obama was raised by a white mother and two white grandparents who, A, told him he was black and that there was nothing wrong with being black. He grew up in Hawaii, far, far removed from the most, you know, sort of violent, you know, tendencies of Jim Crow and segregation. He wasn\'t directly exposed to that. He was untraumatized. \n \n And so that gave him a kind of optimism, an ability to see things, you know, and frankly, an ability to trust, you know, in his fellow, you know, white countrymen in a way that I, for instance, you know, and the vast majority of black people I know never really could. The same time I think that ultimately led him to underestimate some of the difficulties that he would face. \n \n MARTIN: Was the big achievement just winning the White House? \n \n COATES: No. That was an achievement, but as an African-American, I think the symbolism is in how he conducted himself. The symbolism was in - and this sounds really, really small, but it\'s actually big for African-Americans - the symbolism was not in being an embarrassment, but to being a figure that folks were actually proud of. \n \n MARTIN: At the same time, you\'ve been critical of the president. \n \n COATES: I have, yes. \n \n MARTIN: In particular in how he has directed what you could describe as patronizing remarks to African-American communities. \n \n COATES: Yeah, I think so. I think so. You know, part of that is ordinary African-Americans, you know, you come out of your house and you see the conditions in your neighborhood and you see, you know, folks in your neighborhood doing certain things that, you know, are irresponsible. You know, the thing I always think about, you get up early in the morning to go to work and there\'s, you know, some dude outside drinking and you come home and the same dude is outside drinking hanging on the corner. And then this engenders a level of anger I think and, you know, and a level of shame, you know. \n \n My mom used to tell me, you know - I can\'t use this phrase on the radio - but basically don\'t be one of those dudes hanging on the corner. And I think the president adopted some of that same language, but took it into the White House. And I think, like, there\'s a crucial difference between being, you know, Joe Schmo in the neighborhood and being the head, you know, of the government that, you know, in many ways is largely responsible for those conditions in the first place. \n \n MARTIN: According to the most recent exit polling, 8 percent of African-Americans voted for Donald Trump. For those African-Americans who voted for Donald Trump, were they disavowing the presidency of Barack Obama and his legacy? \n \n COATES: I don\'t know, but I would flip this the other way and say over 90 percent of African-Americans voted against Donald Trump. Any time you have, you know, upwards of 90 percent of a demographic voting against somebody, that\'s a statement. \n \n MARTIN: What was your most recent conversation with Barack Obama like? \n \n COATES: It was a week after Donald Trump had won. And initially he was still optimistic. He felt that things would be OK ultimately. And I have to tell you, this is the area where, you know, I see, you know, some degree of contradiction. I mean, the president, you know, at one point when he was campaigning said (laughter) I believe that Donald Trump was not qualified to run a 7-Eleven. I don\'t know how you bridge that contradiction, but I felt that he was sincere. It didn\'t feel like a line to me. You know, it felt like him reverting back to what was in his bones and that\'s, you know, optimism and a deep belief in, you know, American institutions and the American people. \n \n MARTIN: Ta-Nehisi Coates is a national correspondent for The Atlantic. His cover story ""My President Was Black"" is out today. Ta-Nehisi, thanks so much. \n \n COATES: Thanks so much for having me. \n \n Copyright © 2016 NPR. All rights reserved.

Farrow said the network dropped the story, and when initially asked why, he said, ""You would have to ask NBC and NBC executives about the details."" Now, those details may be emerging, at least via a former producer with the network who spoke to the New York Times and via the Daily Beast's sources. NBC News very vocally denies the new claim that it tried to kill the story, and Farrow had no comment. The Beast lays out a timeline dating to November 2016, when Farrow and producer Rich McHugh decided to report on Hollywood's infamous ""casting couch"" and were reportedly advised by NBC News President Noah Oppenheim to look into Rose McGowan's October 2016 tweet about rape at the hands of a Hollywood exec."

The disease is easier to control there than at lower altitudes where it has already established. \n \n According to the latest estimates from the World Health Organization, there were about 207 million cases of malaria in 2012 and an estimated 627,000 deaths.

Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) admitted to “CBS Evening News.” Flake is running for an open Senate seat in the Grand Canyon State. \n \n The rise of big-dollar super PACs has also injected another, more unpredictable element into these races. These outside groups, which are allied with but not controlled by the Democratic or Republican parties, can engage in some of the most negative onslaughts while allowing the candidates to keep their hands clean. Super PACs such as Crossroads GPS and Majority PAC are dumping millions of dollars into TV ad campaigns leading up to Nov. 6. \n \n With control of the Senate up for grabs, the stakes couldn’t be higher. Republicans need a net gain of at least four seats to win the majority — three if Republican challenger Mitt Romney wins the White House — and the outcome has enormous implications for the ability of the next president to push his agenda through Congress. \n \n Heading into Election Day, Democrats are favored to keep control of the Senate, but the GOP still has hope with polls showing that a host of races remain exceedingly tight, including in Montana, Wisconsin, Indiana, Nevada, North Dakota, Virginia, Arizona and Massachusetts. \n \n So as the candidates try to get some separation in the polls, it should come as little surprise that some of the hottest races in the land have turned into backbiting affairs. \n \n In Nevada, Republican Sen.

In areas like the highlands of Colombia and Ethiopia, people have never been exposed to malaria, making them especially vulnerable to the spread of the disease. ""We have estimated that, based on the distribution of malaria with altitude, a 1C rise in temperature could lead to an additional three million cases in under-15-year-olds per year,"" one of the researchers warns.

132,"['WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is cutting off U.S. funding to the United Nations agency for reproductive health under an abortion-related provision in a law that Democratic and Republican administrations have used as a cudgel in the global culture wars. \n \n The U.N. Population Fund will lose $32.5 million in funding from the 2017 budget, the State Department said, with funds shifted to similar programs at the U.S. Agency for International Development. The administration accused the agency, through its work with China\'s government, of supporting population control programs in China that include coercive abortion. \n \n It wasn\'t immediately clear whether the U.N. fund would also lose out on tens of millions of additional dollars it has typically received from the U.S. in ""non-core"" funds. \n \n By halting assistance to the U.N. Population Fund, the Trump administration is following through on promises to let socially conservative policies that President Donald Trump embraced in his campaign determine the way the U.S. government operates and conducts itself in the world. Though focused on forced abortion — a concept opposed by liberals and conservatives alike — the move to invoke the ""Kemp-Kasten amendment"" was sure to be perceived as a gesture to anti-abortion advocates and other conservative interests. \n \n The policy change comes days before Trump is set to host Chinese President Xi Jinping for a highly anticipated meeting at Trump\'s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. In a shift from President Barack Obama\'s approach, Trump has avoided elevating human rights concerns in diplomacy, with White House officials saying those issues are most effectively advanced by raising them with foreign leaders in private. \n \n Rep. Eliot Engel, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, called it a ""grave error"" that sent a dangerous message about the administration\'s policies toward women. He predicted women and girls ""will suffer."" \n \n ""Donald Trump should put the health and dignity of women ahead of political points and reverse this decision immediately,"" said Engel, D-N.Y. \n \n Under a three-decade-old law, the U.S. is barred from funding organizations that aid or participate in forced abortion of involuntary sterilization. It\'s up to each administration to determine which organizations meet that condition. The U.N. Population Fund has typically been cut off by Republican presidents and restored when Democrats control the White House. \n \n In a lengthy memorandum obtained by The Associated Press, the State Department said the U.N. fund partners with China\'s National Health and Family Planning Commission, responsible for overseeing China\'s ""two-child policy."" It said the U.N. collaborates with the Chinese agency on family planning. Still, the memo acknowledged there was no evidence of U.N. support for forced abortions or sterilization in China. \n \n The U.N. Population Fund, known as UNFPA, said it regretted the U.S. move and argued it was ""erroneous"" to suggest it was complicit in China\'s policies. \n \n ""UNFPA refutes this claim, as all of its work promotes the human rights of individuals and couples to make their own decisions, free of coercion or discrimination,"" the agency said in a statement. \n \n Starting in 1979, China had a ""one-child policy"" enforced in many cases with state-mandated abortions. But the policy was eased over the years, and now allows married couples to have two children, in a nod to the aging population in the world\'s most populous country. \n \n The designation was the latest move by the Trump administration to prioritize traditionally conservative issues in the federal budget. The Trump administration has vowed to cut all dollars for climate change programming, and also restored the so-called global gag rule, which prohibits funding to non-governmental groups that support even voluntary abortions. \n \n The Trump administration has also signaled that it no longer sees a need for the U.S. to so generously fund U.N. and other international organizations. The White House has proposed cutting roughly one-third from the State Department\'s budget, with much of it expected to come from foreign aid and global organization dollars, although Congress is expected to restore at least some of that funding \n \n The U.N. agency\'s mission involves promoting universal access to family planning and reproductive health, with a goal of reducing maternal deaths and practices like female genital mutilation. The cut-off funds will be ""reprogrammed"" to USAID\'s Global Health Programs account to focus on similar issues, said a State Department official, who wasn\'t authorized to comment by name and requested anonymity. \n \n The Kemp-Kasten amendment, enacted in 1985, led to some of the U.N. agency\'s funding being initially cut off, then restored by Democratic President Bill Clinton in 1993, USAID said in a report. Republican George W. Bush\'s administration reversed the decision in 2002, but President Barack Obama — a Democrat — gave the funding back after taking office. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writer Edith M. Lederer at the United Nations and AP Diplomatic Writer Matthew Lee in Washington contributed to this report. \n \n ___ \n \n Reach Josh Lederman on Twitter at http://twitter.com/joshledermanAP', 'UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The State Department said on Monday it was ending U.S. funding for the United Nations Population Fund, the international body’s agency focused on family planning as well as maternal and child health in more than 150 countries. \n \n In a letter to U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, the State Department said it was dropping the funding because the U.N. Population Fund (UNFPA) “supports, or participates in the management of, a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization.” \n \n The cut marks U.S. President Donald Trump’s first move to curtail funding for the United Nations and is likely to raise further questions about how deep those cuts will eventually go throughout the organization, where the United States is the top donor. \n \n It comes after Trump in January reinstated the so-called Mexico City Policy that withholds U.S. funding for international organizations that perform abortions or provide information about abortion. \n \n Known by critics as the “global gag” rule, Trump broadened its scope to include all global health assistance in his Jan. 23 executive order that withholds at least half a billion dollars in U.S. funds. A lack of clarity around the rule, however, has left aid groups scrambling and both Republican and Democratic U.S. lawmakers seeking clarity. \n \n In a statement on its website, UNFPA said it regrets the U.S. decision to end funding, which it said is based on an “erroneous claim” that the agency supports coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization in China. \n \n UNFPA said its mission is “to ensure that every pregnancy is wanted, every childbirth is safe and every young person’s potential is fulfilled.” \n \n “The support we received over the years from the government and people of the United States has saved tens of thousands of mothers from preventable deaths and disabilities, and especially now in the rapidly developing global humanitarian crises,” the statement said. \n \n The cut follows Trump’s proposed 28 percent budget reduction for diplomacy and foreign aid, including an unspecified reduction in financial support for the United Nations and its agencies, announced last month. \n \n U.N. agencies such as the UNFPA are funded by governments voluntarily. The United States was the fourth-largest voluntary donor to UNFPA in 2015, giving $75 million in core budget and earmarked contributions. \n \n U.N. officials have warned that abrupt funding cuts could trigger more global instability and argued that dollars for diplomacy are more effective than military spending in combating terrorism.', 'Remember the California couple who found $10 million in gold coins on their property?

The published news item was discovered in the Haithi Trust Digital Library and was provided by Northern California fishing guide Jack Trout, who doubles as a historian and collector of rare coins. \n \n The details of the 1899 heist — $30,000 face value of uncirculated gold coins stolen from the San Francisco Mint in 1899 — matches every known fact about the gold coins found recently in the Sierra foothills, which were nearly $30,000 in face value of uncirculated mint condition coins mostly made at the San Francisco Mint in the late 1800s. \n \n If, as is almost certainly the case, this explains the origin of the found coins, then the couple who found them will not merely have to pay taxes on them — they’ll have to turn them over entirely back to the federal government, since the coins’ status has changed from “treasure trove” to “stolen goods”: \n \n Treasure trove is any gold or silver in coin, plate, or bullion that is hidden by an unknown owner in the earth or other private place for an extended period. The property is not considered treasure trove unless the identity of the owner cannot be determined. Under early common law, the finder of a treasure trove took title to it against everyone but the true owner. The U.S. law governing treasure trove has been merged, for the most part, into the law governing lost property. In the absence of a contrary statutory provision, the title to treasure trove belongs to the finder against all others with the exception of the true owner. \n \n It was a nice story while it lasted. \n \n UPDATE \n \n Just to clarify: \n \n The finders will EITHER have to hand over all the coins back to the government, OR pay taxes on them (on the off-chance they win the legal battle to retain ownership of the coins). Under no circumstance (of which I am aware) would they have to pay taxes AND return the coins. \n \n UPDATE II \n \n A few of the coins in the hoard were from different U.S. Mints and from earlier in the 19th century. It could be the case that the Federal Government might only be able to prove that the coins amongst the hoard which can be confirmed as coming from the San Francisco Mint in 1899 must be returned, while the finders could contest that the remaining coins were not part of that robbery and thus not necessarily stolen property. It’s entirely possible that the person who originally buried the hoard mixed in coins from more than one different sources (or crimes). In this case, the finders and the government would split ownership. \n \n UPDATE III \n \n According to the 1906 edition of the official Hearings Before the Subcommittee of the House Committee on Appropriations, a mint clerk named W.N. Dimmick was caught and convicted of stealing $30,000 in gold coins from the San Francisco Mint — although in the description of the case no mention is made of whether Dimmick ever revealed the location of the stolen coins, or whether they were ever recovered. \n \n Here is the full text of the relevant minutes from the House Hearings: \n \n \n \n \n \n Note that there is a discrepancy in the date of the supposed crime: Was it 1899, or 1901? A few pages later in the same minutes is this passage revealing that there may have been many other thefts from the mint as well, due to a plague of dishonest mint employees: \n \n Also note that one of the coins found in the hoard was an ultra-rare 1866 Liberty $20 gold piece missing the phrase “In God We Trust” — a coin which was never released to the public and which must have been produced and kept within the mint itself. \n \n This link to an article in the July 9, 1901 edition of the San Francisco Chronicle has more details about the Dimmick theft.']",3,"– Just days after he took office in January, President Trump put back in place the ""Mexico City policy"" that keeps federal funds from being funneled to international aid organizations that provide abortions, or even info about them. Now the United States has officially yanked US donations from the United Nations Population Fund (aka UNFPA), the arm of the UN that offers family-planning services in more than 150 nations, Reuters reports. The BBC notes that $32.5 million that was set to be allotted for 2017 will be rescinded, with a Monday letter from the State Department saying the withdrawal of the funds is because UNFPA ""supports, or participates in the management of, a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization"" in China. The US is one of UNFPA's largest benefactors, coming in fourth for 2015 with just over $75,000 in combined core and earmarked contributions. UNFPA—which relies on voluntary donations from global governments to provide its services, which include those for maternal and child health—put out a Tuesday statement noting the US decision was based on an ""erroneous claim"" about the group's work, which it says lets ""individuals and couples ... make their own decisions, free of coercion or discrimination."" The State Department letter says the money will be reallocated to the Global Health Programs account, where it will reportedly be put toward family planning, maternal health, and reproductive health in developing countries. The AP notes the UNFPA fund has traditionally seen the ax whenever the GOP is in the White House; Dems reinstate it when they take back control."

Established in 2003, the DHS BioWatch Program provides early warning of a bioterrorist attack in more than 30 major metropolitan areas across the country. This early warning helps decision makers plan an effective, coordinated, and rapid response. \n \n BioWatch is managed by the DHS Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office. \n \n How Does It Work \n \n The BioWatch Program provides air-monitoring, analysis, notification procedures, and risk assessment to 30+ jurisdictions. This program can substantially minimize the catastrophic impact of a biological attack. \n \n BioWatch involves a large network of stakeholders from public health, emergency management, law enforcement, laboratory, scientific, and environmental health organizations around the country who collaborate to detect and prepare a coordinated response to a bioterrorism attack. \n \n Future of BioWatch \n \n As terrorism evolves, DHS constantly improves its programs in order to stay ahead of the enemy. Currently, DHS is working to upgrade biodetection technology with the intention of: \n \n better addressing a wide range of bioterrorism threats; \n \n providing real-time data across the Homeland Security enterprise; and \n \n improving information-sharing between federal, state, and local operators. \n \n This upgrade to a sustainable, efficient biodetection capability will make Americans safer by improving the ability of first responders and decision makers to act quickly after an attack.', '1.

135,"['She has played an Auschwitz survivor, a nuclear-reactor worker-turned- whistleblower, and the ruthless editor of a fashion magazine. Now Meryl Streep has been lined up to play the leading role in Thatcher, a biopic of one of the most controversial prime ministers in British history. \n \n The Oscar winner Jim Broadbent is tipped to play her husband Denis in the movie, which is being developed by Pathé and BBC films. \n \n The movie, set in the build-up to the Falklands conflict in 1982, will be directed by Phyllida Lloyd, who also helmed Mamma Mia!, the biggest-grossing British film of all time. Thatcher will be her second feature film and is likely to have considerably less singing and dancing than her debut. \n \n The potential casting of Streep has surprised the film world, though she has played an almost unrivalled range of roles. After the success of Mamma Mia! in 2008, she played a ruthless fashion magazine editor based on the British-born Vogue editor Anna Wintour in The Devil Wears Prada, perhaps the perfect preparation for the part. \n \n Ian Freer, the reviews editor at the film magazine Empire, said: ""Meryl Streep is the consummate film actress and can nail all kinds of emotional and dramatic colours, so she is the perfect choice. She delivered an impeccable English accent in The French Lieutenant\'s Woman and has played formidable women throughout her career. She will draw out the humanity in Margaret Thatcher – no mean feat."" \n \n The movie is set during the 17 days that preceded the Argentine invasion of the Falkland Islands and the ensuing 10-week war. As the storm brewed, Ms Thatcher\'s popularity was on the wane. Britain\'s triumph altered the public perception of her, and she won the 1983 election with a parliamentary majority of 144 – the most comprehensive of her election victories. However, it was the sinking of the Argentine cruiser General Belgrano, with the loss of 368 lives, that marked the most controversial moment of her career. \n \n Damian Jones will produce the film, fresh from the success of the Ian Dury biopic Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll. The 61-year-old Streep will be slightly older than the Iron Lady she is playing: Thatcher was 56 when the Argentine president, General Galtieri, ordered the capture of the Falklands. \n \n Thatcher on screen \n \n Andrea Riseborough, \'The Long Road to Finchley\', 2008 \n \n ""Captures to perfection the fledgling leader\'s mannerisms and magnetism in a richly comic performance [which is] teasingly heavy on sexual allure.""

The piece, written by a female reporter who interviewed Toback at the Venice Film Festival, was titled “James Toback Gets Us, He Truly Gets Us in ‘The Private Life of a Modern Woman.’” Blair tweeted the story with a single word in response: “Ironic.” In the days that followed, Blair, who has appeared in films such as Cruel Intentions, Legally Blonde, and Hellboy, learned about a group of women on social media who claimed to have been sexually harassed by the director (Two Girls and a Guy) and Oscar-nominated writer (Bugsy). Their accounts sounded eerily familiar. The group, which included Blair, worked with Los Angeles Times reporter Glenn Whipp on a story that broke on October 22, citing 38 women in total who alleged sexual harassment suffered at the hands of Toback. Since then, the number of accusers has risen to more than 200 women—including Blair and Oscar-nominated actress Rachel McAdams, who both spoke exclusively to Vanity Fair this week about their experiences with Toback. (Toback, 72, has written for Vanity Fair in the past. When reached by phone Wednesday evening, Toback said he had no comment on any of the allegations.) Blair, 45, and McAdams, 38, tell remarkably similar stories about Toback’s modus operandi—the requests to meet him in hotel rooms, flattery about their acting skills, the promise of a role in the movie Harvard Man, which opened in 2001. The consistent themes in the stories of Blair, McAdams, and the hundreds of actresses who have come forward with their own tales of harassment hint at some of the reasons charges of sexual misconduct have plagued Hollywood since its inception. Actors and actresses, newcomers especially, essentially are always auditioning—any encounter, especially in a company town such as Los Angeles, could lead to a big break. The situation is compounded by the fact that many acting courses teach students to use, explore, and expose their vulnerabilities. So when a threatening individual manipulates a performer’s insecurities in a meeting purportedly related to an acting role, the experience can be confusing. Explained McAdams, “I was 21 and in the middle of theater school when I met [Toback]. Theater school was a very safe space.” But Toback, she said, “used the same language during my audition—that you have to take risks and sometimes you’re going to be uncomfortable and sometimes it’s going to feel dangerous. And that’s a good thing—when there is danger in the air and you feel like you are out of your comfort zone.” It is easy to see how a young actress at the start of her career might respond to a director’s lecherous behavior as an acting exercise or “test.” In an opinion piece in The New York Times that detailed an incident with Harvey Weinstein, Oscar-winning actress Lupita Nyong’o noted that “body work” is part of the coursework at fine-arts programs at schools such as Yale. Perhaps Weinstein knew this when he reportedly asked to massage and be massaged by women. Perhaps Toback knew this when he allegedly asked young women, after rattling off his film credits and famous friends, to trust him and disrobe so that he could help them become better actresses. When reports of Toback’s alleged harassment began pouring in, both Blair and McAdams were motivated to speak out. Blair, who cooperated with the initial Los Angeles Times story on the condition her name not be used, said Toback threatened her life after their encounter, which she said took place in 1999. And in the nearly 20 years that followed, the actress only told two people about her experience. “I still felt so powerless and scared,” Blair said, describing her emotional state earlier this week. “I kept thinking, ‘O.K., is there a big actress who is going to come out so that she can be the face of this? I want to bring as much awareness to this harassment as possible because I want Toback to be held accountable.” Toback denied the allegations to the Los Angeles Times, claiming that he had never met any of the then-38 accusers or, if he did, the meetings were very brief. He also claimed that for the last 22 years it had been “biologically impossible” for him to do what he was accused of, citing diabetes and a heart condition. “When he called these women liars, and said he didn’t recall meeting them and that the behavior alleged could not be attributed to him, I just felt rage and an obligation to speak publicly now,” Blair said. “I did not want to talk about this ever again,” McAdams said. “However, even though it is a really bad memory, I feel like some good could come from talking about it now.” What follow are edited excerpts from the actresses’ conversations with Vanity Fair. \n \n Selma Blair’s representatives arranged for her to meet Toback and described him as a “really interesting and odd guy,” who could help her gain credibility with the indie-film crowd. (She had filmed Cruel Intentions, but it had not yet been released.) Blair’s team said Toback would only meet in his hotel room; Blair insisted that they meet in the hotel restaurant. The two were meant to discuss a project Toback had written called Harvard Man , so the actress dressed accordingly—a pleated Y.S.L. skirt, a grosgrain ribbon, and a cable-knit sweater. That afternoon, I arrived at the restaurant and sat down at a table. After a bit, the hostess came up to me and told me that James Toback could not make it down, but that he wanted me to meet him in his room. Against my better judgment, I went upstairs. I was rattled, and looking back, I don’t think James Toback ever planned to come down to the restaurant. I went in the room feeling a little off balance about the arrangement, but he seemed nonplussed. He pulled out the script and said, “I look at you, and I see that we have a real connection. You could be an incredible actress, just by your eyes. But I can tell you don’t have confidence.” He said, “Where are your parents?” I was thinking, “Why is he trying to make me feel so uncomfortable?” But I realize now he was really trying to figure out what support system I had. I answered him. My mother was in Michigan, and I had an estranged relationship with my father. James said, “You know, I could have him killed.” He sat back in his chair and said really confidently, “I do it all the time. I know people.” Now I’m even more nervous, because he’s told me I have no confidence, he said he could have someone killed, and he said we had a connection—which no one had said to me before in this business. I really believed that when he started to talk . . . that he was going to be my mentor. That is how he got into my brain. You know, in acting classes they get into your personal history and connect that to work. So this conversation didn’t seem that strange. It seemed like he was concerned that I would not be seen as the actress I had the potential to be, and that he could do for me what he did for Robert Downey Jr. It was about 40 minutes in and he said, “Will you trust me? I cannot continue to work with you unless you trust me.” He said, “I need you to take your clothes off. I need you to do this monologue naked.” I said, “Why would my character need to be naked? She is a lawyer in a courtroom.” He said, “Because I need to see how your body moves. How comfortable you are with your body. This is where I start training you.” I told him I was uncomfortable. But he continued to coax me—saying that this was in no way a come-on. This was part of training. He wanted to make me a good actress. He wanted to make me comfortable. I thought, “Well, my representation sent me to see him. He must be really important.” I took off my sweater. I was so private about my body. I do remember looking down at the script and seeing my bare chest and not being able to focus on anything but the words and my face being so hot and puffy and feeling so ashamed. He commented on my body—said that it was Eastern European. I was just trying to block it all out. He said, “Wow, you need a lot of work.” I put my sweater back on. And he proceeded to tell me how much help I needed . . . that I was really just a mess. As I was telling him, “Guess I better get out of here . . .” he sat down on the bed and said, “No, you have to talk to me.” He started to rub his penis through his pants and asked, ‘Would you f**k me?’” I managed to say, “No. No, I won’t. Are you married? Do you have a wife?” He said, “It’s complicated, but yes. She’s wonderful. She’s a writer. She’s a teacher. And she’s a wonderful woman. And I have a girlfriend who can’t get enough sex. But I love that. I have to come six or seven times a day or else it really doesn’t work for me to get through my day.” I felt trapped. I did not know how to get out and save face and not make a scene. Was I imagining it? He dropped some names [of actresses] that he did some really dark sexual things with. These felt like lies and dark gossip and that he would add my name to the list. I went to leave and he got up and blocked the door. He said, “You have to do this for me. You cannot leave until I have release.” I said, “What do I have to do? I cannot touch you. I cannot have sex with you.” “He said, ‘It’s O.K. I can come in my pants. I have to rub up against your leg. You have to pinch my nipples. And you have to look into my eyes.’” I thought, “Well, if I can get out of here without being raped . . .” He walked me back to the bed. He sat me down. He got on his knees. And he continued to press so hard against my leg. He was greasy and I had to look into those big brown eyes. I tried to look away, but he would hold my face. So I was forced to look into his eyes. And I felt disgust and shame, and like nobody would ever think of me as being clean again after being this close to the devil. His energy was so sinister. After he finished, he told me, “There is a girl who went against me. She was going to talk about something I did. I am going to tell you, and this is a promise, if she ever tells anybody, no matter how much time she thinks went by, I have people who will pull up in a car, kidnap her, and throw her in the Hudson River with cement blocks on her feet. You understand what I’m talking about, right?” He looked at me with those bug eyes that had just raped my leg. And I said, “Yes. I understand.” I left. I was shaking and scared. I told my boyfriend and made him promise not to tell anyone. My career was just starting, and I was frightened. I thought I was going to be kidnapped if I told anybody. When my manager called me back and said, “James Toback wants to see you again,” I said, “That man is vile. And I never want to be in a room with him again. Do not send any girls or women to him.” I didn’t want to speak up because, it sounds crazy but, even until now, I have been scared for my life. But then these brave women spoke out, and he called them liars and said he didn’t recall meeting them . . . that [the] behavior alleged was disgusting and it could not be attributed to him. I just felt rage. Pure rage. Also, where are the people who have been financing his movies? His high-profile friends? This man, unlike Harvey Weinstein, does not have a company that can hold him accountable. Who is coming out and saying, “This is a horrible story and we are looking into this.” Or, “I knew something.” Where was our union? I would like to see Toback admit this happened. None of us are asking for money, for jobs, or for fame. We don’t want to be threatened on social media or called whistleblowers by people who don’t know what it means to be defiled and degraded and made to feel worthless. What I do want, in my dreams, is for someone bigger than me to call him out. I want to light the pyre of public opinion.” Photograph by Jason McDonald.']",3,"– Meryl Streep is set to team up with Mamma Mia! director Phyllida Lloyd again for a movie with considerably less singing and dancing.

Reporter: IT IS ABSOLUTELY \n \n MOUNT DORA, Fla. - \n \n A convicted sex predator who served 3 years in prison for a crime involving a young child is now a multi-millionaire. Timothy Dale Poole won $3 million on a Florida Lottery scratch-off ticket he purchased at a Mount Dora 7-Eleven store Saturday night. \n \n [VIDEO: Local 6\'s original report ] \n \n ""He was flabbergasted. He couldn\'t believe it,"" said Floyd Snyder, a friend who was with Poole when he hit the jackpot. ""It was quite a remarkable thing. My heart is still beating."" \n \n Poole was among the subjects of a recent Local 6 investigation that examined where convicted sex predators are employed. Poole is driver and dispatcher for Triangle Cab, a Mount Dora taxi company owned by his mother, records show. \n \n In 1999, Orange County authorities arrested Poole following allegations that he sexually battering a 9-year-old boy. According to an arrest warrant affidavit, Poole was a friend of the victim\'s family who once lived at their home. The victim also spent some weekends at Poole\'s home, according to investigators. \n \n ""He said Tim would sleep in the same bed as him at his house"" and perform a sex act on the child, the detective wrote in the affidavit. ""He said sometimes Tim would wake him up from sleeping to (perform a sex act)."" \n \n Poole denied the allegations, according to the report. \n \n As part of a plea bargain, Poole pleaded guilty to attempted sexual battery and was sentenced to the 13 months he had already served in jail. The judge also ordered Poole to serve 10 years of sex offender probation and register as a sexual predator. A judge can designate someone as a predator if the defendant used physical violence, preyed on children or had repeat violations. \n \n In 2003, a judge revoked Poole\'s probation and sent him to prison for 3 years. According to court records, Poole was kicked out of his mandatory sex offender counseling because he failed to attend 4 group sessions. \n \n Poole, who has had no other legal troubles since being released from prison in 2006, insists he is innocent. \n \n ""It may be hard for some to believe, but sometimes people are wrongly accused,"" Poole told Local 6 in November. \n \n ""I\'ve known him for years and I\'ve never seen any inclination of anything like that with him,"" said Snyder, who believes his friend should enjoy the $3 million lottery jackpot. ""He\'s a very positive person. Very kind. Giving. I think that\'s why he won. It\'s Christmastime and the dude deserves a break."" \n \n Poole turned in his winning Super Millions scratch-off ticket at Florida Lottery headquarters in Tallahassee on Monday. Lottery officials said he chose to receive his winnings in a one-time, lump-sum payment of $2,219,807.90. \n \n Florida law does not allow the lottery to withhold payments from winners based on their criminal records, according to spokeswoman. However, before a winner receives a check, Florida Lottery officials conduct a background check using their Social Security number to ensure they do not owe child support or any outstanding debts to a state agency. \n \n Poole could not be reached for comment following his lottery win, so it is unclear what he plans to do with his millions. According to Snyder, Poole will be pouring some of that money into his mom\'s small taxi cab company. \n \n ""He\'s going to invest in the business,"" said Snyder. ""He\'s going to expand.""', 'At the Florida Lottery headquarters, Timothy Poole, 43, posed for a photo with an oversized check after claiming his $3 million Scratch-Off prize. But when the image hit the Internet, others recognized the 450-pound man as a registered sexual predator. \n \n In 2001, the Orange County Sheriff\'s Office arrested Poole on charges of sexual battery on a victim under 12, records show. Before that, he was arrested in 1991 for stealing almost $20,000 in food stamps from Safeco Inc. of Ocala, where he worked as a guard. \n \n In all, Poole has been arrested 12 times in Florida on charges ranging from grand theft to forging a check, records show. Poole served three months in prison in 1996 and did a second stint from 2003 to 2006, according to the Florida Department of Corrections. \n \n This week, Poole claimed his winnings from the Florida Lottery in a one-time lump-sum payment of $2,219,807.90. He played the Super Millions scratch-off game which costs $20 a ticket. The game offers 12 top prizes of $3 million and, with Poole\'s winner, five remain, spokeswoman Keri Gero said. \n \n A call to Poole\'s workplace, Triangle Cabs, was not returned. He did not answer the door of his Mount Dora home where a ""No Trespassing"" sign was posted on a fence. \n \n The Florida Lottery took down a photo of Poole from its website after learning from media about his past. \n \n Florida Lottery Timothy Poole Timothy Poole (Florida Lottery) \n \n ""We chose to not draw additional attention to this particular winner,"" said Shelly Gerteisen, communications manager for the Florida Lottery. \n \n This is not the first time a registered sex offender has struck it rich. \n \n In 2007, a Jensen Beach man arrested for lewd and lascivious or indecent assault upon a child snagged a $14 million lottery jackpot prize. \n \n This year, Massachusetts legislators are considering a bill to prevent registered sex offenders from collecting lottery earnings after a $10 million winner used the money to buy expensive gifts for a new victim, police said. \n \n If you win the Mega Millions jackpot, here are some ideas to help you spend it. \n \n In Florida, there are no laws that prohibit registered sexual predators from playing the numbers and collecting winnings. The Florida Lottery cannot withhold earnings based on someone\'s criminal record. \n \n ""There are no registration laws that would prevent that, but if that offender was under supervision or on probation there could be additional sanctions imposed by the judge,"" said Samantha Andrews of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. \n \n Restrictions depend on the nature of the crime, Andrews said. For example, some sexual predators cannot dress up on Halloween because it attracts attention from children, she said. City or county ordinances may also prevent sexual predators from living within 1,000 feet of a school, day care or park. \n \n Poole pleaded guilty in 2002 to sexual battery of two boys. \n \n The incidents occurred in the late 1990s in both Tavares and Orlando, where he sometimes stayed with the boys\' parents, according to an Orange County sheriff\'s report. Poole, then 28, denied the allegations to sheriff\'s detectives, saying he would never hurt the boys because he felt as if they were his own. \n \n He was sentenced to five years in prison by Circuit Judge Alan S. Apte and was released from state custody in 2006. \n \n Reporter Stephen Hudak contributed to this report. echerney@orlandosentinel.com or 352-742-5930']",2,"– Lottery officials in Florida pulled a photo of the latest jackpot winner from their website after learning that he is a convicted sex offender. Timothy Poole, 43, served time in prison after being accused of sexually battering a 9-year-old boy in 2001 and has been arrested more than 10 other times for offenses including grand theft and forgery, reports the Orlando Sentinel. He won $3 million on a Super Millions scratch-off ticket and took home a lump sum payment of $2,219,807 this week. ""We chose to not draw additional attention to this particular winner"" after learning of his past, a lottery spokeswoman says. Poole—who now works as a driver for a taxi firm his mother owns—served 13 months on a plea deal for the 2001 offense and was later sent back to jail for three years after failing to attend mandatory sex offender counseling sessions. He was required to register as a sexual predator but continues to maintain his innocence and has had no legal problems since his release from prison in 2006, reports WKMG, which notes that Florida doesn't allow the lottery to withhold payments from winners based on their criminal records. (In Alaska a few years ago, a convicted sex offender won a lottery that benefited sex-assault victims and suffered a severe beating in the street a few days later.)"

138,"['Story highlights The CIA officially acknowledges Area 51, long a fixation for conspiracy theorists, in documents \n \n The area, 125 northwest of Las Vegas, was a testing ground for Cold War aerial surveillance \n \n Document release could be just the beginning of Area 51 information, expert says \n \n Area 51 has long been a topic of fascination for conspiracy theorists and paranormal enthusiasts, but newly released CIA documents officially acknowledge the site and suggest that the area served a far less remarkable purpose than many had supposed. \n \n According to these reports, which include a map of the base\'s location in Nevada, Area 51 was merely a testing site for the government\'s U-2 and OXCART aerial surveillance programs. The U-2 program conducted surveillance around the world, including over the Soviet Union during the Cold War. \n \n Area 51, about 125 miles northwest of Las Vegas, is synonymous in popular culture with government secrecy, and many have theorized that it holds the answer to one of the greatest questions plaguing mankind: Are we really alone in the universe? \n \n But the newly released documents make no mention of alien autopsy rooms or spaceship parking lots. \n \n This information will be disappointing to some, who have come to view the area as a mecca of sorts for alien encounters. \n \n For these true believers, the existence of alien spacecraft at Area 51, and the government\'s attempts to cover up their trace, is irrefutable and has been since reports of Unidentified Flying Objects -- or UFOs -- began to emerge from the Nevada desert in the middle part of the 20th century. \n \n The map and other documents were released in response to a Freedom of Information Act request submitted by Jeffrey T. Richelson, a senior fellow at the National Security Archives, in 2005. \n \n The map and other documents were released in response to a Freedom of Information Act request submitted by Jeffrey T. Richelson, a senior fellow at the National Security Archives. \n \n Richelson submitted the request as part of his continuing study of aerial surveillance programs and told CNN that he was not given an explanation of why the new documents were less redacted than previous versions declassified by the agency. \n \n JUST WATCHED Area 51 Revealed Replay More Videos ...

Its location appears in books on aerial surveillance and is widely referenced in popular culture. \n \n In fact, the map that was released in the CIA documents mirrors the one that appears after a simple Google Maps search for ""Area 51."" \n \n Area 51 has also been referenced in government documents in the past, though this newest release is the first that acknowledges its existence and location in a purposeful way. \n \n Richelson told CNN he believes this could signal a dramatic change in the government\'s willingness to declassify information about the famed base, meaning even more information could come out about Area 51 in the future. \n \n The release of these reports seem to put the theories about aliens and flying saucers to rest for the time being, although they may not be enough to silence the true believers. \n \n At least they still have Roswell, right?', 'WASHINGTON — Newly declassified government documents made public Thursday are shedding some of the official mystery surrounding Nevada’s role in developing spy planes of the Cold War. \n \n A history of the U-2 reconnaissance program written by CIA officials in 1992 and released this summer to a national security institute contains official acknowledgement and several mentions of Area 51, the remote desert base 90 miles north of Las Vegas that the government once denied even existed. \n \n It includes the story of when CIA project director Richard Bissell and Air Force officer Col. Osmund Ritland in April 1955 first flew over an old airstrip by the salt flat named Groom Lake. The Beechcraft plane was piloted by Tony LeVier, Lockheed’s chief test pilot. \n \n On closer inspection they agreed it “would make an ideal site for testing the U-2 and training its pilots,” according to the history. The lightweight aircraft was being built by Lockheed at its highly secure “Skunk Works” plant in Burbank, Calif. \n \n Allen Dulles, the director of Central Intelligence, and Adm. Lewis Strauss, the chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, got President Dwight Eisnenhower to sign off on adding the strip, “known by its map designation as Area 51,” to what was then called the Nevada Test Site. \n \n “To make the facility in the middle of nowhere sound more attractive to his workers, (Skunk Works founder) Kelly Johnson called it the Paradise Ranch, which was soon shortened to the Ranch,” according to the document. \n \n Three months later, by July 1955, “the base was ready and Agency, Air Force and Lockheed personnel began moving in.” \n \n On July 25, the first prototype was delivered, wrapped in tarpaulins, “its long slender wings and tail assembly removed.” It was flown to Groom Lake aboard a C-124, and mechanics spent six days readying the craft for its first flight on Aug. 4. \n \n Subsequent high-altitude testing of the U-2 soon led to an unexpected side effect, “a tremendous increase in reports of unidentified flying objects” that added much to Area 51 lore. \n \n That the Nevada installation was a development and staging area for the high-altitude spy plane and other aircraft that flew secret missions over the Soviet Union, China and other U.S. targets now is commonly known, having previously been revealed in several histories of the era. \n \n But up to now, mentions of the base in officially released documents were rare and “probably inadvertent,” said Jeffrey Richelson, senior fellow of the National Security Archive, a research institute that contains a major library of declassified U.S. documents. \n \n Releasing information on Area 51 now “is clearly a conscious decision to acknowledge the name, the location rather than play pretend about the secrecy,” Richelson said. \n \n The 407-page history, “The Central Intelligence Agency and Overhead Reconnaissance,” was released to Richelson in June in response to a Freedom of Information Act request he filed in 2005. A heavily redacted version was published in 1998. \n \n The history also discusses the site’s role in Oxcart, the CIA code-named program that produced the Lockheed A-12 spy plane, the nation’s first stealth aircraft. \n \n T.D. Barnes, 75, of Henderson and Roger Andersen, 83, of Las Vegas, both worked on development of the A-12 at Area 51 in the 1960s. \n \n “There’s not much really new here but they are officially confirming what has been previously speculated,” said Barnes, who worked on a radar project in Beatty that measured the velocity of the record-breaking, rocket-powered X-15 in 1964. \n \n “We would secretly track the flights for the CIA,” he said. \n \n A CIA contractor, Barnes arrived at Area 51 in 1968 as a radar expert to put the finishing touches on the A-12. He said most of the CIA’s “black operations” in Nevada used code names for the projects but not the facility. \n \n He said other unofficial names used for the facility include Dreamland, Home Base, Watertown Strip, Groom Lake and Homey Airport. \n \n “The U-2 guys called it Watertown because that was the hometown of the CIA director at the time,” Barnes said, referring to Dulles. \n \n Barnes said Area 51 is part of the Nellis Air Force range operations area. The restricted airspace around it is known by military pilots as “the box” or “the container.” \n \n Andersen, an Air Force captain recruited by the CIA, said the stories behind Area 51 “generally were known by those of us who worked there but not to the rest of the world.” \n \n While the CIA had been protective of Area 51 information for so long, Andersen said he sensed a shift within the past five to seven years. As a result, he and former Area 51 personnel were invited to a CIA “family day” at headquarters in Langley, Va. \n \n Richelson, the National Security Archive senior fellow, said he had no idea why the CIA decided to open up on Area 51 at this time. Researchers hope it is a sign the agency might be forthcoming about details of other once-secret Nevada programs, such as development of the F-117 Stealth jet and the use of captured Soviet MiGs to train U.S. pilots in air-to-air combat.', 'Hurricane Katrina was one of the deadliest hurricanes ever to hit the United States. An estimated 1,833 people died in the hurricane and the flooding that followed in late August 2005, and millions of others were left homeless along the Gulf Coast and in New Orleans. \n \n Katrina was the most destructive storm to strike the United States and the costliest storm in U.S. history, causing $108 billion in damage, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). It ranks sixth overall in strength of recorded Atlantic hurricanes. It was also a very large storm; at its peak, maximum winds stretched 25 to 30 nautical miles (46 to 55 kilometers) and its extremely wide swath of hurricane force winds extended at least 75 nautical miles (138 km) to the east from the center. \n \n Katrina initially formed about 200 miles (322 km) southeast of the Bahamas on Aug. 23, 2005, as a tropical depression, according to the NOAA. A well-defined band of storm clouds began to wrap around the north side of the storm\'s circulation center in the early morning hours of Aug. 24. With winds of about 40 mph (65 kph), the storm was named Tropical Storm Katrina. \n \n By the time it made its way to southern Florida on Aug. 25, Katrina was a moderate Category 1 hurricane. While it caused some flooding and casualties — two people were killed — during its first landfall, it appeared to be just another hurricane in an active hurricane season. Katrina weakened after passing over Florida and was reclassified as a tropical storm. \n \n But, once over water again, Katrina stalled beneath a very large upper-level anticyclone that dominated the entire Gulf of Mexico, and rapidly gained strength. Katrina re-intensified into a hurricane on Aug. 26, and became a Category Five storm on Aug. 28, with winds blowing at about 175 mph (280 kph). The storm turned north toward the Louisiana coast. The storm weakened to a Category 3 storm before making landfall along the Louisiana-Mississippi border on the morning of Aug. 29 with sustained winds of 120 mph (193 kph). \n \n Katrina weakened to a Category 1 hurricane after moving inland over southern and central Mississippi. It was downgraded to a tropical storm about six hours later just northwest of Meridian, Mississippi, and became an extratropical low on Aug. 31. It was finally absorbed by a frontal zone later that day over the eastern Great Lakes, according to the NOAA. \n \n The flooding in New Orleans nearly a week after Hurricane Katrina hit, taken by NASA\'s EO-1 satellite on Sept. 6, 2005. Credit: NASA \n \n As Katrina made landfall, its front-right quadrant, which held the strongest winds, slammed into Gulfport and Biloxi, Mississippi, devastating both cities. A large storm surge ranging from 10 to 28 feet devastated coastal areas across southeastern Louisiana and coastal Mississippi. \n \n ""The surge exposed engineering mistakes in the levees and floodwalls designed and built by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, causing extensive flooding throughout the New Orleans region,"" said Sandy Rosenthal, the founder and director of the advocacy group aimed at educating people about the catastrophic flooding in New Orleans in 2005 and a known critic of the Army Corps. \n \n Ultimately, 80 percent of New Orleans and large portions of nearby parishes became flooded, and the floodwaters did not recede for weeks. \n \n The National Guard was called in to help with evacuations. Thousands sought refuge in the New Orleans Convention Center and the Superdome, which were overwhelmed. It was one of the largest displacements of a population since the Great Depression, according to the NOAA. According to The Data Center, an independent research organization in New Orleans, the storm displaced more than 1 million people in the Gulf Coast region. [Infographic: Hurricane Katrina History and Numbers] \n \n The rescue and recovery efforts following Katrina became highly politicized, with federal, state and local officials pointing fingers at one another. Critics blamed an aging and neglected federal levee system and a slow state and local response following the disaster for the high loss of life and damage. Many residents did not heed initial warnings to evacuate, putting a severe strain on rescue operations. \n \n After initially receiving praise from then-president George W. Bush, Michael D. Brown, the director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), was forced to resign, as was New Orleans Police Department Superintendent Eddie Compass. Louisiana Gov. Kathleen Blanco and New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin came under severe scrutiny for not ordering mandatory evacuations sooner. Blanco did not seek re-election in 2007. Nagin left office in 2010. In 2014, he was convicted of bribery, fraud and money laundering committed while in office before and after Katrina and is now serving a 10-year sentence, according to the New Orleans Times-Picayune. \n \n Ultimately, a select bipartisan committee of the U.S. House of Representatives investigating the preparation, response and aftermath of the storm cited failures at all levels of government.

Commander Mark Moran, NOAA Corps, NMAO/AOC \n \n Government officials have sought to learn from the tragedy and implement better environmental, communications and evacuation policies. The Army Corps of Engineers has rebuilt the levee system, making the barriers higher and supporting them with steel beams that extend as far as 65 feet (19.8 meters) below sea level. \n \n On 2006, Congress passed an act to reorganize FEMA. The Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act offers grants to help cities revise evacuation plans, includes provisions for better communication with non-English speaking people and those with disabilities and recognizes the evacuation needs of people with pets. The act also increases funding for Urban Search and Rescue teams and requires the establishment of a family registry within six months after a storm. \n \n The city of New Orleans has improved resident access to evacuation and alert information. For example, they have an e-mail and text message system called NolaReady that 13,000 residents have signed up for. \n \n Ten years later, the region was still recovering from Katrina. The New Orleans metro area\'s population had dropped dramatically, from 1.386 million in 2005 to 1.04 million in 2006. By 2014, it had climbed back to 1.252 million, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The number of housing units and business establishments had also fallen and by 2014 had not returned to pre-2005 levels. \n \n While many of the tourist areas such as the French Quarter have recovered, there are still neighborhoods just a short ride from the city that are just gone.

The documents, obtained in a Freedom of Information Act request by a national security institute at George Washington University, explain that Area 51 got its start in 1955 because the government needed a place to test U-2 spy planes. Aliens in crashed spaceships are nowhere to be found in the documents. But here's one weird detail that is: The government initially called it ""Paradise Ranch"" to make the ""facility in the middle of nowhere"" sound more alluring to workers. The documents include a CIA map of the site, which is pretty much the same one that has long been available in a Google Maps search for ""Area 51,"" notes CNN. So what's the big deal here? It's ""clearly a conscious decision to acknowledge the name, the location rather than play pretend about the secrecy,” says the researcher who filed the FOIA request, Jeffrey Richelson. It should pave the way for the release of even more information about the site, he adds. You can dig into the 400 pages of documents here."

The zoo follows a guideline whereby zookeepers bring the birds inside when the temp falls below -25 C. \n \n According to CTVNews, the zoo has 51 members in its flock, which represents a variety of species. In the wild, king penguins often dwell in sub-Antarctic regions, but they are more accustomed to milder climates than their Antarctic cousins, the emperor penguins. \n \n “We just don’t want to expose them to too much,” Malu Celli, the zoo’s curator, told CTVNews on Sunday. “To keep them safe, we decided to pick a limit to let them out.” \n \n Celli went on to say that “It’s not necessarily that it’s too cold for them … I believe that physiologically, they can withstand colder weather than what we have here, but these are not wild birds.” \n \n In fact, the king penguins have a chick among the flock (see “Cleopatra,” below) who is still maturing, so the zookeepers decided to err on the side of safety. \n \n All species of penguins have a layer of insulating fat, as well as down feathers that help them keep warm. Plus, the tuxedoed birds tend to huddle together to create warmth while conserving heat by keeping their flippers close at their sides. That said, the Calgary Zoo’s penguins, who hail from several regions of the world, would probably be more than happy to waddle around in the frigid cold open air. \n \n “It’s kind of like you can bundle up your kid, but then there’s a point you’re going to say, ‘I know you’re good, but I’d rather you stay inside now,’ ” Celli told CTVNews. \n \n (Below, see the penguins roaming outside during the summer months at the zoo.) \n \n Luckily, there’s good news for the fresh air-loving members of the Calgary Zoo penguin flock in 2018: A media representative at the zoo tells PEOPLE that although “the king penguins moved indoors when the temps plummeted … the weather has since become much milder … so this is no longer an issue.” \n \n The recent frigid weather also resulted in cancellations of New Year polar bear dips and plunges throughout Canada.', 'CLOSE Bone-chilling cold gripped much of the U.S. as 2018 began, breaking century-old records and leading to several deaths that authorities attributed to exposure to the dangerously low temperatures. (Jan. 2) AP \n \n Icicles form on the tritons in the Forsyth Park Fountain on Tuesday, Jan. 2, 2018, in Savannah, Ga. Savannah is shivering through a rare bout with icy weather, with the National Weather Service predicting that up to 2 inches of snow and sleet could fall Wednesday on the typically balmy coastal city. (Photo: Steve Bisson, Savannah Morning News via AP) \n \n A winter storm is expected to dump snow and ice along the East Coast, turning into a \'bomb cyclone\' in New England. As temperatures continue to drop, here are some things you shouldn\'t leave in your car: \n \n Cellphones \n \n Apple advises against storing the iPhone or iPad at temperatures below negative-4 degrees, and they shouldn\'t be operated at temperatures lower than 32 degrees. There are similar recommendations for Samsung phones and other electronics. Lithium-ion batteries popular in cellphones are the most vulnerable component to cold, USA TODAY reports. They can stop working in extreme cold but should be OK once you get back indoors. However, repeated exposure to subzero temperatures can cause problems. \n \n More: Let it snow — maybe even in Florida as cold wave tightens grip on USA \n \n Soda or beer \n \n Water expands when it freezes. And for canned liquids under pressure, that can mean explosion. The freeze temperature for Coca-Cola is 30 degrees, and the temperature for beer that\'s 5% alcohol by volume is 27 degrees (higher-alcohol beers freeze at lower temperatures), as NJ.com reported. \n \n We put a bunch of cans of soda in an old station car in the frigid cold and waited for them to explode. Nearly 24 hours later... pic.twitter.com/0LhKnZvYGL — Darnay Tripp (@DarnayTripp) January 7, 2017 \n \n Musical instruments \n \n Things contract when they freeze, so this can cause some instruments to go out of tune. More seriously, ""damage can be done when an instrument shrinks as a result of the cold air. If your instrument is made of real wood, the cold air can cause cracking, which is very expensive to repair. Sometimes they are broken beyond repair,"" according to The Real School of Music. If an instrument is left in a freezing car for a long period, try to make it warm up gradually. \n \n Eggs \n \n Eggs shouldn\'t be allowed to freeze in their shells; if that happens, throw away any cracked eggs. Keep the un-cracked ones frozen, and move them to the refrigerator before use. ""These can be hard cooked successfully, but other uses may be limited. That\'s because freezing causes the yolk to become thick and syrupy so it will not flow like an unfrozen yolk or blend very well with the egg white or other ingredients,"" according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service. \n \n Canned foods \n \n Letting a can of beans freeze allows for the water to freeze and expand in a similar way to beer and soda. The USDA advises that this can result in a broken seal, causing spoilage. If canned food freezes, allow it to thaw in a refrigerator. ""If the product doesn\'t look and/or smell normal, throw it out. DO NOT TASTE IT! If the seams have rusted or burst, throw the cans out immediately, wrapping the burst can in plastic and disposing the food where no one, including animals can get it,"" according to the USDA. \n \n Medication \n \n If you\'re visiting a pharmacy during the deep freeze, consider that some medications can be affected by low temperatures. ""Drugs like insulin can lose their effectiveness if they freeze. The same goes for any so-called suspended medication that has to be shaken before use,"" according to a report in The New York Times. \n \n Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE BABY, IT\'S COLD OUTSIDE N.C. officials urge people to stay home | 0:46 Even after the storm blew off shore, North Carolina officials urged people to stay home while crews worked on roads made treacherous by the storm.

Reason, the libertarian magazine, called Tuesday a ""coming out party"" for believers in the conspiracy. \n \n QAnon supporters believe that at least one government insider, ""Q,"" is using various platforms to feed ""anons"" — Q\'s followers — information about…well, all sorts of things. As the Guardian noted in this excellent explainer, it can be difficult to pin down what exactly proponents of QAnon take the consequences of Q\'s dispatches to be. But many have extrapolated the breadcrumbs supposedly left behind by the deep state agent (or agents) to mean that Hollywood celebrities are engaged in a widespread pedophilia ring; that bad actors once tried to shoot down Air Force One with Trump aboard — and other evidence-free notions. \n \n RELATED COVERAGE: Conspiracy theorist QAnon promoted, then deleted, by Hillsborough County GOP \n \n Yet on Tuesday, QAnon was regarded as legitimate by rally goers. \n \n Jamie and Jennifer Buteau of Ocala wore T-shirts and made signs promoting Q\'s cause at Trump\'s rally Tuesday. Jamie, who voted for Obama in 2012, said in an interview after the rally ended that he got turned onto Trump because of his ""magnetic personality."" He said he views Q\'s dispatches as a research guide. \n \n ""The media has already written it off as this bad thing, but it\'s all positive,"" Buteau said of QAnon. \n \n The Buteaus said there are hidden messages all around Trump\'s presidency, and Q is helping his supporters decode them. When Trump misspells in a tweet, that\'s a sign, Jamie said. When the lights turned out during a press conference in which Trump walked back comments about Russia\'s 2016 interference in America\'s elections, Q was sending a message, Jennifer said. \n \n The lights went out on Trump as he was delivering a statement to the press. \n \n \n \n Good reminder that Trump’s White House is probably more like Veep than House Of Cards. pic.twitter.com/z5NN6MZOlW — Nathan H. Rubin (@NathanHRubin) July 17, 2018 \n \n Even things Q has gotten wrong can be seen by its supporters as evidence of his power. Jamie said that some of Q\'s intel ""drops"" are ""misinformation"" designed to throw deep state actors off the scent. \n \n If any of that sounds far-fetched, that\'s because it is. But Joseph Uscinski, a professor at the University of Miami who researches conspiracy theories, said it makes sense that QAnon supporters showed up at the Trump rally because polls show that Trump supporters are more likely to believe in conspiracy theories. \n \n ""Simply not trusting the media doesn\'t lead to QAnon,"" Uscinski said. ""It\'s a very specific set of people who are going to buy into it. So largely, what you\'re dealing with is the dispositions that allow people to pick up these beliefs, rather than anything really convincing about the theory itself."" \n \n Uscinski noted that although QAnon, which cropped up on 4chan message boards in October of 2017, has shown some staying power — in part because of support from conservative celebrities like Roseanne Barr — most conspiracy theories have a short shelf life. He added that we shouldn\'t judge conspiracy theorists too harshly because we\'re all prone to believing in tall tales from time to time. \n \n ""We shouldn\'t treat our fellow Americans like zoo animals,"" the professor said. \n \n Of course, the wild nonsense spread by QAnon\'s supporters can also be dangerous. Buzzfeed reported that a man was arrested in June after he drove to the Hoover Dam in an armored truck to demand that the government release ""the OIG report,"" a calling card of QAnon supporters. \n \n But for his part, Buteau isn\'t worried he\'s gone too far down the conspiracy rabbit hole — although he admitted QAnon research can be ""addicting."" \n \n ""This is the counterbalance to the fake news,"" Buteau said.']",3,"– The record-breaking cold continues—even penguins in Canada are taking shelter, per People—so it's a good time to share what not to leave in a cold car.

142,"['(CNN) Your favorite fitness tracker may not be totally accurate, according to a study used in an amended complaint filed Thursday against Fitbit. \n \n The class-action lawsuit, filed earlier this year, argues that the PurePulse technology used in the Fitbit trackers that measure your heart rate doesn\'t do it as well as the company\'s marketing material promises, a claim Fitbit denies. The technology is used in the more expensive models of the device, the Surge, Blaze and Charge HR. \n \n The lawsuit was filed on behalf of people who bought these Fitbits specially to help them track their heart rate, whether for health reasons or to make sure they are getting the most out of their workouts. \n \n ""We are not arguing that it is a medical device. I think that is irrelevant,"" said Jonathan Selbin , one of the attorneys who filed the lawsuit. ""This is about the way they market it and that they charge a premium for the heart rate monitor, but it\'s not giving a meaningful measurement."" \n \n The suit alleges that a defect in the trackers is a safety hazard because people who rely on inaccurate heart rate readings for medical purposes could be at risk. The class-action members say there is no reasonable way for them to know that the devices can be inaccurate and that they might not have even bought them if they knew. \n \n The amended complaint, filed Thursday, added a new study that looked at how the trackers worked for 43 healthy adults, compared with an ECG and against each other. The participants wore two Fitbits during the test. \n \n The study -- which was funded by the legal team that brought the lawsuit -- found that the devices were off by, on average, 20 beats per minute during moderate- to high-intensity exercise. The lawsuit concludes that the ""devices could not provide meaningful heart rate data"" when someone is exercising. \n \n ""It works pretty well when you are resting,"" study co-author Edward Jo said. But Fitbit is ""advertised to people who exercise,"" and ads suggest that the trackers are ""counting every beat."" \n \n Researchers tested the device on 22 men and 21 women, who were observed in a single visit. They wore the devices, a Zephyr Technology BioHarness and a single-channel ECG sensor. Monitored for 65 minutes, the subjects were asked to perform physical activities that were similar to ones represented in the Fitbit ads, including a standing rest, a self-paced jog, jumping rope, climbing stairs, fast movement exercise, treadmill running and a seated rest. \n \n The research was done by Jo and Brett Dolezal, scientists at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona. \n \n Fitbit objects to the study, suggesting that it ""lacks scientific rigor and is the product of flawed methodology."" \n \n According to a statement from a Fitbit representative, ""It was paid for by plaintiffs\' lawyers who are suing Fitbit, and was conducted with a consumer-grade electrocardiogram -- not a true clinical device, as implied by the plaintiffs\' lawyers. Furthermore, there is no evidence the device used in the purported \'study\' was tested for accuracy."" \n \n The statement goes on to say, ""Fitbit\'s research team rigorously researched and developed PurePulse technology for three years prior to introducing it to market and continues to conduct extensive internal studies to test the features of our products. Fitbit Charge HR is the #1 selling fitness tracker on the market, and is embraced by millions of consumers around the globe."" \n \n Fitbit also cites an independent study by Consumer Reports in which it did its own tests and found the heart rate measurements to be accurate. That study, however, measured the heart rates of a very small sampling: only two subjects. \n \n The Consumer Reports test also used a consumer-grade heart rate monitor. \n \n The Fitbit representative added, ""We stand behind our heart-rate monitoring technology and all our products, and continue to believe the plaintiffs\' allegations do not have any merit."" \n \n Alex Montoye , an\u200e assistant professor of clinical exercise physiology at Ball State University, has tested several wearables including Fitbit and says he is not surprised by the study results. He is not involved in the class-action suit. \n \n ""The (Fitbits) give a pretty decent ballpark estimate of activity levels, but these are difficult elements to measure perfectly,"" Montoye said. \n \n To the company\'s credit, Montoye said, Fitbit technical specifications don\'t claim 100% accuracy. He noted that the company uses words like ""track"" rather than ""measure"" your steps. But the website does promise that you can ""accurately track calorie burn all day,"" ""check real-time heart rate"" and ""use simplified heart rate zones to tailor your workouts on the spot"" or ""see when your health is improving by analyzing your all-day and resting heart rate trends."" \n \n ""You shouldn\'t think you are buying a medical-grade device, and the company never says that,"" Montoye said. \n \n People who buy them, though, may have higher expectations. \n \n Montoye says some people in his campus exercise program have complained that they went to the grocery store but didn\'t get credit for their steps because they were pushing a cart. The device relies in part on a change in motion, and for the motion pattern to recognize a step, it must be large enoug h. Pushing a cart or even walking on a soft surface like a plush carpet may undercount your movement. It can also overcount your steps if you are riding on a bumpy road, according to Fitbit\'s website. \n \n Montoye said for participants who need to track their heart rate he advises using a different device that is more specific. \n \n Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter. \n \n ""If they had just been honest,"" Selbin said, ""and said it can give you a ballpark figure most of the time, or if the marketing emphasized that you can use these when you are aspiring to be healthier, that would have been OK, but that\'s not how they market it, and they charge a premium for it.""', 'The suit accusing President Donald Trump and his children of convincing consumers to invest in get-rich-quick schemes names Trump, Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, Ivanka Trump and the Trump Corporation as defendants. | Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images Legal Lawsuit accuses Trump family of peddling phony get-rich schemes \n \n A new lawsuit filed in federal court Monday accuses President Donald Trump and his children of convincing consumers to invest in get-rich-quick schemes, while also accepting “large, secret payments” from the companies they were pitching. \n \n The complaint landed a week before a congressional midterm election that Trump has called a referendum on his presidency. It was filed on behalf of four unnamed plaintiffs by lawyers Roberta Kaplan and Andrew Celli, both donors to Democrat Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign, and is being funded by Tesseract Research Center, a progressive group led by Morris Pearl, a former managing director of investment giant BlackRock. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n “This case is about four working-class Americans, and thousands more just like them, who were deliberately defrauded by Donald J. Trump, his family, and the corporation that bears their name,"" the legal filing states. \n \n A spokesman for Kaplan confirmed Tesseract’s involvement but gave no additional comment. \n \n The suit names Trump, Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, Ivanka Trump and the Trump Corporation as defendants.

""The Message was materially false. The Investments did not — and could not — offer a reasonable probability of success,"" the lawsuit states. \n \n In one example, between 2005 and at least 2015, Trump claimed that an investment in a multi-level-marketing company called American Communications Network, or ACN, was “without any of the risks most entrepreneurs have to take” and that its flagship product was doing $500 million in annual sales, even though those claims were false, the lawsuit states. \n \n At the same time Trump was endorsing ACN, he also secretly received “millions of dollars in secret payments” from the company in the form of speaking fees and appearances, according to the complaint. Trump featured prominently in the company’s magazine and blog and attended at least 14 events in the U.S. and overseas, the lawsuit states. \n \n “Trump spent years cultivating a brand for himself based on the impression that he was a successful entrepreneur,” the suit claims. “Defendants conducted the affairs of their enterprise as a fraudulent scheme to leverage that brand, and use a series of false and misleading statements and omissions, to ensnare vulnerable consumers.” \n \n Plaintiffs include the pseudonymous Jane Doe, a hospice caregiver from California who the lawsuit says invested in ACN after seeing clips of Trump praising the company on his reality television show. The complaint says she paid $499 to register with ACN and spent thousands of dollars to attend events and motivational rallies, but she earned a total of $38 after two years. \n \n The other three plaintiffs saw no return from their investments, according to the complaint. \n \n Trump and his companies have been accused of fraud in the past. In November 2016, he agreed to pay $25 million to settle lawsuits against Trump University. \n \n The new case, Jane Doe v. The Trump Corp., was filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.']",2,"– The heart rate tracker technology in fancier models of Fitbit starts to become inaccurate when people start exercising, according to a study included in an amended class-action lawsuit against the company. In a press release, plaintiffs' lawyers say California State Polytechnic University put both Fitbits and ECG sensors on 43 separate subjects tested for 65 minutes of moderate to high-intensity exercise, and found that the PurePulse technology in the Fitbits had an ""extremely weak correlation"" with the heart rate recorded by the ECGs. The researchers say the Fitbit measurement was up to 20 beats per minute off during exercise. In some cases, Fitbits on both wrists recorded different rates—and heart rates of zero were recorded on subjects who were definitely not zombies. Fitbit argues that the study, which was funded by the lawyers, ""lacks scientific rigor and is the product of flawed methodology."" The company notes that the ECGs were consumer-grade ones, not clinical devices. Alex Montoye, an assistant professor of clinical exercise physiology at Ball State University tells CNN that his own research has found that Fitbits are pretty good at giving a ""ballpark estimate of activity levels, but these are difficult elements to measure perfectly."" He says the Fitbit is not a medical device and doesn't claim to be one, which is why the company tends to use words like ""track"" instead of ""measure"" in marketing materials and never promises 100% accuracy.

143,"['With reports of car fires and other bad news driving the price of Tesla Motors shares down 30% from its all time high reached almost six weeks ago, is this the time to start buying into the electric car company? \n \n Not yet, said Efraim Levy, a S&P Capital IQ equity analyst. Levy is maintaining his sell recommendation even though the shares are trading at $135.57 Friday morning, down about 4% from Thursday\'s close and below his $140 target price. \n \n “People are watching like hawks for anything to happen to this company,” Levy said. “There is such intense scrutiny.” \n \n Tesla, which for most of the year has been one of Wall Street’s best performing stocks, has faced brisk head winds this week. \n \n On Thursday the automaker confirmed that a fire burned up one of its $70,000-plus Model S hatchbacks. It was the third such incident in five weeks and triggered calls for a federal safety investigation. \n \n ""There is no question that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration should start looking at this,"" said Clarence Ditlow, executive director for the Center for Auto Safety. \n \n Meanwhile, car shopping website and auto reviewer Edmunds.com said its has encountered mechanical problems in its Tesla that have forced the replacement of numerous parts, including the entire drivetrain. \n \n A battery supply bottleneck, heavy research and development spending and declining sales of lucrative environmental credits also have created head winds for the Palo Alto automaker. \n \n Earlier in the week Tesla said it lost $38.5 million, or 32 cents a share, in the third quarter. That compares with a loss of $110.8 million, or $1.05 a share, in the same period last year. \n \n “Headlines of fire are never good from a marketing perspective,” Levy said. \n \n He noted that all three incidents were triggered by accidents rather than an internal issue with the vehicles. Levy said that once an automaker starts to have thousands of cars on the road – Tesla has sold almost 17,000 cars in the U.S. this year – fires and other incidents are bound to happen. \n \n Levy still believes that Tesla is an innovative automaker that is carving out a strong brand and that it makes sense to value the company more like a technology company and growth story rather than a mature automaker. \n \n “But if there are more fires the stock won’t be so hot,” Levy said. \n \n Follow me on Twitter (@LATimesJerry), Facebook and Google+. \n \n ALSO: \n \n Consumer Reports cuts Camry from picks list \n \n White is the new white.

A class-action suit announced yesterday accuses the company of misleading investors on safety issues, reports the San Francisco Chronicle. The suit follows a Model S fire on Wednesday in Tennessee, the third such fire in six weeks. The latest happened when the driver ran over a tow hitch, which punctured the electric car's battery pack. The suit says the vehicle “suffered from material defects which caused the battery pack to ignite and erupt in flames under certain driving conditions.” It seeks to cover anyone who bought stock from May 10 through Wednesday. In that span, Tesla stock went from $77 to a peak of $193 in September to its close of $138 on Friday. Of course, with the stock dropping, a Los Angeles Times article raises the question, Is it a good time to buy? The short answer from one analyst is not yet. As more Teslas hit the road and presumably get involved in more accidents, it's likely we're going to be reading about more fires until a fix is in place."

As a direct result of the Durbin Amendment, consumers have started paying for financial services they previously enjoyed free of charge. Unfortunately, this proves that whenever government tries to control pricing of a product or service, consumers lose.” \n \n \n \n OBAMA ON BANK OF AMERICA - From the ABC interview: “This is exactly why we need this Consumer Finance Protection Bureau that we set up that is ready to go ... This is exactly why we need somebody who's sole job it is to prevent this kind of stuff from happening. ...

But it’s nothing if not totally transparent. And there are still plenty of banks to which customers can transfer their money if they want out.

What Bank of America has done is an outrage ... \n \n \n \n “It is particularly hard to believe this fee would come from a bank with a track record like Bank of America. After helping to drive our economy off the cliff's edge in 2008, Bank of America was happy to accept a $45 billion federal bailout for their stupidity, their greed, and their stupidity and it was just as happy to take that money and hand out $3.3 billion in employee bonuses in the same year 2008.” Durbin letter to BofA CEO Brian Moynihan: http://politi.co/mXz2tc \n \n \n \n BofA RESPONSE - From spokesman Lawrence Di Rita: “Most of the major banks in the United States are moving toward assigning a charge for debit card use. ...

As you might imagine, most on the economy. And a lot of anger out there. There\'s so many people who simply don\'t think they\'re better off than they were four years ago. How do you convince them that they are? \n \n PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, I don\'t think they\'re better off than they were four years ago. They\'re not better off than they were before Lehman\'s collapse, before the financial crisis-- before this extraordinary recession we\'re going through. I think that-- what we\'ve seen is that we\'ve been able to make steady progress to stabilize the economy. But the unemployment rate is still way too high. And that\'s why it\'s so critical for us to make sure that we are taking every action we can take to put people back to work. And the American Jobs Act, the bill that I put before Congress three weeks ago puts construction workers back to work rebuilding our roads and bridges, it puts teachers back in the classroom, teaching our kids, makes sure that veterans-- are getting a break-- if they come home and are looking for a job with a small business, provides everybody a tax cut, small businesses and middle class families alike so that we\'ve got more consumers out there with a little more confidence, a little more money in their pockets. You know, these are ideas that historically have been supported by Democrats and Republicans. \n \n GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: As you might have heard in the last hour, the Republican leader in the house, Eric Cantor, said he\'s not going to schedule a clean bill-- this all or nothing approach, he said, is unreasonable. \n \n PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, look, what he needs to do is to tell us what exactly he\'s for. Because what I\'ve done is put forward what economists say can increase our growth by close to two percent and put 1.9 million people-- ultimately back to work. Now if he\'s got other ideas, we\'re happy to look at those other ideas. But what-- what I think the American people cannot abide by is us doing nothing. We can\'t sit here and pretend that somehow-- you know, Washington just cutting spending, in and of itself, is going to be putting people back to work. \n \n GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: ...pass the tax cuts and the trade bills, is that enough? \n \n PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, we\'re going to be passing the trade bills. And I\'m pleased we\'re doing that. Because that actually will add jobs-- you know, the trade bill not only is for Korea, but also Panama and Colombia. All these countries, right now, are able to sell into the United States. We have one of the most open markets in the world. Theirs are still a little too closed. And as I\'ve said before, I want-- I don\'t mind Kias and Hyundais sold here, as long as Chryslers and-- and Fords are being sold-- in Korea, as well. So I\'m glad that\'s an area of bipartisan agreement, but it\'s not enough by itself. There\'s more that we can do. And, you know, for example, you talk to Republican governors, Republican mayors, and they\'ll tell you that the need for them to rebuild roads and bridges, including some-- you know, that-- I visited in-- in-- in Virginia, but also-- some that I\'ve visited-- between Kentucky and Ohio, where-- both-- Mr. Boehner and Mr. McConnell hail from-- those are projects that need to happen anyway. Why not do them now at a time when we\'ve got construction workers out of work, contractors-- are able to come in under budget, on time. This is the time to do it. \n \n GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: We have a brand new poll out at ABC. It\'s just coming out-- later today, showing the majority of Americans, 55 percent, think you\'ll be a one-term president. Are you the underdog now? \n \n PRESIDENT OBAMA: Absolutely. The-- because-- you know, given the economy, there\'s no doubt that, you know, whatever happens on your watch, you\'ve got-- \n \n GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: You embraced that pretty quickly. \n \n PRESIDENT OBAMA: You-- you-- you know, I-- I don\'t mind. I-- I\'m used to being an underdog. And-- and I think that-- at the end of the day, though, what people are going to say is, ""Who\'s got a vision for the future? That can actually help ordinary families recapture that American dream?"" When I ran in 2008, the basic idea was that-- you know, ordinary folks, who are working hard, you know, doing everything right, just weren\'t getting ahead. Wages, incomes had flat-lined, costs were going up, everything from health care to college education. And-- you know, the whole approach of everything I\'ve tried to do over the last three years is to say, ""What are those big changes that we have to make so that our kids are getting the best education, we\'ve got the best infrastructure in the world, we\'ve got the tools that allow us to succeed again?"" \n \n GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: We actually got a great question on Twitter about 2008. It\'s from Gale Glover, and he asks, ""If hope and change define the 2008 campaign, what two words are going to make-- are going to define 2012?"" \n \n PRESIDENT OBAMA: I-- you know, I haven\'t quite boiled it down to a bumper sticker yet. But I think what\'ll-- define 2012 is-- you know, our vision for the future. That\'s three words. Four. \n \n GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: It\'s five, actually. \n \n PRESIDENT OBAMA: ...Vision for the future. Four. There is-- going to be a contest of values and-- and vision in 2012. Nobody\'s going to deny that we\'re not where we need to be. That the economy is not producing enough jobs that pay well and give people-- a leg up on life. And so the question is, ""What\'s most likely to get us there?"" Now there are going to be some folks who make the argument that if you just slash spending, eliminate regulations that prevent us from polluting our air or polluting our water or, you know, we bust labor unions, that that in and of itself is going to restore the American dream. I don\'t think most Americans believe that. I think they understand that we\'ve got to invest in making sure we\'ve got the best education system possible, that we\'ve got to invest in basic research. That part of what made us an economic superpower was we had the best technology, the best infrastructure, and that government has some role to play in that. And so the question\'s going to be-- you know, which vision is more persuasive to the American people? \n \n GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: One of your potential opponents, Chris Christie, governor of New Jersey, very tough speech at the Reagan Library last week. He said-- you don\'t have the courage to lead. He called you a bystander in the Oval Office. And I want to get this right, because it-- what he ended up saying is that-- you haven\'t brought people together. Now you\'re going to divide them. And he asked, ""What happened to State Senator Obama? When did he decide to become one of the dividers he spoke of so eloquently in 2004?"" \n \n PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, look-- you know, if the guy\'s thinking about running for president, he\'s going to say a lot of stuff. And I think in the Republican primaries-- saying nasty stuff about me is probably-- polls pretty well-- \n \n GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: --he basically says he did in New Jersey, brought people together, which you haven\'t been able to do in Washington. \n \n PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well-- you know, I\'m not sure that-- folks in New Jersey necessarily would agree with that. But here\'s-- here\'s the broader point. I don\'t think that the American people would dispute that at every step of the way, I have done everything I can to try to get the Republican Party to work with me to deal with what is the biggest crisis of our lifetimes. And each time, all we\'ve got from them is ""no."" I think-- the-- the-- you\'re not going to get too much dispute about that, whether-- \n \n GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: How is that going to change in the next-- \n \n PRESIDENT OBAMA: --the-- well, the-- you know, the way it\'s going to change is because the American people are gonna have the say about where we want to go, you know? They\'re going to have a decision to make. And they\'re going to say to themselves, ""You know what? President Obama wanted to reduce the deficit by not only cutting spending, as he\'s already done, but also by making sure that-- the most fortunate in our society are paying their fair share. That we\'re closing corporate loopholes that small businesses don\'t get. The Republicans have said no to that."" Well, that\'s a contrast in approaches. And-- you know, when you tick down which approach the American people generally prefer, they\'ll say mine. Now what they\'ll say is, ""He hasn\'t been able to get it through Congress."" And, you know, I-- I\'m the first one to acknowledge that-- the relations between myself and-- the Republican Congress have not been good over the last several months, but it\'s not for a lack of effort. It has to do with the fact that-- you know, they\'ve made a decision to follow-- what is a pretty-- extreme approach to governance. \n \n GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: You might have a new issue on your plate over the weekend. Bank of America now is doing a $5 service fee for using your debit cards. Drawing-- a lot of outrage, a lot of questions. And basically the questions boil down to what Vikki Manko of Naperville, Illinois asks. ""These are the types of things government should get involved in and put a stop to."" Can you put a stop to that? \n \n PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well-- what we did was we put a stop through-- The Financial Reform Act of them charging fees-- for credit cards. \n \n GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: And the banks are saying-- \n \n PRESIDENT OBAMA: And so-- Well-- what-- what the banks are saying is-- that ""Rather than take a little bit less of a profit. Rather than paying multimillion dollar bonuses. Let\'s treat our customers right."" And this is exactly why we need this consumer finance-- protection bureau that we set up that is ready to go. And what we need is a confirmation of the person I\'ve appointed, Rich Cordray treasurer of Ohio. Back in Ohio, Republicans and Democrats both think he\'s terrific and he\'s fair. But this is exactly why we need somebody who\'s sole job it is to prevent this kind of stuff from happening. \n \n GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Can you stop this service charge? \n \n PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, you can stop it because it-- if you-- if you say to the banks, ""You don\'t have some inherent right just to-- you know, get a certain amount of profit. If your customers-- are being mistreated. That you have to treat them fairly and transparently."" And-- and my hope is is that you\'re going to see a bunch of-- the banks, who say to themselves, ""You know what? This is actually not good business practice."" Banks can make money. They can succeed, the old-fashioned way, by earning it. By lending to small businesses. By lending to consumers. By making sure that-- you know, we are building the economy together. But-- you know, without the kinds of protections that we\'re starting to see the Republicans try to roll back-- we\'re going to continue to have these kinds of problems. And this is exactly-- the sort of stuff that folks are frustrated by. This, by the way, is an example of the-- the contrasting visions that we have. If-- if-- if-- the Republican Party believes that we should do nothing to curb abuses on Wall Street and roll back regulations put in place to prevent the next big financial crisis, well, I\'ve got a big difference with them. And I think the American people are going to be on my side on that. \n \n GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Your White House has faced a lot of questions on Solyndra, the-- solar panel company you paid a visit to back in 2010. You really held it up then as a model for jobs and clean energy. Do you regret that? \n \n PRESIDENT OBAMA: No, I don\'t, because if you look at the overall portfolio of loan guarantees that have been provided-- overall, it\'s doing well. And what we always understood was that not every single business is going to succeed in clean energy. But if we want to compete with China, which is pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into this space. If we want to compete with other countries that are heavily subsidizing the industries of the future, we\'ve got to make sure that our guys here in the United States of America at least have a shot. Now there are gonna be some failures, and Solyndra\'s an example. \n \n GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: --getting warnings not to back that company up, not to visit. \n \n PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well-- you know, it-- hindsight is always 20/20. It went through the regular review process. And people felt like this was a good bet. But the fact of the matter is-- is that if we don\'t get behind clean energy, if we don\'t get behind advanced battery manufacturing, if we\'re not the ones who are creating the cars of the future, then we\'re not going to be able to make stuff here in the United States of America. And one of the most important things that I want to do over the next several years is restore a sense that America can manufacture, but we don\'t just purchase stuff from someplace else, but we\'re also exporting to other countries. \n \n GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Let me ask you about Al Qaeda-- following the killing on Friday of Anwar Awlaki. Back in July-- Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta said that the strategic defeat of Al Qaeda is within reach. This as we approach the tenth anniversary of the invasion of Afghanistan. How close are we to that strategic defeat? \n \n PRESIDENT OBAMA: You know, I think that we have done more in the last couple of years-- than any time in the last ten years-- to bring that about. Obviously, the most prominent-- case was-- us getting Bin Laden. But when you look at that entire leadership tier of Al Qaeda, they have been decimated. And-- they are-- rapidly approaching the point where they just cannot replace trained, skilled operatives-- \n \n GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: --attack on our homeland? \n \n PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well-- you know, I think that-- given the nature of our open society, we\'re always going to be vulnerable-- to the possible terrorist attack. But for them to be able to mount something that is a big project with a lot of financing, that is very difficult for them to do now. They\'re still dangerous. They\'re still our number one enemy. We\'ve got to make sure that we-- don\'t let up. But I think that we are in a position where over the next couple of years, if we stay on it, that-- it\'s gonna be very difficult for them to mount the kinds of spectacular attacks-- that we saw on 9/11. \n \n GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: You gave a pretty passionate speech at the Human Rights Campaign fund Saturday night. And said that every single American deserves to be treated equally in the eyes of the law. Is that possible without legal gay marriage? \n \n PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, I-- you know, I think that it is certainly possible for us to make sure that-- not only can they serve in our military, but we fully support them. That-- hospital visitation is available-- to gay and lesbian partners. That they\'re not discriminated-- against on the job. Being gay or lesbian is not a fireable offense. That at minimum, that gays and lesbians have strong civil unions that provide the same kinds of protections. \n \n GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: At minimum? \n \n PRESIDENT OBAMA: At minimum. \n \n GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: So you\'ve said your position is evolving. You said you\'re struggling with it. What more do you need to know? \n \n PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well-- you know-- I probably won\'t-- make news right now, George. But I-- I think that there\'s no doubt that-- as I see-- friends, families-- children of gay couples-- who are thriving-- you know, that-- that has an impact on how I think about these issues. It\'s also one of the reasons that I made the decision for us not to defend-- The Defense of Marriage Act, which-- I believe violated the Constitution. And, you know, is going to be-- decided in the courts probably-- in the next-- next few terms. \n \n GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: You think you\'ll change your mind before the election? \n \n PRESIDENT OBAMA: You know-- I-- I\'m-- I\'m-- still working on it. \n \n GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: And you\'re not going to tell it\'s how long it\'s going to take? (LAUGH) Let me just finish up with a couple personal questions. We got a lot of those-- on Yahoo, as well. A lot of people want to know-- first of all, I should say happy anniversary. \n \n PRESIDENT OBAMA: Thank you so much. 19 years. \n \n GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: 19 years. And they want to know what is the best single piece of advice Michelle has given you? \n \n PRESIDENT OBAMA: You know, that when all is said and done-- the mark of success is do you have children who are happy and healthy and-- able to go out there and function as responsible-- loving people. And-- so far so good. You know, I-- I think in-- in this business-- as is true for a lot of professionals, I think-- you love your kids, but you always got these distractions and they\'re always-- things tugging at you. And Michelle very early on-- being that anchor that says, ""No, no, you know, if we\'ve got-- a parent/teacher conference--"" \n \n GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: You\'re gonna be there. \n \n PRESIDENT OBAMA: ""--we\'re gonna be there."" At soccer games. You know, Sasha may say it doesn\'t matter, but it does. That steady drumbeat-- from Michelle-- was exactly right. And-- it-- it\'s-- it\'s part of the reason why, I think-- not only are the kids doing well, but-- it-- it provides me-- just a constant source of joy and-- and sustenance. \n \n GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Four years is a long time in kids\' years. \n \n PRESIDENT OBAMA: Yeah. \n \n GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: They were pretty little during the-- the last campaign. How do you protect them? This time around, when everybody\'s saying all these bad things about you? \n \n PRESIDENT OBAMA: You know, so far so good. I mean, partly because-- they don\'t watch-- they don\'t watch news. Although, the-- you know, they\'re starting to read. \n \n GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: On the internet, right? \n \n PRESIDENT OBAMA: They-- they\'re starting to go on the internet. I think that the thing we worry about has less to do with-- them hearing folks say mean stuff about me, which-- \n \n GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: They don\'t have to answer them. \n \n PRESIDENT OBAMA: They-- they-- they don\'t-- they don\'t-- they know who their daddy is. And-- and they\'re not worried about that. The thing I do worry about is trying to figure out that balance of making sure they\'ve got space to make mistakes, be teenagers, et cetera. But obviously, they\'re not-- typical-- in some ways. So they\'re still having sleepovers. And they\'re still going to the mall. And they\'re still going to movies. But they\'ve got this guy with a gun following them around! And-- and-- and so just-- just trying to make sure that that space is maintained. We\'ve been able to do it so far. Our secret service detail is terrific about it. But it-- it\'s a balance that has to be struck. \n \n GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Finally, since we are on the web here-- live on Yahoo.com, everyone wants to know which-- websites do you surf? \n \n PRESIDENT OBAMA: You know, I\'m pretty eclectic. You know, I\'ll-- you know, I read a lot of newspapers that I used to read in print, I now read on-- on the web. \n \n GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Do you have an iPad or just-- \n \n PRESIDENT OBAMA: I-- I\'ve got an iPad. And-- and-- Steve Jobs actually gave it to me-- a little bit early. And-- (LAUGH) \n \n GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Oh, that\'s pretty cool. \n \n PRESIDENT OBAMA: Yeah, it was cool. I got it directly from him. And-- you know, I go to ABCNews.com, of course, and Yahoo. \n \n GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: And Yahoo, too, thank you. \n \n PRESIDENT OBAMA: Of course. But-- you know, typically, my-- I-- I-- I read on the web what I read in hard copy. I mean, there-- there are some exceptions. There are some blogs and some websites that-- that are interesting that-- you don\'t have-- \n \n GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: --make a comment. \n \n PRESIDENT OBAMA: I-- you know-- I don\'t. I-- I figure if I-- if I got started-- I wouldn\'t stop. And I\'ve got other things to do. \n \n GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Mr. President, thanks for your time. \n \n PRESIDENT OBAMA: I appreciate it. Thank you so much. \n \n GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: And thanks to all of you for joining us on Yahoo.com and ABCNews.com. If you missed any of it, you can get it any time on either website. Take care.', 'A small Washington community is mourning the death of a beloved street performer who, at only 10 years old, wowed crowds and impressed professionals with magic tricks and circus performances. \n \n Caleb ""Flip"" Kors, who was fatally injured in a hanging accident at his home Monday evening and died Tuesday, was famous on the streets of Bellingham, Wash. \n \n ""He was an amazing kid. Incredible,"" said Strangely Doesburg, Kors\' circus instructor and mentor. ""A kid can learn to juggle and do partner acrobatics and mime or whatever, and those are all things I was teaching him. But he brought this boundless enthusiasm for interacting with other people. Caleb at 10 could read a person or crowd and see what they needed and take them to a special place. He could say, \'Hey I\'m going to juggle.Be a part of this with me.\'"" \n \n Police released few details about the death, which they say happened accidentally in his room, amid some assembled acrobatic equipment. The official cause of death would not be known until the medical examiner reports back, according to the Whatcom County Sheriff\'s Department. Doesburg said that Kors was not practicing any circus tricks at the time of his death. \n \n ""He was a little monkey. He liked to climb, and he fell. We don\'t know what happened exactly,"" Doesburg said. \n \n Doesburg, who said the family has asked him to speak on its behalf, said that more than 30 people gathered at a Seattle area hospital Tuesday after Kors was airlifted there from the local medical center. When the medical staff came to deliver the news to the large group, they had to find a larger conference room to accommodate all of Kors\' supporters, he said. \n \n ""That says not only how great a kid he was, but how many people were touched by him,"" Doesburg said. ""People drove four hours to be there. People got on planes."" \n \n The circus group that Kors was a part of, the Bellingham Circus Guild, was deeply shaken by the loss, Doesburg said. \n \n ""We used to have a running joke, you know, that if anything happened to his parents, God forbid, we would adopt him. Collectively, as a group,"" he said. ""It\'s horrendous."" \n \n Kors went to weekly drop-in classes at the Guild as well as private lessons and became friendly with the performers. He and another 10-year-old choreographed their own clown show that they performed with Doesburg last year. \n \n ""He had a way of turning an area of pavement into this special little place, a little theater. Everyone watching felt like they were part of it,"" Doesburg said. \n \n The Guild, which puts on a performance on the 15th of each month, said it will use this week\'s performance as a fundraiser for the Kors family, including Caleb\'s parents and two older brothers. Doesburg said he was planning his own performance to kick start a memorial scholarship for performing arts students in the area, and other friends and community members were rallying to hold other memorials and fundraisers. \n \n ""It\'s only been two days, I know, but part of processing this is trying to turn it into something good. And the family is supporting all of these initiatives a lot,"" Doesburg said.']",4,"– President Obama made waves in his latest interview with George Stephanopoulos of ABC, in which he spoke out against Bank of America’s unpopular new $5 fee for debit card users. “This is exactly why we need this Consumer Finance Protection Bureau,” Obama said. Asked directly if he could stop it, he replied, “You can stop it … if you say to the banks, ‘You don’t have some inherent right just to get a certain amount of profit if your customers are being mistreated.'"" That drew a rebuke from the American Bankers Association, which called it “disappointing and puzzling that the president would attack a private corporation for responding to government price fixing,” according to Politico. That’s not the only soundbite generating interest: Asked if Americans were better off than they were four years ago—the line Ronald Reagan used to defeat Jimmy Carter—Obama replied, “They’re not better off than they were before Lehman’s collapse, before the financial crisis. ... The unemployment rate is still way too high.”"
145,"['For First Time In 130 Years, More Young Adults Live With Parents Than With Partners \n \n Enlarge this image toggle caption Education Images/UIG via Getty Images Education Images/UIG via Getty Images \n \n For the first time in more than 130 years, Americans ages 18-34 are more likely to live with their parents than in any other living situation, according to a new analysis by the Pew Research Center. \n \n In that age group, 32.1 percent of people live in their parents\' house, while 31.6 live with a spouse or partner in their own homes and 14 percent live alone, as single parents or in a home with roommates or renters. The rest live with another family member, a nonfamily member or in group-living situations such as a college dorm or prison. \n \n toggle caption Pew Research Center/NPR \n \n Pew notes that this is not a record high percentage for the number of young people living at home — in 1940, for instance, approximately 35 percent of people in that age range lived at home. \n \n But back then, living with a spouse or partner was even more popular than that. Today not so: More people choose an alternative living situation, and out of the crowded field of choices, life with Mom and/or Dad has become the top pick for millennials. \n \n Well — some millennials. Men, for starters. \n \n American men ages 18-34 live with their parents 35 percent of the time, and with a spouse or partner 28 percent of the time. For women, the numbers are nearly reversed; 35 percent live with a partner, while 29 percent live with their parents. \n \n Living with mom or dad: More common for sons than daughters https://t.co/7SxlYSwEBi pic.twitter.com/gQTFUJZKiU — Pew Research Center (@pewresearch) May 24, 2016 \n \n Less educated young adults are also more likely to live with their parents than are their college-educated counterparts — no surprise, Pew notes, given the financial prospects in today\'s economy. \n \n Black and Hispanic young people, compared with white people, are in the same situation. \n \n For black people in particular, the ""new"" milestone isn\'t so new at all. Black young adults have been more likely to live with their parents than in any other situation since 1980. Today, 36 percent of black millennials live with their parents, while 17 percent live with a spouse or partner. \n \n Meanwhile, taken as a whole, women, white people, Asian/Pacific Islanders and people with bachelor\'s degrees are still more likely to live with spouses or partners than with their parents. \n \n But the overall trend is the same for every demographic group — living with parents is increasingly common. \n \n (Young Americans are still less likely to live with their parents than their southern European friends. In Macedonia, more than 70 percent of 18- to 34-year-olds reportedly live at home, Pew says.) \n \n For many millennials, Pew\'s conclusions might seem both unsurprising and easy to explain: The Great Recession happened, of course! \n \n But the rise in the number of young adults living at home started before the economic crash — and so did the possible contributing factors. Male unemployment has been on the rise for decades, Pew says. Even those who have jobs are making less than they would have in their parents\' day — for young men, Pew notes, inflation-adjusted wages have been falling since 1970. \n \n And then fewer young people are married than in decades past. Even accounting for the increased popularity of cohabitation, there are just fewer paired-up 20-somethings and 30-somethings than there used to be. \n \n In general, the study shows how dramatically the living situations of 18- to 34-year-olds have changed since 1880, when the data begin. \n \n Living alone, as a single parent, or with roommates — once a rarity — is now the choice of 14 percent of people in that age group. And a full 25 percent of young men are now living with other family, nonfamily or group quarters. \n \n Male prosperity rose steadily, and more and more men left the nest — until the \'60s and \'70s, when wages started to drop and more men stayed home. \n \n And women? For decades women who worked were more likely to live with their parents than with a partner or spouse — because wives were discouraged from having jobs, per Pew\'s straightforward interpretation. \n \n But now more and more young women have jobs, and it\'s unemployed women who are more likely to live with their parents. And yet, even as female prosperity rose, so did the number of young women living at home. \n \n Pew speculated it might because of men\'s lower earnings keeping women from marrying and moving out.

Considering all that, it's ""rather financially prudent"" for millennials to stay with mom and dad longer, a situation that's not all that unusual in the rest of the world, she writes. But her bigger message is for those ""crusty"" baby boomers complaining about a lack of character in the younger set: ""Well, boohoo.""

146,"['Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell walk to the Senate floor Wednesday. | John Shinkle/POLITICO Congressional leaders reach budget deal The agreement would raise stiff spending caps and help stave off a shutdown. \n \n Congressional leaders on Wednesday clinched a two-year deal to lift strict budget caps on defense and domestic spending, likely putting an end to a series of short-term spending bills and shutdown fights that have defined Washington the past few months. \n \n The deal is expected to increase defense and domestic spending by roughly $300 billion over two years, according to administration and congressional sources, as well as lift the debt ceiling through the election and include tens of billions of dollars in disaster aid. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n ""This bill is the product of extensive negotiations among congressional leaders and the White House. No one thinks this bill is perfect. But we worked hard to find common ground and stay focused on serving the American people,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said in announcing the agreement. \n \n ""The budget deal doesn’t have everything Democrats want. It doesn’t have everything the Republicans want. But it has a great deal of what the American people want,"" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.). ""After months of legislative logjams, this budget deal is a genuine breakthrough."" \n \n The most reliable politics newsletter.

You can unsubscribe at any time. \n \n The Senate is expected vote on the pact on Thursday, according to Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas). It\'s likely to pass easily, but House approval will be a tougher lift. \n \n And though President Donald Trump suggested that the government could shut down without action on immigration, a top White House aide signaled that Trump supports the bill. \n \n “I’m not going to say every piece of it. But obviously, we’re excited about the defense numbers,"" said Marc Short, the White House legislative director. \n \n Trump tweeted in support of the deal a few hours later. \n \n ""The Budget Agreement today is so important for our great Military,"" he wrote. ""It ends the dangerous sequester and gives Secretary Mattis what he needs to keep America Great. Republicans and Democrats must support our troops and support this Bill!"" \n \n The agreement would increase defense spending this year by $80 billion and domestic spending by $63 billion beyond strict budget caps, according to a summary of the deal obtained by POLITICO. Next year, defense spending would increase by $85 billion and domestic funding by $68 billion beyond the caps. The deal also includes $140 billion for defense and $20 billion for domestic in emergency spending over two years. \n \n A plan to lift the debt limit, which requires action in the coming weeks, and whether to extend expiring tax provisions were among the few outstanding issues that could be attached to the deal, according to aides in both parties familiar with the talks. Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) said the debt ceiling is likely to be suspended through next March in tandem with the budget deal. Cornyn said nearly $90 billion of disaster aid for wildfires and hurricane damage will also be included. \n \n For such a large package to be passed before funding expires, all 100 senators will need to agree to speedy action on the spending bill and budget package. Any one senator can object to moving forward and derail the leaders’ plan, though McConnell said it is unlikely that the budget deal would fall apart at this late stage. \n \n Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who opposes the deal, said he hasn\'t decided whether he would deny a swift vote — and potentially cause a government shutdown. \n \n McConnell briefed the Senate GOP on the contours of the deal at a party lunch Wednesday, and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) also read in his members across the Capitol. Both GOP leaders faced pushback, but allies exuded confidence the budget deal will be on Trump\'s desk by Thursday evening. \n \n ""The House, and Republicans in the Senate and some Democrats in the Senate, are totally committed to increasing defense. And you weren\'t going to increase defense successfully without a big increase in nondefense,"" Blunt said. \n \n poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201802/844/1155968404_5728192221001_5728191585001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404"" true \n \n ""I\'ve got mixed feelings,"" said Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.). “This has been a hard-fought negotiation. I think our leadership really worked hard. It’s obviously not our leadership’s first preference, but we had to work it out with the other side."" \n \n Support from GOP defense hawks, especially in the House, will be critical in passing the bill. Senate Armed Services Chairman John McCain (R-Ariz.) — at home in Arizona while being treated for brain cancer — and House Armed Services Chairman Mac Thornberry (R-Texas) came out strongly in support of the package. \n \n ""This budget agreement is indispensable for our national security,"" the two Republicans said in a joint statement. ""Without it, our military would not be able to defend our nation, as Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis and our military leaders have repeatedly warned."" \n \n However, the negotiations hit a major snag on Wednesday: House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said she cannot support any budget agreement without a commitment from Ryan to vote on an immigration bill to protect immigrants covered under the Deferred Action for Child Arrivals program. \n \n Still, McConnell and Schumer are bullish about success. The two Senate leaders, along with Ryan and Pelosi, have been engaged in high-level spending talks for weeks. \n \n If all goes according to plan, the Senate will amend a short-term spending bill passed by the House to include the deal to lift strict budget caps and send the package back for the House’s approval before a Thursday night deadline to fund the government.

What are you afraid of?"" \n \n ""Without a commitment from Speaker Ryan comparable to the commitment from Leader McConnell, this package does not have my support,"" Pelosi said.

The House passed a bill Tuesday funding the government until March 23, which would allow Congress to write a new spending bill for the rest of the year at levels set by the emerging budget deal, potentially avoiding more shutdown fights in an election year. \n \n Though Democrats were unable to secure complete parity in domestic spending alongside the big boost in military dollars, they were quick to note the agreement includes $20 billion for infrastructure, $5.8 billion for child care and $6 billion to fight opioid addiction. The bill also includes a two-year extension of expired Community Health Centers funding and a 10-year extension of Children\'s Health Insurance Plan funding. \n \n Separately, Schumer and McConnell have been discussing how the Senate will handle a debate on immigration to protect immigrants under DACA from deportation.

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite) (Associated Press) \n \n WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate\'s top leaders announced Wednesday they have sealed agreement on a two-year budget pact that would shower both the Pentagon and domestic programs with almost $300 billion above existing limits, giving wins to both GOP defense hawks and Democrats seeking billions for infrastructure projects and combatting opioid abuse. \n \n The agreement is likely to be added to a stopgap spending bill that passed the House on Tuesday and is aimed at averting a government shutdown Thursday at midnight. \n \n The plan also contains almost $90 billion in overdue disaster aid for hurricane-slammed Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico. \n \n And it would increase the government\'s borrowing cap to prevent a first-ever default on U.S. obligations that looms in just a few weeks. \n \n The House\'s top Democrat, however, swung out against the plan. \n \n House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California announced she would oppose the budget measure unless her chamber\'s GOP leaders promised a vote on legislation to protect ""Dreamer"" immigrants who face deportation after being brought to the U.S. illegally as children. \n \n The House on Tuesday passed legislation to keep the government running through March 23, marrying the stopgap spending measure with a $659 billion Pentagon spending plan, but the Senate plan would rewrite that measure. \n \n Senate Democratic leaders have dropped their strategy of using the funding fight to extract concessions on immigration, specifically on seeking extended protections for the ""Dreamer"" immigrants. Instead, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., went with a deal that would reap tens of billions of dollars for other priorities — including combatting opioids — while hoping to solve the immigration impasse later. \n \n The budget agreement would give both the Pentagon and domestic agencies relief from a budget freeze that lawmakers say threatens military readiness and training as well as domestic priorities such as combating opioid abuse and repairing the troubled health care system for veterans.', 'The order to destroy the missile should any part of it threaten to fall onto Japanese territory was issued after a meeting of the Security Council of Japan met and was informed that North Korea has begun filling a fuel tank alongside the launch pad at the Sohae Satellite Launching Station in preparation for the launch. \n \n Japan has already deployed Patriot Advanced Capability-3 missile batteries in Tokyo, as well as in Okinawa and at locations along the northern and western coasts facing the Korean Peninsula. \n \n Three Japanese destroyers equipped with the advanced Aegis detect-and-destroy weapons system have been deployed in the Sea of Japan. The US has also stationed warships in the area to monitor the launch. \n \n New satellite images released on Friday indicate that snow may have slowed the preparations, but Pyongyang shouuld still be ready for liftoff starting on Monday. \n \n Pyongyang claims the launch is an attempt to put an earth-observation satellite into orbit. But analysts and foreign governments share the belief that the it is part of North Korea’s development of long-range missiles. \n \n The head of US forces in Japan, Lt. Gen. Salvatore Angelella, said on Thursday that the launch threatens the stability of the region. \n \n “This is a very dangerous situation and we do not support those actions by North Korea,” he said. “We are monitoring the situation closely.” \n \n The government and military forces in South Korea have been placed on heightened alert, while the Philippines has expressed “serious concern” that the missile will violate resolution by the United Nations Security Council and called on Pyongyang “to reconsider its planned launch and abide by these resolutions, which call for the abandonment of its ballistic missile programme in a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner.”', 'Photo by Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images \n \n One of the few concrete foreign policy suggestions in this year’s State of the Union address is a call for Congress to “show the world that we are united in this mission by passing a resolution to authorize the use of force against ISIL,” using the White House’s preferred acronym for ISIS. \n \n Joshua Keating Joshua Keating is a staff writer at Slate focusing on international affairs and author of the forthcoming book, Invisible Countries. \n \n As I wrote in December, the White House is still relying on the Authorization for the Use of Force, or AUMF, against terrorism passed in the days following 9/11 to justify the airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. The president acknowledged more than a year and a half ago that the AUMF is long out of date. It’s particularly ill-suited to the fight against ISIS, a group that didn’t exist at the time of 9/11 and is at war with al-Qaida, the group the authorization was designed to combat. \n \n Advertisement \n \n \n \n Since the fight against ISIS began, the White House and Congress have been locked in an awkward dance, with both sides saying they want a resolution but neither taking concrete action to make it happen. “It’s a combination of the administration not being confident in whether it can get what it needs out of Congress and therefore not coming to Congress with a draft, and a Congress that isn’t eager to take up an issue that may later come back to bite them,” Rep. Adam Schiff of California told me. \n \n The White House is worried a new resolution would put unwelcome restrictions on the war, such as, if some Democrats get their way, prohibiting “boots on the ground,” or if some Republicans get their way, calling for the targeting of Syrian military forces. And, for now, the current arrangement has worked out fairly well for the White House. It maintains it can rely on the old AUMF for its operations while blaming Congress for the lack of a new one. Members of Congress, meanwhile, can avoid taking ownership of a war in which success is far from guaranteed. \n \n As the L.A. Times reported last week, though, the two sides came closer to an agreement over a new resolution at a recent meeting between Obama and Republican lawmakers at the White House. (Update: In a statement sent to reporters, Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), sponsor of an earlier draft AUMF and one of the most prominent voices in this debate, said he was ""disappointed [the president] did not signal an intention to send a draft to Congress for consideration"" and that ""congress as a whole will be better prepared to act with specific guidance from the administration."") The question going forward, and one that the sparse language in Tuesday’s address doesn’t answer, is whether any new ISIS authorization will revoke the previous AUMF, which has been interpreted far more broadly than the members of Congress who overwhelmingly supported it in 2001 could have imagined, and has been invoked to justify a decade’s worth of attacks against a wide range of terrorist targets in multiple countries. \n \n Another question that remains unanswered: How narrow will the new authorization be? “We do not think an AUMF should include a geographic limitation,” John Kerry told Congress in December, indicating that the new rules could be just as broad as the old ones.']",4,"– Congress is getting closer to avoiding another shutdown later this week.

147,"['A berm holding the flooded Missouri River back from a Nebraska nuclear power station collapsed early Sunday, but federal regulators said they were monitoring the situation and there was no danger. \n \n The Fort Calhoun Nuclear Station shut down in early April for refueling, and there is no water inside the plant, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission said. Also, the river is not expected to rise higher than the level the plant was designed to handle. NRC spokesman Victor Dricks said the plant remains safe. \n \n The federal commission had inspectors at the plant 20 miles (32 kilometers) north of Omaha when the 2,000-foot (610-meter) berm collapsed about 1:30 a.m. Sunday. Water surrounded the auxiliary and containment buildings at the plant, it said in a statement. \n \n The Omaha Public Power District has said the complex will not be reactivated until the flooding subsides. Its spokesman, Jeff Hanson, said the berm wasn\'t critical to protecting the plant but a crew will look at whether it can be patched. \n \n ""That was an additional layer of protection we put in,"" Hanson said. \n \n The berm\'s collapse didn\'t affect the reactor shutdown cooling or the spent fuel pool cooling, but the power supply was cut after water surrounded the main electrical transformers, the NRC said. Emergency generators powered the plant until an off-site power supply was connected Sunday afternoon, according to OPPD. \n \n NRC Chairman Gregory Jaczko said the loss of the berm at Fort Calhoun nuclear plant doesn\'t threaten the safety of the plant. \n \n ""There are other structures and systems in place that can ensure they will continue operating safely,"" Jaczko said. \n \n Jaczko will tour the Fort Calhoun plant Monday. His visit was scheduled last week. On Sunday, he toured Nebraska\'s other nuclear power plant, which sits along the Missouri River near Brownville. Cooper nuclear power plant is about 75 miles (120 kilometers) south of Omaha and run by the Nebraska Public Power District. \n \n Jaczko said he can\'t predict what the river will do this summer but that NPPD and OPPD seem to be taking appropriate steps to defend against flooding. \n \n Jaczko spent much of his tour of Cooper asking NPPD officials and the NRC\'s local inspectors questions about the plant and this year\'s flooding. He said his visit was designed to gather information. \n \n NPPD officials have been monitoring river levels closely during the flooding, and they have already brought in more than 5,000 tons of sand to build barricades protecting the Cooper plant, the onsite power substations and the plant\'s access roads. \n \n Accessing critical parts of the plant requires visitors to use ladders or steel stairs to climb over sandbag barriers both outside and inside the doors. When the Jaczko saw one of Cooper\'s two back-up diesel generators, he had to climb over three different sandbag barriers to get there. \n \n The Cooper plant remains dry because it sits at an elevation above the river level. The base of Cooper and its storage area for used nuclear fuel is 903 feet (275.23 meters) above sea level while on Sunday the river was just above 899 feet. \n \n Cooper would be shut down if the river rose to 902 feet (274.93 meters) above sea level, but officials say that is unlikely. \n \n ""This plant is designed to deal with a flood much higher than we are seeing _ 906 feet,"" Jaczko said. \n \n Both nuclear plants issued flooding alerts earlier this month, although they were routine as the river\'s rise has been expected. Cooper has been operating at full capacity. \n \n Flooding remains a concern all along the Missouri because of massive amounts of water the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has released from upstream reservoirs. The river is expected to rise as much as 7 feet (2 meters) above flood stage in much of Nebraska and Iowa and as much as 10 feet (3 meters) over flood stage in parts of Missouri. \n \n The corps expects the river to remain high at least into August because of heavy spring rains in the upper Plains and substantial Rocky Mountain snowpack melting into the river basin. \n \n ___ \n \n Josh Funk Associated Press Writer Timberly Ross contributed to this report from Omaha and can be reached at http://twitter.com/timberlysross.', 'The head of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has been dispatched to a nuclear power plant in Fort Calhoun, Neb., where a berm collapsed Sunday, but the public is in no danger, officials said. \n \n The breach allowed Missouri River flood waters to reach containment buildings and transformers and forcing the shutdown of electrical power. \n \n Backup generators are cooling the nuclear material at the Fort Calhoun Nuclear Station. \n \n The plant has not operated since April, and officials say there is no danger to the public. \n \n Jeff Hanson, a spokesman for the Omaha Public Power District, told The Associated Press that the breached berm wasn\'t critical to protecting the plant, although a crew will look at whether it can be patched. \n \n ""That was an additional layer of protection we put in,"" Hanson said. \n \n Nevertheless, federal inspectors are on the scene. \n \n Meanwhile, there was no protecting thousands of homes in Minot, N.D., where flooding of the Souris River hit its peak today, flooding more than 4,000 homes, including Leslie Dull\'s. \n \n ""When you actually see your house,"" Dull said, ""and you know it\'s not just your basement, it\'s your whole house, it\'s ... \n \n ""I\'m sorry,"" she said, as she broke down crying. \n \n There is some good news: The river in Minot peaked two feet lower than expected. But it is nearly 13 feet above flood stage and it is expected to stay near that level for days. \n \n ""It could be two to four to six weeks, or more, before the water actually goes back into its banks ... [and] before [residents] get to come and see their houses,"" Brig. Gen. Bill Seekins of the North Dakota National Guard told ABC News during a tour through the flooded areas. \n \n Seekins described the scene as ""almost apocalyptic."" \n \n Sgt. Dave Dodds of the North Dakota National Guard said heavy rains from Saturday will keep the river at its historic crest for longer than expected. \n \n ""Authorities were hoping for maybe a day or two before it started to recede, but you can add maybe an additional 24 hours onto that,"" Dodds said. \n \n Minot Mayor Curt Zimbelman said the devastation may be even greater than expected. \n \n ""I think we\'re going to reach probably 4,500 [homes] before this is all done, where we\'ve got a lot of water on these homes,"" Zimbelman said. \n \n Randy Nelson and his wife just bought a camper, knowing their house is flooded.

It\'s tough."" \n \n But there have been victories. ABC News watched Koni Aho race to build a berm around her restaurant down river from Minot. Twenty-four hours later there was still no water in the restaurant. \n \n ""I was bound and determined,"" she said. ""I don\'t care. I said, \'It\'s just dirt. We can move it.\'"" \n \n Forecasters said scattered storms were in today\'s forecast, but the worst part of the storm will likely to be south and east of the Souris River Basin. \n \n Neighbors Helping Neighbors \n \n Officials were building and re-enforcing levees in the towns of Sawyer and Velvenau in fear that all the water that has been coming through Minot will swamp the two towns. \n \n As residents and officials brace for the worst, acts of generosity were seen throughout the community. \n \n Garages were turned into storage units for flood victims and families and churches opened their doors to other displaced community members. \n \n ""For the rest of the country, that is kind of mind-boggling. But ... that\'s how we are in North Dakota,"" Sen. John Hoeven told the Associated Press. \n \n Evangelical Lutheran pastor Mike Johnson said he was too preoccupied with helping other people that he wasn\'t sure about the condition of his belongings after being evacuated from the flood zone the previous week. \n \n But Lutherans in a neighboring town stepped in and took care of his files and equipment in his office. \n \n ""They just showed up on Tuesday and carted stuff off for us,"" Johnson told the Associated Press. \n \n ABC News\' Gerard McNiff and the Associated Press contributed to this report.', ""Justice Department officials are taking a fresh look at Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server while she served as secretary of State, The Daily Beast has learned. \n \n An ally of Attorney General Jeff Sessions who is familiar with the thinking at the Justice Department’s Washington headquarters described it as an effort to gather new details on how Clinton and her aides handled classified material. Officials’ questions include how much classified information was sent over Clinton’s server; who put that information into an unclassified environment, and how; and which investigators knew about these matters and when. The Sessions ally also said officials have questions about immunity agreements that Clinton aides may have made. \n \n A former senior DOJ official familiar with department leadership’s thinking said officials there are acutely aware of demands from President Donald Trump that they look into Clinton’s use of a private email server while secretary of State—and that they lock up her top aide, Huma Abedin. \n \n For instance, Trump tweeted on Dec. 2, “Many people in our Country are asking what the ‘Justice’ Department is going to do about the fact that totally Crooked Hillary, AFTER receiving a subpoena from the United States Congress, deleted and ‘acid washed’ 33,000 Emails? No justice!” \n \n “ If the White House asks you to look into it... The answer is to tell the White House to stay out of investigations and prosecutions, especially when it comes to your political opponents. ” — Matt Miller \n \n The former official said tweets like this present two challenges for department leadership: looking into the matter in a way consistent with normal Justice Department approaches, and trying to avoid the appearance that they are trying “to put Huma in jail.” \n \n A spokesperson for the Justice Department declined to comment for this story. \n \n It’s an open question as to whether Justice Department officials would have the same level of interest in Clinton’s server without a political directive from the White House, the former official said. \n \n Last week, the State Department released emails, in response to a lawsuit from the conservative group Judicial Watch, showing that classified material was on the computer of Abedin’s then-husband Anthony Weiner. Sources told The Daily Beast that Justice Department officials were looking into the Clinton emails before those documents were released. \n \n Stephen Boyd, who heads the Justice Department's Office of Legislative Affairs, appeared to hint at the department’s interest in Clinton’s emails in a letter to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte on Nov. 13. In the letter, Boyd wrote that that Sessions “directed senior federal prosecutors to evaluate certain issues” the chairman was concerned about. He also wrote that those prosecutors would “make recommendations as to whether any matters not currently under investigation should be opened,” and that they would send those recommendations directly to the attorney general and his top deputy, Rod Rosenstein. \n \n Brian Fallon, formerly a spokesperson for the Justice Department and Clinton’s presidential campaign, said he suspects DOJ officials are engaging in perfunctory steps “to give Trump and his allies something to talk about and point to, and something to give Fox News to devote segments to.” \n \n “I think that even that is extremely dangerous, and that the Justice Department should not be opening itself up to the perception that it is bending to political pressures from the White House,” Fallon continued. “The Justice Department is supposed to operate independently of the White House, and even if this is just a perfunctory step that they’re taking to try to appease the president, that in and of itself is an abuse of the DOJ authority.” \n \n Nick Merrill, Secretary Clinton’s communications director, had this to say: \n \n “As Trump begins the new year with Steve Bannon calling his campaign treasonous and indictments and guilty pleas piling up, he resorts to diversion and distraction like clockwork, with the help of his attorney general. Few matters have been more scrutinized than emails, and it was determined that there was no wrongdoing. Trump’s behavior shows a profound disrespect for the rule of law and an unprecedented abuse of power—with his attorney general following suit at every turn. It tarnishes our justice system, and should be deeply troubling to all Americans.” \n \n Clinton’s use of a private email server—which the FBI previously investigated, and declined to recommend for criminal prosecution—became a huge issue on the campaign trail. Trump mentioned it at just about every campaign rally, frequently followed by chants of “Lock her up!” from his supporters. On July 5, then-FBI Director James Comey made an unprecedented public statement blasting Clinton’s use of the server, but then explained why the bureau wouldn’t recommend she or any of her associates be prosecuted. \n \n Over the summer, Trump made the email story a central campaign narrative. And at the Oct. 9 presidential debate, he threatened to incarcerate Clinton if he won the election. \n \n “If I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation,” he said, referring to her emails, “because there has never been so many lies, so much deception.” \n \n “It’s just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country,” she replied. \n \n “Because you’d be in jail,” he retorted. \n \n In the weeks after that exchange, the email story dominated the news; on Oct. 28, Comey sent a letter to Capitol Hill—which promptly leaked—saying the investigation was reopened. Then, on Nov. 6, two days before the election, Comey followed up with another letter explaining that he actually hadn’t found new information in additional emails. Republicans were irate that Comey backtracked. Clinton’s camp was irate that he’d said anything at all. In less than two weeks, the FBI director had pulled off a vanishingly rare Washington feat: upsetting everyone. \n \n And though Trump (obviously) became president, many conservatives still argue the Justice Department didn’t adequately investigate Clinton. The president himself, with lots of encouragement from the crew at Fox & Friends, has lobbed a host of critical tweets at the Justice Department on the issue. \n \n “Crooked Hillary Clinton’s top aid [sic], Huma Abedin, has been accused of disregarding basic security protocols,” he wrote on Tuesday morning. “She put Classified Passwords into the hands of foreign agents. Remember sailors pictures on submarine? Jail! Deep State Justice Dept must finally act? Also on Comey & others.” \n \n Conservatives said the revelation that Justice Department officials are looking at Clinton’s email server comes as a relief. \n \n “Clearly, that’s the least they can be doing, is asking some of these questions,” said Tom Fitton, who heads Judicial Watch. “I think there’s enough there to re-initiate an investigation.” \n \n “It’s certainly a positive development,” added Fitton, whose organization sued for the release of thousands of Clinton emails and deposed her top aides. “It’s part of what we’ve been demanding.” \n \n “ It’s about time they’re doing a review of this whole mess. ” — Mark Corallo \n \n Mark Corallo—a former spokesperson for Trump’s legal team and the John Ashcroft-era Justice Department—also said it’s a good sign. \n \n “People should be encouraged that the new leadership at the Justice Department is actually interested in a nonpartisan, above-board Justice Department that treats every citizen equally,” he said. “And we can hope that this means they are dedicating themselves to cleaning up the Justice Department and the FBI, sanctioning any FBI agents or DOJ lawyers who are found to have violated their ethical and legal responsibilities, and restoring the trust of the American people.” \n \n “It’s about time they’re doing a review of this whole mess,” he added. \n \n Matt Miller, a spokesperson for the department during Holder’s time there, vehemently disagreed. He said the news is evidence that Trump is undermining the independence of the Justice Department. \n \n “The president’s ongoing campaign to tear down the wall between the Justice Department and the White House seems to be working,” he said. \n \n “If the White House asks you to look into it, the answer is not to look into it for the sake of looking into it,” he continued. “The answer is to tell the White House to stay out of investigations and prosecutions, especially when it comes to your political opponents. You’re just encouraging a bully. If you encourage him to do that, he’ll just keep bullying you.”""]",3,"– Floodwaters have poured over a berm surrounding a Nebraska nuclear power plant, forcing a shutdown of electricity used to control cooling systems. Emergency generators were used until an off-site power supply could be connected to the Fort Calhoun plant, and officials say there has been no danger to the public, reports ABC News. Federal authorities, including the head of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, are on the scene. The berm was considered an ""additional layer of protection"" at the plant, and a work crew will attempt to patch it, said a spokesman for the Omaha Public Power District. The plant, near Brownville, has been closed for refueling since April, and the operation won't be restarted until the floodwaters recede, according to AP. Nebraska's other nuclear power plant, some 75 miles south of Omaha, was threatened by flooding earlier this month and will be shut down if floodwaters exceed a specific level. Federal officials are continuing to monitor the situation. The Fort Calhoun berm breach was the latest trouble in flooding of the Missouri River that has inundated some 4,500 homes. It could be up to six weeks before the river falls back to its pre-flood stage."

""It\'s a terrible loss. My staff has taken it hard... She was solid as a rock, never got flustered. She was calm, even-tempered. One of our line cooks was quite close with her. When he heard she was missing, he said, \'Can I go find Rosie? I gotta look for her.\' I said, of course. It\'s a terrible tragedy. "" \n \n Though authorities have said a gas leak may have triggered the explosion, Mayor Bill de Blasio told reporters Thursday that the official cause was under investigation. \n \n ""We know there was an explosion,"" he said, ""but we don\'t know everything about the lead-up to it."" \n \n The other fatalities were Andreas Panagopoulos, 43; George Ameado, 44; Rosaura Barrios, 44; and Alexis Salas, 22. \n \n One fatal victim remains unidentified. \n \n On Wednesday, one woman tried in vain to find her husband, Jordy Salas, who may have been on the second floor of one of the collapsed buildings. She fainted and was taken to a hospital. \n \n Desperate search for survivors \n \n Near 116th Street and Park Avenue, once the heart of New York\'s large Puerto Rican community, firefighters tore at mounds of bricks in a search for survivors from the collapsed five-story buildings, which housed a piano store and an evangelical church, in addition to apartments. \n \n ""We (had) probably about two-and-a-half floors of debris, so we have it now down to about one, one-and-a-half floors,"" Edward Kilduff, fire chief of department, told de Blasio during a tour of the site. ""The victims have primarily been found on the left-center side about 20 feet in."" \n \n On Thursday, Con Edison officials said the utility received a call reporting a gas leak around 9:13 a.m. Wednesday from a resident at one of the newer buildings on Park Avenue. The utility dispatched a truck two minutes later, but it arrived after the explosion. The caller reported smelling gas the night before but did not call the utility at the time. \n \n Two gas repairs were made on the block in January 2011 and May 2013 following complaints of a gas odor, Con Ed CEO John McAvoy said. The utility looked back at 10 years of checks and repairs on the gas main on the block and found no ""historical condition,"" he said. In addition, Con Ed checks for leaks in the area on February 10 and February 28 detected no problems. \n \n Fire officials said they received no reports of gas leaks in the area in the last month, while police reported receiving no calls since 2010. \n \n Fire marshals, police arson investigators and the National Transportation Safety Board -- which probes gas explosions -- worked to determine the cause of the explosion. \n \n ""In one word, devastating,"" was how Robert Sumwalt of the NTSB described the scene Thursday afternoon. He called it an ""active search and rescue operation."" \n \n ""You have, basically, two five-story buildings reduced to essentially a three-story pile of bricks and twisted metal."" \n \n Sumwalt said the agency was ""operating under the assumption that a natural gas leak led to an explosion,"" but that his team of investigators had not yet examined the crater where the buildings once stood. \n \n De Blasio said 66 people, including 14 families with children, had received temporary shelter. \n \n Some wreckage was still smoldering Thursday, with the fire whipped by the cold wind, de Blasio said. \n \n ""Our biggest concern now is the free-standing wall in the back,"" Kilduff said. ""That was a little more solid last night, but it burned overnight."" \n \n The massive explosion shook Manhattan\'s East Harlem section around 9:30 a.m. Wednesday. \n \n Surreal scenes after explosion \n \n Colin Patterson said he was watching TV when a thunderous blast suddenly sent pianos hurling through the air in the shop where he works. \n \n ""They flew off the ground,"" said the piano technician, who also lives in the building in East Harlem. He told CNN affiliate WABC that he crawled through the rubble and managed to escape unharmed. \n \n A building department official said one of the two Park Avenue buildings that collapsed received a city permit last year for the installation of 120 feet of gas piping. The work was completed last June. In 2008, owners of the adjacent building, which also collapsed, were fined for failing to maintain vertical cracks in the rear of the building. The condition was not reported as corrected to the buildings department. \n \n There were a total of 15 units in the two buildings, officials said. \n \n Building department records detailed a litany of violations, dating back decades, for one of the collapsed buildings, including a lack of smoke detectors, blocked fire escapes and faulty light fixtures. \n \n The mayor told reporters that the report of the gas leak, which he said came about 15 minutes before the explosion, was ""the only indication of danger."" \n \n Blast shook Manhattan for blocks \n \n Fire Commissioner Salvatore Cassano said responding firefighters barely missed the blast. \n \n ""If we were here five minutes earlier we may have had some fatalities among firefighters,"" he said.

It went on to be called Spanish Harlem and El Barrio.

149,"['Faced with a flood of revelations about U.S. spying practices, the White House is considering ending its eavesdropping on friendly foreign leaders, a senior administration official said. \n \n Graphic shows country-by-country look allegations of spying by the U.S. National Security Agency and reaction; 3c x 5 inches; 146 mm x 127 mm; (Associated Press) \n \n FILE - In this Thursday, Jan. 17, 2013, file photo, a man speaks on a cell phone in the business district of Madrid.

A Spanish... (Associated Press) \n \n A final decision has not been made and the move is still under review, the official said. But the fact that it is even being considered underscores the level of concern within the administration over the possible damage from the months-long spying scandal _ including the most recent disclosure that the National Security Agency was monitoring the communications of German Chancellor Angela Merkel. \n \n On Monday, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, called for a ""total review of all intelligence programs"" following the Merkel allegations. In a statement, the California Democrat said the White House had informed her that ""collection on our allies will not continue."" \n \n The administration official said that statement was not accurate, but added that some unspecified changes already had been made and more were being considered, including terminating the collection of communications from friendly heads of state. \n \n The official was not authorized to discuss the review by name and insisted on anonymity. \n \n Reports based on new leaks from former NSA systems analyst Edward Snowden indicate that the NSA listened to Merkel and 34 other foreign leaders. \n \n ""With respect to NSA collection of intelligence on leaders of U.S. allies _ including France, Spain, Mexico and Germany _ let me state unequivocally: I am totally opposed,"" Feinstein said. She added that the U.S. should not be ""collecting phone calls or emails of friendly presidents and prime ministers"" unless in an emergency with approval of the president. \n \n In response to the revelations, German officials said Monday that the U.S. could lose access to an important law enforcement tool used to track terrorist money flows. Other longtime allies have also expressed their displeasure about the U.S. spying on their leaders. \n \n As possible leverage, German authorities cited last week\'s non-binding resolution by the European Parliament to suspend a post-9/11 agreement allowing the Americans access to bank transfer data to track the flow of terrorist money. A top German official said Monday she believed the Americans were using the information to gather economic intelligence apart from terrorism and said the agreement, known as the SWIFT agreement, should be suspended. \n \n European Union officials who are in Washington to meet with lawmakers ahead of White House talks said U.S. surveillance of their people could affect negotiations over a U.S.-Europe trade agreement. They said European privacy must be better protected. \n \n Many officials in Germany and other European governments have made clear, however, that they don\'t favor suspending the U.S.-EU trade talks which began last summer because both sides stand to gain so much through the proposed deal, especially against competition from China and other emerging markets. \n \n As tensions with European allies escalate, the top U.S. intelligence official declassified dozens of pages of top-secret documents in an apparent bid to show the NSA was acting legally when it gathered millions of Americans\' phone records. \n \n Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper said he was following the president\'s direction to make public as much information as possible about how U.S. intelligence agencies spy under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Monday\'s release of documents focused on Section 215 of the Patriot Act, which allows the bulk collection of U.S. phone records. \n \n The document release is part of an administration-wide effort to preserve the NSA\'s ability to collect bulk data, which it says is key to tracking key terror suspects, but which privacy activists say is a breach of the Constitution\'s ban on unreasonable search and seizure of evidence from innocent Americans. \n \n The release of the documents comes ahead of a House Intelligence Committee hearing Tuesday on FISA reform. \n \n The documents support administration testimony that the NSA worked to operate within the law and fix errors when they or their systems overreached. One of the documents shows the NSA admitting to the House Intelligence Committee that one of its automated systems picked up too much telephone metadata. The February 2009 document indicates the problem was fixed. \n \n Another set of documents shows the judges of the FISA court seemed satisfied with the NSA\'s cooperation. It says that in September 2009, the NSA advised the Senate Intelligence Committee about its continuing collection of Americans\' phone records and described a series of demonstrations and briefings it conducted for three judges on the secretive U.S. spy court. The memorandum said the judges were ""engaged throughout and asked questions, which were answered by the briefers and other subject matter experts,"" and said the judges appreciated the amount and quality of information the NSA provided. \n \n It said that two days later, one of the judges, U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton, renewed the court\'s permission to resume collecting phone records. \n \n The documents also included previously classified testimony from 2009 for the House Intelligence Committee by Michael Leiter, then head of the National Counterterrorism Center. He and other officials said collecting Americans\' phone records helped indict Najibullah Zazi, who was accused in a previously disclosed 2009 terror plot to bomb the New York City subways. \n \n The documents also show the NSA considered tracking targets using cellphone location data, and ran tests to see if it was technically possible to gather U.S. cell-site data, which can show where a cellphone user traveled. According to an April 2011 memo the NSA consulted the Justice Department first, which said such collection was legal. Only later did the NSA inform the FISA court of the testing. \n \n NSA commander Gen. Keith Alexander revealed the testing earlier this month to Congress but said the agency did not use the capability to track Americans\' cellphone locations nor deem it necessary right now. \n \n Asked Monday whether the NSA intelligence gathering had been used not only to protect national security but American economic interests as well, White House spokesman Jay Carney said: ""We do not use our intelligence capabilities for that purpose. We use it for security purposes."" \n \n National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden later clarified that: ""We do not use our intelligence capabilities to give U.S. companies an advantage, not ruling out that we are interested in economic information."" \n \n Still, Carney acknowledged the tensions with allies over the eavesdropping disclosures and said the White House was ""working to allay those concerns,"" though he refused to discuss any specific reports or provide details of internal White House discussions. \n \n ___ \n \n Follow Julie Pace at http://twitter.com/jpaceDC and Kimberly Dozier at http://twitter.com/kimberlydozier \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writers Ted Bridis and Jack Gillum in Washington, Frank Jordan, Geir Moulson and Robert H.

Smith explains why it makes sense for Cowboys owner Jerry Jones to be in favor of the NFL dropping the ban on marijuana. (1:55) \n \n Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones and some other NFL owners want to change the way the league punishes players for marijuana. So do the players. But if the talk is about doing away with marijuana testing completely, it may surprise you to learn that the players\' position is ""not so fast."" \n \n Yes, the players would like to change the league\'s policy on marijuana, but they don\'t want to do away with it entirely, because they think the policy can be helpful to them if done the right way. \n \n Jones and his fellow owners see this as a valuable potential bargaining chip in the next collective bargaining agreement negotiations, which could be coming sooner than you think. \n \n The location of the common ground these two sides end up finding could have a major impact on the health of the game and its players. And the process of finding that common ground could begin within the next few weeks. But before we can predict what may or may not happen, it\'s important to examine the motivations of the people on both sides of the issue. \n \n What the owners want \n \n The league -- defined here as Jones and his 31 fellow team owners -- has made it clear that it wants to extend the current CBA, which runs through 2020. Sources on both sides expect the league to approach the National Football League Players Association within the coming weeks about opening collective bargaining talks aimed at such an extension. \n \n From Jones\' perspective, the marijuana issue has two key prongs: He doesn\'t want to lose his players for long stretches at a time because of drug suspensions, and he views marijuana as an issue around which the players would be willing to negotiate. Surely, Jones\' fellow owners share the former sentiment and the latter hope. \n \n What the players want \n \n According to sources, this topic was discussed extensively at the NFLPA\'s rep meeting in Arizona last month, and union leaders prepared a proposal for a revised marijuana policy and submitted it to the player reps for review. At this time, the player reps and their teammates are reviewing the policy before submitting it to the league for discussion. \n \n Sources with knowledge of what was discussed at the rep meeting say the players\' new proposal is focused on counseling, treatment and pain management. The players don\'t necessarily want to do away with marijuana testing; they just want to reduce or eliminate the punitive aspect of the testing process. \n \n Under the union\'s plan, the purpose of a marijuana testing program would be to identify players in need of help. Their position is that it\'s easy to tell the difference, based on the number of nanograms per milliliter (ng/ml) that show up in a test, whether the player is using the drug for recreational use or using it excessively. \n \n Jerry Jones and his fellow NFL owners see the marijuana policy as a valuable potential bargaining chip in the next CBA negotiations. Ross D. Franklin/AP Photo \n \n Right now, the NFL standard for a positive marijuana test is 35 ng/ml, which is higher than the 15 it was before the drug policy was renegotiated three years ago but still lower than Major League Baseball\'s 50 and far lower than the Olympics\' 150. So a player could test positive at 35 ng/ml and still get the same level of punishment as one who tests positive at 100 ng/ml. \n \n The union\'s position is that those cases need to be handled differently in substantive ways. For example: Should someone test positive above 100 ng/ml, that could be a red flag for an addiction situation or a player who\'s dealing with some sort of chronic pain that he hasn\'t previously reported. In a case like that, testing could lead the team and/or league to provide some sort of treatment for the addiction or the pain. \n \n The important takeaway here is that NFL players don\'t necessarily want the league to stop testing them for marijuana. The union\'s proposal basically says, ""Let\'s still test for it, but let\'s do it in a constructive and less punitive way."" \n \n So, what happens now? \n \n There are a lot of hurdles yet to be cleared. The drug still isn\'t legal in every state, and it\'s against the law to transport it across state lines. The NFL itself doesn\'t have a defined position on this, and when asked about it, commissioner Roger Goodell usually says something about deferring to medical experts. \n \n As mentioned earlier, players are currently reviewing the proposal that union leadership drafted last month. The union will not submit the proposal to the league until it\'s been vetted by its membership. Depending on the timing of that submission, the marijuana discussion could be its own separate thing or part of a larger CBA negotiation. \n \n Regardless, it\'s highly unlikely the union will agree to a relaxation of the marijuana policy in exchange for some financial-based CBA concession like stadium credits. Union officials have made it clear for months that they have no interest in granting financial concessions in exchange for nonfinancial ones in any upcoming CBA talks. So if the only reason owners want to talk marijuana is because they think it\'s important enough to the players to give back some money, they may not find that door wide open to them. \n \n What\'s clear is that this is an issue that\'s not leaving the spotlight anytime soon. But it\'s not an issue that breaks down along lines as simple as you -- or even Jerry Jones -- might expect.', 'Death rates for female pigs in the US are rising fast, sending alarm bells ringing throughout the farming industry. \n \n The mortality rate rose from 5.8% to 10.2% on farms owning more than 125 sows between 2013-2016, according to one organisation that collects data across 800 companies. \n \n The numbers have been linked to a troubling rise in prolapse – the collapse of the animal’s rectum, vagina, or uterus. In some cases the prolapse itself is fatal. In others the pig is euthanised as a result. Some farms have seen no rise, or much smaller rises, but a separate report last year found that some farms were seeing prolapse causing as many as 25%-50% of sow deaths. \n \n The American Association of Swine Veterinarians has created a sow prolapse working group, but their findings so far have been inconclusive. In April, the National Pork Board announced a multi-year research collaboration with Iowa State University’s Iowa Pork Industry Center designed to get a broad overview of the problem. Iowa is the nation’s top pork producer. The study, which is still under way, aims to collect detailed data from 400,000 sows – or about 13% of the nation’s 3 million working sows – on more than 100 farms across 16 states. \n \n A number of possible causes have been suggested, including vitamin deficiency, mycotoxins in the feed, high density diets or abdominal issues. Some experts blame confinement systems in intensive farming – sows will spend a large percentage of their lives in gestation and farrowing crates that don’t allow them to move around. Modern breeding practices have also been suggested as a causal factor. \n \n Industry figures largely declined to comment but some acknowledged that they are grappling with the issue. “It’s a topic in our meetings, both in the hallways and the meeting spaces,” said Dr Tom Burkgren, executive director of American Association of Swine Veterinarians, a group that educates vets around the country. \n \n A brutal business: alleged beatings and abuse on UK pig farms | Harriet Grant Read more \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest After piglets are born, the sows are kept in farrowing crates where the young can feed. Photograph: Jo-Anne McArthur/We Animals \n \n An estimated 97% of the US’s 73 million hogs are raised in closed barns or confined feeding operations. In these systems sows often live the majority of their lives in gestation or farrowing crates that don’t allow them to get up or turn around. In this system the average sow produces 23.5 piglets per year – or ten per litter at a rate of 2.35 litters annually. After two to four litters, most sows tend to be replaced by younger gilts who can produce piglets at a higher rate. \n \n Mary Temple Grandin – professor of animal science at Colorado State University and consultant on the design of livestock-handling facilities – told the Guardian that highly focused breeding across the industry has led to unintended consequences. She said that one side effect of selecting for animals that are more fecund is an increased tendency toward lameness. \n \n In the late 1980s, Grandin added, pigs were bred with three traits in mind: rapid weight gain, thin back fat, and a big loin. Now, she added, “They’re breeding the sows to produce a lot of babies. Well, there’s a point where you’ve gone too far.” \n \n “We’ve bred a contradiction into these animals,” says Leah Garces, outgoing executive director of the US branch of Compassion in World Farming. “Over the last few decades, sows to have been bred to have less back-fat – because people don’t want to eat as much fat – but we also want them to produce more and more babies. And that’s not biologically possible; their bones are weak and they don’t have enough fat to support the reproductive process. We’ve bred them to their limit and the animals are telling us that.” \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest Pigs at a Niman Ranch farm in the US, a network that focuses on sustainable agriculture. Photograph: Courtesy Niman Ranch \n \n Alternatives \n \n The high incidence of animal loss in confinement systems is one of the main reasons that Paul Willis, co-founder of Niman Ranch (now a subsidiary of Perdue Farms) spent years building an alternative to modern hog farming. “I have a neighbour that has been raising pigs [in a confinement system] … and they have a dumpster, and I can go by there almost any time of the day or week and it’s full of dead hogs,” said Willis. \n \n When he was raising hogs at a smaller scale, perhaps 200 to 300 at a time, and allowing them to spend time outside, engaging in behaviours that are typical for hogs, such as wallowing and building nests out of straw, Willis said he’d lose just “a few animals a year”. Under this system, pigs only produce about half as many offspring a year as they do in industrial systems. \n \n The key in most livestock production is finding a balance between productivity and the health of the animals, said Grandin. “You have to figure out the optimal number of piglets these sows should have. One thing people have trouble with is asking what is optimal – not maximal, but optimal – when it comes to breeding.” \n \n For those pursuing a maximal approach, there are new products like the Hercules Arm, a $7,000 (£5,330) piece of machinery that went on the market in 2017. It is marketed as “a unique and revolutionary way to effortlessly remove … heavy dead pigs from stalls”. \n \n Contact us with your stories and thoughts at animalsfarmed@theguardian.com']",3,"– With European countries fuming over NSA surveillance, the White House is reconsidering its spying activities.

They are beyond ignorant to me.” He said that plenty of conservatives have been supporting Bundy’s case because of sincere beliefs about eminent domain abuse but now they’ll all be “branded because of the ignorant, racist, repugnant, despicable comments by Cliven Bundy.” \n \n Hannity cried, “Every conservative that I know does not support racism, period!” He said liberals “get a pass” for this sort of thing, but made it clear unlike hypocrites on the left, “I find it repugnant no matter who it comes from.” \n \n Listen to the audio below, via The Sean Hannity Show: \n \n Please enable Javascript to listen. \n \n — — \n \n Follow Josh Feldman on Twitter: @feldmaniac \n \n Have a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com', 'Nevada Rancher Cliven Bundy attempted again on Thursday to clarify controversial remarks, but did not walk back what many saw as racist comments he made earlier to the New York Times. \n \n “I may not have a very big word base or vocabulary,” Bundy said, but added that he knows what he means, “when I say slavery.” \n \n Text Size - \n \n + \n \n reset \n \n At a press conference Thursday afternoon, Bundy defended his comments saying he did not say that black people were better off as slaves, just that he was wondering. \n \n (Also on POLITICO: 10 things to know about Cliven Bundy) \n \n “I’m still wondering,” Bundy said, who repeatedly referred to black people throughout his presser as the “Negro community.” \n \n “They seem to be slaves to the welfare system … but they have an opportunity,” Bundy said. \n \n Regarding the attention his initial comments have since received, Bundy said he won’t “condemn” the media, adding it has led to a conversation. \n \n “It really don’t matter to me if you twist my words up,” Bundy said. “It matters that my heart goes out to the people of this world and they understand what I stand for.” \n \n Earlier on on Thursday, Bundy tried to clarify his comments on race, saying that he was just “wondering” whether black people would be better off as slaves. \n \n “I’m wondering if they’re better off under a government subsidy and their young women are having the abortions and their young men are in jail and their older women and children are sitting out on the cement porch without nothing to do,” the Nevada rancher said in a radio interview on The Peter Schiff Show. \n \n Bundy repeated similar comments at his afternoon press conference again asking whether black people would be happier in the South. \n \n Bundy caused outrage from figures on the right and left Thursday with statements on race first reported by The New York Times. \n \n On Schiff’s show, Bundy continued: “I’m wondering are they better off being slaves in that sense or better off being slaves to the United States government in the sense of the subsidy. I’m wondering. The statement was right.”', 'Animals are endowed with the capacity to repair injuries. In this study, we found that, upon amputation, the moon jellyfish Aurelia aurita rearranges existing body parts and recovers radial symmetry within a few days. This unique strategy of self-repair, which we call symmetrization, requires mechanical forces generated by the muscle-based propulsion machinery. We observed a similar strategy in a number of other jellyfish species. This finding may contribute to understanding the evolutionary pressures governing biological self-repair strategies. Beyond biology, this finding may inspire a mechanically driven, self-organizing machinery that recovers essential geometry without regenerating precise forms. \n \n Abstract \n \n What happens when an animal is injured and loses important structures? Some animals simply heal the wound, whereas others are able to regenerate lost parts. In this study, we report a previously unidentified strategy of self-repair, where moon jellyfish respond to injuries by reorganizing existing parts, and rebuilding essential body symmetry, without regenerating what is lost. Specifically, in response to arm amputation, the young jellyfish of Aurelia aurita rearrange their remaining arms, recenter their manubria, and rebuild their muscular networks, all completed within 12 hours to 4 days. We call this process symmetrization. We find that symmetrization is not driven by external cues, cell proliferation, cell death, and proceeded even when foreign arms were grafted on. Instead, we find that forces generated by the muscular network are essential. Inhibiting pulsation using muscle relaxants completely, and reversibly, blocked symmetrization. Furthermore, we observed that decreasing pulse frequency using muscle relaxants slowed symmetrization, whereas increasing pulse frequency by lowering the magnesium concentration in seawater accelerated symmetrization. A mathematical model that describes the compressive forces from the muscle contraction, within the context of the elastic response from the mesoglea and the ephyra geometry, can recapitulate the recovery of global symmetry. Thus, self-repair in Aurelia proceeds through the reorganization of existing parts, and is driven by forces generated by its own propulsion machinery. We find evidence for symmetrization across species of jellyfish (Chrysaora pacifica, Mastigias sp., and Cotylorhiza tuberculata).']",3,"– Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy is standing by his widely condemned remarks on slavery even as most of his conservative allies hastily back away from him. ""I don't think I'm wrong,"" Bundy, who wondered if black people were ""better off as slaves, picking cotton and having a family life"" than living ""under government subsidy,"" tells CNN. ""I think I'm right."" He says he had been ""just wondering"" if black people are really better off now, adding that instead of slavery he really ""meant to compare it with maybe life on the farm or life in the South, where they had some chickens and the gardens, and they had something to do."" More: Bundy, who is embroiled in a dispute with federal authorities over grazing rights, admitted that having his cattle graze on public land might make him as much of a ""welfare queen"" as people who survive on government checks. ""But I'll tell you I'm producing something for America and using a resource that nobody else would use or could use. I'm putting red meat on the table,"" he said. Despite some slight backtracking in the CNN interview, Bundy's remarks to a radio show yesterday were almost identical to the ones that first caused offense, Politico finds. ""I'm wondering are they better off being slaves in that sense or better off being slaves to the United States government in the sense of the subsidy. I’m wondering. The statement was right,"" he said. Bundy's remarks have been strongly condemned by former allies including Sens. Dean Heller and Rand Paul and pundits including Sean Hannity, Mediaite reports. ""His comments are beyond repugnant to me. They are beyond despicable to me. They are beyond ignorant to me,"" said the Fox host, adding that he fears the remarks overshadow the ""legitimate issue"" of government overreach. Conservative commentators including Crystal Wright said they feared the controversy will be yet another setback for the GOP's attempts to attract minority voters, the Washington Post finds. ""My parents didn't sit-in at lunch counters so that they would be told that they would have been better off learning how to pick cotton,"" Wright said.

152,"['AUSTIN, Texas -- Texas will pay $3.4 million to a couple who were wrongfully imprisoned for more than two decades on prosecutors\' claims that they sexually abused children as part of satanic rituals at a day care they operated. \n \n Dan and Fran Keller learned Tuesday that they\'ll receive the payment from a state fund for the wrongly convicted, the Austin American-Statesman reported. \n \n A judge in June approved a request from Travis County District Attorney Margaret Moore for a declaration of innocence for the Kellers. \n \n ""There was not enough evidence left,"" Moore said at the time, according to CBS affiliate KEYE. ""We work every day to insure that the cases we bring are appropriately brought and that\'s all I can answer is for what we do now."" \n \n The couple was convicted in 1992 of sexually assaulting a 3-year-old after children at the day care the Kellers operated out of their Austin home told investigators of dismembered babies, tortured pets and other fantastic tales. They were each sentenced to 48 years in prison. \n \n The Kellers were freed in 2013 after the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals found a doctor was mistaken in determining there was physical evidence of assault. The appeals court ruled deemed the doctor\'s testimony to be false, and the doctor himself also recanted it. \n \n Further bolstering the Kellers\' case was an interview the alleged victim provided in 2013 in which she acknowledged having no memory of being abused, Moore said in June. \n \n The determination of outright innocence made Dan Keller, 75, and Fran Keller, 67, each eligible for $80,000 in compensation for every year they were wrongfully imprisoned. They\'ll also receive a matching annuity that provides annual payments of 5 percent interest for as long as they\'re alive, according to the Statesman. \n \n ""This means we don\'t have to worry about pinching pennies on Social Security, and late bills. It means we will actually be free. We can start living -- and no more nightmares,"" Fran Keller told the newspaper. \n \n They\'ll look to buy a house, vehicle, health insurance and better hearing aids for Dan Keller. \n \n Their attorney, Keith Hampton, was not available to comment Wednesday, but he previously told the Associated Press that notorious claims of abuse at other U.S. day care centers were part of a hysteria that began in the 1980s about secretive cults targeting children. \n \n ""Day care panic or the satanic panic began to occur and it reached a fever pitch around the time the Kellers were prosecuted,"" Hampton said. ""And like most hysterias, it thereafter died away.""', 'Dan, Fran Keller were victims of ‘satanic panic’ that swept the nation in the early 1990s, their lawyer says. \n \n Dan and Fran Keller, who spent more than 21 years in prison after they were accused of sexually abusing children during supposed satanic rituals at their South Austin day care facility, will receive $3.4 million from a state fund for those wrongly convicted of crimes. \n \n Shortly after receiving the news Tuesday, an ecstatic Fran Keller said they will no longer have to live on the brink of destitution, unable to find jobs at their ages and with their convictions, even if overturned by the state’s highest criminal court. \n \n “This means we don’t have to worry about pinching pennies on Social Security, and late bills. It means we will actually be free. We can start living — and no more nightmares,” said Fran Keller, 67. \n \n Their to-do list includes buying a house, vehicle, health insurance and better hearing aids for Dan Keller, 75. \n \n The Kellers’ lawyer, Keith Hampton, said the couple will collect two checks totaling $3.44 million Wednesday at the state comptroller’s office, which administers the compensation fund. \n \n “They’re happy, and I’m happy for them,” said Hampton, who worked for no charge in getting the Kellers released and declared innocent. \n \n The Kellers received news of the payments as they stood outside the Williamson County Jail on Tuesday in support of Greg Kelley, who was to be released on bond. \n \n READ: Greg Kelley is released on bond from jail after 3-year legal slog \n \n Kelley, serving a 25-year sentence on a child sexual assault charge, has maintained his innocence and also is being represented by Hampton, who phoned the Kellers with news of the state payments while he was inside the jail arranging Kelley’s release. \n \n The state’s wrongful conviction compensation fund pays $80,000 for each year in prison, plus a matching annuity that provides annual payments of 5 percent interest as long as the recipient is alive and isn’t convicted of a felony. \n \n The Keller case made national news after three children accused them in 1991 of leading ghastly satanic rituals that supposedly included desecrated graves, videotaped orgies, dismembered babies and tortured pets. No evidence of such activities was discovered at their in-home day care facility, and the case against them collapsed about two decades later when the only physical evidence of abuse was acknowledged as a mistake by the examining physician. \n \n Freed on signature bonds in 2013, the Kellers launched an effort to clear their names. \n \n Hampton argued that the Kellers were the victims of “satanic panic” — a belief that swept the nation in the early 1990s that a national network of secretive cults was preying upon day care children for sex and other horrors. \n \n The Kellers also were harmed, he argued, by the combined efforts of inept therapists, gullible police and an investigation that spiraled out of control, producing a suspect list of 26 ritual abusers, including many of the Kellers’ neighbors and a respected Austin police captain. \n \n LIKE US ON FACEBOOK: Our Lone Star Politics page brings Capitol news to your Facebook feed \n \n Children who reported no problems at the day care were ignored, and leading psychologists and criminology professors provided affidavits saying improper interview techniques and subtle encouragement by therapists produced believable-but-false memories in the children who accused the Kellers of abuse. \n \n Taped interviews of a Keller accuser, a 3-year-old girl, made at the Travis County sheriff’s office have since been used in lectures by a top specialist in assessing and treating crime victims to illustrate common interviewing mistakes. \n \n Travis County prosecutors, however, had pushed back, arguing that the Kellers failed to produce sufficient proof of innocence, such as an ironclad alibi or DNA evidence. \n \n In 2015, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals split the difference, overturning the Kellers’ convictions but declining to declare the couple innocent. \n \n The couple’s circumstances changed in June, when Travis County District Attorney Margaret Moore filed court documents that dropped all charges and declared the Kellers “actually innocent” under the law. After an extensive review, it was clear that the Kellers’ innocence claim should be supported in the interest of justice, Moore said at the time. \n \n Now adults, several of the children who accused the Kellers opposed the move, according to Moore and family members.', 'AUSTIN (KXAN) — As attorney Keith Hampton was working to get his client Greg Kelley out of jail on Tuesday, he was also signing off on the compensation package for his other clients, Dan and Fran Keller, who were recently declared innocent in their case. \n \n The Kellers are entitled to $80,000 for each year they were incarcerated. In the couple’s case, they were in prison for 23 years, which means each person will receive approximately $1.84 million for their time served. The Tim Cole Act states half of the money will be paid as a lump sum and the other half will be paid out over their lifetime as an annuity. \n \n “They are now compensated and no longer must fear homelessness or lack of health insurance,” said Hampton in an email. “They are buying a home and can live out their lives in peace and quiet. I am very happy for them.” \n \n The couple was accused of satanic and ritual abuse of children in their care in the early 90s. A jury found them guilty and sentenced them to 48 years in prison. In 2013, a court ruled they didn’t get a fair trial and released them. \n \n In June of this year, Travis County District Attorney Margaret Moore formally dismissed the cases against them. According to the motion to dismiss, there is “no credible evidence” that the Kellers, now 75 and 67 respectively, committed the crimes they were accused of, including sexually abusing the children at their day care in 1991. \n \n On the first day of Greg Kelley’s hearing earlier this month, the Kellers were in attendance to show their support. At his release on Tuesday, they too, were there again to meet him face-to-face for the first time.', 'Join us to get a year of this content! \n \n Zach? What is this? \n \n I was about to sign a typical financing deal in order to get the money to make ""Wish I Was Here,"" my follow up to “Garden State.” It would have involved making a lot of sacrifices I think would have ultimately hurt the film. I’ve been a backer for several projects on Kickstarter and thought the concept was fascinating and revolutionary for artists and innovators of all kinds. But I didn\'t imagine it could work on larger-scale projects. I was wrong. \n \n After I saw the incredible way “Veronica Mars” fans rallied around Kristen Bell and her show’s creator Rob Thomas, I couldn’t help but think (like I\'m sure so many other independent filmmakers did) maybe there is a new way to finance smaller, personal films that didn’t involve signing away all your artistic control. \n \n Financing an independent film the traditional way often means having to give away your right to “the final cut,” casting choices, location choices and cutting down your script to make it shoot-able on the cheapest budget possible. \n \n What if there is a different way? \n \n ""If you don\'t like how things are, change it!

He and his wife are barely getting by financially and Aidan passes his time by fantasizing about being the great futuristic Space-Knight he\'d always dreamed he\'d be as a little kid. \n \n When his ailing father can no longer afford to pay for private school for his two kids (ages 5 and 12) and the only available public school is on its last legs, Aidan reluctantly agrees to attempt to home-school them. \n \n The result is some funny chaos, until Aidan decides to scrap the traditional academic curriculum and come up with his own. Through teaching them about life his way, Aidan gradually discovers some of the parts of himself he couldn\'t find. \n \n It was written by my brother, Adam, and me last summer. \n \n Adam and me. \n \n The Soundtrack: \n \n The Soundtrack to ""Garden State"" was more popular than I could have ever imagined. The album went platinum and won a Grammy. Music and score are very important to me, and I\'ll be using them in the same way in ""Wish I Was Here."" One of the cool things about being a backer is that you can get access to weekly song picks by me, and be the first group to stream the soundtrack. \n \n I don\'t have the rights to put any cool music on here, but here\'s me doing a fairly decent beat-box: \n \n Pre-visualization: \n \n I am lucky enough to be friends and collaborators with one of the greatest pre-visualization artists in the business, Colin Fix. Artists like Colin help filmmakers establish the look and tone of the locations and characters before going into production. \n \n ""Wish I Was Here"" has some very unique characters, and mine in particular has elaborate fantasies that I want to try to bring to life in a very specific way. When operating on a tight budget, it\'s super helpful to be able to gather around the art Colin and I have come up with in order to make sure the entire creative team is on the same page. \n \n A doodle of the Bloom Family I made for Colin: \n \n *Note: The film is NOT ANIMATED.

Only the biggest directors these days get a chance to shoot it. \n \n Production Design: \n \n A Production Designer is in charge of the overall look of the movie. They collaborate closely with the Costume Designer to ensure the film has a cohesive tone.

I know it\'s risky, and I don\'t know if it\'s going to work, but here are a few reasons why I think it\'s worth it to fund via Kickstarter. \n \n Final Cut: \n \n ""Final Cut"" is the industry term for who has the final say on how the movie will be edited. A lot of financing deals require that the final cut go to the money people, NOT the director. Most films these days are tested in front of “test audiences” to see how an audience likes what you’ve made. This is sometimes very helpful, as you can get a sense of when the pace is too slow or when certain jokes aren’t as funny as you thought they were. However, it can also be destructive, as a financier with final cut may use a note from the test audience to force you to make changes to the film that go against your gut. You ultimately have no right to fight against these changes because you have signed away those rights in order to get your money. As a film-lover myself, I always want to see exactly what the filmmaker intended. \n \n Casting Choices: \n \n Traditionally, in order to procure your financing, a filmmaker will often have to choose from a list of pre-approved actors with whom the financier is willing to make the movie. Although there are often many wonderful actors on these lists, you may not see the actors you had in your mind to play those parts. The lists are compiled of actors who’ve been in films that have had large successes overseas. Their names are put into an algorithm, and a computer calculates how much money the financier will be able to pre-sell the foreign distribution of the film for based on that actor’s past successes. Bored yet? Basically, you have to cast who they want, not who you want. \n \n Location Choices: \n \n This film is set in Hollywood. Bizarrely, it is very expensive to shoot in Los Angeles. So unless I have the budget to afford to shoot here (where it takes place), I’ll have to shoot the film in Vancouver or Georgia or Louisiana and fake it to look like LA. I was told we’d just “roll a few palm trees around.” This happens all the time, and we could make it work... and no offense to all those places, but wouldn’t it be amazing to be able to shoot the film where it takes place? \n \n Cuts for Budget: \n \n Every film makes cuts to trim the budget; that’s completely sensible. But there are always places where, with a little extra money, the film could be better. In “Wish I Was Here,” my character\'s elaborate fantasy sequences are one place that extra money would strengthen what shows up on the screen, as I could shoot those in the amazing and surreal locations I picture in my mind. \n \n Wrap it up, Braff, I have stuff to do... \n \n I look at it like this: Come join this little club. Join for whatever you can. And then, together, this lil club\'s gonna make a really cool movie, and you\'ll have made it happen. If you\'ve liked the stuff I\'ve made so far, I know you\'re going to love this. \n \n Whether you end up with a rad t-shirt (soft as a kitten\'s taint) or an invite to a special preview screening, you\'ll know that without you, this movie never would have gotten made.

They were released in 2013, had their convictions overturned in 2015, and were declared innocent in the eyes of the law in June.

153,"['Two missing girls were found dead after they vanished while hiking along an abandoned railroad track in a small Indiana town on Monday. \n \n Police confirmed Wednesday the identities of the two bodies as Liberty “Libby” German, 14, and Abigail “Abby” Williams, 13, and say they are investigating the case as a double homicide. Police have still not released a cause of death. \n \n “This is considered a double homicide investigation, and no further information will be released at this time,” Indiana State Police Sergeant Kim Riley said Wednesday at a press conference. \n \n Later Wednesday, police released photos of a man they are seeking to identify in connection with the case. They have since said they consider him to be the main suspect in the killings. \n \n “We are asking help from the public to help identify him so he can be contacted regarding what he might have seen,” the Indiana State Police said in a press release. You can see the photos below: \n \n The photos were taken from Libby German’s phone, police said. They say she had the presence of mind to record video before her death. Authorities have also released a short audio clip of the suspect saying what they believe to be “down the hill.” You can listen to that clip below: \n \n On Tuesday, Riley said police suspected foul play and were investigating the area where the bodies were found as a crime scene, the Indianapolis Star reported. \n \n Riley said the suspicions arose because of “the way the bodies were found, that’s about all I can say at this time.” \n \n The bodies were found on the edge of the water, upstream, against the flow of the creek, police said. \n \n The girls, from Delphi, in Carroll County, were reported missing by their family on Monday. Hundreds of people, including police, firefighters, family, friends and residents of the surrounding community, searched for the girls into the night Monday and again Tuesday morning. The bodies were found about 12:15 p.m. Tuesday. \n \n The area is known as the Delphi Historic Trails. \n \n “Right now, we are following up on hundreds of hundreds of leads that have come in,” Riley said Wednesday. “There is nobody of interest at this point in time that we can say.” \n \n Police have set up a tip-line for information: 844-459-5786. \n \n Here’s what you need to know: \n \n 1. The Girls Were Dropped Off by Family & Were Reported Missing When They Didn’t Come to be Picked Up \n \n Abby Williams and Libby German were dropped off by family members at trails near the “Monon High Bridge” just east of their hometown of Delphi about 1 p.m. Monday, WTTV-TV reports. \n \n The middle school friends did not have class on Monday because of a snow-day built into the calendar, according to community members. \n \n The girls were supposed to be picked up by family later that afternoon, but did not show up, police said. They were reported missing about 5:30 p.m. \n \n A massive search of the area began, led by local and state police. A drone was used during the search and family members and friends of the girls assisted. A K-9 and dive team were also brought in to help find the girls. \n \n The Delphi Fire Department also assisted in the search, and their headquarters was used as a makeshift command center. \n \n “Having girls of our own, it just hit home,” one of the searchers, Karen Boucher, told the Logansport Pharos-Tribune. “We just wanted to do whatever we could.” \n \n Another searcher, Denise Hoverman, told the newspaper, “Nobody was even talking. It was very somber.” \n \n An Amber Alert was not issued because police said the case did not meet the criteria, which includes knowledge that a child under the age of 18 is in imminent danger and details about a vehicle or person possibly involved in the incident. The local news was notified and information about the girls was distributed online. \n \n “Even if we would have put an Amber Alert out, it wouldn’t have done this case any good,” Riley said at a press conference. “The short period of time and the location where the bodies were found, it would not have helped us in finding them.” \n \n Police initially said there was no foul play suspected, but that changed a day later. \n \n On Tuesday, police announced they found two bodies in Delphi, along Deer Creek, about a half mile from the railroad bridge where the girls had last been seen. \n \n “It’s been a long several hours,” Carroll County Sheriff Tobe Leazenby told reporters Tuesday afternoon. “It’s played tremendously on the emotions of this community.” \n \n Indiana State Police Sergeant Kim Riley told reporters, “One thing the family asked us to do is to thank the communities around Delphi and the people here in Delphi for assisting in attempting to locate the two young children who were missing here earlier. They just wanted to say thank you to those people and express their gratitude toward the hard work that was done in helping search for the children.” \n \n 2. They Posted a Final Photo on Snapchat While Hiking Along a Historic Railroad Bridge \n \n The girls posted an eerie final photo on Snapchat before they disappeared, according to WRTV. \n \n The photo, which you can see above, was posted about 2 p.m. It was taken by Liberty German and shows Abigail Williams walking along the railroad bridge. Liberty posted it to her Snapchat account. \n \n According to police and family members, the girls phones pinged in multiple locations but were shut off shortly after they were reported missing. \n \n A woman who was at the bridge commented on a Facebook post by a family member of one of the girls, saying she had been at the bridge shortly after the girls posted the photo. She said she didn’t notice anything out of the ordinary. \n \n “I even walked all the way across the bridge and back. I only (saw) a guy when I first got there and another couple once I got on the bridge,” Cheyenne Mekisha Engles wrote. “I didn’t see the girls at all. I also didn’t take the trail that leads to the right. Only took the trail that lead to the bridge.” \n \n The bridge where the girls were hiking is known as a popular spot in the Delphi area. It appears to have been an area where the girls had been before. \n \n Abigail’s mom, Anna Williams, has a photo of the bridge as her Facebook cover photo.

Community Members Expressed Concern Over the Lack of Details About the Case Released by Police \n \n Some community members in the small town of about 3,000 people have expressed concerned to local media about the lack of details released by police after the bodies were found. \n \n Officials from the Indiana State Police, Delphi Police Department and the Carroll County Sheriff’s Office both told reporters they were not able to share much information because of the ongoing investigation. \n \n A press conference Tuesday afternoon was filled with vague statements from police spokesmen. \n \n “We don’t have much at this time,” State Police Sergeant Kim Riley said at the press conference. “The Indiana State Police is assisting the Carroll County Sheriff’s Office and the Delphi City Police in the investigation here. We also have the FBI crime scene investigation group here out of Indianapolis.” \n \n “We don’t really want to put out too much information at this point of time,” he said. I know we’re not giving you much, I understand that. But we’re at the baby stages of this case. At this point of time I cannot release really much more information. As soon as I can, I will be more than happy to put stuff out.” \n \n Riley said he was not “at liberty” to give a description of the bodies found in Deer Creek, and also would not say who found the bodies. He also would not give further information about the condition of the bodies and whether they had been injured. \n \n When asked if there was a suspect or person of interest being questioned, Riley replied, “We have not gotten that far into the investigation so I cannot comment on that one way or the other.” \n \n Police were also asked if people in the community should be afraid. \n \n “I think people are smart enough in our community to draw their own conclusions about what they should feel and shouldn’t feel,” Delphi Police Chief Steve Mullin replied. “Our people are very smart. They are a very good community and they are very strong. And they are able to draw their own conclusions about this whole situation I think quite successfully.” \n \n The reporter clarified that he asked the question because some may be concerned when they hear the words “foul play suspected” that there may be somebody “preying on people that they need to be afraid of.” \n \n Mullin said he “understands” what he is saying, and again responded, “I think people are able to draw their own conclusions about this situation, and they’re smart enough to figure out what this situation warrants them to think. That’s all we have to say about that.” \n \n You can watch the full police press conference below: \n \n A local parent, Jennifer Robinson, was asked by the Lafayette Journal & Courier if she feels safe. \n \n “Not particularly, to be honest with you, and I’ve got three kids,” Robinson told the newspaper. “To me it’s kind of a big deal.” \n \n Dennis Walker, another Delphi resident, told the newspaper, “There’s a lot of blowing up going on at Facebook. A lot of angry people. A lot of other people saying we got to pray for the family, do what we can. \n \n “A lot of people go out there for a little hiking, a nice day in the woods, get a little exercise. This shouldn’t happen to you when you go out there,” he said. \n \n Julia Leahy told the Journal-Courier, it’s going to “take this community a long time” to get over this. \n \n Melissa Schwartz told WRTV, “I think it’s very scary, I was raised in Delphi, grew up in Delphi and we’ve never had anything like this happen in Delphi, so it’s very concerning.” \n \n While police have not called it a homicide investigation, some in the community have jumped to conclusions. \n \n “I would always be concerned about that until they find whatever murderous beast did this. I would watch my kids very carefully,” Kevin Kologinski told WRTV. “Mine are all grown up, my grandchildren are too young to be off on their own, but for any other kids that are out I’d keep a very close eye.” \n \n 4. The Girls Were Both Students at Delphi Community Middle School \n \n The girls were both students at the Delphi Community Middle School. \n \n “It is with heavy hearts that the school corporation day comes to an end. It is our understanding that the two bodies found today were those of our two missing Delphi Community Middle School students,” the school district said in a statement to WRTV. \n \n School officials said they plan to have counselors and pastors available for those who need them on Wednesday. The school will open as normal. \n \n Teenagers gathered outside the town’s firehouse on Tuesday after word spread about the bodies that were found, the Lafayette Journal & Courier reported. \n \n A vigil was held Tuesday night at the Delphi United Methodist Church, according to the Pharos-Tribune. \n \n Community members prayed for the families of the two girls, along with first responders, teachers and students. The service include readings from the book of Matthew. \n \n “The people that participated in the search and the people who have made every effort to find the victims in this case, it’s much appreciated,” Delphi Police Chief Steve Mullin told the newspaper at the vigil. “I know this has had a terrible effect on our people, and I am pleased to see the community come out and help us in every way they have. I’m proud to be a part of this community.” \n \n 5. Police Say They Are Confident They Will ‘Get to the Bottom of This’ \n \n Sergeant Kim Riley said on Twitter that investigators were still working at the crime scene late Tuesday evening. \n \n An autopsy was completed Wednesday morning, and police confirmed Williams and German were the victims of a double homicide. Authorities have not released a cause of death, and say further testing, including toxicology reports, are still being completed. \n \n “There is someone out there that did this crime and we’re going to track them down,” Carroll County Sheriff Tobe Leazenby told reporters. “Folks should continue with business as usual but be more mindful and watch your surroundings a little closer. We’re going to get to the bottom of this, we feel confident.” \n \n Riley said parents should keep an eye on their children. \n \n “I think people need to be cautious and careful,” Riley said. “Parents should make sure they know where their children are and what their children are doing, and if nothing else, know what’s going on in their lives. That’s the most important thing I can say at this point in time.” \n \n “We are asking for anyone to come forward with information or were in the area of the Delphi Historic Trails or Monon High Bridge that might have seen a person or persons, vehicles parked in the area or were taking pictures,” Indiana State Police said in a press release. “Any information may be helpful to solving this case. You can contact the Carroll County Sheriff’s Department or the Delphi Police Department at 765-564-2413, option #1, or the Indiana State Police at 765-567-2125. \n \n “Also, if you were parked at High Bridge Trail Head on February 13, 2017 between 1:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m. we would like to talk to you,” police said.', 'UPDATE: Authorities positively identified the two bodies found as Abigail ""Abby"" Williams,13, and Liberty ""Libby"" German,14. \n \n DELPHI, Ind. -- An hour after Delphi Assistant Fire Chief Curtis Borden told RTV6 two missing 13-year-old girls from Carroll County were found, calling it ""not good,"" authorities said at a press conference two bodies had been found in the area the girls went missing. \n \n Sergeant Kim Riley with the Indiana State Police wouldn\'t go so far as to identify the bodies as the girls in a press conference Tuesday, but they do suspect foul play. \n \n New Tip Line has been setup for information regarding deaths of Liberty Germa & Abigail Williams.

The requirement would also be satisfied if the student has a job or a job offer. \n \n The point, the mayor said, is to get Chicago Public Schools students in all parts of the city to stop seeing high school graduation as an ending and get them to consider what\'s next. \n \n ""Just like you do with your children, college, post-high school, that is what\'s expected,"" Emanuel said at a Wednesday morning news conference. ""If you change expectations, it\'s not hard for kids to adapt."" \n \n A top CPS official also acknowledged, however, that every Chicago public high school graduate essentially already meets the new standard because graduation guarantees admittance to the City Colleges of Chicago community college system. \n \n Assuming the idea wins approval from the Emanuel-controlled Chicago Board of Education, the new requirements would first affect the Class of 2020. CPS did not specify how it would amend its graduation policies, and only said the school board would take up the issue sometime in the future. \n \n Emanuel and his office said the ""groundbreaking"" effort would make CPS the nation\'s first large urban school district to require students to develop a plan for their lives after high school. He outlined the plan as CPS continues to struggle with financial problems that has led officials to warn the current school year could end three weeks early. \n \n Emanuel\'s proposal surprised education experts who had questions about the district\'s legal authority to impose such a sweeping new standard. There are also questions about how the policy could affect at-risk students in a system where only a fraction of high school graduates enroll and graduate from four-year institutions. \n \n ""I\'ve been doing this for 20 years and I\'ve never heard of anything like that,"" said Maria Ferguson, executive director of the Washington D.C.- based Center on Education Policy. ""The question I would have for Mayor Emanuel is: \'Where did this come from? What informed your thinking to lead you to believe that this was a good plan of action for CPS?\'"" \n \n But the biggest issue might be whether such a requirement is legal, Ferguson said. While schools often make a point of helping students apply to and enroll in colleges, requiring a plan in order to get a diploma is different. \n \n Emanuel and CPS Chief Education Officer Janice Jackson, who was also at the news conference, said the district already has graduation requirements that are above the state standards, and that as long as CPS meets the state minimum graduation requirements, it is legal to add things on top of that. \n \n They characterized the proposed requirement as a way to get children from all over the city to focus on their post-high school plans. \n \n ""We all need to change how we think about what it means to be a high school graduate — a diploma alone isn\'t enough anymore,"" Jackson said in a statement. \n \n CPS high school graduation requirements already include at least one credit of computer science and the completion of two community service learning projects. Illinois school regulations also allow local school boards to adopt ""additional requirements for graduation."" \n \n State laws and regulations aren\'t clear on exactly how much authority school districts have to expand graduation requirements, said Miranda Johnson, who is the associate director of the Education Law and Policy Institute at Loyola University\'s School of Law. \n \n ""I think that raises questions when the requirements go beyond academic curriculum and extend into the student\'s post-secondary choices,"" Johnson said. ""I think it also raises questions if those requirements are contingent on a third party\'s action that may go beyond the scope of what the student can control."" \n \n Emanuel\'s initiative would allow the mayor to continue promoting the City Colleges of Chicago and push a potential flood of new applicants to schools that must already accept most students. Emanuel recently installed a longtime ally, Latino activist Juan Salgado, as chancellor of the system. \n \n State law already requires Illinois community college districts to admit students qualified to complete any of the schools\' programs, as long as space is available. That could provide an out for a student who isn\'t quite sure what to do after high school, officials said. \n \n Asked whether a student who doesn\'t get one of these letters of acceptance would be prohibited from graduating from high school Jackson said in part: \n \n ""If a student graduates from a Chicago public school, they are automatically accepted into one of our City Colleges. And if a student is at a point where they\'re undecided … we do have that option there for them."" \n \n But processing a possible surge of college applicants would likely require CPS to hire more counselors and could also have implications for the city\'s community colleges, said education policy analyst Rodney Estvan of the Access Living disability rights group. \n \n ""Everybody who graduates from high school is going to be accepted into a community college. That\'s law,"" Estvan said. ""They\'re going to be accepted into City Colleges. Hopefully (CPS) will hire more high school counselors and they\'ll get these kids\' applications in and do what they have to do."" \n \n At the same time, Estvan said the new policy could put a strain on local community colleges. \n \n The City Colleges system has continued to struggle with ""softened"" enrollment numbers, as the system also looks at burning cash reserves and making cuts because of the state\'s protracted budget impasse. \n \n At the same time, the system has said it has seen larger numbers of incoming students ""without the required academic preparation,"" which has led to higher demand for remedial courses and support services. \n \n ""It\'s going to be really hairy for the community colleges if a high percentage of these kids actually show up, because they\'re going broke,"" Estvan said. \n \n There may be other practical implications involved with pushing at-risk students to prove they have jobs or have been accepted into apprenticeship programs.']",3,"– Two 13-year-old Indiana girls had Monday off from school and were dropped off at a popular hiking spot in Delphi, but didn't show up when it was time for them to be picked up—and on Tuesday, their bodies were found. On Wednesday, police officially identified the bodies as Liberty German and Abigail Williams, the AP reports. Police say that foul play is suspected, the Indianapolis Star reports; their deaths are being investigated as homicides. The girls were dropped off around 1pm Monday and were supposed to be picked up later by family members, who searched the area when the girls didn't meet them as planned. They were reported missing at 5:30pm, and search parties set out; the bodies were found around 12:15pm the next day near Deer Creek, a half-mile or so upstream from Monon High Bridge, an abandoned railroad truss that spans the creek, where the girls had been dropped off. The bridge is a popular hiking spot—""a lot of people go out there for a little hiking, a nice day in the woods, get a little exercise,"" a local tells the Lafayette Journal & Courier—and Heavy notes that, even before her daughter went missing, Abigail's mother had a picture of it as her Facebook cover photo. The last known photo of the girls is a picture of Abigail walking along the bridge, which has no guard rails, that Liberty posted to her Snapchat account around 2:07pm Monday, the Indy Channel reports. Per the Logansport Pharos-Tribune, police say they suspect foul play ""because of the nature of the bodies."" The public information officer for the Indiana State Police says autopsies will be done Wednesday; authorities have not commented publicly on cause of death. The school district sent letters home with students Tuesday saying that counseling will be available."
154,"['An advertisement revealing how alcohol absorbs into bloodstreams and can cause cancer is the most effective alcohol education ad internationally, a Cancer Council Victoria suggests. \n \n ‘Spread’, created by The Brand Agency in 2010 for the Western Australia Alcohol and Drug Office, shows how drinking too much alcohol could heighten risks of cell mutations and cause cancer. \n \n Published in the British Medical Journal Open, the study compared 83 alcohol education advertisements around the world, with ‘Spread’ reported as the most likely to motivate drinkers to reduce alcohol consumption. \n \n The study involved 2,174 adults who regularly consume alcohol. The study subjects were shown three randomly selected ads from the pool of options before reporting the extent to which they felt motivated to reduce drinking following the viewing. \n \n Each advertisement was scored on a five-point scale, with one being lowest and five being highest motivation. \n \n ‘Spread’ received a score of 3.77, performing best among male and females, all ages, as well as low and high-risk drinkers. \n \n Todd Harper, Cancer Council Victoria’s CEO said the research shows how campaigns can be used to help inform the public of the long-term consequences of alcohol consumption. \n \n “We’ve seen how effective campaigns around drink driving and short-term harms such as injury or violence have been in terms of changing our drinking habits, but in Victoria and the majority of the rest of Australia, we rarely see the long-term health effects of alcohol portrayed on our screens,” he said. \n \n “This research highlights how effective a campaign like this could be in terms of motivating people to better understand the risks of alcohol consumption. \n \n “These findings should now be used to plan campaigns that empower the community with knowledge about the harms of alcohol, so they can reduce their cancer risk.” \n \n The study was conducted by the Cancer Council’s Centre for Behavioural Research in Cancer and funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council. \n \n Cancer Council Victoria hopes to use the advertisement in a campaign later this year. \n \n Nine’s Today Show Extra this morning built on Harper’s comments, discussing whether alcohol packaging could or should go in the same direction as cigarette advertising, following the study’s revelations.', 'Known and Probable Human Carcinogens \n \n Many people worry that substances or exposures in their environment may cause cancer. As part of the American Cancer Society’s role in informing and educating people about cancer and its possible causes, this document provides lists of substances and exposures that are known or suspected to cause cancer. The lists below have been developed by two highly respected agencies – the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and the US National Toxicology Program (NTP). Some related information is included on how these and other agencies and groups test and classify possible carcinogens. \n \n The American Cancer Society does not keep detailed information on each of the exposures on these lists. If you are looking for more in-depth information on a particular item on these lists, please refer to the agencies in the “Additional resources” section. \n \n What is a carcinogen? \n \n Cancer is caused by changes in a cell’s DNA – its genetic “blueprint.” Some of these changes may be inherited from our parents. Others may be caused by outside exposures, which are often referred to as environmental factors. Environmental factors can include a wide range of exposures, such as: \n \n Lifestyle factors (nutrition, tobacco use, physical activity, etc.) \n \n Naturally occurring exposures (ultraviolet light, radon gas, infectious agents, etc.) \n \n Medical treatments (radiation and medicines including chemotherapy, hormone drugs, drugs that suppress the immune system, etc.) \n \n Workplace exposures \n \n Household exposures \n \n Pollution \n \n Substances and exposures that can lead to cancer are called carcinogens. Some carcinogens do not affect DNA directly, but lead to cancer in other ways. For example, they may cause cells to divide at a faster than normal rate, which could increase the chances that DNA changes will occur. \n \n Carcinogens do not cause cancer in every case, all the time. Substances labeled as carcinogens may have different levels of cancer-causing potential. Some may cause cancer only after prolonged, high levels of exposure. And for any particular person, the risk of developing cancer depends on many factors, including how they are exposed to a carcinogen, the length and intensity of the exposure, and the person\'s genetic makeup. \n \n How do researchers determine if something is a carcinogen? \n \n Testing to see if something can cause cancer is often difficult. It is not ethical to test a substance by exposing people to it and seeing if they get cancer from it. That’s why scientists must use other types of tests, which may not always give clear answers. \n \n Lab studies \n \n Scientists get much of their data about whether something might cause cancer from lab studies in cell cultures and animals. There are far too many substances (both natural and man-made) to test each one in lab animals, so scientists use what is already known about chemical structures, results from other types of lab tests, the extent of human exposure, and other factors to select chemicals for testing. For example, they can often get an idea about whether a substance might cause a problem by comparing it to similar chemicals that have already been studied. \n \n Although lab studies alone can\'t always predict if a substance will cause cancer in people, virtually all known human carcinogens that have been adequately tested also cause cancer in lab animals. In many cases, carcinogens are first found to cause cancer in lab animals and are later found to cause cancer in people. \n \n Most studies of potential carcinogens expose the lab animals to doses that are much higher than common human exposures. This is so that cancer risk can be detected in relatively small groups of animals. It is not always clear if the results from animal studies will be the same for people as they are normally exposed to a substance. For example, the effects seen in lab studies with very high doses of a substance may not be the same at much lower doses, or the effects of a substance when it is inhaled may not be the same as if it is applied to the skin. Also, the bodies of lab animals and humans don\'t always process substances in the same way. \n \n But for safety reasons, it is usually assumed that exposures that cause cancer at larger doses in animals may also cause cancer in people. It isn\'t always possible to know how the exposure dose might affect risk, but it is reasonable for public health purposes to assume that lowering human exposure will reduce risk. \n \n Studies in people \n \n Another important way to identify carcinogens is through epidemiologic studies, which look at human populations to determine which factors might be linked to cancer. These studies also provide useful information, but they have their limits. Humans do not live in a controlled environment. People are exposed to many substances at any given time, including those they encounter at work, school, or home; in the food they eat; and in the air they breathe. It\'s very unlikely they know exactly what they\'ve been exposed to or that they would be able to remember all of their exposures if asked by a researcher. And there are usually many years (often decades) between exposure to a carcinogen and the development of cancer. Therefore, it can be very hard to definitely link any particular exposure to cancer. \n \n By combining data from both types of studies, scientists do their best to make an educated assessment of a substance\'s cancer-causing ability. When the evidence is conclusive, the substance is labeled as a carcinogen. When the available evidence is compelling but not felt to be conclusive, the substance may be considered to be a probable carcinogen. But in some cases there simply isn\'t enough information to be certain one way or the other. \n \n Who determines how carcinogens are classified? \n \n Several national and international agencies are responsible for determining the cancer-causing potential of different substances. \n \n International Agency for Research on Cancer \n \n The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) is part of the World Health Organization (WHO). One of its major goals is to identify causes of cancer. The most widely used system for classifying carcinogens comes from the IARC. In the past 30 years, the IARC has evaluated the cancer-causing potential of more than 900 likely candidates, placing them into one of the following groups: \n \n Group 1: Carcinogenic to humans \n \n Group 2A: Probably carcinogenic to humans \n \n Group 2B: Possibly carcinogenic to humans \n \n Group 3: Unclassifiable as to carcinogenicity in humans \n \n Group 4: Probably not carcinogenic to humans \n \n Perhaps not surprisingly, based on how hard it can be to test these candidate carcinogens, most are listed as being of probable, possible, or unknown risk. Only a little over 100 are classified as “carcinogenic to humans.” \n \n National Toxicology Program \n \n The National Toxicology Program (NTP) is formed from parts of several different US government agencies, including the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The NTP updates its Report on Carcinogens (RoC) every few years. \n \n The Report on Carcinogens identifies 2 groups of agents: \n \n “Known to be human carcinogens” \n \n “Reasonably anticipated to be human carcinogens” \n \n The current version of the RoC lists about 250 substances and exposures. Unlike the IARC’s list, the RoC does not list substances that have been studied and found not to be carcinogens. \n \n Environmental Protection Agency \n \n The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) maintains the Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS), an electronic database that contains information on human health effects from exposure to certain substances in the environment. The EPA uses a rating system similar to that of IARC when describing the cancer-causing potential of a substance: \n \n Group A: Carcinogenic to humans \n \n Group B: Likely to be carcinogenic to humans \n \n Group C: Suggestive evidence of carcinogenic potential \n \n Group D: Inadequate information to assess carcinogenic potential \n \n Group E: Not likely to be carcinogenic to humans \n \n Other agencies and groups \n \n Other federal agencies, such as the CDC’s National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) may comment on whether a substance or exposure may cause cancer and/or what levels of exposure to a particular substance might be considered acceptable. \n \n Some state agencies also keep lists of known or probable carcinogens. For example, the California Environmental Protection Agency (CalEPA) maintains a list of “chemicals known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity.” (Much of this list is based on the IARC and NTP lists below.) \n \n The American Cancer Society’s role \n \n The American Cancer Society (ACS) contributes in many ways to evaluating how environmental factors affect a person\'s likelihood of developing cancer, including: \n \n Conducting epidemiologic research on the causes of cancer \n \n Funding laboratory and epidemiologic research at universities and other institutions that study environmental causes of cancer \n \n Advocating for environmental health on local, state, and federal levels \n \n Informing the public about environmental factors that affect cancer risk and how to decrease their risk of developing cancer \n \n In most cases, the ACS does not directly evaluate whether a certain substance or exposure causes cancer. Instead, the ACS looks to national and international organizations such as the NTP and IARC, whose mission is to evaluate environmental cancer risks based on evidence from laboratory and human research studies. \n \n Some important points about the IARC and NTP lists here \n \n The IARC and NTP act independently but have studied many of the same agents, so many known or suspected carcinogens appear on both lists. But because an agent appears on one and not on the other does not necessarily mean there is a controversy, as one agency may not have evaluated it. \n \n Unfortunately, many of the substances and exposures on the lists below can often go by different names. This can make it hard to find a particular substance on one or both of these lists, which are in alphabetical order and may not always use the most common term. \n \n These lists include only those agents that have been evaluated by the agencies. These agencies tend to focus on substances and exposures most likely to cause cancer, but there are many others that have not been studied fully yet. \n \n Most of the agents on the lists have been linked only with certain kinds of cancer, not all types. For more detailed information, refer to the specific monographs or reports published by the agencies (available on their websites). \n \n The lists describe the level of evidence that something can cause cancer, not how likely it is that something will cause cancer in any particular person. For example, IARC considers there to be strong evidence that both tobacco smoking and eating processed meat can cause cancer, so both are listed as “carcinogenic to humans.” But smoking is much more likely to cause cancer than eating processed meat, even though both are in the same category. \n \n Carcinogens do not cause cancer at all times, under all circumstances. Some may only be carcinogenic if a person is exposed in a certain way (for example, swallowing it as opposed to touching it). Some may only cause cancer in people who have a certain genetic makeup. Some of these agents may lead to cancer after only a very small exposure, while others might require intense exposure over many years. Again, you should refer to the agencies’ reports for specifics. \n \n Even if a substance or exposure is known or suspected to cause cancer, this does not necessarily mean that it can or should be avoided at all costs. For example, estrogen is a known carcinogen that occurs naturally in the body. Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from sunlight is also known to cause cancer, but it’s not practical (or advisable) to completely avoid the sun. These lists also include many commonly used medicines, particularly some hormones and drugs used to treat cancer. For example, tamoxifen increases the risk of certain kinds of uterine cancer but can be very useful in treating some breast cancers, which may be more important for some women. If you have questions about a medicine that appears on one of these lists, be sure to ask your doctor. \n \n Looking at the list below can tell you whether or not something may increase your risk of cancer, but it is important to try to get an idea of how much it might increase your risk. It is also important to know what your risk is to begin with. Many factors can enter into this, including your age, gender, family history, and lifestyle factors (tobacco and alcohol use, weight, diet, physical activity level, etc.). As noted above, the type and extent of exposure to a substance may also play a role. You should consider the actual amount of increased risk when deciding if you should limit or avoid an exposure. \n \n Known human carcinogens \n \n International Agency for Research on Cancer \n \n

That's the finding of a new study published in the BMJ Open journal that examined English-language alcohol ads to identify which ones proved best at inspiring drinkers to cut down. Researchers tapped a pool of 2,174 Australian adults ages 18 to 64 who drink alcohol at least one or two days a week. A total of 83 ads were shown, and the subjects were instructed to note after viewing each one how motivated they were to reduce their drinking on a scale from one to five, with ""one"" counting as an unmotivated ""Nah, I'm good,"" and ""five"" as ""Take the key to my liquor cabinet and bury it, please."" The most effective ad: ""Spread,"" a 30-second video created by the Western Australian government a few years ago that shows the cancerous mutations wrought after alcohol gets into one's bloodstream. The dud: that ad pushing water over beer. Cancer Council Victoria CEO Todd Harper tells the Guardian that ""Spread"" may have made an impact because folks simply don't know alcohol is a Group 1 carcinogen, the most dangerous category. Even though Fergus Taylor, the director of Alcohol Beverages Australia, calls the ""Spread"" ad ""scaremongering,"" Harper notes ""every drink"" ups one's chance of getting cancer, including that of the mouth, liver, and bowel. What these findings should do is spur campaigns that maximize the public's awareness of alcohol so they can cut their cancer risk, Harper says, per Mumbrella. (A study says alcohol can be directly tied to seven cancers.)"

He also remembers some of the last words she spoke to him before he shipped out in 1970 at age 21: ""She told me she was pregnant,"" he tells the Washington Post. Reischl, now 67, had been warned by his Air Force superiors that it could be a trap to get him to take the sex worker back to America with him, and he never found out if it was just a line, though he's returned to Vietnam four times searching for an answer.

(Photo: Dan Powers/P-C Media) \n \n The shooting happened near the pavilion on the bridge. No police officers fired their weapons. \n \n Valencia del Toro\'s ex-fiance is cooperating with authorities, police said. \n \n Styka said police had no contact with Valencia del Toro before the incident. He was a second-semester freshman at the University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh, studying criminal justice. He previously served in the U.S. Air Force and recently enlisted in the U.S. Army, Styka said. \n \n He also had been training as a member of the Menasha Auxiliary Police, an unarmed group of volunteers interested in community service. \n \n Robert Kelley, an airman who served with Valencia del Toro from 2010 to 2014, described him as a ""carefree, happy guy."" \n \n ""I mean, he had his share of problems like anybody else, but I could never imagine him randomly shooting people,"" Kelley said in an online interview Monday while serving at an Air Force base in South Korea. \n \n Air Force records show that Valencia del Toro was a senior airman when he was discharged from the service in 2014. The nature of his discharge was not released. \n \n He served from November 2008 to March 2014 as a food service journeyman, said Mike Dickerson, a spokesman for the Air Force Personnel Center in San Antonio. \n \n Valencia del Toro\'s last service station was Travis Air Force Base near Fairfield, Calif. Valencia del Toro\'s Facebook page and online records indicate he lived on the base after growing up in Los Angeles. \n \n Erin Stoffel got herself and her two other children, son Ezra, 7, and daughter Selah, 5, off the bridge. She told Ezra to run to the west end of the bridge to get help. \n \n Winnebago County Coroner Barry Busby said that as the boy exited the bridge, an unidentified person ""gathered him in — he and the dog — and kept them safe and got help coming."" \n \n ""It was a little boy who helped save his mother\'s life,"" Busby said. \n \n Georgen said the quick notification allowed police and emergency personnel to respond swiftly to the scene and made the difference between life and death. Georgen was amazed at the power of the human spirit shown by Erin Stoffel. \n \n ""You can never underestimate the power of a mother to protect her children,"" he said. ""To have three gunshot wounds and be able to get off that bridge and save two of her children is incredible. It\'s an amazing story of heroism on her part and certainly of her children."" \n \n Erin Stoffel works part-time at the Neenah-Menasha YMCA.

She\'s a sweetheart … We consider her and her family part of our YMCA family,"" he said. ""It\'s the loss of a family member when we lost her husband and daughter, and we\'re worried for her."" \n \n Styka said the shooting spree could have been worse considering the weapons and ammunition Valencia del Toro had. Two handguns — a 9 mm semi-automatic pistol and a revolver — were fired, and Styka said at least six to 10 rounds were spent. \n \n The chief said Valencia del Toro shot the Stoffels and Bentdahl with the pistol and then shot himself with the revolver. \n \n Valencia del Toro had a holster on his right hip and ammunition on his left hip when he arrived at Theda Clark for treatment, Georgen said. He was wearing camouflage pants. \n \n Styka said Valencia del Toro owned the two handguns, plus other unspecified weapons that police recovered from his residence. \n \n Georgen said the Stoffel family was overwhelmed with the swelling of support from the community following the tragedy. ""Obviously, we can\'t even imagine what they\'re going through right now with the loss of two family members,"" he said. \n \n Family members are taking care of the two surviving children. The Stoffel children attend Fox Valley Christian Academy in Neenah. \n \n A GoFundMe page has been set up to take donations for the Stoffel family. \n \n AUDIO: Listen to the emergency response. \n \n The shooting spree took place on the west end of the bridge that spans Little Lake Butte des Morts and connects Menasha and the Town of Menasha. At least 75 people were in the area of the bridge when the shooting happened, police said. \n \n More than 30 officers from Menasha, Town of Menasha, Appleton, Neenah, Winnebago County Sheriff\'s Department and State Patrol responded to the scene within 15 minutes, Styka said. Police flooded both ends of the bridge — at Fritse Park in the Town of Menasha and at the Menasha lock in the city. \n \n Detectives from Menasha, Town of Menasha and Neenah worked through the night to analyze the crime scene and interview witnesses.

She was later identified as Andrea Kuiper, 26, of Virginia. \n \n A woman struck and killed by two vehicles 27 years ago in Huntington Beach has been identified, officials announced Thursday morning.The Orange County Sheriff\'s Department Coroner\'s Division confirmed the woman\'s identify as 26-year-old Andrea Kuiper of Fairfax, Virginia.Authorities said Andrea Kuiper was struck by two vehicles as she was crossing Pacific Coast Highway on April 1, 1990.""It was a very tragic death. Not that most of them aren\'t, this was just particularly tragic because she was just crossing the street in Huntington Beach,"" Kelly Keyes, supervising deputy coroner said.Investigators said the woman didn\'t have any identification on her. The only clues they had to go by were her clothes.""They believed she was from Virginia, although someone said possibly from Newport in Virginia, which wasn\'t entirely accurate, and that she said she was adopted,"" Keyes explained.Andrea Kuiper\'s information was provided to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children at the time of her death, officials said. NCMEC recreated images of what Andrea Kuiper may have looked like and the images were distributed to the media.Investigators said the creation of the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System in 2010, and it\'s partnership with the FBI in March 2017 to check fingerprints, helped lead to Andrea Kuiper\'s identification.""Instead of looking at a 10-print system with all 10 fingers, there were looking at them individually, which is more like they would do at a crime scene,"" Keyes detailed.Investigators got a hit when her fingerprints matched the ones taken when she applied for a job at the Department of Agriculture just three years before her death.""It was one of those once in a career type moments to know that Andrea was Andrea,"" Keyes described.After Andrea Kuiper was identified on May 4, investigators worked to locate her parents to tell them about the discovery.""We are thankful to know what happened to our daughter after all these years,"" her father Richard Kuiper said in a written release. ""Andrea was loved and respected. She was beautiful. But she was manic depressive, and therefore we had been through quite an adventure.""', ""It was 10 p.m. on April Fools’ Day, 1990. As a woman tried to cross Pacific Coast Highway in Huntington Beach, two cars hit her. \n \n Police found her dead on the road, wearing a black dress with fishnet stockings and pink heels. She had a strand of hair wrapped around her finger like a ring, and a lock of hair in her pocket. \n \n For 27 years, no one knew who she was, and her family was never told of her death. \n \n Now, thanks to a push to connect fingerprint databases among U.S. agencies, authorities have finally learned her identity: Andrea Kuiper, a 26-year-old Virginia native. \n \n A mystery, and no answer in sight \n \n There was too much trauma to Kuiper’s face to release a photo after her death, said Kelly Keyes, an Orange County supervising deputy coroner. Instead, authorities released a sketch and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children even created and circulated a computer-generated model of what she might look like. \n \n ( Orange County Sheriff's Department ) \n \n (Orange County Sheriff's Department) \n \n The sketches helped investigators in some ways, but they didn’t resolve the matter. The closest police got to learning her identity was a few people telling them that her name was Andrea. One person told investigators that they thought she may be from Newport News, Va. \n \n This was a case that should have been easier than many others to solve, Keyes said. Investigators had her DNA, dental records, fingerprints, even a first name. \n \n About seven years ago, they put all her information into the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs), a national searchable database established in 2010 to help solve cold cases such as this one. \n \n But the years went on, and Andrea’s identity remained a mystery. \n \n Decades later, looking for a match \n \n Keyes has been leading the effort to get answers on unidentified bodies for about a year and a half. There are more than 90 open cases. She has solved two. \n \n Last year, Keyes reviewed the file and reached out to Newport News police “to make sure they didn’t have any new missing person reports matching Andrea’s description,” Keyes said. They didn’t. \n \n Shown is a screenshot of Andrea Kuiper's case summary. (Orange County Sheriff's Department) \n \n The breakthrough came thanks to a partnership between the FBI and NamUs to solve more cases such as this one. Kuiper, it turns out, worked for the U.S. Department of Agriculture , Keyes said. Her job application in 1987 included fingerprints, and someone in the federal government had finally put those fingerprints into a system that the FBI accessed and shared with NamUs, she said. \n \n Finally, last week, there was a match. \n \n “We were very excited,” Keyes said. “We’re here to serve the public and try to get a family answers and support the deceased. So to finally get Andrea a name was doing exactly what we hoped to do.” \n \n Who was Andrea Kuiper? \n \n One of two children, Kuiper loved ice skating and art as a girl — her parents still have some of her drawings, they said in a statement. Her family described her as “smart, clever, attractive and persuasive,” according to a news release from the Orange County Sheriff’s Department. \n \n The last her parents heard of her was from a friend a few months before the accident, who told them Kuiper was safe. They never filed a missing person’s report, Keyes said. \n \n “We are thankful to know what happened to our daughter after all these years,” Andrea’s father, Richard Kuiper, said in a statement. “Andrea was loved and respected. She was beautiful. But she was manic depressive, and therefore we had been through quite an adventure.” \n \n All the family has always wanted, Richard Kuiper said, was to see Andrea driving up to their Virginia home in a “car full of beautiful children and say, ‘Hi, it’s me.’” \n \n Support our journalism Already a subscriber?

For 27 years, police have tried to figure out who she was—and now she's finally been identified. Andrea Kuiper of Fairfax, Va., an artist who suffered from manic depression, started using drugs, and moved to California. Two months before her death at age 26 that night in 1990, a friend called her family to say she was safe, and they never heard news of her again. They never filed a missing persons report. Now they have answers, and in a statement, her father says they ""are thankful to know what happened to our daughter after all these years. Andrea was loved and respected. She was beautiful. But she was manic depressive, and therefore we had been through quite an adventure."" Authorities, thinking she could be a teenager, submitted her data to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, and her story was featured on TV's Unsolved Mysteries. In 2010, the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs) was created, and authorities added her information to that. But none of those measures led to an identification. Then, this year, the FBI worked with NamUs to closely examine fingerprints, and found a match for the unidentified victim: fingerprints given by Andrea Kuiper when she applied for a job with the Department of Agriculture three years before her death, ABC 7 reports. Authorities are happy to have given the former Jane Doe her identity back, but it's a tragic end for her family; per the Los Angeles Times, Kuiper's dad says they always hoped she'd drive up in a ""car full of beautiful children and say, ‘Hi, it’s me.'"""

That's what the Swedish city of Kiruna has decided because iron mining below it has weakened the foundations of houses and buildings, Tech Insider reports. Now LKAB, the state-owned company behind the mining, is dedicating billions of dollars to moving Kiruna about 2 miles east. The ongoing 30-year plan includes relocating 21 particular buildings (like Kiruna's city hall and its attractive church) and paying residents to have their homes demolished and rebuilt at the new location, the Guardian reported last year. An Arctic city that's in darkness most of the year, Kiruna ""will be a bit like a walking millipede with a thousand feet, moving, crawling, slowly ... toward the east,"" says an architect in a promotional video for the plan. Critics say social networks will be shattered by the move and relocated residents will have higher rents, but on the bright side, the new city is supposed to be more walkable and economically diverse. Plus there's a lot at stake: Founded partly by LKAB in 1900, the city of 18,000 supplies the European Union with 90% of its iron. ""There might be some concerns, but the mine has to keep operating,"" a resident says. It's not a first, either: Cities have been relocated before for economic or safety reasons, and other towns are considering moves over climate change, the New York Times notes. Only possible problem for Kiruna? ""Iron is under the new town center, too,"" admits a city official. ""[But] it will be too expensive for LKAB to move the city again.""

""So, two weeks ago, they had to cut off her right leg just above the knee, her left leg just below the knee and both her arms about mid-forearm."" \n \n Keith Rogers said that he visits his wife every day at the hospital as she battles other complications from RMSF, including blood clots in her lungs that necessitated a tracheotomy last Friday. \n \n ""Every day is a new challenge,"" he said. ""I go in there, sit and talk to her and show her pictures of how our two boys are doing. I show her videos of her two dogs back at home. I try to keep it normal, but it gets very hard because she\'ll want me not to leave, and it\'s so hard because I can\'t take her with me."" \n \n Though Jo Rogers currently can\'t speak or walk, her husband wants people to know she is a fun-loving woman who loved her dogs, hiking and nature. \n \n The couple went hiking at Natural Falls State Park, close to the Oklahoma-Arkansas border, this past Fourth of July, he said, explaining that there weren\'t many waterfalls in Oklahoma and she wanted to go see one. \n \n ""But when we came back, she started feeling sick, and she thought she might have the flu,"" Keith Rogers said, noting that headaches turned into fevers that then became aggravated with vomiting and dizziness. \n \n Though his wife initially resisted going to the hospital, she was so lethargic a week later that ""she wasn\'t making any sense,"" Keith Rogers said, so he took her to the emergency room. \n \n As her health deteriorated, doctors did rounds of tests on her, including tests for meningitis and West Nile Virus, but they only figured out she had complications from a tick-borne illness when she was already developing gangrene on her limbs, he said. \n \n ""We\'re not sure if she was bit by the tick when we were hiking at the falls or if it was at home,"" he said. ""I don\'t think it\'s really set in with my family yet, but for me, it\'s up and down every day."" \n \n Keith Rogers said he\'s not sure if his wife will be in the hospital for a few more months or a year, but once she\'s fully recovered, he said she\'ll likely transition to rehab and that the family would take it from there. \n \n A GoFundMe page to help cover the costs of Jo\'s medical care has been set up by her cousin, he added. \n \n ""RMSF is the most commonly reported tick-borne illness in Oklahoma,"" according to the state Health Department. ""In addition, Oklahoma has one of the highest rates of RMSF in the United States."" \n \n A spokesperson for Integris\' Baptist Medical Center told ABC News that Jo Rogers\' physician declined to be interviewed but confirmed she was currently at the hospital being treated for RMSF and that she has had amputations. \n \n Dr. Jennifer Ashton, a senior medical contributor for ABC News, said RMSF is s currently in peak tick season. \n \n ""It\'s been reported in urban areas and even found in people who have not been camping,"" she said. \n \n The symptoms -- fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, and rash -- can mimic a lot of viruses, she said. \n \n ""If there is a suspicion that these symptoms could be related to a tick bite, the recommendation is to start doxycycline antibiotics immediately because time is of the essence,"" said Ashton.', ""This is my precious, beautiful cousin, Jo Rogers.

She has been in the 3 different hospitals since July 9th, after a short vacation in NE Oklahoma. Shortly after being moved to an Oklahoma City hospital, she went into septic shock and was put on a ventilator into a medical coma. She was tested for West Nile Virus, meningitis and all other bacterial and viral infections. To protect her vital organs, her body deferred the infection to her limbs. Since then she has had surgeries to remove her right leg mid-thigh, her left leg below the knee and both of her arms mid-forearm. She will soon have more surgeries on her arms to prevent the infection from spreading more. Last Friday, it was found that she has a blood clot in her lung, more infection in her blood and they are fighting the possibility of pneumonia.

Share Tweet 3.2k total shares total shares"", 'In 1976, 16-year-old model Babi Christina Engelhardt embarked on a hidden eight-year affair with the 41–year-old filmmaker that mirrors one of his most famous movies. Now, amid the #MeToo reckoning and Allen’s personal scandals, she looks back with mixed emotions on their relationship and its unequal dynamic. \n \n Sixteen, emerald-eyed, blond, an aspiring model with a confident streak and a painful past: Babi Christina Engelhardt had just caught Woody Allen\'s gaze at legendary New York City power restaurant Elaine\'s. It was October 1976, and when Engelhardt returned from the ladies\' room, she dropped a note on his table with her phone number. It brazenly read: ""Since you\'ve signed enough autographs, here\'s mine!"" \n \n Soon, Allen rang, inviting her to his Fifth Avenue penthouse. The already-famous 41-year-old director, still hot off Sleeper and who\'d release Annie Hall the following spring, never asked her age. But she told him she was still in high school, living with her family in rural New Jersey as she pursued her modeling ambitions in Manhattan. Within weeks, they\'d become physically intimate at his place. She wouldn\'t turn 17, legal in New York, until that December. \n \n The pair embarked on, by her account, a clandestine romance of eight years, the claustrophobic, controlling and yet dreamy dimensions of which she\'s still processing more than four decades later. For her, the recent re-examination of gender power dynamics initiated by the #MeToo movement (and Allen\'s personal scandals, including a claim of sexual abuse by his adopted daughter Dylan Farrow) has turned what had been a melancholic if still sweet memory into something much more uncomfortable. Like others among her generation — she just turned 59 on Dec. 4 — Engelhardt is resistant to attempts to have the life she led then be judged by what she considers today\'s newly established norms. ""It\'s almost as if I\'m now expected to trash him,"" she says. \n \n Time, though, has transfigured what she\'s long viewed as a secret, unspoken monument to their then-still-ongoing relationship: 1979\'s Manhattan, in which 17-year-old Tracy (Oscar-nominated Mariel Hemingway) enthusiastically beds Allen\'s 42-year-old character Isaac ""Ike"" Davis. The film has always ""reminded me why I thought he was so interesting — his wit is magnetic,"" Engelhardt says. ""It was why I liked him and why I\'m still impressed with him as an artist. How he played with characters in his movies, and how he played with me."" \n \n Two of Engelhardt\'s close friends from the period affirm they were aware of Engelhardt\'s relationship with Allen at the time — one would even drop her off at his penthouse. Photographer Andrew Unangst, who was dining with her at Elaine\'s the night she made her move on Allen, also says he knew about the long-running tryst she initiated that night. ""She was a knockout, and outgoing too,"" he says of the gambit. Engelhardt\'s younger brother Mike remembers Allen calling their parents\' home: ""I\'d holler out, \'Babi, it\'s Woody!\' My brain didn\'t think something romantic; I was 11 or 12 and a huge fan. I mean, Bananas?!"" \n \n Engelhardt and her journey, shared here publicly for the first time, are complicated. She\'s proud of her teenage self as an up-by-her-bootstraps heroine who successfully beguiled a ""celebrated genius."" Even now, she holds herself largely responsible for remaining in the relationship as long as she did and for the frustration and sorrow that ultimately came with the liaison — one in which, by her description, she never held any agency. (Most experts would contend that such an uneven power dynamic is inherently exploitative.) \n \n Even with hindsight, though, she\'s unwilling to indict Allen, who declined to comment for this story. ""What made me speak is I thought I could provide a perspective,"" she offers. ""I\'m not attacking Woody,"" she says. ""This is not \'bring down this man.\' I\'m talking about my love story. This made me who I am. I have no regrets."" \n \n *** \n \n Today, Engelhardt (who dropped Babi from her name and goes by Christina), is a divorcee and mother of two college-aged daughters living in a crystal-filled apartment in the flats of Beverly Hills. Since childhood, she says she\'s been a psychic reader, interpreting the stars for boldface names (just as she once did for Allen, who was not impressed). One paid psychic client, the late Pop Minimalist artist Patrick Nagel, gifted her the original piece above her living room sofa. It\'s here, with a portfolio of her yellowed and brittle modeling photos in hand, that Engelhardt travels into her past. \n \n Open and thoughtful, Engelhardt unspools a life story that took root in a strict German immigrant household and blossomed into a Zelig-esque series of adventures as she attempted to break into modeling: partying with Iman, jet-setting with Adnan Khashoggi, dining with Stephen King, working as a personal assistant to Jeffrey Epstein, the billionaire financier later convicted for soliciting an underage girl. Following her time with Allen, she went on to become a platonic muse to Federico Fellini during the auteur\'s late-life journeys in Rome and Tulum, Mexico, then spent years tending to egos as a hostess in the executive dining room at Paramount before landing her current gig, working as an assistant for producer Bob Evans. What\'s made her attractive to these powerful men, both personally and professionally, she posits, is in part what Allen appreciated in the first place: ""I was pretty enough, I was smart enough, I was nonconfrontational, I was non-judgmental, I was discreet, and nothing shocks me."" \n \n She\'s already written, and kept private, two volumes of unpublished memoirs, one focusing on her Fellini years, the other on her time with Allen. In the latter, Engelhardt portrays a relationship of unequals. From their first rendezvous (quizzing her on the meaning of life, challenging her to a chess match, inviting her to watch a basketball game in his TV room, making out with her), terms were decreed by Allen. She considered him then, and still considers him now, a Great Man. She pushed back little if at all. \n \n ""I was a pleaser, agreeable,"" says Engelhardt, a fan of Allen long before they met. ""Knowing he was a director, I didn\'t argue. I was coming from a place of devotion."" They operated under two key unspoken rules: There\'d be zero discussion about his work, and — owing to the celebrity\'s presumed necessity for privacy — they could only meet at his place. By her count, on more than 100 subsequent occasions, she\'d visit him at his apartment at 930 Fifth Ave., where she\'d invariably make her way to an upstairs bedroom facing Central Park. \n \n ""The curtains were always drawn,"" Engelhardt says. ""The view must have been spectacular."" She shrugs. ""I wasn\'t there for the view."" \n \n Another element that may have factored into her dynamic with Allen, Engelhardt muses, was her German background. ""I had been taunted, tormented as a \'Nazi child\' in the Jewish neighborhood I grew up in: Matawan, New Jersey. [The family moved to a rural area of the state when she was a teenager.] My father ran around in lederhosen. I had doors slammed in my face."" Her parents were both postwar emigres, her father — by his account — a 14-year-old ditch-digging conscript into Hitler\'s army serving near the French border before the end of the war. ""Woody\'s the uber-Jew, and I\'m the uber-German,"" she says. While the pair never discussed their difference, she contends it hovered, at least on her end: ""There was a chip on my shoulder about wanting to please those who cast me aside. I wasn\'t confrontational because I thought, \'Nobody likes Germans.\' "" \n \n By Engelhardt\'s recollection, about a year into the relationship, Allen occasionally began bringing in two other ""beautiful young ladies"" for threesomes. Engelhardt says she had experimented with bisexuality and at times found the experiences with Allen ""interesting — a \'70s exploration,"" she says. \n \n But she felt differently when, after they\'d been sleeping together for four years, Allen beamingly announced that he wanted to introduce her to his new ""girlfriend."" (Engelhardt had presumed she was the girlfriend.) It turned out to be Mia Farrow, who was 14 years older and already famous for Rosemary\'s Baby and The Great Gatsby. \n \n In her manuscript, Engelhardt writes, ""I felt sick. I didn\'t want to be there at all, and yet I couldn\'t find the courage to get up and leave. To leave would mean an end to all of this. Looking back now, that\'s exactly what I needed, but back then, the idea of not having Woody in my life at all terrified me. So I sat there, patiently, calmly trying to assess the situation, trying to understand why he wanted the two of us to meet."" \n \n Despite the initial shock of jealousy, Engelhardt says she grew to like Farrow over the course of the ""handful"" of three-way sex sessions that followed at Allen\'s penthouse as they smoked joints and bonded over a shared fondness for animals. (""When Mia was there, we\'d talk about astrology, and Woody was forced to listen,"" she laughs.) Engelhardt writes in her manuscript, ""There were times the three of us were together, and it was actually great fun. We enjoyed each other when we were in the moment. She was beautiful and sweet, he was charming and alluring, and I was sexy and becoming more and more sophisticated in this game. It wasn\'t until after it was done when I really had time to think of how twisted it was when we were together … and how I was little more than a plaything."" She continues, ""While we were together, the whole thing was a game that was being operated solely by Woody so we never quite knew where we stood."" \n \n ""I used to think this was a form of mother-father with the two of them,"" says Engelhardt. ""To me, that whole relationship was very Freudian: how I admired them, how he\'d already broken me in, how I let that be all right."" \n \n As for Farrow, she explains, ""I always had the impression that she was doing this because he wanted it."" Engelhardt recalls when the story broke about Allen\'s relationship with Farrow\'s adopted daughter, Soon-Yi Previn (now his wife of nearly 21 years). ""I felt sorry for Mia,"" she says. ""I thought, \'Didn\'t Woody have enough \'extra,\' with or without her, that the last thing he had to do was to go for something that was totally hers?\' \n \n ""He had groomed Mia, trained her, to put up with all of this. Now he had no barriers. It was total disrespect."" (Farrow declined to comment on this story.) \n \n Allen\'s prolific career had largely been unaffected by his personal-life controversies until the arrival of the #MeToo reckoning. In October 2017, the red carpet premiere for his Amazon Studios release Wonder Wheel was canceled, and in January 2018, two stars of his follow-up film for the streamer, A Rainy Day in New York — Timothee Chalamet and Rebecca Hall (who previously had appeared in Allen\'s Vicky Cristina Barcelona) — apologized for working on it and donated their salaries to anti-harassment organizations. A Rainy Day in New York, originally expected to debut this year, is still without a release date. \n \n Looking back on her relationship with Allen, Engelhardt believes the only time she ever witnessed him truly reveal his vulnerability was after he took an unexpected phone call from Diane Keaton. She remembers that his ex-girlfriend told him the cat they\'d shared together had died. ""It caught him off-guard,"" Engelhardt says. ""He just sat there next to me and looked at his hands. They were trembling. In that moment he wasn\'t even in the room."" \n \n Engelhardt, who had begun taking acting classes with Stella Adler and Lee Strasberg during her time with Allen, remains hurt that he refused to assist her in obtaining a SAG card. ""It was the only thing I\'d ever asked for of him, and he told me, \'No, that\'s something you\'ll need to get on your own,\' in a tone that said \'drop it,\' "" she recalls. In the fall of 1979, without telling Allen, Engelhardt secured work as an extra on Stardust Memories. ""I didn\'t even see him there; it may have been second-unit,"" she says. ""My dream was that he\'d have seen me and pulled me out from the crowd. But I showed up with the crowd and left with the crowd."" She never told him she\'d been there. \n \n She also hid something much more tragic from Allen. Engelhardt had repeatedly been raped in the years before meeting him, first by an older classmate, then on multiple occasions by a family friend. ""The unpleasant things that happened to me, I wanted to forget that they happened,"" she says. \n \n Over time, Engelhardt grew increasingly unfulfilled by her arrangement with the auteur, eventually leaving New York. ""I thought I was special, and then I realized he\'s a big person and he\'s got a big life — I\'m in his life,"" she says. ""It\'s a rainbow with many colors, and I\'m one of them."" By the late 1980s, she had ended up part of Fellini\'s creative circle in Rome, working in his office. One day, Allen, a noted fan, called him. ""I was the one to pick up,"" Engelhardt says. ""He said, \'You\'re with Fellini — you left me for Fellini?! That\'s so cool!\' He was shocked I was with, of all people, his hero."" She still marvels that, to her mind, Allen finally valued her only when he came to (mistakenly) believe that another man, one he idolized, had successfully wooed her. \n \n Engelhardt last heard from Allen in January 2001, when he sent her a letter thanking her for sending him a copy of a documentary she\'d appeared in about the making of The Voice of the Moon, Fellini\'s final film. ""I hope you\'re happy and well,"" Allen wrote. ""I recall our times together fondly. If you\'re ever in New York I would love you to meet my wife — she\'d like you. We get out to California every so often. If you\'d like I\'d call and perhaps we could all get together."" \n \n Engelhardt assumed, given their history, that a proposed meeting with Allen and Previn wasn\'t meant to be platonic. ""I already had children then,"" she notes. ""I was like — not that I\'ve gone square, but my priorities were different. I just wanted to stay away from that."" \n \n *** \n \n It\'s been more than a decade since Engelhardt last viewed Manhattan when she rewatches it in November. The TV set in her living room isn\'t working, so she uses the one in her daughters\' bedroom — ""how appropriate,"" she jokes. Settling in on a bed, amid a dangling dreamcatcher, Engelhardt pulls her legs in close as Gershwin\'s ""Rhapsody in Blue"" famously swells over the opening skyline interlude and the narrative unfolds. \n \n Engelhardt first saw the film at a matinee while the pair were still involved. ""I didn\'t know anything going in — that\'s how little I knew about what he was working on,"" she says. Based on the advertisements, she thought that any romance would hinge on the adult stars, Meryl Streep and Keaton, and was stunned as the story focused on Allen\'s stand-in as he alternates between bemusement and distress by his can\'t-quit-it relationship with a soul-baring teenager played by Hemingway. \n \n ""I cried through most of the movie, the dawning of realization slowly settling in as my greatest fears crept to the surface,"" she writes in her memoir manuscript. ""How could he have felt this way? How was our partnership not something more than just a fling? We had shared such a special bond right from the start, something magical, and now here was his interpretation of me and us on the big screen for all to see in black-and-white. How could he deconstruct my personality and our life together as if it were just some fictional creation for art house fatheads to pore over?"" \n \n When she next saw Allen, she told him she found an awful lot of similarities between her and Hemingway\'s Tracy. (Not just in their tender ages; they were both, among other salient details, gorgeous would-be actresses with an interest in photography who, perhaps to others\' surprise, exalted their clever beta male beaus as erotic alphas.) ""I thought you would,"" she recalls him responding. There was no further bite, and, as usual, she didn\'t push it. ""That was it,"" she reflects in the book. ""That was all I would ever get out of him about the film, and looking back now, I am so angry with myself for not being stronger."" \n \n Engelhardt doesn\'t suppose she\'s the sole inspiration for Tracy. She knows that actress Stacey Nelkin, who dated Allen while she was a 17-year-old student at Stuyvesant High School after meeting him during the making of Annie Hall, has stated she was his Manhattan muse. (Still: ""When I heard her say that, I was like, \'Whatever.\' "") For Engelhardt\'s part, she presumes Tracy is a composite and that any number of Allen\'s presumed other real-life young paramours, including the two she met during threesomes, may have collectively stirred the director\'s imagination. ""I was a fragment,"" she explains. ""Great artists cherry-pick."" \n \n Manhattan operates for Engelhardt as deja vu, looking-glass and trapdoor, from an early scene at Elaine\'s (""Hah!"") to Ike\'s postcoital insistence that Tracy can\'t be spending the night at his bachelor pad. ""He always did the same with me,"" she explains, ""although he had his driver sending me away in his white Rolls-Royce. I often ended up at the Port Authority, heading to New Jersey."" (""It\'s a brilliant film,"" she repeats, again and again.) Yet at the film\'s emotional climax, when Tracy tells Ike ""not everyone gets corrupted; you have to have a little faith,"" Engelhardt is wryly unillusioned: ""Of course, he didn\'t have faith in anybody."" \n \n When it\'s over, Engelhardt is struck by how, to her, Allen had conjured a make-believe world in which Ike could conduct his relationship with a teenage partner, able to parade her in public and among friends in a fantasyland devoid of any disapproval, noting how it contrasted with her own enforced seclusion. ""I was kept away,"" she observes. The ethical milieu Allen establishes among the rest of the adults in the film is striking. Without exception, they\'re either amusedly ambivalent or outright supportive of the pair\'s relationship. Indeed, Ike\'s own perpetual hand-wringing about its appropriateness — as though such hand-wringing were tantamount to absolution — is brought into even sharper relief by its absence elsewhere. \n \n In a draft for the shooting script for Manhattan (co-written by Marshall Brickman) and now a part of Woody Allen\'s archival papers at Princeton University, Tracy is described by various characters as being as young as 16. In the last scene of the film, she assures Ike, ""I turned 18 the other day. I\'m legal, but I\'m still a kid."" In the other copy of the script on file at Princeton, her age is typed as ""seventeen,"" then crossed out and corrected by hand to add another year. \n \n In January, The Washington Post published an article that catalogued the ""misogynist and lecherous musings"" in his Princeton papers. It zeroed in on a couple of short-story drafts in which he\'d portrayed middle-aged men romantically entangled with teen girls as well as an unmade television pitch featuring a 16-year-old girl described as ""a flashy sexy blonde in a flaming red low cut evening gown with a long slit up the side."" Engelhardt says of the piece: ""It put all of the dots together. It made me realize that I was part of a pattern. I\'d never been privy to his mind in that way."" \n \n After she unloads the Manhattan DVD, Engelhardt offers a final thought for the evening. What if it had been the teenage girl\'s story that had been the center rather than that of the middle-aged man? ""It\'s a remake I\'d like to see."" \n \n *** \n \n A week after the screening, Engelhardt confides that Allen has preoccupied her dreams. ""I used to dream of making love to Woody,"" she says. ""Now I\'m dreaming of him dying in my arms."" \n \n She\'d also been dreaming of her 19-year-old daughter. In Engelhardt\'s slumber, she\'d learned that a significantly older suitor, a major celebrity, was pursuing her child, that he was offering to show her the world, to take her to Paris. ""I was mirroring myself,"" she says. ""In the dream, I was OK with it."" Now that Engelhardt was awake, was she still on board? ""Um, no."" \n \n This story also appears in the Dec. 18 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.

Soon after their return, Keith tells ABC News, Jo didn't feel well and suspected the flu. But as Jo got sicker and so lethargic that Keith says ""she wasn't making any sense,"" he took her to the ER about a week after they came home—and things continued to worsen. ""She was shaking her hands because they hurt, her feet hurt,"" her cousin, Lisa Morgan, tells KOCO. Then her organs began shutting down, and ""by Saturday morning, her arms and feet were turning dark blue and black. It was crawling up her limbs,"" Morgan says. The diagnosis: a tick bite that infected Jo with Rocky Mountain spotted fever. The course of treatment: to amputate all four of her already-gangrenous limbs to give her a chance at life. ""They had to cut off her right leg just above the knee, her left leg just below the knee and both her arms about mid-forearm,"" her husband tells ABC, noting Jo has also been contending with other complications from the disease, including blood clots in her lungs that called for a tracheotomy. Up to 5% people who contract RMSF end up dying, the state Department of Health notes, but death isn't common in patients who receive rapid diagnosis and treatment. Keith Rogers doesn't know how long his wife will be in the hospital receiving treatment and rehab, he tells ABC. ""Every day is a new challenge. I go in there, sit and talk to her and show her pictures of how our two boys [ages 12 and 17, per a GoFundMe page for the family] are doing,"" he tells ABC. ""I show her videos of her two dogs back at home. I try to keep it normal, but it gets very hard because she'll want me not to leave, and it's so hard because I can't take her with me.""

160,"['House Republicans unveiled a $1 trillion spending bill setting budgets for hundreds of government programs in a bid to force U.S. lawmakers to wrap up their work for the year. \n \n Republicans aim to put the more than 1,200-page spending measure to a vote tomorrow, a move designed to give them an advantage in a separate battle with Democrats over extending an expiring payroll tax cut. \n \n Passing the spending bill would let Republicans leave for their Christmas holiday, increasing pressure on the Democratic-controlled Senate to accept it as well as Republicans’ version of the payroll tax cut. Democrats have been holding up the legislation on concerns that approval would ensure the House recess, forcing them to accept both measures. \n \n A short-term bill funding federal agencies expires tomorrow and without action by Congress, the government will partially shut down. House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers, a Kentucky Republican, said his colleagues want to break the payroll-tax stalemate. \n \n “Hopefully, the Senate will act,” he told reporters yesterday. “But you know how they are. We’re not going to sit around here and wait two weeks, twiddling our thumbs, waiting for the Senate.” \n \n Short-Term Measure \n \n President Barack Obama’s spokesman Dan Pfeiffer said last night in a statement that lawmakers instead ought to pass a short-term budget measure to allow more time for negotiations on the budget bill and the payroll-tax plan. \n \n “Given the magnitude of the legislation -- providing over $1 trillion dollars in funding -- coupled with the unresolved payroll-tax cut and unemployment insurance extension, Congress should pass a short-term continuing resolution,” Pfeiffer said. \n \n Some Republicans expressed qualms about their party’s strategy. Representative Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican, said lawmakers will be asked to vote on legislation they won’t have enough time to read. “It goes against a lot of what we’ve said we were going to do,” he said. \n \n The party’s campaign “Pledge to America” last year said “we will end the practice of packaging unpopular bills with ‘must-pass’ legislation” and “instead, we will advance major legislation one issue at a time.” \n \n Oil Pipeline \n \n Democrats are balking at some provisions in the House- passed payroll-tax plan, including plans to expedite construction of an oil pipeline from Canada to Texas, raising Medicare premiums for wealthier retirees and paring unemployment benefits. \n \n The spending measure wraps together nine overdue appropriations bills funding almost 40 percent of the government, including the Departments of Defense, Labor, Education, Homeland Security, Veterans Affairs and others. \n \n Some House Republicans said yesterday they are unsure how many of their colleagues will support the budget plan, which has been criticized for spending too much. More than 100 Republicans, 40 percent of the chamber’s caucus, opposed a spending bill last month, forcing party leaders to rely on Democratic votes for passage. \n \n Representative Tim Huelskamp, a Kansas Republican, said yesterday he was withholding judgment because he wasn’t sure what would be in the legislation, which was released early today. \n \n ‘See What’s In It’ \n \n “I’m not going to vote for something unless I have a pretty good idea of what’s in it and right now, we don’t,” Huelskamp said. “I’ve got to see what’s in it.” \n \n The budget bill, combined with a related bill passed last month, would cap non-emergency discretionary spending at $1.043 trillion, according to the Republicans’ summary. That would be $7 billion less than last year and the second consecutive year appropriations have declined. \n \n The cuts are larger when compared with inflation, currently 3.5 percent, and the increased demand for government services that comes with population growth. \n \n More than half of the bill is comprised of the Defense Department’s budget, which would increase by $5 billion or about 1 percent to $518 billion. That doesn’t include an additional $115 billion in emergency war funding. \n \n Foreign Aid \n \n Some of the biggest cuts would come in foreign aid and international programs, one of the politically easiest areas to cut. Funding for the State Department, global health programs, economic assistance and other initiatives would fall by 13 percent, according to Republicans. \n \n Pell grants, which help low-income families send children to college, would be cut by $11 billion over the next decade in part by tightening eligibility criteria. \n \n The Environmental Protection Agency would see a 3 percent cut, which, when combined with reductions approved earlier this year, would mean an 18 percent cut from 2010, according to Republicans. The Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, would receive a 6 percent cut. \n \n The bill also includes a number of policy “riders” including ones targeting the administration’s policies on travel and sending money to Cuba, energy-efficient light bulbs and public funding of abortions in Washington, D.C. \n \n To contact the reporter on this story: Brian Faler in Washington at bfaler@bloomberg.net \n \n To contact the editor responsible for this story: Mark Silva at msilva34@bloomberg.net', 'Mitch McConnell says Harry Reid should talk to John Boehner. Reid says he wants to talk to Boehner to hash out a compromise on extending the payroll tax holiday and jobless benefits. But Boehner first wants Reid to show his hand by actually passing something. \n \n The three top leaders in Congress met privately Wednesday evening, but they came away no closer to a deal. At the meeting, Boehner said he wouldn’t negotiate with Reid and that the Senate majority leader would have to work out a payroll tax plan with McConnell, according to two sources familiar with the meeting. \n \n Text Size - \n \n + \n \n reset \n \n Boehner’s position is “he can’t cut a deal with Reid. If he did, our guys would go nuts,” according to a Republican source. The source added that without a Senate product, House Republicans are negotiating among themselves, and rank-and-file Republican lawmakers are “keenly focused” on making sure that doesn’t happen. \n \n Whether Reid and McConnell can cut a bipartisan deal — that can also pass the Republican-led House within days — will be the key question facing the leaders Thursday as they struggle to pass a payroll tax holiday, extend jobless benefits and approve more than $1 trillion in federal spending before adjourning for the holidays. Rank-and-file lawmakers in both parties are getting agitated over the inability of Congress to complete its most basic tasks without lurching into another crisis. \n \n The latest effort to find a breakthrough came as Democrats were considering scrapping their millionaires’ surtax. But it was far from clear what else they’d give up and whether Republicans would return any concessions. \n \n For every step toward a possible deal, there seemed to be a step backward: The White House put out a strongly worded statement Wednesday night calling on Congress to put off a mammoth $1 trillion government funding bill that Republicans had demanded as a condition for passing the payroll tax cut. \n \n Instead, the White House wants a short-term spending bill, an idea many Republicans have scoffed at. \n \n With a Friday deadline rapidly approaching, the developments created yet another picture of a dysfunctional Washington and a Congress with rock-bottom approval ratings that’s been defined by 11th-hour brinkmanship. Congress has until Jan. 1 to extend the payroll tax holiday before taxes go up for millions of workers, but lawmakers are trying to finish the year’s work by Friday’s scheduled adjournment. \n \n There are still a host of contentious battles ahead that will need to be ironed out between the White House and congressional leaders — and blessed by the rank-and-file. At the forefront in the payroll tax fight are several controversial matters, including the construction of a new oil pipeline, cuts to health care programs, the scrapping of an environmental rule and shortening the duration of jobless benefits. \n \n “The two biggest things are frustration with Washington’s gridlock and grave anxiety about some of the really bad ideas that are being foisted in Washington right now,” said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.). “Those things really unnerve people at home.” \n \n By Wednesday afternoon, each side had retreated to its respective corner: Reid and Senate Democratic leaders were meeting at the White House with President Barack Obama and weighing what concessions to make, including ditching the millionaires’ surtax that Republicans strongly oppose.']",2,"– In an effort to reach a compromise in one of the two year-end battles facing Congress, Democrats have decided to drop their demand for a surtax on millionaires to finance payroll tax cuts. Without a deal, 160 million workers will face an automatic Social Security tax increase on Jan. 1, but a quick bipartisan agreement on the legislation may be out of reach despite the Democratic retreat, AP notes. ""I don't think it's much of a concession,"" a spokesman for John Boehner says. ""It never had any chance of passing the Senate, let alone the House."" Lawmakers are also battling over a separate spending bill, and the squabble threatens to force a federal government shutdown by this weekend. House Republicans have unveiled a $1 trillion spending bill providing budgets for hundreds of government programs. They aim to pass the bill tomorrow, allowing them to depart for their Christmas holidays, Bloomberg reports. Some Republican lawmakers, however, are wary of passing legislation that they haven't had time to read, and as leaders squabble, rank-and file lawmakers from both parties are complaining about Congress' inability to perform its most basic tasks, Politico notes."

News of the celestial upheaval came Tuesday morning via the ladies of The View, and Marvel now confirms that a woman will wield the hammer Mjölnir in a brand-new series starting in October. “This is not She-Thor,” says writer Jason Aaron in Marvel’s press release, published by the Mary Sue. “This is not Lady Thor. This is not Thorita. This is THOR. This is the THOR of the Marvel Universe. But it’s unlike any Thor we’ve ever seen before.” \n \n I’m not sure there is much thmor to be said here in the way of gender analysis, although perhaps the character’s makeover has something to do with sublimated love for superhero Ruth Bader Ginsburg? (Hammer equals gavel.) But it is fun to chant that evocatively solid syllable in the new Avenger’s honor. While a lot of superheroines—including Marvel’s own Storm, Black Widow, and Captain Marvel—rely on lithe acrobatics to fight evil, Thor favors the brute smashing of things. Thor is mighty and unsubtle and loud. She doesn’t shoot dinky little arrows, like Hawkeye, or bat-shaped boomerangs. As Walter White might say, she is the one who knocks. \n \n Advertisement \n \n \n \n Plus, we have delicious logistical questions to consider, now that Asgard has decided to lean in. For instance, Marvel Studios has committed to at least two more Avengers movies, one in 2018 and one (we think) in 2021. Will the comic book Thor diverge from the film Thor until the mainstream catches up with Aaron and his team? Or will Chris Hemsworth hand off the flowing blond locks to a female actor? (If so, we’ll miss your arms, Chris!) \n \n Either way, as Whoopi Goldberg said this morning, “It’s a huge day in the Marvel universe.” And on Twitter, Marvel executive editor had a thunderous response to skeptical fans:', ""Marvel is excited to announce an all-new era for the God of Thunder in brand new series, THOR, written by Jason Aaron complimented with art from Russell Dauterman. \n \n This October, Marvel Comics evolves once again in one of the most shocking and exciting changes ever to shake one of the “big three” of Captain America, Iron Man and Thor. No longer is the classic Thunder God able to hold the mighty hammer, Mjölnir, and a brand new female hero will emerge worthy of the name THOR. \n \n Who is she? Where did she come from and what is her connection to Asgard and the Marvel Universe? \n \n “The inscription on Thor's hammer reads ‘Whosoever holds this hammer, if HE be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor.’ Well it's time to update that inscription,” says Marvel editor Wil Moss. “The new Thor continues Marvel's proud tradition of strong female characters like Captain Marvel, Storm, Black Widow and more. And this new Thor isn't a temporary female substitute - she's now the one and only Thor, and she is worthy!” \n \n Series writer Jason Aaron emphasizes, “This is not She-Thor. This is not Lady Thor. This is not Thorita. This is THOR. This is the THOR of the Marvel Universe. But it’s unlike any Thor we’ve ever seen before.” \n \n THOR is the latest in the ever-growing and long list of female-centric titles that continues to invite new readers into the Marvel Universe.

But careful: ""This is not She-Thor,"" says writer Jason Aaron. ""This is not Lady Thor. This is not Thorita. This is THOR."" It's an interesting change, notes Katy Waldman at Slate, because ""while a lot of superheroines—including Marvel’s own Storm, Black Widow, and Captain Marvel—rely on lithe acrobatics to fight evil, Thor favors the brute smashing of things.

163,"['Microsoft co-founder says his exploration vessel M/Y Octopus found the battleship off the coast of the Philippines \n \n Sunk without trace in what some historians consider the greatest naval battle ever fought, the mightiest battleship ever built has been found off the Philippines by one of the world’s wealthiest men. \n \n Paul Allen, the multibillionaire Microsoft co-founder, on Tuesday posted photographs of the wreck of the Musashi, a second world war Japanese battleship that, with its sister-ship the Yamato, was the largest and most heavily-armed warship ever launched. \n \n “WW2 Battleship Musashi sank 1944 is FOUND,” Allen announced on Twitter, beneath a ghostly underwater photograph of the mammoth vessel’s rusting, coral-encrusted bow clearly bearing the chrysanthemum crest of the Japanese imperial family. \n \n Other pictures taken on the floor of the Sibuyan Sea by a team from the Octopus, Allen’s luxury yacht and undersea exploration vessel, showed one of the warship’s enormous anchors and a heavily encrusted valve captioned: “RIP crew of Musashi, approximately 1,023 lost.” \n \n Image taken by Paul Allen showing what Allen’s team believes is a valve wheel on the ship. Photograph: AP \n \n Allen, who has devoted a small part of his estimated $17.5bn fortune to deep-sea and space exploration, said on his website that the discovery of the wreck, at a depth of more than half a mile, marked “an important milestone in the annals of World War II naval history”. \n \n Designed to take on multiple enemy ships simultaneously, the Musashi was the second of the imperial Japanese navy’s colossal Yamato-class heavy battleships. Launched in November 1940, it measured 263m (863 feet) overall, weighed 73,000 tonnes fully laden, carried a crew of 2,500, and could travel at speeds of up to 27 knots (50 kph). \n \n But what most alarmed the Allies was the warship’s terrifying armament, which included the largest-calibre guns ever fitted to a warship: nine 46cm (18.1in) cannon mounted in three triple turrets, each capable of firing up to two 1,460kg (3,220lb) armour-piercing shells a minute over a maximum range of 26 miles. \n \n She was an awe-inpiring sight. “I had never,” the World War II Database records gunner Russ Dustan of the American aircraft carrier USS Franklin as saying, “seen anything as big in my entire life … It was huge.” \n \n But mighty as she was, the Musashi was not invulnerable – especially to aerial attack. On October 18 1944, Japanese vice admiral Takeo Kurita sailed with a 67-strong fleet, including both the Musashi and Yamato, into the Sibuyan Sea, west of the Philippine island of Leyte, aiming to throw back an American landing and attack vulnerable US transport ships on the other side of the island. \n \n At 8.10am on October 24 a spotter aircraft from the US carrier Intrepid spied the Japanese fleet, and by 10.27am, according to Japanese naval records, battle was formally engaged, with the Musashi’s massive guns in action for the first time. \n \n But with few Japanese aircraft to fend off the airborne attacks, the enormous vessel eventually became a sitting duck, reduced to firing its mammoth guns into the water to send up huge spouts of water aimed at knocking the attacking aircraft out of the air. \n \n “Running into one of these geysers was like running into a mountain,” one US pilot, Jack Lawton, was recorded as saying after the battle. “I felt the muzzle blast each time they fired. I could swear the wings were ready to fold every time these huge shockwaves hit us.” \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest The Japanese battleship Musashi in October 1944. Photograph: Jiji Press/AFP/Getty Images \n \n The last American attack was over by 3.30pm, according to the US Naval Historical Centre, leaving the Musashi listing heavily from some 37 direct torpedo and bomb hits (the figure is disputed). At 7.15pm, Captain Toshihira Inoguchi retired to his cabin, intending to go down with his ship. The order to abandon ship came 15 minutes later and at 7.36pm the Musashi capsized and sank. Of the crew of 2,399, only 1,376 survived. \n \n Pitting combined American and Australian forces against the Japanese navy, the Battle of Leyte Gulf is widely considered to be the largest naval battle of World War II and is thought by some naval historians to be the largest in history. \n \n Despite numerous witness accounts of the sinking, the exact location of the Musashi’s wreck was never clearly established. Allen, who co-founded Microsoft with Bill Gates in 1975 and is ranked by Forbes magazine as the 51st richest person in the world, said he began searching for the battleship more than eight years ago. \n \n In a statement, the billionaire said his team conducted a bathymetric survey of the ocean floor to eliminate large areas from the search, then conducted the final phase of the search using a autonomous underwater robot, or AUV, to detect the wreckage on Monday. An ROV, or remote operated vehicle, fitted with a high-definition camera and operated from the Octopus, later successfully filmed the battleship. \n \n Allen said he had long been fascinated by second world war history and was “honoured to play a part in finding this key vessel in naval history and honouring the memory of the incredible bravery of the men who served aboard her”. \n \n The entrepreneur is also working on a project to put “cost-effective” cargo and manned missions into space, and launched SpaceShipOne, the first privately built craft to enter suborbital space, in 2004.', '(CNN) Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen says he has found the wreck of a long-lost World War II Japanese battleship near the Philippines. \n \n The philanthropist posted images on Twitter that appeared to show the Musashi, once one of the two largest warships in the world. The discovery was made aboard his superyacht, the MY Octopus, as part of an expedition that Allen launched. \n \n The search has taken Allen and his team of researchers more than eight years. \n \n The images and video were taken by an unmanned submersible deployed from the vessel. \n \n ""Since my youth, I have been fascinated with World War II history, inspired by my father\'s service in the U.S. Army,"" Allen said in a statement. \n \n ""The Musashi is truly an engineering marvel and, as an engineer at heart, I have a deep appreciation for the technology and effort that went into its construction. I am honored to play a part in finding this key vessel in naval history and honoring the memory of the incredible bravery of the men who served aboard her."" \n \n He used his Twitter account to publicize the find. In one tweet, he said one image showed the bow of the ship, which features a distinctive chrysanthemum -- the flower is the emblem of Japan\'s royal family -- and a huge anchor. \n \n WW2 Battleship Musashi sank 1944 is FOUND > 1K M deep by MY Octopus Sibuyan sea, bow Chrysanthemum, huge anchor. pic.twitter.com/b9ZMA0icI8 — Paul Allen (@PaulGAllen) March 2, 2015 \n \n The other underwater photograph shows one of the Musashi\'s valves on which the Japanese characters for ""main valve handle"" and ""open"" are legible. \n \n He said the writing on the valve was proof that the ship was of Japanese origin. \n \n RIP crew of Musashi, appx 1023 lost.

According to U.S. Navy documents, torpedo planes from U.S. aircraft carriers scored at least 10 hits on the battleship over the course of four hours. Navy dive bombers also hit the ship 16 times, but it was the torpedo hits that doomed the Musashi. \n \n ""She went down by the bow, capsizing when the forward flying (U.S. forecastle) deck was submerged,"" said the Navy report, based on survivor accounts. \n \n Two of those survivors, the executive officer and the chief engineer, told how they escaped the sinking. \n \n ""The executive officer swam off from one of the upper levels in the tower. He saw the propellers as Musashi disappeared,"" the Navy report said. ""The chief engineer climbed over the side amidships as Musashi lurched to port. He walked and scrambled around the girth against the roll, climbing over the bilge keel. Finally, he was thrown off into the water and swam away to port. There were no explosions."" \n \n More than 1,000 of the Musashi\'s crew were killed during the battle and sinking. The 1,300-plus survivors were taken aboard by other Japanese warships, according to the U.S. Navy report. \n \n 1 kilometer deep \n \n This image, released by Paul Allen\'s company, Vulcan, appears to show the massive ship\'s starboard anchor. \n \n Allen said that his superyacht, the MY Octopus, had found the wreck at a depth of around 1 kilometer (3,281 feet). \n \n A statement released by Vulcan, Allen\'s company, said that the team combined historical data with advanced technology to narrow the search area, and that Allen had ""commissioned a hypsometric bathymetric survey of the ocean floor to determine the terrain"" before searching the area with a Bluefin autonomous underwater vehicle. \n \n Kazushige Todaka, the maritime museum director, said that, given the location and the depth at which the wreck was found, he was ""90% sure"" that the ship was the Musashi. \n \n ""I was really surprised because the location of the sunken ship has never been identified since it went down. I have heard countless stories in the past that the ship was discovered, but they all turned out not to be true."" \n \n Todaka said Allen\'s team had been in contact with the museum about the ship\'s potential location and its expedition. \n \n \'Wonderful discovery\' \n \n This shot, released by Allen\'s company, Vulcan, shows the Japanese royal family\'s chrysanthemum emblem on the bow. \n \n ""It\'s a wonderful discovery, if it\'s true, as we have long been looking for the battleship,"" he said. \n \n ""It\'s fateful that the discovery was made on the 70th anniversary of (the end of) World War II. The memory of the war has been fading away after 70 years, and the survivors of the war are disappearing. It is very meaningful discovery and a good chance for us to remind ourselves about the war and its tragedy."" \n \n He added that images of the entire body of the ship will be needed to be 100% sure that the discovery is indeed the Musashi. \n \n The Vulcan statement added that the team is ""mindful of the responsibility related to the wreckage of the Musashi as a war grave and intend to work with the Japanese government to ensure the site is treated respectfully and in accordance with Japanese traditions."" \n \n Diverse interests \n \n Since leaving Microsoft, the company he co-founded in 1975, billionaire Allen has immersed himself in a variety of commercial and charitable pursuits. \n \n He is the owner of several U.S. sports teams -- including the Seattle Seahawks -- and backed SpaceShipOne, the prototype commercial spaceplane that won the 2004 Ansari X Prize.', 'MILWAUKEE (AP) — A man was pronounced dead after collapsing at his Milwaukee apartment, but began to move his limbs as he was about to be taken to the morgue, authorities say. \n \n The girlfriend of the 46-year-old man had not been able to reach him for two days, and called police Tuesday asking for an officer to check on him. An officer went to the man\'s home and entered his apartment with the building manager.

Paul Allen tweeted photos on Monday of the Musashi, sunk by US warplanes in 1944. Allen says he found the remains in the Philippines while exploring on his yacht, the M/Y Octopus, and describes it as the culmination of an eight-year search that relied on historical documents from four countries, a ""hypsometric bathymetric survey"" of the ocean floor, and his yacht's robust technology. After surveying the area, Allen and his team of researchers deployed an autonomous underwater vehicle to pinpoint the ship's location, according to a press release via CNBC that calls the Musashi ""one of the two largest and most technologically advanced battleships in naval history.""

The men entered the water off Steep Hill Beach, a part of Crane Beach proper. Crane Beach stretches for 4 miles on the 2,100-acre reserve. \n \n The idea was for both Hackett and Auerbach to swim with the outgoing tide along the shore and get in a workout. \n \n Auerbach eventually swam ashore and walked to the rescue crews assembled at the Crane Beach parking lot. \n \n Hackett wasn\'t as fortunate. \n \n ""The beautiful thing was when the fog lifted -- I don\'t know how late it was, 8, 8:30, maybe even 9 -- I was able to get my bearings,"" said Hackett. ""I swam over the horizon and saw all the lights from the rescue vehicles. Without all those people and lights, it would have been hard for me to see.

Justin Daly and Fire Department Lt. Jeff French set up the unified command post in the parking lot and Police Department and Fire Department resources were called in, including off-road vehicles and rescue boats. \n \n ""This was a team effort,"" Oldham said. ""The police called us. Otherwise we wouldn\'t have known."" \n \n The Coast Guard dispatched the helicopter from Air Station Cape Cod and two 27-foot boats from the Gloucester station. \n \n The Massachusetts State Police sent a K-9 unit and Massachusetts Environmental Police also responded. \n \n ""This was a tremendous effort by municipal, state and federal agencies who came together to locate a swimmer in difficult conditions and rough waters,"" Acting Police Chief Lt.

Randall Hackett, 58, and his 28-year-old son-in-law, Alexander Auerbach, had decided to swim part of the 4-mile distance of Crane Beach in Ipswich around 5pm Tuesday, report the Salem News and WCVB. Both are strong swimmers, and they were clad in wetsuits, but family members were nonetheless concerned when neither had returned to shore after an hour and a half, per ABC News. Shortly after family members reported the pair missing, Auerbach was found on the beach around 7:30pm, about a mile south of the men's starting point, but he said he'd lost track of Hackett because of rip currents and heavy fog. For two hours, the Coast Guard, police, and fire department combed the water before rescuers using an infrared camera aboard a helicopter spotted Hackett treading water a quarter-mile offshore, per WCVB. Hackett was plucked from the water around 9:30pm and returned to the beach, where he walked into his wife's arms. ""The fog was so thick you couldn't even see your hand,"" says Hackett, who was taken to a hospital as a precaution. ""I made the decision to try and conserve energy,"" he adds, noting he clung to a buoy for a time. ""I thought I could survive until morning."" On Facebook, police called the rescue ""a tremendous effort … in difficult conditions and rough waters,"" while the Coast Guard warns water conditions are getting worse as temperatures drop. (This Coast Guard rescuer had to rely solely on his own muscles in another incident.)"

In addition, President Obama’s public statements contradict other witness statements, specifically those made by labor union official and Senate Candidate B,” the motion said. The motion is here. Several parts are redacted, but you can easily copy and paste the entire motion into a text file and view all the redacted material. Oops on somebody’s part. * All of the most explosive allegations in the motion were redacted. Blagojevich’s lawyers allege that Tony Rezko admitted to violating the law by personally contributing “a large sum of cash” to a public official’s campaign, which the Blagojevich people say is Obama. The lawyers claim that Obama may not have been telling the truth when he said Rezko never relayed a request from a lobbyist to hold a fundraiser for Obama in exchange for favorable legislative action (Obama, however, refused to agree to the offer, Rezko allegedly says). They also claim that Obama allegedly lied when he said he didn’t have any conversations with Rezko about a casino license… In a recent in camera proceeding, the government tendered a three paragraph letter indicating that Rezko “has stated in interviews with the government that he engaged in election law violations by personally contributing a large sum of cash to the campaign of a public official who is not Rod Blagojevich. … Further, the public official denies being aware of cash contributions to his campaign by Rezko or others and denies having conversations with Rezko related to cash contributions. Rezko has also stated in interviews with the government that he believed he transmitted a quid pro quo offer from a lobbyist to the public official, whereby the lobbyist would hold a fundraiser for the official in exchange for favorable official action, but that the public official rejected the offer. The public official denies any such conversation. In addition, Rezko has stated to the government that he and the public official had certain conversations about gaming legislation and administration, which the public official denies having had. President Obama is the only one who can testify as to the veracity of Mr. Rezko’s allegations above. A redacted footnote offers further explanation… The defense has a good faith belief that this public official is Barack Obama. As its proof, the Blagojevich people reference a 2006 Sun-Times story… Senator Barack Obama was asked: “Did Rezko or his companies ever solicit your support on any matter involving state or federal government? Did Al Johnson, who was trying to get a casino license along with Tony Rezko, or Rezko himself ever discuss casino matters with you?” Senator Obama answered: “No, I have never been asked to do anything to advance his business interest. In 1999, when I was a State Senator, I opposed legislation to bring a casino to Rosemont and allow casino gambling at docked riverboats which news reports said Al Johnson and Tony Rezko were interested in being part of. I never discussed a casino license with either of them. I was a vocal opponent of the legislation.” * The rest of the redacted stuff mostly involves claims by the Blagojevich team that Barack Obama was not totally truthful during FBI questioning. “Senate Candidate B” is Valerie Jarrett, who is now one of three senior advisers to the president… 9. Yet, despite President Obama stating that no representatives of his had any part of any deals, labor union president told the FBI and the United States Attorneys that he \n \n spoke to labor union official on November 3, 2008 who received a phone message from Obama that evening. After labor union official listened to the message labor union official told labor union president “I’m the one”. Labor union president took that to mean that labor union official was to be the one to deliver the message on behalf of Obama that Senate Candidate B was his pick. 10. Labor union official told the FBI and the United States Attorneys “Obama expressed his belief that [Senate Candidate B] would be a good Senator for the people of Illinois and would be a candidate who could win re-election. [Labor union official] advised Obama that [labor union official] would reach out to Governor Blagojevich and advocate for [Senate Candidate B].. . . [Labor union official] called [labor union president] and told [labor union president] that Obama was aware that [labor union official] would be reaching out to Blagojevich.” (Labor union official 302, February 3, 2009 p. 3). 11. According to Senate Candidate B, on November, 4 2008, Senate Candidate B spoke with labor union official about the Senate seat. Labor union official said he spoke to Obama. Labor union official said he was going to meet with Blagojevich and said “he was going to push Blagojevich hard on this. * There is also an allegation of an attempted quid pro quo on the Jarrett Senate appointment… Supporter of Presidential Candidate Obama is mentioned in a phone call on November 3, 2008, having offered “fundraising” in exchange for Senate Candidate B for senator (Blagojevich Home Phone Call # 149). …Adding… Obama allegedly shot down former Senate President Emil Jones’ name when it was floated by the Blagojevich team as a possible Senate appointment. And Rahm Emanuel floated Cheryle Jackson’s name… President’s Chief of Staff told the FBI that he had a conversation discussing the Senate seat with Obama on December 7, 2008 in Obama’s car. President’s Chief of Staff told the FBI “Obama expressed concern about Senate Candidate D being appointed as Senator. “[President’s Chief of Staff] suggested they might need an expanded list to possibly include names of African Americans that came out of the business world. [President’s Chief of Staff] thought he suggested Senate Candidate E who was the head of the Urban League and with President’s Chief of Staff’s suggestion.” *** UPDATE *** The New York Times hasn’t figured out that the redactions can be seen… Judging from what can be seen of the motion, which is full of blacked-out sentences and words (to comply with rules about sealed information), Mr. Blagojevich’s lawyers are hoping the president himself will point up contradictions in the prosecution case and testify about whether he had sent “emissaries” to Mr. Blagojevich with regard to who the White House would prefer fill the Senate seat. - posted by Rich Miller \n \n 89 Comments Sorry, comments for this post are now closed.', 'A human foot was found on a Jordan River beach Thursday morning, sparking an investigation by the B.C.

But whoever redacted it did a lousy job; the blacked out text could be easily read just by copying and pasting it, as Capital Fax revealed. Here's what Blago's lawyers allege in the redacted portions: Obama lied about his conversations with Tony Rezko. The lawyers say Obama turned down a fundraiser Rezko offered him in exchange for favorable legislative action. Obama has denied even having such a conversation. Obama directly recommended Valerie Jarrett for his old Senate seat, and gave Blagojevich a list of four candidates he considered acceptable. One of Obama's supporters offered to raise money for Blagojevich if he picked Jarrett. Obama had a secret phone call with Blagojevich in December—though the document doesn't say what was discussed.

(Associated Press) \n \n BEIRUT (AP) — Lebanon\'s president called on Saudi Arabia Saturday to clarify the reasons why the country\'s prime minister has not returned home since his resignation last week, announced from the kingdom, as the United States and France expressed their support for Lebanon\'s sovereignty and stability amid heightening tensions between Beirut and Saudi Arabia. \n \n A political crisis has gripped Lebanon and shattered the relative peace maintained by its coalition government since Prime Minister Saad Hariri\'s stunning announcement Nov. 4 from the Saudi capital that he was resigning. \n \n Lebanese officials have insisted on the return home of Hariri from Saudi Arabia amid rumors he is being held against his will. Saudi officials have said that their measures against Lebanon are in response to the militant Hezbollah\'s group support of anti-Saudi rebels in Yemen known as Houthis. \n \n Lebanese President Michel Aoun called on Saudi Arabia to clarify why Hariri hasn\'t returned home since announcing his resignation saying that ""the obscurity regarding Hariri\'s conditions makes anything that he says or does not reflect truth."" It was an indication that Aoun does not recognize Hariri\'s resignation. \n \n In statements released by his office, Aoun called on Saudi Arabia ""that is linked to us through deep brotherly and friendly relations to clarify the reasons that are preventing"" Hariri from returning to Lebanon. \n \n White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement that Washington calls upon ""all states and parties to respect Lebanon\'s sovereignty, independence, and constitutional processes."" \n \n Saudi Minister for Gulf Affairs Thamer al-Sabhan warned earlier this month that his government would deal with Lebanon as a hostile state as long as Hezbollah was in the Lebanese government. The Lebanese unity government that Hariri formed a year ago includes Hezbollah members — the result of a tacit Saudi-Iranian agreement to sideline Lebanon from the other proxy wars in the region. \n \n Al-Sabhan blasted in a tweet late Saturday as laughable those expressing support and ""love"" for Hariri despite their previous opposition to him. He added that those who ""sold out"" Lebanon would soon be exposed. \n \n ""In this sensitive time, the United States also rejects any efforts by militias within Lebanon or by any foreign forces to threaten Lebanon\'s stability, undermine Lebanese government institutions, or use Lebanon as a base from which to threaten others in the region,"" Sanders said. She was apparently referring to Hezbollah and Saudi Arabia. \n \n Sanders described Hariri as ""a trusted partner of the United States in strengthening Lebanese institutions, fighting terrorism, and protecting refugees."" Sanders said the Lebanese army and security forces are the only legitimate forces in Lebanon. \n \n Also Saturday, Lebanon\'s state-run National News Agency reported that French President Emmanuel Macron called Aoun expressing France\'s commitment to Lebanon\'s ""unity, sovereignty and independence and to help it in preserving political and security stability."" \n \n Iran\'s Foreign Ministry spokesman said Saudi Arabia is aiming to create unrest in Lebanon after doing so in the Gulf region and Yemen. Bahram Qasemi said in comments carried by state news agency IRNA that the kingdom is trying to destabilize the region. \n \n Aoun said that a Marathon planned in Beirut on Sunday in which tens of thousands will participate should be ""a national sports demonstration for solidarity with prime minister Hariri and his return to his country."" \n \n Last year Hariri took part in the marathon, wearing the number 3.']",3,"– Perhaps he found inspiration in Willow.

I\'ll be back this summer and will hopefully see all my Canadian fans!"" \n \n Brown was jailed for nearly three months last year for violating his probation by getting into an altercation outside a Washington hotel the previous year. He was on probation after he attacked pop singer Rihanna, his then-girlfriend, before the 2009 Grammy Awards. \n \n Nicole Perna, a spokeswoman for Brown, confirmed Canadian immigration officials denied him entry. Perna said Brown can apply to return at a later date and plans to do so. Live Nation, the promoter, said in a statement that ""due to immigration issues"" the shows have been canceled and refunds are available at the point of purchase. \n \n In 2010, the United Kingdom denied Brown entry into the country, forcing him to miss four shows. The British government\'s Home Office said then that Brown had been refused a visa because of his past criminal record. \n \n Stephane Malepart, a spokesman for Canada Border Services, said the country\'s privacy act prevents him from commenting on any individual case, but said several factors are used in determining admissibility, including involvement in criminal activity.', 'The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is strengthening an existing label warning that non-aspirin nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) increase the chance of a heart attack or stroke. Based on our comprehensive review of new safety information, we are requiring updates to the drug labels of all prescription NSAIDs. As is the case with current prescription NSAID labels, the Drug Facts labels of over-the-counter (OTC) non-aspirin NSAIDs already contain information on heart attack and stroke risk. We will also request updates to the OTC non-aspirin NSAID Drug Facts labels. \n \n Patients taking NSAIDs should seek medical attention immediately if they experience symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath or trouble breathing, weakness in one part or side of their body, or slurred speech. \n \n NSAIDs are widely used to treat pain and fever from many different long- and short-term medical conditions such as arthritis, menstrual cramps, headaches, colds, and the flu. NSAIDs are available by prescription and OTC. Examples of NSAIDs include ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac, and celecoxib (see Table 1 for a list of NSAIDs). \n \n The risk of heart attack and stroke with NSAIDs, either of which can lead to death, was first described in 2005 in the Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions sections of the prescription drug labels. Since then, we have reviewed a variety of new safety information on prescription and OTC NSAIDs, including observational studies,1 a large combined analysis of clinical trials,2 and other scientific publications.1 These studies were also discussed at a joint meeting of the Arthritis Advisory Committee and Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee held on February 10-11, 2014. \n \n Based on our review and the advisory committees’ recommendations, the prescription NSAID labels will be revised to reflect the following information: \n \n The risk of heart attack or stroke can occur as early as the first weeks of using an NSAID. The risk may increase with longer use of the NSAID. \n \n The risk appears greater at higher doses. \n \n It was previously thought that all NSAIDs may have a similar risk. Newer information makes it less clear that the risk for heart attack or stroke is similar for all NSAIDs; however, this newer information is not sufficient for us to determine that the risk of any particular NSAID is definitely higher or lower than that of any other particular NSAID. \n \n NSAIDs can increase the risk of heart attack or stroke in patients with or without heart disease or risk factors for heart disease. A large number of studies support this finding, with varying estimates of how much the risk is increased, depending on the drugs and the doses studied. \n \n In general, patients with heart disease or risk factors for it have a greater likelihood of heart attack or stroke following NSAID use than patients without these risk factors because they have a higher risk at baseline. \n \n Patients treated with NSAIDs following a first heart attack were more likely to die in the first year after the heart attack compared to patients who were not treated with NSAIDs after their first heart attack. \n \n There is an increased risk of heart failure with NSAID use. \n \n We will request similar updates to the existing heart attack and stroke risk information in the Drug Facts labels of OTC non-aspirin NSAIDs. \n \n In addition, the format and language contained throughout the labels of prescription NSAIDs will be updated to reflect the newest information available about the NSAID class. \n \n Patients and health care professionals should remain alert for heart-related side effects the entire time that NSAIDs are being taken. We urge you to report side effects involving NSAIDs to the FDA MedWatch program, using the information in the “Contact FDA” box at the bottom of the page.']",2,"– After a week of outrage over child separation at the southern border and a subsequent executive order that claims to stop it, President Trump is again using pointed rhetoric to describe the immigration crisis in America. In a Sunday string of tweets, Trump blasted Democrats, telling them to ""fix the laws"" while praising his own administration for being better than those of Bush or Obama at handing the complex issue. In that same tweet, Trump connected illegal immigration with crime on this side of the border. ""Cannot accept all of the people trying to break into our Country. Strong Borders, No Crime!"" he tweeted. As Politico notes, Trump and his supporters have frequently used controversial language when describing undocumented immigrants, specifically when invoking the MS-13 gang. The president did not mention the street gang in Sunday's tweets. However, Trump did say that ""We cannot allow all of these people to invade our Country ... we must immediately, with no Judges or Court Cases, bring them back from where they came."" As of May, federal immigration courts had a backlog of over 700,000 cases and some courts were scheduling hearings after 2021. Per AP, Republican apprehension over Trump's habit of sending off fiery and unpredictable tweets about the hot button issue and their fear of riling conservative voters are undermining GOP leaders' election-year struggle to shove an immigration bill through the House this week. Party leaders are trying to finally secure the votes they need for their wide-ranging bill with tweaks they hope will goose support from the GOP's dueling conservative and moderate wings."
168,"['SEOUL (Reuters) - The Seoul government has released rare video footage of Korean women forced to work in Japanese military brothels during World War Two, the first time moving images have been shown of the “comfort women”. \n \n A government-funded research team from Seoul National University found the footage, which was filmed in 1944 by an American soldier, in the United States National Archives after a two-year hunt. \n \n “South Korea has not had its own data on comfort women and (has) been relying on Japanese and American data,” said Kang Sung-hyun, an academic on the team. \n \n “It is crucial for South Korea to have our own data for the issue of comfort women,” he said. \n \n The 18-second black-and-white clip shows seven women lined up outside a brick house, being questioned by Chinese soldiers. The women were found by U.S.-China allied forces in China’s Yunnan province, the research team said in a statement. \n \n The women were registered by U.S. soldiers, the research team said. Two of the women in the video had already appeared in previously released photos of “comfort women”. \n \n The term is used to describe girls and women from South Korea, China, the Philippines and elsewhere, who were forced into prostitution in Japanese wartime military brothels. \n \n South Korean activists estimate that there may have been as many as 200,000 Korean victims. \n \n Japan and South Korea agreed to resolve the issue “finally and irreversibly” in 2015 if all conditions were met. Japan made an apology and promised one billion yen ($8.84 million) for a fund to help victims. \n \n However, the issue continues to strain relations between the two countries. \n \n Japan wants South Korea to remove a statue near the Japanese consulate in Busan city commemorating Korean comfort women, as well as another near the Japanese embassy in Seoul, saying that the presence of the statues violates the 2015 agreement. \n \n South Korean President Moon Jae-in suggested during his campaign for a May 9 election that most South Koreans did not accept the 2015 deal negotiated by his conservative predecessor Park Geun-hye and Japanese PM Shinzo Abe, and that he could try to renegotiate it. \n \n Since the election, he has not directly addressed whether he will seek to renegotiate the pact. The issue is likely to be discussed when he meets Abe on Friday on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in Hamburg, Germany.', 'Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption First known footage of \'comfort women\' \n \n South Korea has released what it says is the first known footage of ""comfort women"" forced to work as sex slaves for Japanese soldiers during World War Two. \n \n Filmed by US troops in China, the clip was found by government-funded researchers at Seoul National University in US archives. \n \n The 18-second clip shows several women lined up talking to a Chinese soldier. \n \n South Korean activists estimate 200,000 women were forced into brothels for Japan\'s military. \n \n They are believed to have been mainly from Korea, but also from China, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Taiwan. \n \n Some of the women were willing, others were lured with the offer of paid work as cooks or cleaners and many were forced, a UN report said. \n \n Until now, the only records of women forced into sexual slavery by the Japanese military during World War Two had been photographs and survivor testimonials. \n \n Image copyright US National Archives Image caption The issue has long been a strain on ties between South Korea and Japan \n \n The research team says the footage was filmed by joint US-Chinese troops in China\'s Yunnan province which was previously occupied by Japan. \n \n The seven Korean women were freed in 1944 and the officer speaking with them has been identified as a Chinese captain of the China-US Combined Force, the team said. \n \n The issue has long strained the relationship between South Korea and Japan over a perceived lack of adequate apology and compensation from Japan. \n \n In 2015, the two countries reached a settlement whereby Tokyo formally apologised and agreed to pay 1bn yen ($8.3m, £5.6m) to fund victims. \n \n Many Koreans though viewed the apology as insufficient and the issue continues to plague ties. \n \n In January, Japan temporarily withdrew its ambassador to South Korea over a ""comfort women"" statue placed outside the Japanese consulate in Busan. \n \n A similar statue has also been placed outside Japan\'s consulate in Seoul, and Tokyo wants both these statues to be removed. \n \n Correction 31 July 2017: This article has been amended to make it clear that not all the ""comfort women"" were coerced.', 'A far worse sight lay just ahead. Jirus went to an alley where he thought he would be safe, and talked briefly with a man there about what was going on. Jirus said he heard two gunshots, loudly echoing off the building. It caused him to spin around to look for the source of the noise. But when he turned back, he looked down and saw the man he had been conversing with lying on the ground, shot in the head. \n \n Uncertain where the shooter was, he ran. \n \n “I was just lucky,” he said. “The other person was shorter than me. There were two shots, he got that guy, he didn’t get me. . . . The randomness of it — standing right next to me, one person gets shot.” \n \n At least two police officers were among those shot. Lanier said the D.C. officer worked in the K-9 unit and has been on the force 23 years. She said she has known and worked closely with him for ""many, many years."" \n \n ""He\'s got a stellar record,"" she said. \n \n ""He\'s got a pretty serious injury, but right now his family is here with him and he\'s in good spirits,"" Lanier added. ""He\'s just very grateful for all the other responders who helped get him out of that building and get the medical attention he needed."" \n \n The other was said to be a base officer. Earlier in the say officials at MedStar Washington Hospital Center said his chances for survival were good. \n \n Janis Orlowski, the chief medical officer at Washington Hospital Center, said three victims in all were brought to the center, all in critical condition but alert, responsive and able to talk with doctors. The victims were also able to speak briefly to law enforcement officers before undergoing surgery or treatment, she said. \n \n The other two victims at the hospital were female civilians, Orlowski said at a news conference. All are likely to survive. \n \n The impact of the incident rippled across town, forces schools, offices and homes into an enforced lockdown. \n \n Senate buildings on Capitol Hill went on lockdown at about 3 p.m., with no one allowed to enter or leave the building, though it was partially lifted toward the end of the day to allow staffers to go home. \n \n The Nationals, whose ballpark is near the Navy Yard, postponed a Monday night game. Instead, they will play a double header Tuesday at 1 p.m. and 7 p.m. \n \n Ten public and charter schools and a public school administration building in the District went on lockdown, and flights out of Reagan National Airport were briefly halted, causing delays even after they began departing again. \n \n Adm. Jonathan W. Greenert, the chief of Naval Operations, was evacuated from his residence at the Navy Yard complex shortly after the first report of shots fired, Navy officials said. \n \n Greenert, a four-star admiral and member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was safely evacuated to the Pentagon along with his wife, Darleen, said Cmdr. Ryan Perry, a Navy spokesman.']",3,"– It's just 18 seconds long, but a new video released by South Korean researchers makes history for the worst of reasons. The clip shows Korean ""comfort women"" held as sex slaves by the Japanese military, reports the BBC. It's believed to be the first such film clip known to exist, though images of ""comfort women"" had previously surfaced in still photographs. The good news is that the video shows the women after US and Chinese troops arrived to free them in China's Yunnan province in 1944. A research team from Seoul National University found the footage in the US National Archives after a two-year search, reports Reuters. An American soldier is believed to have filmed the scene, in which a Chinese officer talks to the women lined up in front of a building used as a brothel. Japan forced an estimated 200,000 women to work as sex slaves for its soldiers during World War II. (Earlier this year, South Korea angered Japan with a statue honoring the women.)"
169,"['It’s amazing. You strap on some gear, and then you’re inside whatever world you want. It showed up in books, it showed up in movies, and everyone dreamed about it. Problem was, it kinda sucked. I tried Dactyl Nightmare at an amusement park, and it kinda sucked. Huge wires, unconvincing tracking, horrible visual fidelity. VR kept sucking for a long time, and people kinda gave up on it. \n \n But then something happened. Or, well, it had already happened, but nobody realized. The technology was finally here to do proper virtual reality. The team behind Oculus Rift realized this, and built the first prototype of VR that was finally just good enough to be usable, and it was only going to get better and better. They set up a kickstarter to fund their enthusiasm, and a lot of people got excited. They made about ten times the money they asked for, and I was one of the top-level backers. \n \n I got my oculus rift dev kit, and played around with it. It was convincing. It presented a lot of design problems. It made me nauseous. It was signed by the entire Oculus Rift team. I got super excited and worked on a couple of prototypes before moving on to other things. Perhaps I would pick it up again closer to the consumer version release. \n \n A couple of weeks ago, they reminded me that I still hadn’t visited their office, one of the rewards from the kickstarter. John Carmack would be there. The combined opportunity of seeing their latest tech and getting to talk about vr (and doom) with John was overwhelming, so I took the 12+ hour flight there. What I saw was every bit as impressive as you could imagine. They had fixed all the major issues, and all that remained was huge design and software implementation challenges. \n \n As someone who always felt like they were born five or ten years too late, I felt like we were on the cusp of a new paradigm that I might be able to play around with. I could be part of the early efforts to work out best practices, and while I have no doubt that in ten years we’ll look back at the problems with early VR applications in the same we look back at GUI problems with early PC games, it still felt exciting to me. My head started spinning with potential applications and how to deal with all the issues (how do you do gui? how do you deal with locomotion? what input do you use? what happens if the player leans far enough forward to clip into a wall? how do you prevent vr induced existential crisis?) \n \n Of course, they wanted Minecraft. I said that it doesn’t really fit the platform, since it’s very motion based, runs on java (that has a hard time delivering rock solid 90 fps, especially since the players build their own potentially hugely complex levels), and relies a lot on GUI. But perhaps it would be cool to do a slimmed down version of Minecraft for the Oculus. Something free, similar to the Minecraft PI Edition, perhaps? So I suggested that, and our people started talking to their people to see if something could be done. \n \n And then, not two weeks later, Facebook buys them. \n \n Facebook is not a company of grass-roots tech enthusiasts. Facebook is not a game tech company. Facebook has a history of caring about building user numbers, and nothing but building user numbers. People have made games for Facebook platforms before, and while it worked great for a while, they were stuck in a very unfortunate position when Facebook eventually changed the platform to better fit the social experience they were trying to build. \n \n Don’t get me wrong, VR is not bad for social. In fact, I think social could become one of the biggest applications of VR. Being able to sit in a virtual living room and see your friend’s avatar? Business meetings? Virtual cinemas where you feel like you’re actually watching the movie with your friend who is seven time zones away? \n \n But I don’t want to work with social, I want to work with games. \n \n Fortunately, the rise of Oculus coincided with competitors emerging. None of them are perfect, but competition is a very good thing. If this means there will be more competition, and VR keeps getting better, I am going to be a very happy boy. I definitely want to be a part of VR, but I will not work with Facebook. Their motives are too unclear and shifting, and they haven’t historically been a stable platform. There’s nothing about their history that makes me trust them, and that makes them seem creepy to me. \n \n And I did not chip in ten grand to seed a first investment round to build value for a Facebook acquisition. \n \n I have the greatest respect for the talented engineers and developers at Oculus. It’s been a long time since I met a more dedicated and talented group of people. I understand this is purely a business deal, and I’d like to congratulate both Facebook and the Oculus owners. But this is where we part ways. \n \n If you want to experience Minecraft in VR, there’s an excellent mod that does this. It’s called Minecrift, and you can find it here.', 'By now, we know that the reaction to a major Facebook acquisition among the chattering technorati follows a pretty simple script. It happened with Instagram in 2012, it happened again last month with WhatsApp, and it happened yet again Tuesday with the $2 billion deal for the virtual reality gurus at Oculus VR. \n \n First comes the stage where we all have a good laugh. Facebook bought what now? For how much? No. Seriously? What are they smoking in Menlo Park? The memes and jokes fly thick and fast. We comb our cultural history for anything that matches the pattern of an accurate prediction. The Oatmeal called it. The Simpsons called it. \n \n Then Zuckerberg will get on the phone with analysts and journalists, and explain very matter-of-factly why the purchase is worth whatever he paid for it — not now, but many years in Facebook\'s future. He makes an awful lot of sense: yes, virtual reality probably is the next big platform after mobile. There are murmurs of unease. Crap, Zuck was right about Instagram, he\'s probable right about this. \n \n See also: Mark Zuckerberg Casually Conquers the World \n \n A few hours later later, after the value of the technology or app in question has had time to sink in, comes the full-blown freakout. Zuckerberg is no longer a dolt; Zuckerberg must be stopped. Facebook is going to turn us into drooling zombies. You\'re going to be full-time immersed into a Matrix-style virtual-reality ""Planet Facebook"" filled with manipulative corporate sponsors while keeping your body alive by sucking on a ""QuenchTube"" through a ""small nipple in your mouth,"" suggested Verge editor Josh Topolsky. \n \n Hey, I\'m as much of a sucker for a good sci-fi scenario as the next futurist, but let\'s get real about this one. That\'s just not how the future happens. If you want to talk about technologies that were supposed to turn us into drooling idiots, try television. Try games consoles. If you look at them objectively, as numerous studies have done, it turns out those technologies are actually pretty good at informing us and improving our reactions. (See: Everything Bad is Good For You.) \n \n Yeah, but Facebook\'s going to ruin Oculus Rift, right? They\'re going to plaster it with ads and make it focus on gaudy, commercial apps that help its bottom line? Well, no. Facebook has a history of funding its big purchases well and letting them run themselves independently, like the world\'s luckiest startups. Look at Instagram: Kevin Systrom is firmly in charge, user numbers are skyrocketing, and the service has barely begun to introduce sponsored photos, which it may well have had to do by now anyway. (See: every app that wanted to make money ever.) \n \n Look at WhatsApp: founder Jan Koum staked his word on the fact that Facebook will not touch WhatsApp user data, ever. You know why that\'s guaranteed? Because if it doesn\'t happen, Zuckerberg won\'t be able to convince the next hot startup that he wants to buy that he isn\'t just blowing smoke when he says they\'ll be independent. \n \n Zuck is playing a wider game here, and the stakes are high. If Facebook ever got a reputation among the Silicon Valley community for being a rapacious corporate monster that goes back on its word and forces you to do so as well — well, there would be a few more giant companies around here that they\'d much rather sell to. \n \n Okay, you say, but surely there\'s some pressure that will be applied, pressure to put friend requests here, or targeted ads there — subtle backroom pressure that Oculus VR\'s leadership won\'t be able to withstand. To which I say: have you met John Carmack, Oculus\' CTO? I interviewed Carmack half a dozen times over the last decade and a half, back to when he was the mastermind behind Quake and Doom. The two words I invariably used to describe him are ""evil"" and ""genius."" \n \n Carmack never does anything by half-measures. He built his own space startup, for crying out loud. He\'s in the Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos realm of influence. If it ever came down to corporate politics, he\'d give that young whippersnapper Zuck a run for his money. Come to think of it, I\'d even put a small wager on Carmack taking over Facebook from within. \n \n Facebook could buy an awful lot of goodwill for the cost of 3 engineers by refunding the 9500 Oculus Kickstarter backers their $2.5 million. — Anil Dash (@anildash) March 26, 2014 \n \n I do agree with entrepreneur and blogger Anil Dash, above, that Facebook would do well to address the fact that Oculus VR began as a Kickstarter company. The payout would be an elegant solution, so long as it isn\'t seen as a crass bribe, and who knows — it may convince the creator of Minecraft to stop freaking out about Facebook. \n \n It would also encourage more Kickstarter campaigns, annointing the crowdfunding service as a legitimate form of venture capital, which would be a rising tide that lifts all Silicon Valleys boats (except for its established VCs, who may freak out themselves). \n \n But it\'s not something Facebook needs to do, legally or even ethically. Oculus fulfilled its obligations to its backers long ago. If its backers thought it would never do any of the things a for-profit company does, perhaps they missed the part where it became a for-profit company. Perhaps they missed the hiring, last year, of the evil genius. Besides, again, they\'re missing the point. \n \n Weep not, for the Oculus you know is not dead. Dry your eyes, because you ain\'t seen nothing yet through them. The number one reason why Oculus ""sold out"" to Facebook: because this way, it can remain independent and improve exponentially — first and foremost, in bringing down the cost and the size of those clunky headsets, and encouraging way more developers to join the platform. \n \n I\'ve tried Oculus a number of times, and really like the demo app where you zoom around the solar system. But even that felt a bit too low-res; all I could think was it\'ll be nice when it\'s finished. But Oculus was stuck paying way too much money for way too little gadgetry; now it has purchasing power, and how. What happened Tuesday was one giant leap into Oculus\' future. \n \n Not convinced? Read the Reddit threads where Oculus founder Palmer Luckey is taking on all-comers. ""I am not going to close off, I am 100% certain that most people will see why this is good in the long term,"" he writes. ""Any change at Oculus will be for the better."" He lists three short-term reasons why, in as much detail as he can: \n \n 1) We can make custom hardware, not rely on the scraps of the mobile phone industry. That is insanely expensive, think hundreds of millions of dollars. More news soon. \n \n 2) We can afford to hire everyone we need, the best people that fit into our culture of excellence in all aspects. \n \n 3) We can make huge investments in content. More news soon. \n \n Where will this end? Not in Topolsky\'s dystopian vision, but where all technology ends up — in the casual mundanity of everyday life as you pretty much know it, just one step removed. It ends with ""honey, have you seen my Oculus glasses?"" \n \n It ends with you using them the same way you\'d use Skype — zipping in and out of the virtual world for meetings, making it much easier to work from home or catch up with far-flung family. \n \n It ends with you donning your Oculus glasses about as frequently as you\'d use your Xbox or PlayStation. Games nerds will be addicted; the rest of us will use it every now and then, for fun. \n \n That\'s not a very sexy story to tell, granted; fearful future freakouts are so much wilder. If you simply don\'t trust Facebook because it\'s had a hard time communicating its privacy settings, if you don\'t trust Oculus to stand firm in the unlikely scenario that they\'re strong-armed, if you think the combination of the two is the beginnings of The Matrix, then knock yourself out. \n \n Just be aware that the sci-fi reality you\'re spinning with that story is as unreal and unlikely as anything you\'d see in VR.', 'William Wei, Business Insider Facebook is buying Oculus VR, a startup that makes virtual reality headsets, in a $2 billion deal. \n \n Oculus doesn\'t make a consumer product yet, but its headset called the Oculus Rift for video game developers has completely changed the way many feel about video games. \n \n The device is nearly impossible to describe. It makes you feel like you\'re truly immersed in a virtual environment. It\'s one of those things you have to try to fully understand. And we guarantee it\'ll blow your mind. \n \n Console gaming companies have sensed the threat of Oculus, which is why Sony announced a similar headset for its new PlayStation 4 gaming console. However, it\'s unclear when Sony\'s headset will launch. \n \n The question now is: why would Facebook buy a video game hardware company? \n \n According to a statement from CEO Mark Zuckerberg, the company plans to expand Oculus beyond gaming: \n \n After games, we\'re going to make Oculus a platform for many other experiences. Imagine enjoying a court side seat at a game, studying in a classroom of students and teachers all over the world or consulting with a doctor face-to-face -- just by putting on goggles in your home. \n \n Zuckerberg expanded on that in a conference call following the announcement, saying he believes virtual reality will be the next big computing platform after mobile devices like smartphones and tablets. \n \n ""History suggests that there will be more platforms to come,"" Zuckerberg said on the conference call, adding that the person who controls that major computing platform will be able to shape the entire tech industry. \n \n ""Today\'s acquisition is a long-term bet on the future of computing,"" Zuckerberg said. \n \n Oculus got its start on crowdfunding site Kickstarter, where it raised $2.4 million in 2012. Since then, other VCs have invested in the company. Most recently, Oculus raised $75 million in a round led by Andreessen Horowitz. Marc Andreessen, a partner at Andreessen Horowitz and a Facebook board member, tweeted today that he recused himself from acquisition talks between Facebook and Oculus VR. \n \n Last summer, Business Insider spoke with Oculus VR\'s 21-year-old founder Palmer Luckey about how he came up with the device. He got started at a young age, tinkering with all kinds of computerized headsets. You can read the full interview here. \n \n By the way, this isn\'t Facebook\'s only recent major acquisition. Just a few weeks ago, Facebook bought WhatsApp in a $19 billion deal. \n \n Here\'s Zuckerberg\'s full statement on the deal: \n \n I\'m excited to announce that we\'ve agreed to acquire Oculus VR, the leader in virtual reality technology. \n \n Our mission is to make the world more open and connected. For the past few years, this has mostly meant building mobile apps that help you share with the people you care about. We have a lot more to do on mobile, but at this point we feel we\'re in a position where we can start focusing on what platforms will come next to enable even more useful, entertaining and personal experiences. \n \n This is where Oculus comes in. They build virtual reality technology, like the Oculus Rift headset. When you put it on, you enter a completely immersive computer-generated environment, like a game or a movie scene or a place far away. The incredible thing about the technology is that you feel like you\'re actually present in another place with other people. People who try it say it\'s different from anything they\'ve ever experienced in their lives. \n \n Oculus\'s mission is to enable you to experience the impossible. Their technology opens up the possibility of completely new kinds of experiences. \n \n Immersive gaming will be the first, and Oculus already has big plans here that won\'t be changing and we hope to accelerate. The Rift is highly anticipated by the gaming community, and there\'s a lot of interest from developers in building for this platform. We\'re going to focus on helping Oculus build out their product and develop partnerships to support more games. Oculus will continue operating independently within Facebook to achieve this. \n \n But this is just the start. After games, we\'re going to make Oculus a platform for many other experiences. Imagine enjoying a courtside seat at a game, studying in a classroom of students and teachers all over the world or consulting with a doctor face-to-face -- just by putting on goggles in your home. \n \n This is really a new communication platform. By feeling truly present, you can share unbounded spaces and experiences with the people in your life. Imagine sharing not just moments with your friends online, but entire experiences and adventures. \n \n These are just some of the potential uses. By working with developers and partners across the industry, together we can build many more. One day, we believe this kind of immersive, augmented reality will become a part of daily life for billions of people. \n \n Virtual reality was once the dream of science fiction. But the internet was also once a dream, and so were computers and smartphones. The future is coming and we have a chance to build it together. I can\'t wait to start working with the whole team at Oculus to bring this future to the world, and to unlock new worlds for all of us. \n \n Here\'s the press release from Facebook: \n \n Facebook today announced that it has reached a definitive agreement to acquire Oculus VR, Inc., the leader in immersive virtual reality technology, for a total of approximately $2 billion. This includes$400 million in cash and 23.1 million shares of Facebook common stock (valued at $1.6 billion based on the average closing price of the 20 trading days preceding March 21, 2014 of $69.35 per share). The agreement also provides for an additional$300 million earn-out in cash and stock based on the achievement of certain milestones. \n \n Oculus is the leader in immersive virtual reality technology and has already built strong interest among developers, having received more than 75,000 orders for development kits for the company\'s virtual reality headset, the Oculus Rift. While the applications for virtual reality technology beyond gaming are in their nascent stages, several industries are already experimenting with the technology, and Facebook plans to extend Oculus\' existing advantage in gaming to new verticals, including communications, media and entertainment, education and other areas. Given these broad potential applications, virtual reality technology is a strong candidate to emerge as the next social and communications platform. \n \n ""Mobile is the platform of today, and now we\'re also getting ready for the platforms of tomorrow,"" said Facebook founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg. ""Oculus has the chance to create the most social platform ever, and change the way we work, play and communicate."" \n \n ""We are excited to work with Mark and the Facebook team to deliver the very best virtual reality platform in the world,"" said Brendan Iribe, co-founder and CEO of Oculus VR. ""We believe virtual reality will be heavily defined by social experiences that connect people in magical, new ways. It is a transformative and disruptive technology, that enables the world to experience the impossible, and it\'s only just the beginning."" \n \n Oculus will maintain its headquarters in Irvine, CA, and will continue development of the Oculus Rift, its ground-breaking virtual reality platform. \n \n The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2014. \n \n Want more?

Security Council members that would have required President Donald Trump to rescind his declaration of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, a vote that showed the depth of global opposition to the U.S. move. \n \n The United States was certain to veto the Egyptian-drafted resolution, but its Arab supporters wanted the vote to demonstrate that countries everywhere and even many U.S. allies such as Britain, France and Japan are against Trump\'s action. \n \n U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley called the resolution ""an insult"" that won\'t be forgotten, saying the United Nations forced the U.S. to cast a veto simply because of its right to decide where to put its embassy. \n \n The resolution that was vetoed would have called on ""all states to refrain from the establishment of diplomatic missions in the holy city of Jerusalem,"" citing a 1980 council resolution. \n \n Without naming any country, it would have expressed ""deep regret at recent decisions concerning the status of Jerusalem."" \n \n And it would have demanded that all countries comply with 10 resolutions on Jerusalem, dating back to 1967, including requirements that the city\'s final status be decided in direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. \n \n The vetoed resolution would also have affirmed that ""any decisions and actions which purport to have altered, the character, status or demographic composition of the holy city of Jerusalem have no legal effect, are null and void and must be rescinded."" \n \n Trump shattered decades of unwavering U.S. neutrality on Jerusalem on Dec. 6 when he declared that the United States recognizes the divided holy city as Israel\'s capital and will move its embassy there. Trump insisted that after repeated peace failures it was past time for a new approach, saying his decision was merely based on reality. \n \n The status of Jerusalem has been a central issue in the decades-long Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and Trump\'s announcement was widely perceived as taking the side of Israel. It countered an international consensus that Jerusalem\'s status should be decided in negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, who claim east Jerusalem as the capital of their future state. \n \n Trump\'s announcement triggered denunciations and demonstrations around the world. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas\' Fatah movement and other groups organized mass protests while its rival, the Gaza-based Islamic militant group Hamas, has called for a third violent uprising against Israel. \n \n Trump has been working on a new Mideast peace plan and says he remains committed to brokering a deal, despite the Jerusalem move. However, Abbas said after the announcement that the U.S. has effectively removed itself from any role as a Mideast broker, and those close to him say it\'s time to look for alternatives. \n \n Haley stressed that Trump ""took great care not to prejudge final status negotiations"" — and reiterated that the United States remains committed to Mideast peace. \n \n The vetoed resolution would also have reiterated a call to reverse ""the negative trends on the ground that are imperiling the two-state solution"" that would see the states of Israel and the Palestine living side-by-side in peace. And it would have called for intensified and accelerated international and regional efforts to achieve Middle East peace.']",4,"– Facebook has bought pioneering virtual-reality headset maker Oculus for $2 billion, and Mark Zuckerberg is pretty excited about it. The startup's immersive headset for video game developers has been a big hit, but Facebook appears ready to take virtual reality beyond gaming, Business Insider finds.

""Today's acquisition is a long-term bet on the future of computing."" But while Facebook is enthusiastic about the buy, game makers are less than thrilled about the company's move into virtual reality, Time and AdWeek report. Soon after the announcement, Minecraft creator Markus Persson said he had canceled plans for an Oculus version of the game because Facebook ""creeps him out."" Facebook is ""not a game tech company,"" he explained in a blog post. It cares ""about building user numbers, and nothing but building user numbers.""

It\'s meant to help you find search results faster. When you now search for a popular or well-known person, place or thing, you\'ll get a box to the right of the results explaining more about your search term. \n \n For instance, search for ""Frank Lloyd Wright"" today and the first link might be to Wikipedia. But now, to the right of that result you\'ll see some of that Wikipedia or other sourced information right on the search page, including a short summary of who Wright was, his birth date, etc. You\'ll also get related searches. If Wright were still living and a Google+ user, you\'d also get his Google+ profile link. \n \n ""The knowledge graph has been constructed using a lot of reliable sources of information, including the World CIA Fact Book, Wikipedia, etc. We also collect content of our own, like Google Books,"" Shashidhar Thakur, Google\'s Tech Lead in Search, told ABC News. \n \n Thakur said a team at Google has been working on the Knowledge Graph for two years. They have built a database with 500 million people, places and things, and there are 3.5 billion defining attributes and connections, which include those related searches and other information. \n \n Google says you\'ll start seeing the Knowledge Graph box as often as you see Google Maps, making it its largest search launch ever. It says it has surpassed the launch of Google Image and Google News in terms of the data available on its first day. Obviously, the database will continue to grow. \n \n One of the most interesting things about the Knowledge Graph is its understanding of search terms. Take the word ""Kings."" When you search ""Kings"" now it might think you\'re talking about the ice hockey team, the ""Kings"" TV show, or those medieval kings. Now the Knowledge Graph box, located to the right of the results, will give you those options. When you click one it will take to you the search results for that specific ""Kings"" search term, and you\'ll get another Knowledge Graph box -- this time with information about the specific ""Kings"" search. \n \n While Google\'s Knowledge Graph tries to focus on reliable sources of information, the company continues to make search more social. Google has recently tied Google +, its own social network, into search results. \n \n Google+ updates from friends now appear in search results, and Vic Gundotra, Google\'s senior VP of social business, has even said that Google+ is the future of Google. ""In the new Google, we know your name, we understand your circles, and we make every service better,"" Gundotra said at SXSW in March. The Knowledge Graph will include the Google+ profiles if you search for someone who happens to be in the Knowledge Graph database and has a Google+ profile. \n \n This week Microsoft began rolling out the newest version of its Bing search pages, which include social network information, including related Tweets and Facebook updates. \n \n Google\'s Knowledge Graph feature will begin to roll out in the next few days.

Another reason is more practical — Huntsman is wagering everything on New Hampshire, and leaving the state for even a day to debate in Iowa detracts from time he can spend wooing Granite State voters. \n \n His decision to withdraw from the CNN Nevada debate to protest the state\'s early primary was well-received in New Hampshire, where he is just beginning to show signs of life — breaking double-digits there for the first time in a poll released earlier this week.']",2,"– Google is rolling out a major new change to its search engine today—the Knowledge Graph.

172,"['Submitting to an examination slightly less intense than Rudy faced on the average episode of The Cosby Show, Bill Cosby appeared on today’s Good Morning America, where ABC bragged he would at last “break his silence” on the more than 40 allegations of sexual assault he has refused to dignify with an answer, or anything approaching dignity. This promise proved to be true in that noise is the opposite of silence, and Cosby did indeed make noises in the general vicinity of the accusations. But for anyone expecting a direct response—or even coherence—they left disappointed. \n \n The muddling began with ABC News’ Linsey Davis, who was formally there to talk to Cosby about his education reform campaign in Alabama. Likely wanting to avoid another NPR or Associated Press situation, Davis attempted to frame her question in the form of a hypothetical child who might want to know whether the accusations are true, because “my mom says you’ve done some bad things.” From the mouths of babes, and not ABC reporters, and so forth. \n \n Cosby’s reply was every bit as convoluted: \n \n \n \n I am prepared to tell this young person the truth about life. I’m not sure that they will come like that. I think that many of them say, “Well, you’re a hypocrite. You say one thing, you say the other.” My point is, okay, listen to me carefully. I’m telling you where the road is out. I’m telling you where, as you’re driving, you’re gonna go into water, and it looks like it might only be three inches deep, but you and your car are gonna go down. Now you wanna go here? Or you wanna be concerned about who’s giving you the message? \n \n Though this resembled some sort of Voight-Kampff test to determine whether you have a conscience, the message was (sort of) clear: You should ignore the many rape allegations against Cosby, if you care at all about your car. Also, that the message is more important than the messenger, even if that message is total gibberish. \n \n Pressed as to whether being accused by more than 40 women of drugging and raping them—in accounts whose graphic details are now permanently etched in the American psyche—might “overshadow” his message about not driving in puddles or whatever, Cosby offered more Dadaist poetry in response. It was a bit like e.e. cummings, if e.e. cummings were accused of multiple counts of rape: \n \n i’ve been in this business (52) years i’ve never seen anything like this and reality is the situation and i i can’t speak \n \n Cosby was also asked, “What would you like your legacy to be?”—a simple question to which Cosby might have answered, “Well, not being an accused serial rapist,” and thereby justified ABC’s claims to have actually gotten somewhere. Instead, he rambled some more about TV shows he wants to make: \n \n I really know about what I want to do tomorrow, in the tomorrows that follow. I have a ton of ideas to put on television for a series about people and their behavior and their love for each other. \n \n No one wants any of Bill Cosby’s ideas. \n \n Send your Newswire tips to tips@avclub.com', 'Bill Cosby is responding to questions about allegations of sexual assault for the first time in an exclusive interview with ABC News’ Linsey Davis. \n \n Interested in ?

You say one thing, you say another,’” he told Davis. “My point is, \'OK, listen to me carefully. I’m telling you where the road is out.

Now, you want to go here or you want to be concerned about who is giving you the message?\'” \n \n More than 30 women have come forward in the past six months, some accusing Cosby of drugging or sexually assaulting them. His legal team has issued a number of denials. Cosby has never been criminally charged. Three of his accusers have filed a defamation lawsuit against him, which Cosby is trying to get dismissed. \n \n In an effort to turn the page, Cosby is now part of an initiative to bring awareness about the state of underfunded schools near Selma, Alabama. But will the allegations overshadow his message? \n \n “It’s interesting. When I talk to people they will say, ‘This is a situation that’s unprecedented.’ I, my family, my friends, I have been in this business 52 years,"" he said. ""I’ve never seen anything like this. And reality is the situation. And I can’t speak.” \n \n Cosby has been invited to walk across the historic Edmund Pettus Bridge with students as part of a “March for Education.” The program is hosted by the Black Belt Community Foundation, a nonprofit group dedicated to improving the lives of citizens in a 12-county section of Alabama known as the “Black Belt” area. \n \n Cosby’s participation sparked an online firestorm, something that organizers admit made them think twice about his involvement. \n \n “We had some very rich discussions about it, but at the end of the day what was most important was: How do we make sure the world knows that Black Belt children matter?” said Felecia Lucky, the organization’s president. \n \n Cosby, whose long career has included his portrayal of Cliff Huxtable on “The Cosby Show,” still talks about the possibility of a return to TV. \n \n “I really know about what I want to do tomorrow -- in the tomorrows that follow,” he told Davis. “I have a ton of ideas to put on television for a series about people and their behavior and their love for each other.”', 'Bill Cosby says that in all of his years in show business, he\'s ""never seen anything like"" his situation after being accused by multiple women of sexual assault. \n \n The comedian appeared on Good Morning America on Friday to promote a non-profit organization, the Black Belt Community Foundation, which aims to improve education for children in high-poverty counties near Selma, Ala. Yet when the subject turned to the many allegations against him, he seemed to be at a loss for sensible words. \n \n Asked how he would react if the children he\'s there to help were to confront him about his sexual assault allegations, he said, ""I’m not sure that they will come like that.

By the dozens, women have come forward to allege that Cosby sexually assaulted them. But while their words have filled op-eds and interviews and press conferences, Cosby, for the most part, has refused to comment. \n \n Yet Cosby came face-to-face with the allegations again in a new interview with Good Morning America‘s Linsey Davis, a conversation which was ostensibly about Cosby’s work with the Black Belt Community Foundation but, in the clips released to the public thus far, focus almost entirely on Cosby’s reputation as a serial rapist. \n \n During the interview, Davis asked Cosby, “Are you prepared for backlash? If a young person comes up to you and says, ‘My mom says you’ve done some bad things,’ how will you answer them? If they are pressing you, ‘Are you guilty? Did you do it? Are the allegations true?'” \n \n Cosby’s reply: \n \n I am prepared to tell this young person the truth about life. I’m not sure that they will come like that. I think many of them say, well, you’re a hypocrite. You say one thing, you say the other. My point is, okay, listen to me carefully. I’m telling you where the road is out. I’m telling you where, as you’re driving, you’re going to go into water and it looks like it might only be three inches deep, but you and your car are going to go down. Now, you want to go here, or you want to be concerned about who is giving you the message? \n \n There was this pause after the word “truth.” You could be forgiven for getting hopeful in that moment: “I am prepared to tell this young person the truth.” But, no. And it seems rather optimistic of Cosby to assume that this hypothetical young person would say “You’re a hypocrite” and not “You’re a serial rapist.” \n \n Davis then asked, “Are you concerned at all that, given the allegations, that may overshadow your message?” \n \n “I’ve been in this business 52 years, and I’ve never seen anything like this,” Cosby said. “And reality is the situation. And I can’t speak.” \n \n Forty women have publicly condemned Cosby for sexually assaulting them. The accusations span decades. You’ve never seen anything like this, Cosby? What a coincidence, neither has anyone else. \n \n \n \n \n \n It is kind of amazing that, after all this time, Cosby still responds to questions about these allegations as if he is surprised and scandalized by their existence. Obviously, he knows this barrage of rape accusations is newsworthy and that any reasonable reporter will ask what, if anything, he wants to say in response. How does he not just have a boilerplate, go-to reply? He always appears to be scrambling for something vague and not-incriminating to say. His failure to have a clear dismissal-and-denial strategy calls to mind his sloppy written response to the revived allegations last fall: his ever-changing legal team, his contradictory statements. \n \n Davis asked Felecia Lucky, president of the Black Belt Community Foundation, if the rape allegations “were enough to make you think twice about inviting Mr. Cosby?” Cosby will speak to hundreds of high school students in Demopolis and Selma and participate in the “March for Education” across the historic Edmund Pettus Bridge. Lucky acknowledged that she had second thoughts but decided “at the end of the day, what is most important was, how do we make sure the world knows the Black Belt children matter.” \n \n Could Cosby’s participation, even on behalf of a good cause, shed a positive light on anything at the moment? In just six months, his reputation has fallen from mostly-beloved public figure to likely predator. His name, in association with the word “mentor,” scans as so absurd to a modern audience it is, literally, a joke. \n \n And there is something especially disconcerting about the notion of Cosby spending a lot of intimate time with young people, considering the fact that Judy Huth, one of Cosby’s alleged victims, was 15 years old at the time of her assault. (A representative from the Black Belt Foundation, reached this morning by phone, said no one would be available to comment on this story.) \n \n When Davis asked Cosby what he wants his legacy to be, Cosby shook his head and said, “I have a ton of ideas to put on television about people and their love for each other.” \n \n This, again, demonstrates a willful obliviousness to reality: Cosby might want to be on television, but television has made it quite clear that it wants nothing to do with Cosby. TV Land yanked all the Cosby Show reruns from the air last November; NBC killed a Cosby project that was still in its early stages; Netflix shelved comedy special Bill Cosby 77, which was slated to premiere on Nov. 27 of last year, indefinitely. Multiple theaters have canceled his scheduled appearances. \n \n Off-screen, Cosby resigned, presumably under pressure, from the Temple University Board of Trustees, and was stripped of his honorary chief petty officer designation by the Navy. \n \n But Cosby has made a point of continuing to perform wherever and whenever he is able to do so, keeping up his tour with the trolling title of “Far From Finished.” When over 14,000 people signed a petition protesting Cosby’s April 27 show at the Cobb Center in Atlanta, Cosby posted a 19-second video to assure fans that “I’m going to perform because I love it when you laugh.” \n \n His determination to stay on stage might not be enough to overcome the latest accusation, which could result in Cosby facing criminal charges. Actress Lili Bernard said that Cosby raped her in New Jersey, where there is no statute of limitations on sexual assault. Bernard came forward at a press conference hosted by Gloria Allred two weeks ago, the day after she reported her assault to the Atlantic City Police Department. \n \n GMA is hyping the interview by claiming Cosby is responding to allegations for “the very first time,” even though Cosby has actually addressed them before. Last December, he told a Page Six reporter that he “only expect[s] the black media to uphold the standards of excellence in journalism.” During an interview with the Associated Press on Nov. 6, Cosby issued a brief “no comment” to questions about his alleged assaults and then tried to bully the AP reporter into not showing the interview footage: “If you want to consider yourself to be serious, it will not appear anywhere.” \n \n This is about as close as Cosby gets to “responding” to the dozens of allegations against him: in this elliptical, I’m-the-real-victim-here sort of way. So his latest comments aren’t too surprising, even though they are disappointing and frustrating and, no matter how closely you read them, incomprehensible.""]",4,"– Bill Cosby has generally been avoiding saying anything at all about the rape allegations against him, but he went on ABC's Good Morning America today and agreed to talk at least a little about them: “It’s interesting.

The pilots will have oxygen masks and will be bundled up. The temperature inside their capsule will be about 50 degrees. \n \n The pilots have to be physically fit to endure several days inside the capsule, with little sleep and limited oxygen.

The control room will be staffed day and night until the balloon lands. \n \n The team, which includes balloonists, a meteorologist, a physician and a search-and-rescue expert, uses satellite phones to talk to the pilots, and there are also several different types of radios inside the aircraft. \n \n “On any flight of this nature,” Bradley said at a news conference in October, “there is always the possibility of things going wrong. We have to have a team tracking us.” \n \n Bradley and Tiukhtyaev’s balloon – dubbed Two Eagles – is outfitted with a high-tech navigation system, basic necessities such as a first-aid kit, and communications equipment. It is 140 tall, 90 feet wide and filled with 350,000 cubic feet of gas. \n \n It will fly at an altitude of at least 15,000 feet. The pilots will have oxygen masks and will be bundled up. The temperature inside their capsule will be about 50 degrees. \n \n The balloon was flying over Japan at 19,000 feet Saturday evening. In just under four hours, the balloon had traveled about 120 miles, according to the team’s website. \n \n The pilots have to be physically fit to endure several days inside the capsule, with little sleep and limited oxygen. In addition to the record attempts, the flight is being monitored by researchers at Arizona State University who are studying the effects of fatigue on cognitive ability. \n \n Track the balloon \n \n The Two Eagles website, The Two Eagles website, twoeaglesballoonteam.com , includes live tracking of the balloon’s position and regular updates from Mission Control. \n \n It’s possible the pilots could be aloft for 10 days, which is the outer limit of the balloon’s capabilities, the team said. \n \n Once the hatch is closed and the pilots are inside, it’s much like a video game, monitoring the GPS and other systems for updates on weather conditions, speed and altitude, Bradley told The Associated Press in October. \n \n Bradley and his wife, Tami, live in Albuquerque and have two children. Bradley regularly flies hot-air balloons in the Duke City and owns and operates a hot-air balloon company. He has set records before in gas, hot-air and gas and hot-air combination Roziére balloons.']",2,"– Riding in a 140-foot tall balloon filled with 350,000 cubic feet of gas, an American and a Russian have set off from Japan in the hopes of setting two balloon ride records at once. First, Troy Bradley, 50, and Leonid Tiukhtyaev, 58, hope to reach North America and break the current distance record of 5,208 miles, which was set between Japan and the US in 1981. And second, they hope to reach the West Coast in 5.5 days and then head inland another day or two, breaking the duration record of 137 hours (5.7 days) set in 1978, reports the AP. ""Everything went just like a textbook,"" said team social media director Letitia Hill just after takeoff early yesterday. (Bad weather delayed two previous attempts earlier this month.) Mission Control, situated in a small room at a balloon museum in Albuquerque, includes balloonists, a meteorologist, a physician, and a search-and-rescue expert, who are staying in touch with the pilots via satellite phones, reports the Albuquerque Journal. The balloon, called Two Eagles, is equipped with several types of radios, a high-tech navigation system, and basics like food and a first-aid kit. The men will wear oxygen masks and stay bundled up in the 50-degree cabin as they fly at an expected altitude of at least 15,000 feet. It's possible the pilots could be in flight for as many as 10 days, the balloon's apparent outer limits, and it's not clear where they'll come down. ""That’s going to keep us on the edge of our seats for this mission,"" says Hill. Bradley and Tiukhtyaev are also being monitored by Arizona State University researchers studying fatigue's effects on cognition. (Check out this recent balloon ride that didn't go as planned.)"

176,"['Leader appears on state TV briefly to signal defiance in the face of mounting revolt against his 41-year rule. \n \n There have been widespread reports that Libyan soldiers have used live ammunition on protesters [Reuters] Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi has appeared on state television to signal his defiance in the face of a mounting revolt against his 41-year rule. \n \n \n \n ""I am in Tripoli and not in Venezuela. Do not believe the channels belonging to stray dogs,"" Gaddafi told Libyan state TV, which said he was speaking outside his house on Tuesday. LIVE BLOG On Monday, William Hague, the British foreign minister, had suggested that Gaddafi had fled to Venezuela, a report that the government of that country denied. Gaddafi, in his first televised appearance since protests to topple him began last week, was holding an umbrella in the rain and leaning out of a van. \n \n \n \n ""I wanted to say something to the youths at the Green Square (in Tripoli) and stay up late with them but it started raining. Thank God, it\'s a good thing,"" Gaddafi said in a 22-second appearance. \n \n \n \n State TV reported earlier that pro-government demonstrations were taking place in Green Square in the capital. \n \n \n \n Libyan forces loyal to Gaddafi have fought an increasingly bloody battle to keep the veteran leader in power with residents reporting gunfire in parts of the capital Tripoli and warplanes reportedly bombing protesters. Scores of people have been reported killed in continuing violence in Tripoli amid escalating protests across the north African nation. ""In a sense this is a pariah regime that will not have any chance of governing anymore and the international community could come to terms on whether this is a genocide and whether there should be international intervention to protect the Libyan people from the militias of the regime,"" said Marwan Bishara, Al Jazeera\'s senior political analyst. \n \n \n \n ""We\'ve heard even a NATO spokesman saying that the Libyan regime should stop committing war crimes against its people so I think there is momentum out there but certainly it\'s not quick enough."" Deep cracks were showing and Gaddafi seemed to be losing vital support, as Libyan government officials at home and abroad resigned, air force pilots defected and major government buildings were targeted during clashes in the capital. At least 61 people were killed in the capital city on Monday, witnesses told Al Jazeera. Protesters called for another night of defiance against the Arab world\'s longest-serving leader, despite a crackdown by authorities \'Unacceptable bloodshed\' Libya\'s deputy ambassador to the United Nations, Ibrahim Dabbashi, spoke to Al Jazeera Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, has said it is ""time to stop this unnacceptable bloodshed"" in Libya. \n \n \n \n A group of army officers issued a statement urging fellow soldiers to ""join the people"" and help remove Gaddafi. \n \n \n \n The justice minister resigned in protest at the ""excessive use of violence"" against protesters and diplomats at Libya\'s mission to the United Nations called on the Libyan army to help overthrow ""the tyrant Muammar Gaddafi"". \n \n \n \n Both Libya and Venezuela denied reports that Gaddafi had fled to the South American country. Two Libyan fighter jets landed in Malta, their pilots defecting after they said they had been ordered to bomb protesters, Maltese government officials said. Libyan authorities have cut all landline and wireless communication in the country, making it impossible to verify many reports. With reports of large-scale military operations under way in Tripoli, a spokesperson for Ban Ki-moon said the UN chief held extensive discussions with Gaddafi on Monday, condemned the escalating violence in Libya and told him that it ""must stop immediately”. UN, Arab League meetings The UN Security Council will hold a closed-door meeting on Tuesday to discuss the crisis in Libya, diplomats said. \n \n \n \n They said the meeting, referred to as ""consultations"", had been requested by Ibrahim Dabbashi, the Libyan deputy ambassador, and would start at 1400 GMT. \n \n \n \n Dabbashi and other diplomats at Libya\'s mission to the UN on Monday said they sided with protesters in Libya. \n \n \n \n Earlier, Hamad Bin Jassim Bin Jabr Al-Thani, Qatar\'s prime minister and foreign minister, called for an extraordinary meeting of the Arab League to take place on Tuesday. \n \n \n \n The aim is to discuss the current crisis in Libya and to put additional ""pressure"" on the government, Al-Thani told Al Jazeera. He said the international community must act now. ""I feel a big sympathy for the Libyan people. We don\'t accept using force in this way or any way against the people or against any nation from their governments,"" he said. The comments came just hours after Ahmed Elgazir, a human-rights researcher at the Libyan News Centre (LNC) in Geneva, Switzerland, told Al Jazeera that security forces were ""massacring"" protesters in Tripoli. Speaking to Al Jazeera, Ahmad Jibreel, a Libyan diplomat, confirmed that the justice minister, Mustapha Abdul Jalil, had sided with the protesters. Jibreel further said that key cities near Libya\'s border with Egypt were now in the hands of protesters, which he said would enable the foreign media to enter the country. Meanwhile, the Egyptian military on Tuesday said it was reinforcing the border with Libya, but that it would leave it open throughout the day for those who require medical or other assistance. The army says it has set up two field hospitals and camps to receive Egyptians and Libyans who cross the border into Egypt.', 'A suggestion that Gadhafi may have fled was fueled when British Foreign Secretary William Hague said he had ""some information"" the dictator was heading for Venezuela. \n \n U.K.-based opposition activist Ahmed Sawalem, who is keeping in touch with protesters in Libya, told msnbc.com that there were reports of planes bombing a weapons store south of Benghazi in Ajdabiya ""so the protesters cannot get hold of them, to use them to fight."" He said a number of people in the area were thought to have been killed in the attack. \n \n Sources said the fighter pilots defected because they would not fire on the Tripoli protesters. \n \n They had left from a base near Tripoli and had flown low over Libyan airspace to avoid detection. They arrived shortly after two civilian helicopters carrying seven people claiming to be French landed after a flight from Libya. \n \n Fighter pilots claim asylum Reuters reported that two Libyan fighter jets flown by Libyan air force colonels were granted permission to land in Malta after asking for political asylum. \n \n A group of Libyan army officers issued a statement urging fellow soldiers to ""join the people"" and help remove Gadhafi, Al Jazeera reported on Monday. \n \n Communications into the capital appeared to have been cut, and mobile phones of residents could not be reached from outside the country. State TV showed images of hundreds of Gadhafi supporters rallying in central Green Square Monday evening, waving pictures of the Libyan leader and palm fronds. \n \n Snipers had taken position on the roofs of buildings around Tripoli, apparently to stop people from outside the capital from joining the march, according to Mohammed Abdul-Malek, a London-based opposition activist in touch with residents. \n \n Gadhafi\'s regime appeared to be preparing a new major assault in the capital Monday night. State TV at nightfall announced that the military had ""stormed the hideouts of saboteurs"" and called on the public to back the security forces as protesters called for a new demonstration in central Green Square and in front of Gadhafi\'s Tripoli residence. \n \n ""But I think Gadhafi is going to put up a fight ... in Libya more than any other country in the region, there is the prospect of serious violence and outright conflict,"" he said. \n \n ""These really seem to be last, desperate acts. If you\'re bombing your own capital, it\'s really hard to see how you can survive, "" said Julien Barnes-Dacey, Control Risks\' Middle East analyst. \n \n An analyst for London-based consultancy Control Risks said the use of military aircraft on his own people indicated the end was approaching for Gadhafi. \n \n One of Gadhafi\'s sons, Seif al-Islam, has vowed that his father and security forces would fight ""until the last bullet."" \n \n ""The toll is also likely to rise because of the shortage of medicine which the country is facing,"" the statement said. \n \n The International Federation for Human Rights said in a statement Monday that at least 300 to 400 people had been killed since Feb. 15, citing the Libyan League for Human Rights, which is a member of the federation. \n \n The accounts came as deep cracks opened in Gadhafi\'s regime, with diplomats abroad and the justice minister at home resigning, air force pilots defecting and a fire raging at the main government hall after the clashes in the capital Tripoli. Protesters called for another night of defiance in Tripoli\'s main square despite the government\'s heavy crackdown. \n \n Another man, identified only as “Victory,” told msnbc.com after touring Tripoli, “We could hear firing every 15 minutes, I don’t know from where really.” \n \n ""Our people are dying. It is the policy of scorched earth,"" he said. \n \n ""What we are witnessing today is unimaginable,"" Adel Mohamed Saleh, an activist in the capital, told Al Jazeera television. His accounts could not be independently confirmed. ""Warplanes and helicopters are indiscriminately bombing one area after another. There are many, many dead. \n \n Gadhafi spoke hours after reports that Libyan military aircraft fired live ammunition at crowds of anti-government protesters in Tripoli on Monday. \n \n ""I am in Tripoli and not in Venezuela. Don\'t believe those misleading dog stations,"" he said, referring to media reports that he had left the country. \n \n Gadhafi was seated in the passenger seat of a small vehicle holding an umbrella up through the open door. It had been raining in the capital for two days. His remarks were aired about 2 a.m. local time (7 p.m. Monday ET). \n \n Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi appeared for less than a minute Tuesday morning on state television and made brief remarks to say he was in the capital Tripoli and to deny rumors he had fled to Venezuela amid the violent revolt against his 41-year rule. \n \n However, a senior government source in Caracas denied that and a U.K. official said Hague had been referring only to unconfirmed media reports. \n \n Leaders break with Gadhafi \n \n Libya\'s ambassadors at the United Nations called for Gadhafi to step down as the country\'s ruler. Deputy Ambassador Ibrahim Dabbashi said Monday that if Gadhafi does not relinquish power, ""the Libyan people will get rid of him."" \n \n The staff of Libya\'s mission to the United Nations declared allegiance to the people of Libya, instead of to Gadhafi, a spokesman said Monday. \n \n ""The members of the Libyan mission are representing only the Libyan people and not anyone else,"" the spokesman, Dia al-Hotmani, said by telephone. \n \n Justice minister Mustafa Abdel-Jalil reportedly resigned from his post to protest the ""excessive use of force against unarmed protesters."" \n \n The Libyan ambassador to the United States also said he could no longer support Gadhafi, and the ambassador to India resigned. Almost all Libyan diplomats at the United Nations backed deputy ambassador Ibrahim Dabbashi\'s pleas to Gadhafi to end his 40-year rule and to the international community to intervene. \n \n A Libyan diplomat in China, Hussein el-Sadek el-Mesrati, told Al-Jazeera, ""I resigned from representing the government of Mussolini and Hitler."" \n \n Libya\'s former ambassador to the Arab League in Cairo, Abdel-Moneim al-Houni, who a day earlier resigned from his post to side with protesters, issued a statement demanding Gadhafi ""be put on trial along with his aides, security and military commanders over the mass killings in Libya."" \n \n ""Gadhafi\'s regime is now in the trash of history because he betrayed his nation and his people,"" al-Houni said. \n \n The U.N. spokesperson\'s office said late Monday that the Security Council had scheduled consultations on the situation in Libya for Tuesday morning. \n \n Earlier, Dabbashi had said he was writing to the Security Council calling for action to stop the bloodshed. \n \n As diplomatic support for Gadhafi began to crumble, Dabbashi warned that if he doesn\'t leave, ""the Libyan people will get rid of him."" \n \n Celebration in Benghazi \n \n Protesters celebrated in the streets of the country\'s second largest city, Benghazi, claiming they were in control after days of bloody fighting and after anti-government unrest. Celebrating protesters raised the flag of the country\'s old monarchy, toppled in 1969 by a Gadhafi-led military coup, over Benghazi\'s main courthouse and on tanks around the city. \n \n ""Gadhafi needs one more push and he is gone,"" said Amal Roqaqie, a lawyer at the Benghazi court, saying protesters are ""imposing a new reality ... Tripoli will be our capital. We are imposing a new order and new state, a civil constitutional and with transitional government."" \n \n Cars honked their horns in celebration and protesters in the streets chanted ""Long live Libya."" \n \n There were fears of chaos as young men — including regime supporters — seized weapons from the Katiba and other captured security buildings. ""The youths now have arms and that\'s worrying,"" said Iman, a doctor at the main hospital. ""We are appealing to the wise men of every neighborhood to rein in the youths."" \n \n Youth volunteers were directing traffic and guarding homes and public facilities, said Najla, a lawyer and university lecturer in Benghazi. She and other residents said police had disappeared from the streets. \n \n After seizing the Katiba, protesters found the bodies of 13 uniformed security officers inside who had been handcuffed and shot in the head, then set on fire, said Hassan, also a doctor. He said protesters believed the 13 had been executed by fellow security forces for refusing to attack protesters. \n \n Rage in Tripoli \n \n The capital was largely shut down, with schools, government offices and most stores closed, as armed members of pro-government organizations called ""Revolutionary Committees"" circulated in the streets hunting for protesters in Tripoli\'s old city, said one protester, named Fathi. \n \n During the day Monday, a fire was raging at the People\'s Hall, the main hall for government gatherings where the country\'s equivalent of a parliament holds its sessions several times a year, the pro-government news web site Qureyna said. \n \n The man identified as ""Victory"" told msnbc.com that telephone service went down at around 3 p.m. local time. \n \n He said he saw helicopters overhead and a column of six tanks as he traveled through the city in the afternoon. He said for the most part the streets were empty of residents, but he came across security forces with machine guns. \n \n Among the buildings attacked by protesters was the Ministry of Defense headquarters on Omar El Mokhtar Street, which was on fire, he said. \n \n At 7:45 p.m. he said he saw military planes flying near the ground, close enough to see that they were full of passengers. \n \n The man, who spoke to msnbc.com from the home he shares with his parents and four sisters and brothers, denied that the country was in the midst of a civil war. \n \n “The situation on the streets is not a war,” he said. “The people don’t have anything, they use rocks, sometimes knives. We don’t have guns, we don’t have anything to fight them with.” \n \n He said the residents of Tripoli were especially angered and frightened by the presence of what he called African militias brought in to fight protesters. \n \n The last straw for many people was the speech Sunday night by Gadhafi ‘s son. \n \n “The people, they want freedom,” he said. “Maybe 10 years ago, 20 years ago they would have listened. But not now — I don’t think we can accept that anymore … his father is not welcome in Libya anymore.” \n \n The government “has fallen,” he said. “Gadhafi is not good for Libya.” Protesters planned new marches in the central Green Square and at the leader\'s residence for Monday evening. \n \n Sunday evening, protesters from various parts of the city streamed into Green Square, all but taking over the plaza and surrounding streets in the area between Tripoli\'s Ottoman-era old city and its Italian-style downtown. That was when the backlash began, with snipers firing down from rooftops and militiamen attacking the crowds, shooting and chasing people down side streets, according to several witnesses and protests. \n \n Gadhafi supporters in pickup trucks and cars raced through the square, shooting automatic weapons. ""They were driving like mad men searching for someone to kill. ... It was total chaos, shooting and shouting,"" said one 28-year-old protester. \n \n The witnesses reported seeing casualties, but the number could not be confirmed. One witness, named Fathi, said he saw at least two he believed were dead and many more wounded. After midnight, protesters took over the main Tripoli offices of two state-run satellite stations, Al-Jamahiriya-1 and Al-Shebabiya, one witness said. \n \n Fight \'to the end\' \n \n “The overwhelming sentiment among Libyans is, ‘prepare to see this fight for our freedom to the end,’” Tarik Yousef, dean of the Dubai School of Government and a Libyan-American, told msnbc.com. “This is a 42-year dictatorship of the worst possible kind.” \n \n “I think what happened in Libya is to some extent connected with what happened in Egypt and Tunisia,"" Yousef said. ""There has been a huge contagion effect running across the three countries. The demonstration of the capacity of the public to effect change is a huge factor in what has happened.” \n \n “I think this is an historic moment from the perspective of modern Arab history,"" Yousef said. ""I can’t go back to the modern period and find a moment that resembles this kind of widely expressed people’s power movement that we see at the moment.” \n \n Yousef has family in Benghazi and friends in Tripoli. \n \n “The conditions for disintegration of the regime base are there,” Yousef said, noting the resignations of diplomats, the Libyan mission to the United Nations staff distancing itself from Gadhafi, and even the flying of the Libyan flag of independence at the Libyan Embassy in London. \n \n “All of these are developments that suggest that a lot of the power base of the regime is slowly disintegrating and crumbling.” \n \n “When you have tribes that have access to oil installations within their vicinity and can in fact affect the supply of oil — threaten to use that — that’s another source of weakening of the regime.” \n \n \n \n International alarm \n \n Gadhafi\'s regime has unleashed the bloodiest crackdown of any Arab country against the wave of protests sweeping the region, which toppled the leaders of Egypt and Tunisia. \n \n U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon spoke to Gadhafi Monday by telephone, expressing deep concern over the escalating violence and saying it must stop immediately, a statement obtained by NBC News said. \n \n The U.S. State Department ordered all embassy family members and non-emergency personnel in Libya to leave the nation, NBC News reported. It also urged Americans to delay travel to Libya or if already there to use extreme caution. \n \n Violence and looting could continue for several days, it warned. \n \n The White House said on Monday that it was analyzing Seif\'s speech to see what offers of meaningful reform it contained, NBC News reported. \n \n Seif promised ""historic"" reforms in Libya if protests stop, and on Monday state TV said he had formed a commission to investigate deaths during the unrest. Protesters ignored the vague gestures. \n \n Officials would seek more information from Libyan officials and reiterate the White House\'s call for the Libyan government to avoid using violence against those protesting peacefully and respect their rights, NBC added. \n \n British Prime Minister David Cameron, visiting neighboring Egypt, called the Libyan government\'s crackdown ""appalling."" \n \n ""We can see what is happening in Libya which is completely appalling and unacceptable as the regime is using the most vicious forms of repression against people who want to see that country — which is one of the most closed and one of the most autocratic — make progress. The response they have shown has been quite appalling,"" he told reporters in Cairo. \n \n The European Union on Monday sharply criticized Libyan authorities. The EU foreign ministers condemned ""the ongoing repression against demonstrators in Libya and deplores the violence and death of civilians,"" said a statement released after the regular monthly meeting of the bloc\'s 27 foreign ministers. \n \n EU President Herman Van Rompuy said in a separate statement he was ""horrified by the growing number of human casualties among demonstrators."" \n \n Fragmentation is a real danger in Libya, a country of deep tribal divisions and a historic rivalry between Tripoli and Benghazi. The system of rule created by Gadhafi — the ""Jamahiriya,"" or ""rule by masses"" — is highly decentralized, run by ""popular committees"" in a complicated hierarchy that effectively means there is no real center of decision-making except Gadhafi, his sons and their top aides. \n \n Seif has often been put forward as the regime\'s face of reform and is often cited as a likely successor to his father.

(Associated Press) \n \n Employees wept and audience members grew silent Saturday at SeaWorld as the theme park\'s popular killer whale show resumed with a photo montage memorial for a trainer who was killed by one of the orcas in front of horrified spectators three days ago. \n \n The show had been shut down since veteran trainer Dawn Brancheau, 40, died Wednesday after rubbing a 22-foot, 12,000-pound orca named Tilikum. The animal grabbed her ponytail and pulled her into the water in front of about 20 spectators. The medical examiner says she likely died of traumatic injuries and drowning. \n \n More than 2,000 people packed the park\'s stadium Saturday for the first show since Brancheau\'s death. \n \n The audience seemed thrilled, applauding and cheering as the whales zipped around their tank and splashed spectators during the show _ with the theme of ""believe,"" about a young boy who sees an orca and dreams of one day becoming a whale trainer. It was a fitting tribute to Brancheau, whose family said she always wanted work with the giant whales. \n \n At one point during the show, a young girl was brought on stage and given a whale tail necklace. \n \n ""I just wanted to be here for this show. It\'s so special,"" said Russell Thomphsen, 65, who said he is a season-ticket holder for SeaWorld. ""This touches so many lives."" \n \n Spectators packed the enormous outdoor amphitheater despite chilly, rainy weather, with the orca pool registering at 52 degrees. The whale trainers received a standing ovation as they approached the platform before the show, part of the multimillion-dollar enterprise centered around ""Shamu"" _ the stage name given to all the performing orcas. \n \n Several SeaWorld employees wept as the photo montage set to music was shown. \n \n ""It was very moving,"" said Molly Geislinger, 33, who came from Minneapolis with her husband and 21-month-old child. \n \n However, she noticed a difference in how the trainers acted. \n \n ""They looked like they were being very careful,"" she said. ""They looked very cautious today."" \n \n Indeed, the trainers weren\'t allowed in the water, meaning the whales\' handlers did not surf on top of the marine mammals or fly into the air. Instead, the trainers _ wearing orca-like black-and-white wetsuits _ directed the whales from outside the huge tank\'s acrylic walls. They coached the creatures to splash the front-and-center rows a few times, much to the delight of onlookers. \n \n SeaWorld officials have said trainers won\'t swim with the orcas until they finish reviewing what happened to Brancheau. \n \n Jeff Steward, who came to the show with his wife, called the memorial ""a very emotional start."" \n \n He said they enjoyed the show, adding: ""It\'s a tragedy, but these things happen when you\'re dealing with wild animals."" \n \n SeaWorld Parks and Entertainment President Jim Atchison said Friday that Tilikum will remain an ""active, contributing member of the team,"" in part because the killer whale show is big business at SeaWorld. The company owns more killer whales than anyone else in the world and builds the orca image into its multimillion-dollar brand. Tilikum did not perform Saturday. \n \n The timing of the killer whales\' return to performances reflects just what the sleek black-and-white mammals mean to SeaWorld, which the private equity firm The Blackstone Group bought last fall for around $2.7 billion from Anheuser-Busch InBev in a deal that included two Busch Gardens theme parks and several other attractions. \n \n There are two other SeaWorld parks _ one in San Antonio, and one in San Diego. \n \n No animal is more valuable to that operation than Tilikum, the largest orca in captivity. Captured nearly 30 years ago off Iceland, Tilikum has grown into the alpha male of captive killer whales, his value as a stud impossible to pin down. He now has been involved in the deaths of two trainers and requires a special set of handling rules, which Atchison wouldn\'t specify. \n \n John Galloway, of Palm Coast, Fla., said he didn\'t want to see the killer whale shows end because of the tragedy. \n \n ""I think they know what they\'re doing,"" he said of the trainers. ""Me, myself, I wouldn\'t be down there doing that.""']",3,"– The rumors of Moammar Gadhafi's Venezuelan vacation are greatly exaggerated: The embattled Libyan leader made a bizarre, minute-long appearance on state TV at 2am local time, declaring, ""I am in Tripoli and not in Venezuela.

177,"[""For Mitt Romney, the 2012 election was held about a year too early. \n \n Romney would hold a slight lead on President Obama if the 2012 election were replayed today, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll. \n \n The poll of registered voters shows Romney at 49 percent and Obama at 45 percent in the rematch, a mirror image of Romney's four-point (51-47) popular-vote loss in 2012. \n \n Obama's shifting fortunes, of course, come as his signature health-care law is increasingly embattled -- both thanks to a glitchy Web site and a broken promise by Obama to allow people who like their insurance to keep it. \n \n Obama's loss of support is spread across many demographics, but he has suffered most among the young, the less-educated, the poor and, perhaps most interestingly, among liberals. \n \n To wit: \n \n * Obama won women in 2012 by 11 points, according to exit polls; today he leads by one point. \n \n * He has seen his lead among young voters (18-39 years old) drop from 18 percent to 2 percent. \n \n * His four-point lead among those with less than a college degree has flipped to a nine-point deficit. \n \n * Among those making less than $50,000, Obama's 22-point lead is now three points. \n \n * The biggest drop is among those professing to have no religion. While this group backed Obama by 44 points, it now supports him by a 22-point margin. \n \n * Among liberals, Obama won by 75 points but now leads by 59 percent. One in five self-described liberals (20 percent) say they would vote for Romney. \n \n This all comes with a few caveats. \n \n 1. This poll, obviously, is hypothetical. People know there isn't another election between Romney and Obama and may be more willing to change their opinion from the 2012 vote. \n \n 2. This doesn't necessarily mean Romney would win the race today. There is, of course, the margin of error and the fact that that the Electoral College -- and not the popular vote -- elects the president. \n \n That said, an eight-point shift in the popular vote, spread across the entire country, would have netted Romney an additional 10 states and 125 electoral votes in 2012. That would mean he would have won the race 331-207 -- virtually the same margin as Obama's 332-206 win. \n \n The Post-ABC poll was conducted Nov. 14-17 among a random national sample of 1,006 adults, including interviews on landlines and with cellphone-only respondents. The overall margin of sampling error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.

Fifty-five percent disapprove, a record. And 70 percent say the country\'s headed seriously off on the wrong track - up 13 points since May to the most in two years. \n \n See PDF with full results, charts and tables here. \n \n Other ratings of the president\'s performance have tumbled as well. He\'s at career lows for being a strong leader, understanding the problems of average Americans and being honest and trustworthy - numerically under water on each of these (a first for the latter two). His rating for strong leadership is down by 15 points this year and a vast 31 points below its peak shortly after he took office. In a new gauge, just 41 percent rate him as a good manager; 56 percent think not. \n \n This poll, produced for ABC by Langer Research Associates, finds that the president\'s personal image has suffered alongside his professional ratings. Fewer than half, 46 percent, see him favorably overall, down 14 points this year to the fewest of his presidency. Fifty-two percent now view him unfavorably, a new high and a majority for the first time since he took office. It may matter: Personal popularity can provide a president with cushioning when the going gets rough. Losing it leaves the president more vulnerable. \n \n ACA - Skepticism about the Affordable Care Act looks to be the driving force in Obama\'s troubles. Americans by nearly 2-1, 63-33 percent, disapprove of his handling of implementation of the new health care law. And the public by 57-40 percent now opposes the law overall, its most negative rating to date, with opposition up by 8 points in the past month alone. \n \n Intensity of sentiment is running against the law and the president alike. At 46 percent, ""strong"" opposition to the ACA - a new high - outpaces strong support by a record 19 points. In terms of Obama\'s job performance overall, strong critics outnumber strong approvers by 2-1, 44-22 percent, with strong disapproval at another career high. He\'d run evenly on strong sentiment as recently as last May. \n \n Fifty-six percent describe the cancellation of health insurance policies that are deemed substandard under the law as ""mismanagement"" rather than a normal startup problem. Given the breakdown of the healthcare.gov website, a broad 71 percent favor postponing the individual mandate requiring nearly all Americans to have coverage. And the mandate\'s still widely unpopular in any case; 65 percent of Americans oppose it - a majority of them, strongly. Notably, even among those who support the individual mandate. 55 percent favor delaying it. \n \n The poll produces evidence that the ACA could spell trouble for Democrats in the 2014 midterm elections. Americans by a 16-point margin, 37-21 percent, are more likely to oppose than to support a candidate for Congress who favors Obamacare. That\'s opened up from an even score in July 2012. (Using an intensity rating - those who are ""much"" more or less likely to support a candidate who backs the ACA - it\'s still 15 points negative, vs. 2 points last year.) \n \n The health care law looks most politically hazardous in the states that backed Mitt Romney in 2012; there Americans by 3-1, 46-15 percent, say they\'re more inclined to oppose than to support a candidate who favors the law. But the ACA\'s no help even in the blue states that backed Obama; while the division is far closer, 31 percent in those states are inclined to oppose an ACA-linked candidate, vs. 25 percent who\'d be more apt to support one. \n \n For all the ACA\'s troubles, Americans divide evenly, 49-49 percent, on whether the law simply is unworkable or the government can recover and implement it successfully. While its individual mandate is widely opposed, 58 percent support its requirement that companies with 50 or more employees provide coverage or pay a fine. And fewer than half - though a still-troubling 44 percent - think Obama ""intentionally misled"" the public when he said that people who liked their policies could keep them. (For comparison, there were four occasions in 2005-6 when majorities said George W. Bush had ""intentionally misled"" the American public on Iraq.) \n \n TURN - The results overall represent a sharp turnaround in fortune for Obama and his party, which just a month ago were ascendant over the Republicans in views of the budget dispute that led to a partial government shutdown. Today 45 percent of Americans call Obama ""too liberal,"" matching the high, and 46 percent say the same about the Democratic Party. And perhaps adding insult to injury, registered voters divide numerically in Mitt Romney\'s favor, 49-45 percent, if they had a mulligan for the 2012 presidential election. While the difference between the two is within the poll\'s error margin, Obama\'s support is 6 points below his actual showing a year ago. \n \n Indeed, even with the stock market soaring and GDP and the jobs market gaining ground, disenchantment with Obama has damaged his most critical issue-specific approval rating, for handling the economy. Fifty-seven percent disapprove, up by 9 points since May and the most since March 2012. \n \n Partisanship on all this is profound: Eighty-four percent of Democrats approve of Obama\'s job performance overall, while a mere 8 percent of Republicans agree - a gap that matches the widest of Obama\'s presidency. \n \n Key, though, are views among political independents - and in this group just 33 percent now approve of Obama\'s work in office, while 63 percent disapprove. That\'s a career low for Obama among independents, down 21 points since January and 10 points in just the past month. \n \n Similarly showing damage in the center, Obama\'s dropped by 17 points in approval among moderates since January, to 46 percent, compared with his losses among conservatives and Republicans (down 12 and 9 points, respectively, albeit to a far lower level). \n \n At the same time, there\'s also one core support group in which Obama is hurting - young adults, a group he won by an historic margin in 2008, and strongly again in 2012. The president\'s overall approval rating has lost 23 points among adults age 18 to 29 since January, his steepest loss in any group. Their view that the country\'s headed in the wrong direction has gained 20 points since May. And in just the past month, opposition to the health care law has jumped by 16 points among under-30s, with strong opposition up by 21 points. \n \n For all this, about as many Americans call both the Republican Party and the Tea Party political movement ""too conservative"" - 43 and 40 percent, respectively - as call Obama and the Democrats too liberal. And the number who say the Tea Party has too much influence over the GOP has nearly doubled, from 23 percent in spring 2010 to 43 percent now. That suggests the Republicans haven\'t left the doghouse so much as Obama and the Democrats, courtesy of the troubled start of the new health care law, have joined them in it. \n \n METHODOLOGY - This ABC News/Washington Post poll was conducted by telephone Nov. 14-17, 2013, in English and Spanish, among a random national sample of 1,006 adults, including landline and cell-phone-only respondents. Results have a margin of sampling error of 3.5 points, including design effect. Partisan divisions are 31-24-37 percent, Democrats-Republicans-independents. \n \n The survey was produced for ABC News by Langer Research Associates of New York, N.Y., with sampling, data collection and tabulation by Abt-SRBI of New York, N.Y.', ""On Thursday, the comments were taken off the publication’s Web site after the controversy erupted, and the editors, Father Groeschel and his religious order apologized. \n \n “I did not intend to blame the victim,” Father Groeschel wrote in a statement published on The Catholic Register’s site. “A priest (or anyone else) who abuses a minor is always wrong and is always responsible. My mind and my way of expressing myself are not as clear as they used to be.” \n \n Photo \n \n Joseph Zwilling, a spokesman for the Archdiocese of New York, denounced the comments as “terribly wrong.” But he said the church was unlikely to discipline Father Groeschel, in part because as a member of a religious order, he was not officially a priest of the diocese. \n \n For the past 38 years, Father Groeschel has counseled priests at the Trinity Retreat House in the New York suburb of Larchmont; he founded the retreat at the direction of the archbishop at the time, Cardinal Terence J. Cooke. The retreat is a place of treatment and reflection, and the archdiocese has sent priests credibly accused of sexual abuse to live there, but not since 2006, Mr. Zwilling said. \n \n More recently, priests struggling with problems like alcoholism have been sent there for counseling. Father Groeschel, who has a doctorate in psychology from Teachers College at Columbia University, has also taught pastoral counseling for more than 40 years at the archdiocesan seminary, St. Joseph’s Seminary in Yonkers. \n \n Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The Rev. Glenn Sudano, another founder of the Friars of the Renewal, whose adherents take vows of poverty and work extensively with the poor, said the remarks might have been the result of Father Groeschel’s advancing age and failing health, as well as the aftereffect of a near-fatal 2004 car accident in Orlando, Fla. \n \n “Poor Father Benedict,” he said. “It is painful for us, seeing someone who was so much an advocate and a defender for the underdog, say that.” \n \n In the interview, Father Groeschel said that he continued to counsel priests and that he worked some 12 hours a day. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Asked if he counseled priests who were abusers, he said yes, and then offered a sympathetic portrait. “People have this picture in their minds of a person planning to — a psychopath, but that’s not the case,” he said. Asked why a child might act as a seducer, he said: “A kid looking for a father and didn’t have his own — and they won’t be planning to get into heavy-duty sex, but almost romantic, embracing, kissing, perhaps sleeping but not having intercourse or anything like that.” \n \n He also expressed sympathy for Jerry Sandusky, the retired Penn State football coach who was recently convicted of serial child molesting, calling him “this poor guy.” \n \n Many New York priests and others — including advocates for victims of child sexual abuse — reacted with anger at the remarks. “Blaming the abused for their abuse is indefensible,” said the Rev.

So bad that if the American people got a mulligan on the 2012 election, there's a good shot we'd be looking at a President Romney. A Washington Post-ABC News poll reveals that if the election were held today, Obama would lose the popular vote 45% to 49%. While the Post reminds us that the Electoral College, not the popular vote, is the ultimate decider, it notes that spread roughly mirrors the 4 points Obama actually won by, and reflects plummeting support from his key demographics: Obama won women by 11 points; now, his edge is down to one point. He won voters aged 18-39 by 18 points; that's down to two. He won voters earning less than $50,000 by 22 points; it's down to three. He's now nine points in the hole with voters without a college degree, after winning them by four points. While he'd still win 59% of liberals, that's down from 75%—and 20% now say they'd vote for Romney. Obama's approval rating has fallen 13 points this year to 42%, tying its lowest mark ever in the poll. The culprit, as you might suspect, is at least in part the Affordable Care Act rollout, which 63% think has been handled poorly. The public now opposes the law itself 57%-40%, its worst numbers yet, and 71% favor delaying the individual mandate."
178,"['Judge Neil Gorsuch was on the list of judges that President Donald Trump promised he would choose from during the campaign. | AP Photo Trump picks Gorsuch for Supreme Court The 49-year-old federal appeals court judge would be the court\'s first conservative addition in a decade. \n \n President Donald Trump on Tuesday tapped Judge Neil Gorsuch for the Supreme Court, elevating a 49-year-old judge who has served on a federal appeals court for more than a decade to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia. \n \n “When Justice Scalia passed away suddenly last February, I made a promise to the American people: If I were elected president, I would find the very best judge in the country for the Supreme Court,” Trump said. “I promised to select someone who respects our laws and is representative of our Constitution and who loves our Constitution and someone who will interpret them as written.” \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n Trump used his characteristic superlatives to introduce Gorsuch, calling him the “best” judge for the job and praising his credentials without expounding on the specifics of his legal philosophy. Trump even touted Gorsuch’s Ivy League pedigree — the kind of affiliations Trump has sometimes denigrated as breeding grounds for the out-of-touch elite. \n \n ""Mr. President, I am honored and I am humbled,"" Gorsuch said after being introduced. \n \n Trump’s sons Donald Jr. and Eric sat in the front row during the announcement. Vice President Mike Pence and his wife, Karen, were also in attendance, as were a number of congressional leaders. Scalia’s widow, Maureen, was also in the audience. \n \n Gorsuch pledged that, if confirmed, he would serve as “a faithful servant of the constitution and laws of this great country.” \n \n “The Supreme Court’s work is vital not just to a region of the country, but to the whole, vital to the protections of the people’s liberties under law and to the continuity of our constitution — the greatest charter of human liberty the world has ever known,” Gorsuch said. \n \n In his remarks, Gorsuch praised Scalia. “Justice Scalia was a lion of the law. Agree or disagree with him, all of his colleagues on the bench cherished his wisdom and his humor. And like them, I miss him,” he said. \n \n Gorsuch was on the list of judges that Trump promised he would choose from during the campaign, and his selection to the high court is expected to rally conservative activists who successfully pushed Republicans to block hearings for Judge Merrick Garland, former President Barack Obama’s pick, after Scalia’s death in February 2016. \n \n Gorsuch was appointed to the circuit court in 2006 by George W. Bush. He was confirmed by a Senate voice vote, meaning there were no objections to his confirmation but individual senators\' votes were not recorded. Trump touted Gorsuch as having been confirmed ""unanimously."" \n \n Gorsuch said he cherishes the traits he considers essential to a judge — “impartiality and independence, collegiality and courage” — and said he looks forward to his hearing before the Senate, which he called the “greatest deliberative body in the world.” \n \n Gorsuch’s statement provided some hints that he’s what legal scholars call an ""originalist"" or ""textualist,"" favoring a literal meaning of statutes and the Constitution. \n \n “I respect, too, the fact that in our legal order it is for Congress, and not the courts, to write new laws,” Gorsuch said. “It is the role of judges to apply, not alter, the work of the people’s representatives. A judge who likes every outcome you reach is very likely a bad judge — stretching for results he prefers rather than those the law demands.” \n \n View Who is Judge Neil Gorsuch? President Donald Trump nominated Judge Neil Gorsuch from the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals to fill the vacant seat of the late Justice Antonin Scalia. \n \n And he made a nod to his religion: “I am so thankful tonight for my family, my friends and my faith,” he said. “These are the things that keep me grounded at life’s peaks and that sustain me in its valleys.” \n \n If confirmed, Gorsuch is unlikely to swing the ideological balance on the court. Legal experts see him as largely falling in line with the conservative bloc, as did Scalia. But, at 49, he would be the youngest justice on the court and represent an infusion of new blood into conservative ranks that have not seen an addition for a decade. \n \n Democrats have threatened to filibuster Trump\'s nominee, and the Senate\'s top Democrat criticized Gorsuch\'s record on Tuesday night. \n \n “The burden is on Judge Neil Gorsuch to prove himself to be within the legal mainstream and, in this new era, willing to vigorously defend the Constitution from abuses of the executive branch and protect the constitutionally enshrined rights of all Americans,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said. “Given his record, I have very serious doubts about Judge Gorsuch’s ability to meet this standard.” \n \n Democratic Sens. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Ron Wyden of Oregon, Jeff Merkley of Oregon, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Ed Markey of Massachusetts have all indicated they\'ll vote against the nominee. \n \n Senate Republicans praised Trump\'s pick and noted that Democrats had not blocked him from joining the appeals court. ""Eleven years ago, the Senate was so confident in Judge Gorsuch’s abilities that it confirmed him by voice vote,"" said Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas). ""In the time since, he has shown himself worthy of that distinction, and I would hope that my Senate colleagues give him the respect he deserves this time around, as well, and support his confirmation.” \n \n Gorsuch has the typical pedigree of a high court justice. He graduated from Columbia, Harvard and Oxford, clerked for two Supreme Court justices and did a stint at the Department of Justice. \n \n He attended Harvard Law with Obama. On Tuesday afternoon, Obama\'s former ethics czar, Norm Eisen, another classmate, tweeted: ""Hearing rumors Trump\'s likely Supreme Court pick is Neil Gorsuch, my (and President Obama\'s!) 1991 Harvard Law classmate.If so, a great guy!"" \n \n Since 2006, he has served on the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, and he is praised by conservative scholars for the clarity and force of his writing. \n \n “Neil Gorsuch is one of the most respected conservative originalist legal intellectuals of his generation,” said Jeffrey Rosen of the National Constitution Center. “He’s unusual for his memorable writing style, the depth of his reading and his willingness to rethink constitutional principles from the ground up. Like Justice Scalia, he sometimes reaches results that favor liberals when he thinks the history or text of the Constitution or the law require it, especially in areas like criminal law or the rights of religious minorities, but unlike Scalia he’s less willing to defer to regulations and might be more willing to second-guess Trump’s regulatory decisions.” \n \n Gorsuch is a favorite of legal conservatives because he has sharply questioned a three-decade-old legal precedent that many on the right believe has given too much power to the regulatory state. The landmark 1984 Supreme Court ruling involving the Chevron oil company held that courts should defer to federal agencies’ reasonable interpretations of ambiguous federal laws. \n \n In a ruling last August in an immigration case, Gorsuch questioned the wisdom of that doctrine, arguing that the meaning of the law is for judges to decide, not federal bureaucrats. \n \n “Where in all this does a court interpret the law and say what it is?” Gorsuch asked in an extended digression on the subject. “When does a court independently decide what the statute means and whether it has or has not vested a legal right in a person?

His confirmation to the Supreme Court is expected to be contentious. Republicans hold a 52-48 advantage in the Senate, but Democrats, led by Schumer, are expected to force Republicans to muster 60 votes through a filibuster. \n \n Trump has suggested Republicans should eliminate the filibuster if Democrats use it, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has been more circumspect about that idea, saying it remains up to the Senate, not the White House. \n \n Gorsuch has seen the grinder of Washington, D.C., up close.

(Victoria Walker/The Washington Post) \n \n President Trump has announced Judge Neil Gorsuch of Colorado as his pick for the Supreme Court. (Victoria Walker/The Washington Post) \n \n For nearly eight months, President Trump has boasted that appointing Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court ranks high among his signature achievements. \n \n But earlier this year, Trump talked about rescinding Gorsuch’s nomination, venting angrily to advisers after his Supreme Court pick was critical of the president’s escalating attacks on the federal judiciary in private meetings with legislators. \n \n Trump, according to several people with knowledge of the discussions, was upset that Gorsuch had pointedly distanced himself from the president in a private February meeting with Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), telling the senator he found Trump’s repeated attacks on the federal judiciary “disheartening” and “demoralizing.” \n \n The president worried that Gorsuch would not be “loyal,” one of the people said, and told aides that he was tempted to pull Gorsuch’s nomination — and that he knew plenty of other judges who would want the job. \n \n It is unclear whether Trump’s “explosion,” as another administration official described it, truly put Gorsuch’s nomination in jeopardy or whether the president was expressing his frustration aloud, as he often does. But at the time, some in the White House and on Capitol Hill feared that Gorsuch’s confirmation — which had been shaping up to be one of the clearest triumphs of Trump’s tumultuous young presidency — was on the verge of going awry. \n \n Sen.

The judge sent the president a handwritten letter dated March 2, thanking him for the nomination and explaining how grateful he was, according to a copy obtained by The Washington Post. \n \n “Your address to Congress was magnificent,” Gorsuch wrote. “And you were so kind to recognize Mrs. Scalia, remember the justice, and mention me. My teenage daughters were cheering the TV!” \n \n The reference to “the justice” was to Antonin Scalia, the late justice whom Gorsuch replaced, and “Mrs. Scalia” is his widow, Maureen. \n \n Aides said Trump did not immediately receive the note, but it was retrieved by legislative affairs director Marc Short and then viewed by Trump on March 10, helping ease his concerns. \n \n “As head of legislative affairs, our team was in charge of his nomination, and never did I view his nomination in jeopardy, nor did the president ever suggest to me that he wanted to pull him,” Short said. “The process obviously caused frustration, but that frustration was compounded by the fact that Gorsuch had sent him a personal letter that he never received.” \n \n Gorsuch, through a spokeswoman, declined to comment. \n \n President Trump watches as Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch hugs his wife, Marie Louise, moments after Supreme Court Justice Anthony M. Kennedy administered the judicial oath in the Rose Garden of the White House on April 10. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) \n \n “The president’s nomination of Neil M. Gorsuch was among his first and most important accomplishments during his first year in office, and delivered on a major campaign promise,” White House spokesman Raj Shah said in a statement. “At no point did the president consider withdrawing Justice Gorsuch’s nomination. He is very proud of the accomplishment.” \n \n Advisers also told Trump that Gorsuch was trying to demonstrate the independence necessary to make it through the confirmation process and that pulling the nomination would have far-reaching repercussions and might infuriate supporters who were enthusiastic about the conservative jurist. \n \n In April, two months after Trump first expressed his ire, the Senate confirmed Gorsuch on a vote of 54 to 45. Trump and his allies promptly began boasting about the appointment as one of the president’s major achievements. \n \n The incident that so angered Trump came shortly after a federal judge had issued a nationwide stop to the president’s travel ban targeting a list of majority-Muslim countries. At the time, the president disparaged the “so-called judge” on Twitter, writing that the ruling “put our country in such peril.” \n \n “If something happens blame him and court system,” Trump wrote. “People pouring in. Bad!” \n \n Trump had additionally said that a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit that held oral arguments to review the judge’s order was “disgraceful” and that the judges cared more about politics than following the law. \n \n Gorsuch, meanwhile, was moving through the confirmation process, doing rounds of courtesy meetings with senators on Capitol Hill — including the one with Blumenthal, which quickly became news after the senator shared their private discussion with reporters. \n \n “I told him how abhorrent Donald Trump’s invective and insults are toward the judiciary,” Blumenthal told The Post in an interview. “And he said to me that he found them ‘disheartening’ and ‘demoralizing’ — his words.” \n \n Ron Bonjean, a member of the group guiding Gorsuch through the confirmation process, confirmed the account at the time. \n \n The remarks angered the president, who attacked Blumenthal on Twitter, saying the senator misrepresented Gorsuch’s comments. But at the time, at least, he also felt that Gorsuch himself was being disloyal. \n \n In a meeting with House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), Trump attacked the judge in sharp terms, surprising his fellow Republicans. \n \n “He’s probably going to end up being a liberal like the rest of them,” Trump told the Republican leaders, according to a person with knowledge of the comments. “You never know with these guys.” \n \n A senior White House official who was in the room during the meeting disputed that characterization, saying the president is concerned about the judicial outlook of all lifetime nominees. \n \n But McConnell was so concerned that he made a point of repeatedly telling Trump to stay the course on Gorsuch — and that he would make sure the judge made it through the confirmation process with as few hiccups as possible. \n \n “It’s clear [Trump] was very upset with the comment” by Gorsuch, said someone familiar with the incident, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive topic. \n \n The person added that he largely faults the White House for failing to adequately prepare Trump for Gorsuch’s comments and to explain that Supreme Court nominees asserting their independence from the president who appointed them was a natural part of a successful confirmation process. \n \n In fact, establishing Gorsuch’s independence from Trump was so important that it was the subject of the first question he was asked by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), a fervent Gorsuch supporter. “Tell us whether you’d have any trouble ruling against the president who appointed you,” Grassley said at the time. \n \n “That’s a softball, Mr. Chairman,” Gorsuch replied. “I have no difficulty ruling against or for any party, other than based on what the law and the facts and the particular case require. And I’m heartened by the support I have received from people who recognize that there’s no such thing as a Republican judge or a Democratic judge. We just have judges in this country.” \n \n Despite Trump’s early concerns, Gorsuch’s young tenure has given the president little reason to question his appointment to the Supreme Court. If anything, the justice — who has emerged as one of the court’s most conservative members — has been criticized for not distancing himself enough from both the president and the Republican Senate leaders who championed his nomination through the highly partisan confirmation process. \n \n Gorsuch traveled to Kentucky with McConnell to lecture at the senator’s two alma maters. One of his first public speeches was to a conservative scholarship organization that held its luncheon meeting at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, the subject of a lawsuit alleging that payments to Trump’s companies violate the Constitution’s emoluments clause. \n \n Gorsuch also was the featured speaker at the annual black-tie gala of the Federalist Society, which had recommended him to Trump for the Supreme Court, telling the cheering crowd that neither originalism nor textualism “is going anywhere on my watch.” \n \n In April, Trump bragged to the National Rifle Association that Gorsuch “is really something very special” and in June told the Faith and Freedom Coalition that no president had accomplished more in their first 100 days, citing Gorsuch as a key achievement. \n \n “I appointed and confirmed a Supreme Court justice in the mold of the late, great Antonin Scalia,” he said, “and now Justice Gorsuch has a seat on the United States Supreme Court.” \n \n In his March note to Trump, Gorsuch was similarly effusive. \n \n “The team you have assembled to assist me in the Senate is remarkable and inspiring,” he wrote. “I see daily their love of country and our Constitution, and know it is a tribute to you and your leadership for policy is always about personnel.” \n \n He concluded, “Congratulations again on such a great start.”', 'Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell walk to the Senate floor Wednesday. | John Shinkle/POLITICO Congressional leaders reach budget deal The agreement would raise stiff spending caps and help stave off a shutdown. \n \n Congressional leaders on Wednesday clinched a two-year deal to lift strict budget caps on defense and domestic spending, likely putting an end to a series of short-term spending bills and shutdown fights that have defined Washington the past few months. \n \n The deal is expected to increase defense and domestic spending by roughly $300 billion over two years, according to administration and congressional sources, as well as lift the debt ceiling through the election and include tens of billions of dollars in disaster aid. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n ""This bill is the product of extensive negotiations among congressional leaders and the White House.

But we worked hard to find common ground and stay focused on serving the American people,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said in announcing the agreement. \n \n ""The budget deal doesn’t have everything Democrats want. It doesn’t have everything the Republicans want. But it has a great deal of what the American people want,"" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.).

It\'s likely to pass easily, but House approval will be a tougher lift. \n \n And though President Donald Trump suggested that the government could shut down without action on immigration, a top White House aide signaled that Trump supports the bill. \n \n “I’m not going to say every piece of it. But obviously, we’re excited about the defense numbers,"" said Marc Short, the White House legislative director. \n \n Trump tweeted in support of the deal a few hours later. \n \n ""The Budget Agreement today is so important for our great Military,"" he wrote. ""It ends the dangerous sequester and gives Secretary Mattis what he needs to keep America Great. Republicans and Democrats must support our troops and support this Bill!"" \n \n The agreement would increase defense spending this year by $80 billion and domestic spending by $63 billion beyond strict budget caps, according to a summary of the deal obtained by POLITICO. Next year, defense spending would increase by $85 billion and domestic funding by $68 billion beyond the caps. The deal also includes $140 billion for defense and $20 billion for domestic in emergency spending over two years. \n \n A plan to lift the debt limit, which requires action in the coming weeks, and whether to extend expiring tax provisions were among the few outstanding issues that could be attached to the deal, according to aides in both parties familiar with the talks. Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) said the debt ceiling is likely to be suspended through next March in tandem with the budget deal. Cornyn said nearly $90 billion of disaster aid for wildfires and hurricane damage will also be included. \n \n For such a large package to be passed before funding expires, all 100 senators will need to agree to speedy action on the spending bill and budget package. Any one senator can object to moving forward and derail the leaders’ plan, though McConnell said it is unlikely that the budget deal would fall apart at this late stage. \n \n Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who opposes the deal, said he hasn\'t decided whether he would deny a swift vote — and potentially cause a government shutdown. \n \n McConnell briefed the Senate GOP on the contours of the deal at a party lunch Wednesday, and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) also read in his members across the Capitol. Both GOP leaders faced pushback, but allies exuded confidence the budget deal will be on Trump\'s desk by Thursday evening. \n \n ""The House, and Republicans in the Senate and some Democrats in the Senate, are totally committed to increasing defense. And you weren\'t going to increase defense successfully without a big increase in nondefense,"" Blunt said. \n \n poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201802/844/1155968404_5728192221001_5728191585001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404"" true \n \n ""I\'ve got mixed feelings,"" said Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.). “This has been a hard-fought negotiation. I think our leadership really worked hard. It’s obviously not our leadership’s first preference, but we had to work it out with the other side."" \n \n Support from GOP defense hawks, especially in the House, will be critical in passing the bill. Senate Armed Services Chairman John McCain (R-Ariz.) — at home in Arizona while being treated for brain cancer — and House Armed Services Chairman Mac Thornberry (R-Texas) came out strongly in support of the package. \n \n ""This budget agreement is indispensable for our national security,"" the two Republicans said in a joint statement. ""Without it, our military would not be able to defend our nation, as Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis and our military leaders have repeatedly warned."" \n \n However, the negotiations hit a major snag on Wednesday: House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said she cannot support any budget agreement without a commitment from Ryan to vote on an immigration bill to protect immigrants covered under the Deferred Action for Child Arrivals program. \n \n Still, McConnell and Schumer are bullish about success. The two Senate leaders, along with Ryan and Pelosi, have been engaged in high-level spending talks for weeks. \n \n If all goes according to plan, the Senate will amend a short-term spending bill passed by the House to include the deal to lift strict budget caps and send the package back for the House’s approval before a Thursday night deadline to fund the government. House Democrats moved their annual retreat from Maryland’s Eastern Shore to the U.S. Capitol in anticipation of having to vote on the Senate plan. \n \n Hard-line GOP conservatives in the House Freedom Caucus oppose the deal, which means Ryan will need some votes from Pelosi. But many Republicans are expected to back it. \n \n ""There’s substantial support within our caucus. So I don’t think we’ll need that many Democrat votes,"" said Rep. Hal Rogers (R-Ky.). \n \n poster=""http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201804/3805/1155968404_5768203162001_5767695500001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404"" \n \n Pelosi is facing pressure from some of rank-and-file members — as well as from progressive groups — to reject a budget caps agreement unless Trump and the Republicans agree to a legislative fix for Dreamers. After surveying her caucus, she implored Ryan on the House floor to ""Let Congress work its will. What are you afraid of?"" \n \n ""Without a commitment from Speaker Ryan comparable to the commitment from Leader McConnell, this package does not have my support,"" Pelosi said. McConnell promised to hold a floor debate on various Dreamers proposals later this month as long as the government remains open. \n \n Ryan has said he would bring up a Dreamers deal if Trump signs off on it. \n \n ""We\'ve been very clear about this,"" Ryan said at a news conference earlier this week. ""We will take a bill that the president supports."" \n \n Republicans said privately they were not going to overreact to Pelosi\'s comments, even as she held the House floor for hours demanding action for Dreamers. Pelosi and her aides have been part of the budget caps negotiations from the start, and no deal will occur unless all four party leaders on the Hill support any agreement and work to pass it. \n \n On Tuesday, Schumer said he and Pelosi are aligned strategically on moving forward, potentially defusing another government shutdown. \n \n And many Democrats and Republicans will find relief in a break from budget brinkmanship and in boosting domestic programs and defense spending. The House passed a bill Tuesday funding the government until March 23, which would allow Congress to write a new spending bill for the rest of the year at levels set by the emerging budget deal, potentially avoiding more shutdown fights in an election year. \n \n Though Democrats were unable to secure complete parity in domestic spending alongside the big boost in military dollars, they were quick to note the agreement includes $20 billion for infrastructure, $5.8 billion for child care and $6 billion to fight opioid addiction. The bill also includes a two-year extension of expired Community Health Centers funding and a 10-year extension of Children\'s Health Insurance Plan funding. \n \n Separately, Schumer and McConnell have been discussing how the Senate will handle a debate on immigration to protect immigrants under DACA from deportation. While House Democrats had been pushing Senate Democrats to clinch a DACA deal in tandem with the budget, there is little hope of a deal on immigration this week. \n \n All McConnell would promise is a wide-ranging floor debate to begin next week. \n \n Jennifer Scholtes contributed to this report.', 'A statuary figure of a boy stands outside one of at least 20 homes destroyed just on Windermere Drive in the Point Dume area of Malibu, Calif., Saturday, Nov. 10, 2018.

(AP) — Authorities called in a mobile DNA lab and anthropologists to help identify the dead as the search went on for victims of the most destructive wildfire in California history. The overall death toll from the outbreak of fires at both ends of the state stood at 25 Sunday and appeared likely to rise. \n \n The worst of the blazes was in Northern California, where flames reduced the town of Paradise, population 27,000, to a smoking ruin days ago and continued to rage in surrounding communities. The number of people killed in that fire alone, at least 23, made it the third-deadliest on record in the state. \n \n Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea said the county was bringing in more rescue workers and consulted anthropologists from California State University at Chico because in some cases ""the only remains we are able to find are bones or bone fragments."" \n \n ""This weighs heavy on all of us,"" Honea said. \n \n Authorities were also bringing in a DNA lab and encouraged people with missing relatives to submit samples to aid in identifying the dead. \n \n The sheriff\'s department compiled a list of 110 people unaccounted for, but officials held out hope that many were safe but had no cellphones or some other way to contact loved ones. \n \n Firefighters gained modest ground overnight against the blaze, which grew slightly to 170 square miles (440 square kilometers) from the day before and was 25 percent contained, up from 20 percent, said David Clark, a spokesman for the state fire agency, Cal Fire. \n \n Clark said Sunday that high winds and dry conditions were expected over the next 24 hours: ""We\'re at a pivotal point now."" \n \n The blaze destroyed more than 6,700 buildings, nearly all of them homes. \n \n Two people were also found dead in a wildfire in Southern California , where fires tore through Malibu mansions and homes in working-class Los Angeles suburbs. The severely burned bodies were discovered in a long residential driveway in Malibu, home to a multitude of Hollywood celebrities. \n \n Among those forced out of their homes were Lady Gaga, Kim Kardashian West, Guillermo del Toro and Martin Sheen. \n \n Flames also raged on both sides of Thousand Oaks, the Southern California city still in mourning over the massacre of 12 people in a shooting rampage at a country music bar Wednesday night. \n \n Cal Fire Battalion Chief Lucas Spelman said the larger of the two fires in the region was 10 percent contained, but firefighters braced for another round of Santa Ana winds, the dry gusts that blow out of the interior toward the coast. \n \n The count of lost structures in both Southern California fires climbed to at least 179, authorities said. \n \n All told, a quarter-million people were under evacuation orders across the state, officials said. \n \n Drought, warmer weather attributed to climate change and home construction deeper into forests have led to more destructive wildfire seasons in California that have been starting earlier and lasting longer. \n \n In Paradise, a town founded in the 1800s, residents who stayed behind to try to save their properties or who managed to return despite an evacuation order found incinerated cars and homes. \n \n Wearing masks because the air was still heavy with smoke, people sidestepped metal that had melted off of cars or Jet-Skis as they surveyed their ravaged neighborhoods. Some cried when they saw nothing was left. \n \n Jan McGregor, 81, got back to his small two-bedroom home in Paradise with the help of his firefighter grandson. He found his home leveled — a large metal safe and pipes from his septic system the only recognizable traces. The safe was punctured with bullet holes from guns inside that went off in the scorching heat. \n \n He lived in Paradise for nearly 80 years, moving there in 1939, when the town had just 3,000 people and was nicknamed Poverty Ridge. \n \n ""We knew Paradise was a prime target for forest fire over the years,"" he said. ""We\'ve had \'em come right up to the city limits — oh, yeah — but nothing like this."" \n \n McGregor said he probably would not rebuild: ""I have nothing here to go back to."" \n \n ___ \n \n This story has been corrected to show fix survivor\'s name to McGregor instead of MacGregor. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writers Daisy Nguyen, Olga R.

When President Trump first tapped the Supreme Court justice for the job earlier this year, he praised Gorsuch as being the ""best"" candidate for the job, and by many accounts, Gorsuch has since made good at carrying out the president's conservative agenda. And Trump has publicly touted Gorsuch as one of his main achievements so far—but privately things may have been quite different initially. Sources tell the Washington Post Trump was furious after hearing Gorsuch was slamming him in private meetings with lawmakers (specifically a February one with Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal) in response to the president's attacks on the judiciary. So furious, in fact, that Trump spoke of yanking his nomination of Gorsuch and finding someone else for the job, sources say. ""He's probably going to end up being a liberal like the rest of them,"" Trump reportedly told Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell during a meeting; a source says McConnell had to talk Trump down.

179,"['“Ah, what a trifle is a heart, \n \n If once into love’s hands it come!” \n \n John Donne, The Broken Heart \n \n That line, and those of thousands of other poems and love songs, may have to be rewritten, according to Professor Alain Carpentier, the inventor of the world’s first fully artificial, self-regulating heart. \n \n His contraption is now beating inside the breast of a 75-year-old Frenchman. Controlled by a computer and made partly from chemically treated animal tissues, it is the culmination of a 30-year quest by Mr Carpentier, 80, for the “holy grail” of transplant surgery. \n \n Asked on Sunday to comment on his discovery, he quoted the celebrated 19th century French scientist Claude Bernard: “Whatever the poets may say, the heart is just a pump.” \n \n Mr Carpentier went on to add, however: “It’s a rather special kind of pump. If your loved one came through the door [and you had a Carpentier artificial heart], it would start to beat faster, just like a real one.” \n \n Other types of artificial heart have been constructed and fitted, with varying degrees of success, such as Robert Jarvik’s device first implanted in 1982. Mr Carpentier’s invention is claimed to be the first to be completely artificial and self-regulating. It was constructed by a French medical engineering company, Carmat, and transplanted into a patient by two surgeons at a Paris hospital in a 10-hour operation last Wednesday. \n \n The operation, leaked to the French press before it was to be officially announced this week, is reported to have gone well. The patient was said to have been “near death, without any other alternative available” but is now responding well. \n \n Mr Carpentier hopes his artificial heart, powered by replaceable batteries carried outside the body, will help to solve the chronic shortage of hearts for transplant surgery. Unlike a real donor heart, it should not provoke rejection by the host. \n \n The Carpentier heart weighs 900g, is roughly the same size as a real heart and imitates its functions exactly. Electrical sensors and microprocessors monitor the demands of the body for blood and adjust the operation of the heart accordingly. \n \n In an interview on Sunday with the Journal du Dimanche, Professor Carpentier said he began his work on artificial hearts three decades ago. “I was confronted with a painful situation,” he said. “I was a doctor with a patient who was about to die from a defective heart when there was no transplant available.” \n \n Mr Carpentier initially developed artificial heart valves made from chemically treated animal tissues. “I then decided to try to create an entire heart with these same materials,” he said. \n \n The cost of a Carpentier artificial heart is estimated at £100,000 to £135,000 – about the same as the overall cost of providing a transplanted heart from an accident victim. The present model is the right size for 70 per cent of men and 25 per cent of women, but Mr Carpentier is developing a smaller version.', 'NEW YORK, NY — Rhode Island’s Department of Health says that sexually transmitted diseases are way up in the state, in part because of the increase of hookup apps like Tinder. \n \n Between 2013 and 2014, cases of syphilis grew by 79%. HIV infections were up 33% and gonorrhea cases increased by 30%. STD cases for young adults are growing at a faster rate than the rest of the population. \n \n Rhode Island says the recent uptick in STD cases follows a national trend. The state’s health department blamed “high-risk behaviors that have become more common in recent years,” including “using social media to arrange casual and often anonymous sexual encounters.” \n \n A spokesman for Tinder did not respond to a request for comment. \n \n Social media and online hookup apps have been blamed for a rise in STDs in the past. \n \n A 2013 New York University study found that Craigslist was responsible for a 16% increase in HIV cases between 1999 and 2008 across 33 states. Grinder, a hookup app for gay men, was associated with more than half of all syphilis cases in New Zealand in 2012, according to Christchurch Sexual Health Clinic. \n \n “These new data underscore the importance of encouraging young people to begin talking to a doctor, nurse, or health educator about sexual health,” said Rosemary Reilly-Chammat, an HIV/AIDS sexuality specialist for the Rhode Island Department of Education, in a press release.']",2,"– Alain Carpentier thinks he has an answer to chronic shortages of organ donors. The French cardiac surgeon—under Carmat, the French company he founded—has invented what the Independent calls the ""world's first fully artificial, self-regulating heart,"" and it apparently works, at least very initially. Carpentier's creation was successfully transplanted into a 75-year-old on Wednesday; he's said to be responding favorably. If you're wondering why it deserves the label ""first,"" especially considering Robert Jarvik's artificial heart was first implanted in 1982, Carpentier, 80, explains that his is the first heart to self-regulate, mimicking an actual heart. ""If your loved one came through the door [and you had a Carpentier artificial heart], it would start to beat faster, just like a real one,"" he says. Further, surfaces that are exposed to human blood are made in part from cow tissue, rather than synthetic material, which can produce blood clots and therefore require the use of anticoagulants; its design also minimizes the chance of rejection, reports the Financial Times. Most importantly, it's designed to sidestep the need for a donor heart: Reuters reports the current model, powered by external lithium batteries, is expected to keep a patient alive for up to five years. The heart was three decades in the making, and the end result is similar in size to a real heart, though it weighs three times more (at nearly 2 pounds) and isn't sized correctly for all—about 86% of men but only 20% of women, reports Reuters (a smaller model is planned). The expected cost is $190,000 to $220,000, on par with the cost of a traditional heart transplant. The Carmat heart has been approved for testing in three more French patients; the initial trial seeks to determine whether the patients can survive at least one month.

Mike Salomonsky said. \n \n Investigators also arrested 23-year-old Terry Brown and charged him with possession of drug paraphernalia, loitering and promoting prison contraband. \n \n ""Upon his arrival at the main facility after his incarceration, he was found to have marijuana on his person. So that brought about the additional charge which is a felony on him,"" Capt. Mike Salomonsky said of Brown\'s contraband charge. \n \n The Mannequin Challenge video shows numerous people in possession of several guns. This launched an investigation by the Criminal Investigation/Narcotics unit. Despite the two arrests, Capt. Salomonsky said they expect one or two more to come soon. \n \n Please enable Javascript to watch this video \n \n ""There are several persons in the video who may be convicted felons,"" Capt. Salomonsky said. ""So, we\'re going to try to do some identification, work with the ATF and see if we can generate any charges out of that. \n \n Investigators say they were able to obtain enough probable cause through their investigation to get a search for the home. \n \n ""We used a breaching technique which caused the front door to be removed from the residence,"" Capt. Salomonsky said. ""They encountered one subject that was in the front room and he was armed. But, he told them he was armed."" \n \n Please enable Javascript to watch this video \n \n After authorities cleared the residence, they searched the house. Investigators say they found two hand guns, one assault rifle, one older single barrel shotgun, multiple packs of marijuana, an attack vest, multiple magazines for the assault rifle, multiple rounds of ammunition and a computer. \n \n There were six people inside the home when the team of authorities executed the search warrant, including children. \n \n Initially, they thought several items behind the house might have been stolen, but found they were purchased legitimately. \n \n The investigation started after the video surfaced. ""You have a lot of people with firearms at one address,"" says Salomonsky. ""And you have to ask yourself the question, \'Why?\' and the second question you have to ask yourself: is it a public safety issue?"" \n \n Deputies say the investigation determined the people living in that home were selling marijuana.', 'View Reward Notice Here \n \n Governor Andrew M.

(John Moore/Getty Images) \n \n The Trump administration is continuing an Obama-era program allowing so-called ""dreamers,"" young people whose parents brought them to the United States illegally, to stay and work here, handing a big victory to immigration activists who have been battling with the new president on immigrant travel and refugee matters. \n \n The decision, a one-line mention at the bottom of a memo the Department of Homeland Security released Thursday night, is also a reversal of a campaign promise of Donald Trump, who pledged as a candidate to ""immediately terminate"" protections offered by program. \n \n The memo details the administration\'s decision to abandon the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, or DAPA, program, which protected the parents of legal residents and U.S. citizens from deportation. That program has never been in full effect, as it was enjoined by the courts, and the Homeland Security\'s decision merely formalizes what has been ongoing policy. At the end of the memo, however, the administration offered a notice that may be less-palatable to Trump\'s political base: ""The June 15, 2012 memorandum that created the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program will remain in effect."" \n \n DACA has far more public sympathy, since it applies to people who were brought to the United States as young children and have no real ties to their countries of birth. Some do not even have the language skills needed to relocate in their home countries, if they are deported. \n \n Former President Barack Obama issued DACA five years ago Thursday. It does not make such undocumented immigrants citizens, but provides administrative relief from the fear of deportation and allows eligible young people to work legally for two years. It applies to those who were under the age of 31 as of June 15, 2012, who arrived in the U.S. before age 16 and have lived continuously in the country since June 15, 2007. Eligible beneficiaries of the discretionary policy must be currently studying or be a high school or military graduate, and have clean criminal records. \n \n Obama\'s DAPA program also extended the legal work authorization from two years to three years for DACA beneficiaries. That provision is rescinded, according to the DHS memo, meaning young eligible undocumented immigrant may only work legally for two years before having to apply for permission again. \n \n Immigration activists are disappointed at the formal rescission of DAPA, and while they say they are not surprised by the DACA statement, since Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly previously indicated in congressional testimony that dreamers would not be a target, they are wary. \n \n The DHS memo ""simply reiterates the status quo,"" Lynn Tramonte, Deputy Director of the pro-immigrant group America\'s Voice, said in a statement. ""DACA remains in place – for now – but it\'s clear that they are using it as cover to deport everyone else. What\'s more, this Administration has been cynically wielding its enforcement authorities over certain DACA recipients. This is a classic move used by abusers to keep their targets – in this case DACA recipients – feeling vulnerable and \'in check.\' \n \n America\'s Voice and other pro-immigrant advocates believe the administration wants to focus its attention on other immigrant targets, including those convicted of minor crimes. While Trump has said he wanted to deport only criminal illegal immigrants, activists have noted that people with minor traffic violations have been targeted for detention and deportation, putting immigrants in fear. \n \n On the fifth anniversary of the program Thursday, activists and DACA beneficiaries rallied in favor of continuing the policy. \n \n ""Protecting DACA is not only central for immigrants\' rights, it is deeply personal. DACA has provided members of my own family and community the opportunity to live fuller and better lives, no longer restrained by the threat of deportation,"" Lorella Praeli, director of immigration policy and campaigns at the American Civil Liberties Union, said in a statement. Praeli was a leader of the immigrant youth movement which pressed for relief for young immigrants. \n \n ""Here at the ACLU and so many other organizations, we are grounded in the fight to defend and advance the rights of immigrants of all walks of life. DACA is a lifeline and a reminder that this country still believes in all of our potential and welcomes our contributions,"" Praeli said. \n \n Later on Friday, the White House drew back on the DHS statement, saying the filing was meant to meet a court deadline on DAPA next week and was not intended to affect the program for young people. A senior White House official, speaking on background, did not say whether the White House was still reviewing the DACA program and added, ""quite frankly, immigration is something that needs to be resolved by Congress."" \n \n Updated on June 16, 2017 : This story has been updated with comment from a White House official.']",3,"– They succeeded in making a viral video, but it might have been in exchange for their freedom.

181,"['Drama. Starring Matt Damon and Cecile De France. Directed by Clint Eastwood. (PG-13. 129 minutes. In English and in French with English subtitles. At Bay Area theaters.) \n \n That Clint Eastwood has become a great filmmaker is something few would contest, yet the nature of his greatness is as surprising as it\'s little understood. You can talk about the pristine technique - the new film, ""Hereafter,"" provides lots of examples. But what\'s much more fascinating and enriching is Eastwood\'s Olympian vision, the sympathetic and all-encompassing understanding of the pain and grandeur of life on earth. \n \n This vision is consistent in Eastwood\'s late work, no matter who is doing the screenwriting, and it boggles the mind to realize that this is coming from a guy who, until he was about 60, was best known as an action hero. Make no mistake, Eastwood\'s directorial output, from ""Mystic River"" on, constitutes the 21st century\'s first cinematic marvel, and ""Hereafter"" is among the best things he has ever done. \n \n Like Alejandro Inarritu\'s ""Babel"" and Wayne Kramer\'s ""Crossing Over,"" ""Hereafter"" is an attempt to convey the bigness of life though a story involving disparate characters in different parts of the world. All three movies are responses to the interconnectedness of the world, but ""Hereafter"" is by far the most successful, partly because it has the best screenplay - by Peter Morgan (""The Queen"") - and partly because it has a director who understands the difference between important and self-important. \n \n Importance is earned, shot by shot, scene by scene. Self-importance is assumed, and is largely a matter of adopting an attitude and keeping a straight face. \n \n Eastwood takes us into the story from the opening shots. From a hotel, we see a beach resort, filmed with the kind of color saturation we might see in an old postcard. The effect is reassuring, but misleading. A vacationing French journalist (Cecile De France) goes into the village to buy presents. And suddenly, there\'s a rumbling, the sight of a rising wave, and within seconds, buildings are washed away, and cars, trucks and people are all caught in a rushing flood. \n \n There have been tidal waves in movies before, but what makes this one so effective (aside from being perfectly realized on the technical end) is that Eastwood stays with De France. He doesn\'t show us an overview, so that we might get our bearings. Rather, we experience the catastrophe from one person\'s terrified and completely subjective vantage point. It\'s as close as you\'ll ever be to a tidal wave without getting wet. \n \n ""Hereafter"" features three central characters that have been touched by death. The newswoman drowns and is revived. A construction worker (Matt Damon) in San Francisco is cursed with an ability to talk to the dead. (If he touches someone, he finds himself in communication with that person\'s dead relatives - so much for his love life.) And a little boy in London develops an all-consuming desire to talk to a recently deceased loved one. These stories play out separately, then gradually move toward one another. \n \n Notice how every shot communicates something precise, whether it\'s plot detail or a thought or emotion. As an actor, Eastwood is used to breaking up a script into a succession of specific actions, and he does the same as a director. Such meticulousness serves his actors well and allows Eastwood to take his time within scenes and let them expand and feel lived in. He never wastes his audience\'s time, because he is always feeding it new information. \n \n Eastwood\'s practical unwillingness to neglect any actor ends up giving ""Hereafter"" a humane essence: Everybody is important, not just Damon as the tortured psychic or De France as a breezy extrovert deepened by trauma. Thus, the little boy\'s mother (Lyndsey Marshal), is more than a desperate alcoholic, and Bryce Dallas Howard gets to create a rich character as Melanie, the psychic\'s partner in a San Francisco cooking class - a young woman masking pain under a superficial facade that has become her personality. \n \n The ironic result of all this meticulous care is that we don\'t see Eastwood\'s hand but rather have the illusion that this gallery of humanity is telling the story for him. It\'s the most self-effacing way to do great work, and it\'s an approach that couldn\'t be more suited to this material. The film\'s notion that people share a common destiny, that they\'re participating in some overarching order, that they\'re being watched over by a benevolent all-seeing understanding, doesn\'t need to be spelled out. It has its analogue and expression in Eastwood\'s technique. \n \n He just tells the story, and we get it. \n \n -- Advisory: This film contains sexual situations. \n \n This article appeared on page E - 1 of the San Francisco Chronicle', 'Hereafter \n \n October 19, 2010 \n \n Clint Eastwood\'s ""Hereafter"" considers the idea of an afterlife with tenderness, beauty and a gentle tact. I was surprised to find it enthralling. I don\'t believe in woo-woo, but then neither, I suspect, does Eastwood. This is a film about the afterlife that carefully avoids committing itself on such a possibility. The closest it comes is the idea of consciousness after apparent death. This is plausible. Many near-death survivors report the same memories, of the white light, the waiting figures and a feeling of peace. \n \n One of the characters seems to have a genuine psychic gift. But is he in fact communicating with people beyond the grave? Some form of telepathy might be possible, and he may simply be receiving what his subjects desire or need to be told by their dead loved ones. He brings nothing from beyond the grave that his clients could not have formed in their living minds. \n \n \n \n This is a subject that lends itself to sensation and psychic baloney. It\'s astonishing how many people believe New Age notions, which have the attraction of allowing believers to confer supernormal abilities on themselves and others without the bother of plausibility. Eastwood\'s film will leave such people vaguely uneasy. It believes most psychics are frauds. It supposes one who seems to be the real thing, but what, exactly, is he real about? \n \n \n \n This is a film for intelligent people who are naturally curious about what happens when the shutters close. Eastwood tells three primary stories. The stories meet at the end, in one of those coincidences so beloved by multiple-strand movies. Is this possible? Yes. Is it likely? No. A coincidence never is. That\'s why we notice them. Throughout the film, the characters behave in ways that seem reasonable enough, and possibilities are left open, which is as it should be. We must live the lives we know and not count on anything beyond the horizon. \n \n \n \n ""Hereafter"" stars Matt Damon as George, a man who sincerely believes he\'s able to have communication with the dead, but has fled that ability and taken a low-profile job; Cecile de France as Marie, a newsreader on French television; Bryce Dallas Howard as Melanie, a young cooking student with a fearful dark place inside; Richard Kind as a man mourning his wife; and Frankie and George McLaren as twin brothers, one of whom is struck by a truck and killed. \n \n \n \n I won\'t describe here the traumatic surprises some of them experience. In the surprises as in everything else, ""Hereafter"" is believable. There are terrifying events, but Eastwood handles them not for sensation but to show how close we all are, at any moment, to oblivion. In the case of Marie, she undergoes the near death experience we often hear reported, with the white light and the figures. Are people in such a state already dead, or are they experiencing visions generated by the human mind in its final shutdown mode? \n \n \n \n The powers of the Damon character seem to be authentic, although what they prove is hard to say. There is a moment handled with love and delicacy in which he says something that is either true or isn\'t, but is a kindness either way. When he holds a stranger\'s hands he experiences a flash of telepathic insight, but the movie never declares that his insights literally come from dead spirits. \n \n \n \n Eastwood and his actors achieve a tone that doesn\'t force the material but embraces it: Not dreamlike, but evoking a reverie state. These characters are not hurtling toward the resolution of a plot. There is no ""solution"" to their stories. There are various degrees of solace, or not. They don\'t punch the dialogue. They lack the certainty to impose themselves. George in particular is reserved and sad, because his power has become a burden to him. \n \n \n \n There\'s a sweet subplot involving Melanie (Howard), who he meets as a partner in a cooking class. She has experienced loss. George doesn\'t want to enter her mind. He yearns for a normal life. The ability to read minds would be an unbearable curse. The way his gift affects their relationship is stark and poignant. Marie, the newsreader, is played by Cecile de France in such a fresh and likable way that our sympathy is engaged and we understand that whatever happened to her in the first terrifying scene has fundamentally changed her. Frankie McLaren, as the solemn and earnest little boy seeking his dead twin, takes a character that could have been bathetic and makes him simple and transparent. And notice Richard Kind, so affecting as a man who has lost his wife. \n \n \n \n The movie is an original screenplay by Peter Morgan (""The Queen""). Eastwood told me Morgan doesn\'t believe in an afterlife. I don\'t know if Eastwood does, either. His film embodies how love makes us need for there to be an afterlife. It is the film of a man at peace. He has nothing to prove except his care for the living. \n \n \n \n Incorporates a little wording from my blog entry from the Toronto film festival premiere.', 'Across the Styx, but never out on a limb \n \n By Michael O\'Sullivan \n \n Friday, October 22, 2010 \n \n For much of its two-hour-plus length, ""Hereafter"" plays like a smart and stylish thriller. Smart because of the way it pulls back, but only a little bit, from a full-on embrace of its central premise: the existence of an afterlife for the human soul. Stylish because of its cool and bloodless demeanor. The world it depicts - our world, the world of the here and now - is bathed in a deathlike pallor of icy blues and grays, whether set in San Francisco, London or Paris. \n \n It\'s a thriller because of the pervasive tone of dread and sadness. For its three main characters, the world is a deeply haunted place indeed. \n \n At the center of the mostly mesmerizing but finally flawed film is George Lonegan (Matt Damon). In the script by two-time Oscar nominee Peter Morgan (""The Queen"" and ""Frost/Nixon""), which has been directed with admirable restraint by Clint Eastwood, George is a former professional psychic who has shut down his lucrative Bay Area practice to work as a menial laborer. It seems that his ability to talk to the dead through readings is less the gift one might think than a curse. \n \n All George has to do is to touch someone\'s hand and he\'s plugged into a parallel universe - a universe of actual ghosts and the ghosts of repressed trauma. These days, despite his best efforts, he\'s forever running away from skeletons: both the kind in the ground and the kind in someone else\'s closet. \n \n Needless to say, this makes it kind of hard for George to maintain relationships. The first time he takes a woman\'s hand, as he does on an abortive first date with a flirtatious cutie from cooking class (Bryce Dallas Howard), he immediately knows everything about her. And I mean everything. So much for leaving something to the imagination. \n \n But Eastwood\'s film isn\'t just about George\'s romantic problems. Woven into that narrative are two even more compelling story lines. \n \n While on a vacation, French TV anchor Marie LeLay (Cecile de France) almost drowns, during what we\'re led to believe is the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. This is the scene that opens the film, and it\'s a doozy of harrowingly real special-effects. Brought back from the brink of death, Marie soon quits her job to research and write a book on near-death experiences. (The name of the manuscript, ""Hereafter,"" lends the film its title.) \n \n Meanwhile, in London, a taciturn schoolboy named Marcus (Frankie McLaren) is traumatized when his identical twin, Jason, (George McLaren) is accidentally killed. Marcus spends the rest of the movie trying to contact his dead brother, or to track down somebody who can. At one point, Jason seems to reach from beyond the grave to save Marcus from one of the London subway bombings of 2005, by knocking Marcus\'s hat off his head. \n \n It\'s these dramatic close calls - first the tsunami, then the bombing - that lend the film an air of mounting suspense. Eastwood and Morgan handle them with as little cheesiness as possible, under the circumstances. The tone is not one of skepticism, so much as deadpan acceptance of things we may not understand. \n \n As the film proceeds, however, something terrible (or perhaps something wonderful) seems to be brewing, something even more dramatic than what\'s come before. Something that somehow involves not only George, and his ability to connect with the other side, but also Marie and Marcus. It takes the film nearly two hours to get there, but finally, near the end of the movie, all three characters wind up in London, for what we\'ve been led to believe will be a collision - or at least a fusion - of artfully woven plotlines. \n \n That fusion never takes place. \n \n Not, at least, in the way that Eastwood and Morgan have been hinting at in ""Hereafter\'s"" deliciously creepy, otherworldly build-up. George and Marcus do meet. So do George and Marie. The film is filled with such great little one-on-one scenes. And the best of them are between the living, not between the living and the dead. \n \n But the big payoff fizzles. By pulling its punches, by refusing to make outlandish claims about a world beyond this one, ""Hereafter"" avoids the pitfalls of other supernatural thrillers. But it\'s unable to avoid the even soggier conventions of the movie romance. \n \n It starts out with a tsunami - and ends up standing in a puddle. \n \n Contains disturbing disaster and accident scenes, brief crude language and drug and alcohol abuse. In English and some French with English subtitles.']",3,"– Clint Eastwood, Matt Damon … what’s not to like about Hereafter? But not all the critics are overly impressed with this spiritual film that touches on the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and the 2005 London subway bombings: “The mostly mesmerizing but finally flawed film” mostly “plays like a smart and stylish thriller,” writes Michael O'Sullivan in the Washington Post. But the promise of three separate and “artfully-woven” plotlines coming together for “a collision—or at least a fusion,” is never realized. “The big payoff fizzles.” Mick LaSalle begs to differ: This is one of Eastwood’s best, he writes in the San Francisco Chronicle. “Every shot communicates something precise, whether it's plot detail or a thought or emotion.” The result is a “sympathetic and all-encompassing understanding of the pain and grandeur of life on earth.” In the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert concurs: The “enthralling” film “considers the idea of an afterlife with tenderness, beauty and a gentle tact.” Though the subject matter “lends itself to sensation and psychic baloney … this is a film for intelligent people who are naturally curious about what happens when the shutters close.” Another in the thumb's down camp: It tackles big topics ""without having anything to say,” writes Kyle Smith in the New York Post. “The movie drags, yet it feels like it's missing an hour. It features three characters on three continents who barely interact with one another. And after 130 minutes, it stops without concluding.” Eastwood recently promoted the film, but ended up talking about his disagreements with President Obama. Watch that interview here."

In 2010, illegal immigrants represented roughly 6 percent of the state’s population. \n \n Activists said Arizona’s anti-immigrant laws inspired many illegal immigrants to demand more rights. Last week, some college students rallied outside Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer’s office for driver’s licenses for illegal immigrants. \n \n “They no longer are afraid to come and say, ‘I am not able to vote, but I can make my voice heard, and they have to listen to me,’” said community organizer Abril Gallardo. \n \n A report released in January showed the U.S. Border Patrol’s Tucson sector remains the busiest along the U.S.-Mexico border. The Tucson sector accounted for 38 percent of all drug seizures and 37 percent of all apprehensions along the border. \n \n Brewer said last week the border cannot be declared safe until the people living near it feel secure from drug human trafficking. \n \n But Democratic Congresswoman Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona told Latino and black community leaders at a Phoenix luncheon Tuesday that Arizonans need to spread the word on how much more secure the border has become. \n \n “There are lots of folks who don’t live in Arizona who have no idea what the border is like,” Sinema said. \n \n Napolitano toured the border Tuesday afternoon with U.S. Customs and Border Protection Deputy Commissioner David Aguilar, Democratic Rep.

""I\'m putting my life on the line."" \n \n One site for the video drew nearly 640,000 views, as of Thursday. \n \n His news conference Tuesday followed a Kobe Shimbun newspaper report this week that raised questions about Nonomura\'s visiting the hot springs 106 times last year, using public money. \n \n Such visits were not illegal and had been reported to the assembly office, but totaled 3 million yen ($30,000). \n \n Calls are rising for Nonomura to give an explanation. \n \n Hyogo legislators get 500,000 yen ($5,000) a month for expenses, including travel, but the spending is supposed to be for official travel, research and other costs related to activities of elected office. \n \n Nonomura, who does not belong to a major political party, was found to have gone to other day trips, racking up expenses, including visits to Tokyo and southwestern city of Fukuoka. \n \n Of his 195 day trips, ones to the ""onsen"" hot-springs resort town of Kinosaki, which lies outside his precinct, were the most frequent. \n \n The appalled public response is also due to the fact Japanese politicians here are generally staid. Outbursts are considered unsightly in a conservative culture that favors quiet, reserved personal styles. \n \n Nonomura\'s behavior has been widely seen as extreme, perhaps even a sign of illness. \n \n Japanese politicians have been forced to quit in the past after gaffes such as comments seen as sexist or discriminatory, or after getting embroiled in sex scandals. \n \n Calls to Nonomura\'s office and email queries asking for comment were not immediately answered. \n \n Hideaki Asada of the Hyogo Prefectural assembly office said the assembly was now on summer break, but the local government believes Nonomura owes the people an explanation about his spending habits. \n \n ""Many people are starting to demand that he resign,"" Asada said.

184,"[""Russian President Vladimir Putin has just imposed harsh new security measures around the resort town of Sochi, home to the 2014 Winter Olympics Games. The measures, which went largely unnoticed outside of Russia, may be the most extreme ever placed on an Olympic city. But as Putin attempts to present an image of stability, progress and prosperity to the rest of the world, his enemies are now accusing him of planning a gulag-style restricted area in and around Sochi. \n \n Our web monitoring of Russian-language internet traffic revealed that the accusers are anti-Russian Islamic insurgents in the North Caucasus, a restive region not far from Sochi. The rebels, who have a bloody history of terror attacks, have long made clear their intentions to target the Olympics. \n \n unprecedented compared to what? Since the mid-1980s, the Olympics have always been held in democratic countries--save for the 2008 Olympics in China. Those Olympics were previously the most extreme in their implementation of population control and security measures. Our research shows that the Sochi measures will be even more intense. \n \n The Kavkaz Center, a rebel news outlet, is now decrying the presidential decree that Putin signed on Monday, which will institute the stringent new security measures in Sochi beginning Jan. 7 and going until March 21, 2014. It creates a restricted zone of up to 80 miles around the city, and blocks road entry into the area for everyone except registered residents, emergency vehicles, railway passengers and those traveling with special government permission. That leaves train and air travel as the only viable modes of transport, which will allow the security services to strictly scrutinize the belongings and identities of incoming travelers. Since the Olympics take place between Feb. 7 and Feb. 23, that means the city will be on virtual lockdown for months simply for the sake of a two week sporting event. \n \n how we know We continually monitor postings from Kavkaz Center. While the site clearly supports terrorist groups such as the Caucasus Emirate, they often present correct facts, but add in commentary clearly slanted toward sympathy for jihadi causes. Their calling the security situation around Sochi unprecedented-though hyped up to win a propaganda victory against Russia-is actually a valid point. \n \n As part of the new measures, Putin also banned public protests and marches unrelated to the Olympics within the area. So protesting about gay rights certainly seems out of the question. Athletes won’t even be allowed to paint their fingernails in solidarity with their gay and lesbian counterparts. The Sochi protest prohibition comes on the heels of a country-wide law, passed last summer, that introduced fines of up to $10,000 or two years in prison for participating in a spontaneous demonstration. The alternative, applying for permission to assemble, can be rejected for any reason by the government. \n \n Who Runs Kavkaz Center? The site was created by Movladi Udugov, the Deputy Prime Minister and head propagandist for the former Chechen Republic of Ichkeria. Currently, he uses the site as part of information campaign to support the Caucasus Emirate and other pan-Islamic jihadi causes. \n \n The Kavkaz Center’s accusation that Putin is tightening a Stalin-like grip on Sochi (where Stalin famously had a dacha, or vacation home) is sure to stir the pot among the Islamic insurgency’s followers. The Center is considered an influential information source among Islamists, and we used specialized software to examine who follows its social media pages. Besides 8,000 Twitter followers, they have Facebook followers ranging from young women in Macedonia and Austria to men from France and the Republic of Georgia. \n \n To dig deeper about public opinion, we used specialized software to analyze Russian social media posts following the announcement of the restricted zone in Sochi. Here are some results: \n \n Доку Умаров пообещал аллахакбар в 2014 в Сочи. Если что-то взорвут – через год население С. Кавказа будет состоять лишь из российских солдат — Степан Грозный (@faraday_m) August 20, 2013 \n \n “Doku Umarov promised an Allahuakbar in 2014 in Sochi. If they blow something up—in a year the population of the North Caucasus will consist only of Russian soldiers.” \n \n Doku Umarov is the leader of the Caucasus Emirate terrorist group, which has threatened to attack the Games. \n \n Another social media user posts a link to an article about the vast security apparatus that Putin is employing. \n \n 40 тысяч полицейских будут обеспечивать безопасность на зимней Олимпиаде 2014 в Сочи http://t.co/bTrhekhNf7 — Новости Ставрополья (@bzfrmt_stav) August 20, 2013 \n \n “40 thousand policemen will provide security for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi.” \n \n That number is staggering when you consider that during the 2012 London Olympics, the British deployed only 20,000 soldiers and policemen, and the event was located in a much larger city. \n \n While some worry about Olympic terror attacks, the Russian propaganda machine keeps churning out positivity both on Facebook and its Russian equivalent, VKontakte. \n \n Expect nothing less You'll only hear positive news about Sochi coming from official Russian sources, who will continue to paint a rosy picture despite a myriad of shocking abuses that Vocativ has reported on. The international reputation of the Russian government, as well as President Putin's personal prestige, depends on the Games going off without a hitch. \n \n Using the official kids’ outreach Facebook page, “Mascots of the Olympic Games Sochi 2014,” the government published the cuddly image below. \n \n The description explains that the Olympic mascots are the best company for travel to the mountains. Although the new restrictions make this happy, stuffed-animal friendly scenario unlikely. \n \n The official VKontakte page, “Sochi Games 2014,” published the following image. \n \n From the above post, which says “200 days until the Paralympics in Sochi,” it seems that the Russian government is already getting amped about the next event in the sub-tropical city. (The Paralympics will take place in Sochi in March.) Paradise, it seems, can only be preserved by barbed wire."", 'Putin has spent $2 billion to keep the Winter Games safe from terrorist attacks like those in Volgograd last month. But even if Sochi is safe, Russia may not be. \n \n Why the new health-care bill may keep affordable care out of reach for some \n \n Russian President Vladimir Putin takes part in a friendly hockey match at The Bolshoy Ice Dome in Sochi, Russia, on Saturday. With the Olympics Games just a month away, Mr. Putin faces a difficult balancing act of both improving his international reputation and cracking down on terrorism after last month\'s bombings in Volgograd. \n \n With just one month to go before the Sochi Olympics open, Russia is launching the biggest security operation in Olympic history in a tense and largely secret effort to thwart an invisible enemy who has sworn to do everything possible to blight the prestigious international event with acts of mass terror. \n \n President Vladimir Putin traveled to Sochi last week to inspect the Olympic venue\'s $2 billion ""ring of steel"" defenses, which are to go into full operation tomorrow, exactly a month before the Games begin. Earlier he visited Volgograd, where two suicide bombings killed 34 people just before the New Year, and pledged additional measures to fight the terrorists until their ""complete annihilation."" \n \n He has won some support from the international community. In recent days announcements by US Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and British Prime Minister David Cameron have promised unspecified but deeper and more effective security cooperation with Russia in the run-up to the Olympics. ""We both want the Sochi Games to be a safe and secure Games,"" Mr. Cameron told journalists after a telephone conversation with Mr. Putin last Friday. \n \n Sochi\'s ""ring of steel"" is a zone about 60 miles long and 25 miles deep, in which the local population and visitors will be subjected to near total surveillance. The measures, according to security expert Mark Galeotti, include a garrison of about 25,000 special police, 8,000 interior troops, unknown numbers of plainclothes agents, special forces such as the ""Alpha"" anti-terrorist squad of the FSB (the successor to the KGB), and up to 30,000 regular troops to patrol the nearby borders with Georgia and the breakaway Georgian republic of Abkhazia. The skies will be full of Russian Air Force fighters and at least a dozen drones; ultra-modern S-400 and Pantsir-S anti-aircraft missiles capable of taking down any airborne threat will be deployed around the zone; and four of the Russian Navy\'s new Grachonok anti-saboteur patrol boats with teams of divers and special sonar equipment will range up and down the coast. \n \n Putin\'s gamble \n \n The stakes are high for Putin, who has invested Russia\'s prestige and $51 billion of mostly state cash in hosting the Winter Olympics. \n \n ""Putin\'s personal image is closely connected to the outcome of these Games. So I am absolutely sure that whatever can be done, will be done,"" says Gennady Gudkov, a former KGB security expert and ex-Duma deputy. \n \n It\'s not only Putin\'s international reputation that hangs in the balance. His domestic popularity rests largely on his image as a tough and uncompromising slayer of terrorists. \n \n He arrived in power in autumn 1999 amid a wave of deadly apartment bombings that killed hundreds, and used the public panic over the acts to launch a fresh war against Chechen militants, re-impose strong central government, and greatly beef up Russian security services. Since then, as both president and prime minister, Putin has faced intermittent waves of terrorism which he has often turned to his own advantage. For example, he seized upon the horrific 2004 school siege at Beslan to abolish local elections and further ratchet up the powers of security forces. \n \n But a long lull in serious terrorist attacks against Russia\'s heartland has been shattered by the Volgograd bombings, and in the nail-biting tensions of the coming weeks and months, Russians will be expecting him to ensure their security. \n \n ""This is Putin\'s basic promise to Russians, that he will make us safe,"" says Andrei Piontkovsky, a veteran Kremlin critic. \n \n ""If we look back over the past 15 years, we can see that he never really kept that pledge. We\'ve been hit over and over again,"" he says. ""But because of the Olympics, the whole world is watching. It may be that the extraordinary concentration of security resources in Sochi means that city is safe, but what about the rest of the country? Even Moscow? If terrorists strike anywhere, it will seriously undermine faith in Putin."" \n \n Finding balance \n \n Putin has taken several steps to restore world confidence in the Sochi Olympics, especially after President Barack Obama decided last month that neither he nor any other top US official would be attending the Games. Late last month, the Kremlin amnestied thousands of prisoners, including many of those regarded as ""political"" in the West. In Sochi last week, he relaxed a ban on all protests at the Games and designated a special area where demonstrations may be held with official permission. \n \n But keeping the Olympics safe – and without suffocating them in omnipresent security measures – is his greatest challenge, say experts. \n \n ""One of the purposes of terrorists is to sow uncertainty, ill temper, and chaos,"" says Alexei Makarkin, deputy director of the independent Center for Political Technologies in Moscow. \n \n ""The other side of that coin is the excessive tightening of security measures. This can pose big problems for athletes and spectators. How to secure the Games without creating onerous difficulties for fans – to make the event controllable and calm at the same time – is the biggest issue here. If the balance tips either way, the Games risk being a failure,"" he says. \n \n Unseen dangers? \n \n Some experts warn that in Russia, where a seething North Caucasus Islamic insurgency has been marked by shifting allegiances, and security services have been accused of murky dealings with terrorist networks, there may be unseen dangers ahead. \n \n Most reports focus on Chechen Islamist warlord Doku Umarov, who is presumably holed up somewhere in the rugged Caucasus Mountains, as the main threat. But Nikolai Petrov, a leading expert on Russia\'s regional politics and a professor at Moscow\'s Higher School of Economics, suggests that other forces, including members of pro-Moscow Chechen strongman Ramzan Kadyrov\'s retinue and rogue elements of Russia\'s own security services, may have a strong interest in aiding and abetting more acts of terrorism. \n \n ""When we examine these recent Volgograd attacks, it\'s hard not to notice how well planned and well organized they were. They seem to have enjoyed a lot of logistical help,"" he says. ""Kadyrov may have pacified Chechnya, but his funding from Moscow has been falling lately, and he may not expect to be given such a free hand in Chechnya after the Olympics are over. Some officials in the security forces have interests in private companies that provide security for airports and other transport infrastructure, and there are huge profits to be made in this field."" \n \n ""Terrorism has become a big business, and there are people with a real, material interest in keeping it going,"" Mr. Petrov adds. ""I know how strange this may sound. But we have seen such things before in Russia, and nothing should be taken for granted here.""', 'WASHINGTON (AP) — Take a White House state dinner and multiply it by 50.

Obama wasted little time highlighting his own personal connection to Africa during a brief toast. Guests were shuttled down to a massive tent erected on the South Lawn because the White House, as big as it is, does not have any rooms large enough that can hold the more-than-400 invited guests. \n \n ""I stand before you as the president of the United States, a proud American. I also stand before you as the son of a man from Africa,"" Obama said drawing applause. ""The blood of Africa runs through our family, so for us, the bonds between our countries, our continents are deeply personal."" \n \n He warmly recalled family visits to Kenya before he became president, as well as stops at historic sites in Ghana, Senegal and South Africa with his family while in office. And he offered a toast to ""the new Africa, the Africa that is rising and so full of promise."" \n \n Among the African leaders who arrived at the White House one at a time over the course of 90 minutes were President Salva Kiir of South Sudan, the world\'s newest country, and President Jacob Zuma of South Africa. Kiir wore a cowboy hat and waved dramatically to the media. \n \n Egypt\'s ambassador and Libya\'s foreign affairs minister also attended. Next to last to arrive was Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta, who has pleaded innocent to murder and other charges for his alleged role in organizing violence that left more than 1,000 people dead after Kenya\'s 2007 elections. The case is before an international criminal court, and Obama pointedly skipped visiting Kenya when he toured Africa with his family last summer. \n \n Vice President Joe Biden and his wife, Jill, who last month visited Zambia, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Sierra Leone, attended along with numerous other Obama administration officials, members of the delegations accompanying the African leaders, U.S. lawmakers and business leaders. \n \n There was political, Hollywood and athletic star power in the crowd, too. \n \n Former President Jimmy Carter, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and de Blasio\'s predecessor, Michael Bloomberg, a sponsor of a U.S.-Africa business forum where Obama spoke earlier Tuesday, mingled with guests before dinner. Also expected were actors Chiwetel Ejiofor, star of the Academy Award-winning drama ""12 Years a Slave,"" and Robert De Niro, NASCAR driver Jeff Gordon and Meb Keflezighi, the Eritrean-born American winner of this year\'s Boston Marathon. \n \n After greeting Obama and first lady Michelle Obama inside the White House, guests boarded chartered trolley cars for a ride to the South Lawn. Mrs. Obama wore a cream-colored dress by Prabal Gurung, one of her favorite designers, with cut-outs in both the front and the back and her hair swept up into a bun. \n \n The menu featured a largely American-style dinner with hints of Africa sprinkled throughout each of the four courses. \n \n Guests dined on chilled spiced tomato soup and socca crisps, which are made of chick peas; chopped farm-stand vegetable salad using produce from the first lady\'s garden; and grilled dry-aged Wagyu beef served with chermoula, a marinade used in North African cooking, sweet potatoes and coconut milk. \n \n Dessert was cappuccino fudge cake dressed with papaya scented with vanilla from Madagascar. American wines were also on the menu. \n \n Award-winning singer Lionel Richie provided the after-dinner entertainment. \n \n ""Tonight, we are going to have a party,"" Richie said as he took the stage and quoted from the lyrics to ""All Night Long,"" one of his top hits.

(AP) — Bernie Sanders and John Kasich picked up the most votes as the first ballots of the first-in-the-nation primary were cast early Tuesday. \n \n Sanders won over all four Democratic voters in the tiny town of Dixville, while Kasich sneaked past Donald Trump, 3-2, among Republicans. \n \n Under New Hampshire state law, communities with fewer than 100 voters can get permission to open their polls at midnight and close them as soon as all registered voters have cast their ballots. While that happened in three locations, Dixville traditionally gets most of the spotlight due to its media-friendly setup at the Balsams Grand Resort Hotel. \n \n Located about 20 miles from the Canadian border, Dixville exists as a town only for voting purposes. Almost all of its nine voters are employees of the hotel, which closed in 2011 but is currently undergoing a major overhaul under new owners. \n \n Former owner Neil Tillotson started the midnight voting tradition in 1960, likely at the suggestion of a news photographer looking for an advantage in getting his pictures out to newspapers ahead of his rivals. For many years, voters cast their ballots in individual booths in the hotel's posh ballot room. Because of the renovations, the nine current residents voted in another building on the property, the Hale House. \n \n In 2012, there was a tie for first place on the Republican side, with Mitt Romney and Jon Huntsman getting two votes apiece. All three Democrats voted for Obama. \n \n Hart's Location, about 80 miles south of Dixville, first hosted midnight voting in 1948 but gave it up after the 1964 election when residents grew weary of the late hours and media frenzy every four years. Energized with new blood, town residents revived the tradition in 1996, and this year, the town has 41 registered voters. \n \n Millsfield is also making a comeback this year, though it's unclear just when the town last voted at midnight or when its tradition started. According to a 1952 article in Time magazine, eight residents voted at midnight during the general election that year. This year, there are 22 registered voters.""]",2,"– An Australian artist has been buried alive with a bucket and a book, but don't worry—they plan to dig him out Sunday. More than 3,000 people watched Thursday as Mike Parr, 73, descended a ladder into a 25-foot-square box under a road in Hobart, Australia, for a performance piece called ""Underneath the Bitumen the Artist,"" the New York Times reports. The confinement was billed as a memorial to victims of totalitarian violence and British colonialism in Australia, notes ABC News Australia, but many assumed it was about local Aboriginal Tasmanian history being buried—particularly the 19th-century Black War in which British settlers nearly wiped out Indigenous Tasmanians. And that sparked a few fighting words. ""It is a bit insulting, really,"" says Tasmanian Aboriginal Center CEO Heather Sculthorpe, per Pedestrian. ""If they have any interest in telling the Aboriginal story then they should have put it out there for Aboriginal people to do it."" But an Aboriginal activist called Parr ""courageous"" and said that ""we support this bloke."" Meanwhile, Parr sits below Hobart traffic with his thermos and a microphone that lets his team monitor his breathing. The apparent risk is old hat for Parr, who in past works has nailed his arm to a wall, sewn his mouth shut, and stayed in a glass cage for 10 days with only water to survive.

186,"['James Cook University scientists have helped invent a clever technique to tell black leopards apart - a trick that may end up saving their skins. \n \n Scientists from JCU in Australia and others have been studying the leopards on the Malay Peninsula - where almost all of the big cats are jet black. \n \n Experts have no idea why the leopards are black and, until recently, could not tell them apart, hindering research and conservation efforts. \n \n But researchers have now devised a simple method to solve the problem by manipulating the mechanism of automatic cameras. \n \n ""Most automatic cameras have an infrared flash, but it\'s only activated at night"", said Dr Gopalasamy Reuben Clements from JCU. ""However, by blocking the camera\'s light sensor, we can fool the camera into thinking it\'s night even during the day, so it always flashes."" \n \n With the infrared flash firing, the seemingly black leopards suddenly showed complex patterns of spotting. These spots could be used to distinguish different animals, and help estimate the population size of the species. \n \n The researchers tested this method in the north east of Peninsular Malaysia. ""We found we could accurately identify 94% of the animals,"" said Dr Clements, who also works with a local research institute from Universiti Malaysia Terengganu. ""This will allow us to study and monitor this population over time, which is critical for its conservation."" \n \n The researchers want to use their new method to study black leopards in other parts of Peninsular Malaysia where there is abundant prey but few leopards to be seen. It\'s thought widespread poaching is to blame. \n \n ""Many dead leopards bearing injuries inflicted by wire snares have been discovered in Malaysia,"" said Distinguished Professor William Laurance from James Cook University. He said that leopard skins and body parts are increasingly showing up in wildlife trading markets in places such as on the Myanmar-China border. \n \n At the same time, suitable leopard habitats are disappearing faster in Malaysia than perhaps anywhere else in the world, as forests are felled for timber and replaced with oil palm and rubber plantations. \n \n ""Understanding how leopards are faring in an increasingly human-dominated world is vital,"" said Laurie Hedges from the University of Nottingham - Malaysia, lead author of a study on the cats just published in Journal of Wildlife Management. ""This new approach gives us a novel tool to help save this unique and endangered animal."" \n \n Leopards, found from the frozen forests of Russia to the scorching sands of the Kalahari Desert, are the most widely distributed large cat on earth. Their iconic spotted coat has been admired and coveted by humans for millennia. \n \n The black leopards of Peninsular Malaysia are extremely rare. ""This is perhaps the only known example of a wild mammal with virtually an entire population composed of black individuals,"" said Laurie Hedges. \n \n Black coloration--also known as \'melanism\'--is found in some mammal species, especially big cats, where individuals that normally have patterns or colours in their coat are instead completely black. However, scientists have no idea why it predominates in the Malay Peninsula. \n \n ###', 'A magnitude 4.4 earthquake rattled Southern California on Tuesday night.

The rare leopards, an endangered species living on the Malay Peninsula, have been hard to identify because each one appeared the same—until now. The researchers discovered that the big cats actually have complex designs of spotting when viewed through an infrared flash, according to a press release. ""Most automatic cameras have an infrared flash, but it's only activated at night,"" says a researcher on the project. ""However, by blocking the camera's light sensor, we can fool the camera into thinking it's night even during the day, so it always flashes."" The spots make it easier for humans to identify and track black leopards, which should save more leopard lives. ""Understanding how leopards are faring in an increasingly human-dominated world is vital,"" says lead author Laurie Hedges. Few leopards actually live on the Malay Peninsula, perhaps due to poaching, while wire snares are killing them and wildlife markets are selling leopard body parts and skins. The rapid elimination of Malaysian forests is also depriving leopards of suitable habitats. The black panther—or leopard in Asia and Africa—has long had a ""mythical aura"" dating back to Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book and Stan Lee's creation of the Black Panther superhero, Mongabay.com reports. Another neat fact: The black leopard is ""perhaps the only known example of a wild mammal with virtually an entire population composed of black individuals,"" says Hedges.

187,"['The scene of collapsed houses along 400 block of Daly Street in South Philadelphia on July 29, 2013. (LUKE RAFFERTY / Staff Photographer) \n \n Eight people, including two children, were injured this morning after an apparent gas explosion caused a South Philadelphia rowhome undergoing extensive renovation to collapse. Two other homes were damaged and as many as 25 people were evacuated on the 400 block of Daly Street, between 4th and 5th, where the collapse occurred. Police said an explosion was reported in the tightly-packed Whitman neighborhood at 11:09 a.m. Rubble from the collapsed home spilled into the street. The property is owned by a development corporation called SCK Investments LLC, based in Pennsylvania and incorporated in Delaware, according to public records. SCK Investments executive secretary, Steve Finney, said ""no comment"" when reached by phone and hung up. A message left for SCK President Cathy Finney-Hughes was not immediately returned. SCK Investments bought the property in March for $65,000, according to records with the city Office of Property Assessment. \n \n Fire Department Battalion Chief Mike Richey said that when emergency responders arrived in the minutes after the call, they found seven people injured and several houses damaged by the explosion. Initially, officials evacuated 22 houses adjacent to the mid-block collapse. Utility crews cut gas and power to houses surrounding the scene. \n \n Six victims were taken to Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in stable condition. One child was taken to the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in stable condition, and a contractor performing the renovations was taken to the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania in critical condition. The contractor, officials said, was working on a water heater. \n \n Rebecca Swanson, a spokeswoman for the Department of Licenses and Inspections, said that renovation permits had been given for the house at 428 Daly St., where the explosion is believed to have originated, The incident remains under investigation, and Swanson added that L&I was working to gather more information about exactly what was going on with the property at the time of the blast. \n \n The city’s website shows four permits for the property. The permits — two for major renovations, one for a complete electrical rewiring and one for installing a furnace and duct work — were issued earlier this year. \n \n Linda Lyons, 60, who lives on a block adjacent to the explosion and collapse, said she could feel the whole room shaking when the blow happened, and that the electrical lines outside her house began to spark and make a popping noise. \n \n “I flew into the house,” Lyons said. “I was scared to death.” \n \n She immediately called 9-1-1. Her son, Mike Lyons, 27, who was in the backyard at the time of the explosion said he felt a whoosh and saw smoke coming from at least one of the houses. \n \n Around 1 p.m., the block of Daly remained cordoned off, and debris from the leveled houses littered the middle of the block. \n \n Residents of nearby Wolf Street who had been evacuated were allowed back into their houses, while the rest of the evacuees were sent to the Taggart School not far from the scene. The Red Cross of Southeastern Pennsylvania was at the school, setting up supplies for those evacuated. \n \n Scott Snelling, who lives about two blocks from where the explosion happened, said a neighbor smelled gas near their houses last week and contacted the gas company. Snelling said the gas was shut off for a few days. \n \n Joseph Szymborski, who lives a block away from the incident site, says he ran to the home and helped victims escape from their front window. \n \n ""Just making sure everyone\'s out, everyone\'s safe,"" he said. ""That\'s all I was thinking."" \n \n The people in the home were covered in soot from the debris, he said. \n \n Leonard Gilbert, who lives a few blocks away, called the incident ""devastating"" and said he went to the site after be heard about the incident on a police scanner. \n \n Gilbert said it was worrisome that the collapse might have been caused by a gas explosion. \n \n ""Natural gas is nothing to play with,"" he said, adding that he was concerned the gas lines under is own basement ""could take out an entire city block."" \n \n -- \n \n Check back for details as they develop. \n \n Staff writer Brian X.

He also said the Justice Department had failed to demonstrate that collecting the information had helped to head off terrorist attacks. \n \n Text Size - \n \n + \n \n reset Feinstein, Chambliss defend NSA Politicians sound off on Snowden \n \n Acting on a lawsuit brought by conservative legal activist Larry Klayman, Leon issued a preliminary injunction barring the NSA from collecting so-called metadata pertaining to the Verizon accounts of Klayman and one of his clients. However, the judge stayed the order to allow for an appeal. \n \n (Also on POLITICO: NSA probe: Snowden can still do damage) \n \n “I cannot imagine a more ‘indiscriminate’ and ‘arbitrary invasion’ than this systematic and high-tech collection and retention of personal data on virtually every single citizen for purposes of querying it and analyzing it without judicial approval,” wrote Leon, an appointee of President George W. Bush. \n \n The preliminary injunction Leon granted Monday does not require him to make a definitive ruling on the constitutional questions in the case, but does take account of which side he believes is more likely to prevail. \n \n Leon’s 68-page opinion is the first significant legal setback for the NSA’s surveillance program since it was disclosed in June in news stories based on leaks from former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. For seven years, the metadata program has been approved repeatedly by numerous judges on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court and found constitutional by at least one judge sitting in a criminal case. \n \n (WATCH: Boehner says Edward Snowden is a ‘traitor’) \n \n The Justice Department persuaded those courts that the collection of information on the time and length of calls, as well as the numbers called, did not amount to a search under the Fourth Amendment because that information is routinely available to telephone companies for billing purposes and is shared with those firms voluntarily. \n \n Government lawyers and the judges who found the NSA program legal pointed to a 1979 Supreme Court ruling, Smith v. Maryland, which found no search warrant was needed by police to install a device which recorded the numbers dialed on a particular phone line. \n \n But Leon said the three-decade-old precedent was not applicable to a program like the NSA’s because of its sophistication and because telephone use has become far more intense in recent years. \n \n (Also on POLITICO: Military keeps cyber control at NSA) \n \n “The ubiquity of phones has dramatically altered the quantity of information that is now available and, more importantly, what that information can tell the Government about people’s lives,” the judge wrote. “I cannot possibly navigate these uncharted Fourth Amendment waters using as my North Star a case that predates the rise of cell phones.” \n \n The judge went on to conclude that the searches involved in the NSA metadata program were likely not permissible under the Fourth Amendment in part because there was little evidence the program has actually prevented terrorism. \n \n “I have significant doubts about the efficacy of the metadata collection program as a means of conducting time-sensitive investigations in cases involving imminent threats of terrorism,” Leon wrote. “The government does not cite a single instance in which analysis of the NSA’s bulk metadata collection actually stopped an imminent attack, or otherwise aided the Government in achieving any objective that was time-sensitive in nature.” \n \n Edward Snowden himself praised the decision.“I acted on my belief that the NSA’s mass surveillance programs would not withstand a constitutional challenge, and that the American public deserved a chance to see these issues determined by open courts. Today, a secret program authorized by a secret court was, when exposed to the light of day, found to violate Americans’ rights. It is the first of many.” \n \n (Also on POLITICO: W.H. declines to split NSA, Cyber Command) \n \n The judge’s ruling was issued just before White House press secretary Jay Carney took the podium for the daily press briefing. Carney said he was unaware of the decision and he referred inquiries to the Justice Department. \n \n “We are reviewing the court’s decision,” DOJ spokesman Andrew Ames said. \n \n Similar lawsuits challenging the program are pending in at least three other federal courts around the country. In addition, criminal defendants are beginning to challenge the program after the Justice Department disclosed it had played a role in investigating their cases. \n \n Critics of the NSA program leapt on Leon’s decision as evidence that the legal foundation of the surveillance effort is deeply flawed. \n \n “The ruling underscores what I have argued for years: The bulk collection of Americans’ phone records conflicts with Americans’ privacy rights under the U.S. Constitution and has failed to make us safer,” Sen. Mark Udall (D-Colo.) said in a statement urging passage of legislation ending the so-called bulk collection program. “We can protect our national security without trampling our constitutional liberties,” he added. \n \n At a hearing last month, Leon said he knew that his decision would be far from the last word on the issue, which is almost certain to wind up at the Supreme Court. \n \n However, he added some flair to his opinion Monday, referring at one point to the Beatles and at another to Federalist Papers author James Madison, who later became president. \n \n “Surely, such a program infringes on ‘that degree of privacy’ that the Founders enshrined in the Fourth Amendment. Indeed, I have little doubt that the author of our Constitution, James Madison, who cautioned us to beware ‘the abridgement of freedom of the people by gradual and silent encroachments by those in power’ would be aghast,” the judge wrote. \n \n Follow @politico']",2,"– At least six people were reportedly injured in south Philadelphia today, after a home collapsed after a possible explosion, the Philadelphia Inquirer reports.

188,"['BBC Elizabeth Hamel (left) meets Ann Hunt, her long-lost twin sister. \n \n These two peas are back in the same pod—after 78 years apart. \n \n For most of her life, Ann Hunt believed she was an only child, an orphan adopted by a kind mother in Aldershot, UK. She had no idea that thousands of miles away, in Albany, Ore., her twin sister Elizabeth Hamel was waiting to find her. \n \n The 78-year-old women were reunited on Thursday in Los Angeles, BBC reports—and they connected instantly. \n \n ""Lizzie, Lizzie, how lovely,"" said Hunt. \n \n ""How lovely to see you in the flesh,"" said Hamel, hugging her long-lost sister tightly. \n \n The women are now the world’s longest separated pair of twins, according to Guinness World Records. Because of how long they’ve been apart, some researchers believe the twins could shed light on the nature vs. nurture debate. \n \n Psychologist Dr. Nancy Segal, a prominent twin researcher, will be studying the women to see how their circumstances and the DNA they inherited had an effect on their personalities. \n \n ""What was it in their life that caused the differences? If they\'re fraternal, it could be character as well as circumstance,” Segal said. “We want to get a comprehensive overview of their lives, their abilities, their interests, and put it all together as an important case study.” \n \n The twins were born Elizabeth Ann Lamb and Patricia Susan Lamb on February 28, 1936. Their mother, Alice Alexandra Patience Lamb, was a domestic cook who worked in Aldershot. She had a steamy affair with a military man named Peters and ended up pregnant out of wedlock. When Peters left her, Alice was placed in an incredibly difficult position. \n \n Keeping her kids would mean losing her job. It was a scandal for an unmarried woman to have children. And live-in servants were rarely allowed to keep their kids in the house, since it would mean another mouth to feed. \n \n BBC Ann Hunt still lives in Aldershot, England, where she was born. \n \n ""In those days it was a very hush-hush affair,"" said Hamel, the twin from Albany. ""We were both illegitimate, which was very difficult. My mother was a servant living in a home. It was very frightening."" \n \n Alice decided to give her daughters up for adoption. Hunt was adopted by a Gladys and Hector Wilson, a couple who lived in Aldershot, and given the name Ann. \n \n It was harder for Alice to find a place for her older twin, Elizabeth. \n \n ""I had curvature of the spine, which in those days was something which made a person unadoptable,"" Hamel says. ""We were both going to be adopted but when mother found out about the curvature of the spine, she decided to keep me."" \n \n But because of the stigma of being unmarried, Alice couldn’t keep her daughter too close. \n \n For the first few years of her life, Hamel lived with caretakers while Alice worked as a cook at a Berkhamsted manor. Alice would regularly visit her child on her half-day off. When she popped by one day for an unannounced visit, Alice was shocked to find her daughter dressed in rags. \n \n ""She was so upset,"" said Hamel. ""She told me: \'I\'d made you beautiful dresses and smocked them by hand.\'"" \n \n The outraged mother decided to bring Hamel home to live in the servant’s quarters. When she was 15, her mother revealed that she had a twin. Hamel remembers seeing the adoption papers, but she didn’t know how to find her sister. \n \n Hamel eventually joined the Women’s Royal Naval Service. She met her husband Jim—an American—on a blind date in Malta. They were married in 1964 and stayed together for 48 years, until he died in 2012. \n \n BBC Elizabeth Hamel lives in Albany, Ore. \n \n Hunt, on the other hand, had no idea that she even had a sister. She was 14 when she found out she was adopted. She doesn’t think her adoptive parents knew she was a twin. \n \n Somehow, Hunt was also happily married to a man named Jim, until she became a widow. \n \n It was Hunt’s youngest daughter, Samantha Stacey, who started the hunt that would eventually lead to her twin. The genealogy enthusiast started looking into Alice Lamb’s history. In 2013, she found out that her grandmother had married a man named George Burton at the age of 49. She tracked down Burton’s grandson, who told her “Oh yes, Alice has a daughter in the U.S."" \n \n From then, it wasn’t too hard to locate Hamel in Oregon. The sisters were soon chatting on Skype. \n \n ""I was over the moon, I couldn\'t speak,"" Hunt says. ""I let Elizabeth speak mostly, I had to pinch myself because I realized, I\'ve got a sibling, a sister. It\'s so wonderful, I\'m not on my own any more. I\'ve got no words to say. I\'m so happy — I have Elizabeth."" \n \n The twins are now convinced that they share the same mannerisms. Hamel says her sister looks just like her mom, Alice. And both of them love to be silly in front of a camera. \n \n After participating in a two-day study in Los Angeles, the newly reunited twins plan to return to Hamel’s home in Oregon for a party. \n \n ""I feel like I\'ve known Liz all my life now,"" Hunt says.', 'Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) \n \n Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) \n \n Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) \n \n Cardi B chose twerking over her court date. \n \n The 26-year-old rapper appeared to be shooting a new music video in Miami on Monday instead of making an appearance in New York criminal court to face charges of assault and reckless endangerment over a fight that took place at Angels Strip Club in Flushing on August 29. There, Cardi allegedly ordered her crew to attack bartending sisters Baddie Gi and Jade because she thought they’d slept with her husband, rapper Offset. \n \n Instead, in a series of paparazzi photos, the “I Like It” singer can be seen frolicking in the surf with her friends while covered in body paint made to make her look like a tiger, dancing on a pole set up along the shore and pouring champagne on the butts of a number of twerking dancers aboard a huge yacht. \n \n The judge of Cardi’s case warned the pop star, whose real name is Belcalis Almanzar, that she risked arrest if she did not show up on Monday, but subsequently offered a new appearance date of Dec. 7. \n \n Her lawyer Jeff Kern informed the judge, “As you probably know she is a fairly notable hip-hop artist.

Credit: Jeff Chiu / Associated Press', 'Boston (CNN) -- They might have fulfilled every immigrant\'s dream, fleeing a war-torn part of the world and settling into a quiet life in America, one buoyed by aspiration and a will to succeed. \n \n Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, loved to box. And he was talented. At 196 pounds, he represented New England as a heavyweight in the National Golden Gloves boxing tournament. He wanted to make it on an Olympic team. \n \n His brother, Dzhokar, 19, graduated in 2011 from Cambridge Rindge & Latin School, the alma mater of actors Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. The city awarded Dzhokar a $2,500 scholarship. And he, too, was an athlete -- a wrestler. He was named student athlete of the month and made the state playoffs. \n \n But something went wrong somewhere. \n \n This week, the brothers Tsarnaev became the target of a massive manhunt after police identified them as the suspects behind Monday\'s Boston Marathon bombings. \n \n Tamerlan died early Friday after a night of ferocious gun battles. The world watched live on television Friday night as police laid siege to Watertown, Massachusetts, and finally captured Dzhokar. \n \n It was unclear what might have motivated the brothers to commit the heinous crime they are suspected of carrying out. All day Friday, reporters sought out people who knew them, trying to understand one thing: Why? \n \n What unfolded was a story typical of the American immigrant narrative: A family originally from the Russian republic of Chechnya fled the brutal wars in their homeland in the 1990s. They moved to neighboring Russian republics before at last arriving in the United States. \n \n The youngest, Dzhokar, came first with his parents, according to his aunt, Maret Tsarnaev. The older son, Tamerlan, was initially left behind with his two sisters. \n \n Eventually, they were reunited -- a family of six whose American journey contained elements of a struggle to fit in and success in making a new life. \n \n Analysis: Older suspect grew increasingly religious \n \n Hints of unhappiness \n \n Another familiar narrative also emerged Friday: a high-profile crime followed by a crusade to find out who did it. First, there were photographs, then names attached to the images. And shock. \n \n Friends and acquaintances of the Tsarnaev brothers expressed disbelief. The two men were nice, friendly. Quiet. The kind of guys you\'d never even notice or look at twice if you passed them on the street. \n \n Their aunt spoke with Canada\'s CTV and described the boys\' childhood as perfect. Their father, Anzor, was a loving, soft-hearted man. She said he and his wife, Zubeidat, have moved back to Dagestan, which borders Chechnya. \n \n Dzhokar came to America on July 1, 2002, as a tourist and asked for asylum, a federal official told CNN. He was naturalized as a U.S. citizen on September 11 last year. \n \n There was some dispute over when his older brother arrived. The U.S. official said he came four years later on September 6, 2006, and held a permanent resident visa. But another federal official said Tamerlan first entered the United States on July 19, 2003. \n \n Alyssa Lindley Kilzer said she often visited the apartment at 410 Norfolk St. in Cambridge, where the Tsarnaevs lived. Kilzer used to get facials from Zubeidat at a local spa but, after she was fired, Kilzer began going to her house. \n \n She wrote about her experience on her Tumblr blog and said the staircase was crowded with shoes and the house was filled with the noise of arguments, cooking and other household chores. It was hardly spa-like but Kilzer thought Zubeidat gave great facials. \n \n But she became increasingly uncomfortable going to the apartment because of Zubeidat\'s growing religious fervor. \n \n ""She started quoting conspiracy theories, telling me that she thought 9-11 was purposefully created by the American government to make America hate Muslims,"" she wrote. \n \n Zubeidat told her: ""It\'s real. My son knows all about it. You can read it on the Internet."" \n \n Kilzer said she met Tamerlan only once -- he wasn\'t friendly, she thought. \n \n He was a dapper dresser and drove a Mercedes, according to an online photo gallery titled ""Will Box for Passport."" \n \n ""I\'m dressed European style,"" Tamarlan said in a caption accompanying a photo of white leather shoes. \n \n FBI agents interviewed bombing suspect in 2011 \n \n Photographer Johannes Hirn shot images of Tamerlan at the Wai Kru Mixed Martial Arts Center on Brighton Street in Cambridge. That\'s where he trained before the Golden Gloves. \n \n He was a good boxer, said Gene McCarthy from the Sommerville Boxing Club, who\'d coached Tamerlan since he was 16. \n \n He was more than 6-feet tall, with long arms and determination written all over him. Once, he fought in a New England championship match even though he had the flu and fever blisters covered his lips. He won. \n \n Tamerlan had been boxing since he was a kid -- his father began training him while they were still living in the Caucasus region. \n \n His younger brother started coming to the gym from the time he was 10, McCarthy said. Dzhokar followed Tamerlan around like a puppy. He\'d be just behind him, doing calisthenics. \n \n Tamerlan told Hirn, the photographer, that he gave up drinking alcohol and smoking in accordance with Muslim values. His aunt said he had become more devout a few years ago and started praying five times a day. \n \n His mother told Russian TV channel RT that her oldest son embraced Islam but never spoke of anything extreme; never said he was on the side of jihad. Her son, she said, would never keep secrets from her. She would\'ve known had he been involved in unsavory activities. \n \n However, she said the FBI was checking on him, following his moves on the Internet. \n \n ""How could this happen? They were controlling every step of him, now they are saying this is a terrorist act,"" she said Friday. \n \n FBI agents interviewed Tamerlan two years ago and looked at his travel history, checked databases and searched Web postings, but found no connection with terrorist groups, an FBI official told CNN. \n \n Tamerlan traveled to Sheremetyevo, Russia, in January 2012, according to travel records provided by a U.S. official. He returned six months later, those documents show. \n \n A YouTube page in his name had links to Islamic websites, videos from a radical Australian preacher and rap music. \n \n What their family has to say \n \n He had quit college, gotten married and had a daughter two years ago, said his aunt and father. \n \n In an interview Friday with the Russian national TV network Zvezda in Dagestan, Anzor Tsarnaev said his sons had been framed. He said he had been trying to call Dzhokar but his phone is switched off. He\'d spoken with Tamerlan the day before. He wanted to make sure Tamerlan was taking care of his brother; that he was studying hard. \n \n This was Anzor\'s belief: that if his sons did not get an education, they would be left to toiling their entire lives. \n \n But there were hints that all did not sit well for Tamerlan in his new country. \n \n He said this during the photo shoot with Hirn: ""I don\'t have a single American friend. I don\'t understand them."" \n \n And in 2009, Tamerlan, then 22, was arrested for domestic assault and battery after allegedly assaulting his girlfriend, according to Cambridge Police records cited by the website spotcrime.com. \n \n \'I cried ... when they named him\' \n \n Dzhokar\'s friends included Torrie Martinez, 20. \n \n Friday, Martinez stood on Cambridge Street looking down Norfolk Street, where the Tsarnaev brothers made their home. Martinez used to catch the city bus with Dzhokar every day to school and was on the wrestling team with him. \n \n ""I wish I could say he was a bad kid,"" said Martinez, still trying to absorb the news. ""But he was a nice kid from what I knew of him. I talked with him on a daily basis. I practiced with him."" \n \n He was a sophomore when he met Dzhokar, who was a year behind him. They talked about stuff high school boys talk about; it never got too personal. Martinez didn\'t know Dzhokar was Chechen. \n \n And they talked wrestling. ""He was a smaller kid, but he did well for his weight class,"" Martinez said. \n \n A smile appears beneath his scruffy, unshaven face. \n \n ""Between me and him, I would pin him."" \n \n Now he wished he\'d whupped him a little harder. The smile vanishes from Martinez\'s face. \n \n ""I cried ... when they named him."" \n \n It will be hard to trust anyone again. \n \n Larry Aaronson, a former teacher at Cambridge Rindge and Latin, said he had taken pictures of Dzhokar wrestling. \n \n ""There is nothing in his character, in his deportment, in his demeanor that would suggest anything remotely capable of any of these things that he is now suspected of doing,"" Aaronson said. \n \n ""He was so grateful to be here, he was so grateful to be at the school,"" he said. ""He was compassionate, he was caring, he was jovial."" \n \n He described Dzhokar, whom he saw in the neighborhood nestled between Harvard and MIT a few weeks ago, as ""a lovely, lovely kid."" \n \n Construction worker Joey Barbaso, 50, has lived in the neighborhood since he was 5. His pants are worn from hard work and stained from years of paint. That\'s the kind of people who live here -- along with college students. \n \n ""It\'s just, I dunno,"" he said. ""You never know who you\'re living next to."" \n \n Robin Young, host of radio\'s ""Here and Now,"" said Dzhokar was her nephew\'s best friend. She called him a beautiful boy. \n \n But now he was a man despised by many. \n \n As Boston reeled, younger suspect partied \n \n Tweeting even after the bombings \n \n Dzhokar had been more public about his life than his brother. More people have stepped forward with accounts of their relationships with him than about Tamerlan. \n \n Dzhokar had a page on the Russian equivalent of Facebook on which he described his worldview as Islam. \n \n Active on Twitter. ""Ain\'t no love in the heart of the city. Stay safe people,"" he tweeted just hours after the bombings. \n \n Tuesday, he called ""fake"" a story about a woman who died in Monday\'s bombings and was found by her boyfriend who was planning to propose. \n \n His friend, Giovanni, who wanted only his first name used, said Dzhokar was even joking on Twitter about ""how he had like a dream about eating a cheeseburger and then he was like, \'And the next day, what did I have next?\' \n \n ""And I responded (on Twitter) in a joking way, \'A hot dog?\' \n \n ""And here I am, like, having a conversation with this guy not knowing what he was doing or what he did."" \n \n Giovanni said he played video games with Dzhokar, but hadn\'t seen him in person since January. He said his friend had told him he was engaged to be married, even showing him a photo of his supposed fiancée on his phone. \n \n ""He was always just quiet, quiet in a nice (way),"" Giovanni said. ""You just wouldn\'t suspect that he\'d do something so messed up."" \n \n And he said Dzhokar was particular about his identity. \n \n ""He used to tell us he\'s the only Chechen ... we\'d ever come across,"" Giovanni said. ""Sometimes they\'d call him Russian and he\'d always correct me."" \n \n He said he didn\'t know much about Tamerlan; only that Dzhokar had said his older brother was a boxer. \n \n ""A year ago when I met him ... to think. I had no idea I\'d be friending such a messed up person. You just think, \'Oh, he seems nice, he seems innocent.\'"" \n \n Dzhokar worked for a time as a lifeguard at a pool at Harvard University, said George McMasters, who hired him about 2½ years ago. \n \n McMasters was impressed with Dzhokar\'s work ethic. \n \n ""He showed up on time, he watched the water, he rotated from position to position fine, got along well with others."" \n \n ""He seemed like a very quiet, unassuming young man,"" McMasters said. ""It is very surprising and shocking to see the destruction that he has brought to the city."" \n \n Last year, McMasters was deployed to Afghanistan with the Army National Guard and, when he returned to the pool job in August, Dhzokar was no longer on the staff or the schedule, he said. \n \n Manhunt began with intense firefight in dark street \n \n \'Losers\' \n \n Not everyone had good things to say. The harshest comments Friday came from the brothers\' uncle. \n \n Ruslan Tsarni told reporters outside his home in Montgomery County, Maryland, that he had not seen the Tsarnaev family since December 2005 and last spoke with them in 2009. \n \n Asked what might have motivated the people who did the attack, he said: ""Being losers; hatred to those who were able to settle themselves. These are the only reasons I can imagine."" \n \n Though the family is Muslim, their religion played no role in the attacks, the uncle insisted. \n \n ""Anything else to do with religion, with Islam, it\'s a fraud, it\'s a fake,"" he said. \n \n He described the family as peace-loving, ethnic Chechens. \n \n ""Somebody radicalized them, but it\'s not my brother, who just moved back to Russia, who spent his life bringing bread to their table, fixing cars,"" he said. ""My family had nothing to do with that family. Of course, we\'re ashamed, yes, we\'re ashamed they\'re children of my brother."" \n \n Tsarni said he noticed changes in the religious views of Tamerlan Tsarnaev as far back as 2009. He recalled a 2009 phone conversation where in response to some life advice he had given, Tsarnaev called him an ""infidel."" The young man also told his uncle he was not concerned about work or studies because God had a plan for him. \n \n The Brothers Tsarnaev, said Tsarni, had brought shame on the Chechen people. \n \n CNN\'s Wayne Drash reported from Boston.

190,"['Being bullied as a child can result in long-lasting psychological scars for both boys and girls, according to a U.S. study. \n \n Reviewing more than two decades of data, the researchers found that bullied children, regardless of their sex, face an elevated risk of developing anxiety disorders, depression and suicidal thoughts in later years. \n \n “We were surprised at how profoundly bullying affects a person’s long-term functioning,” the lead researcher, William Copeland, a clinical psychologist and epidemiologist at Duke University in Durham, N.C., said in a statement. \n \n “This psychological damage doesn’t just go away because a person grew up and is no longer bullied. This is something that stays with them. If we can address this now, we can prevent a whole host of problems down the road.” \n \n An earlier study, carried out in Finland, came to slightly different conclusions. Bullied boys seem to suffer few long-term problems, but the girls showed evidence of lasting psychological harm. The Finnish study relied on health-system data, but did not have access to individual case histories. \n \n The U.S. researchers said their new study, published Wednesday in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, is “most definitive to date in establishing the long-term psychological effects of bullying.” \n \n They said they used “a much richer data set” than the Finnish researchers. In particular, the analysis is based on a sample of 1,420 children from North Carolina. At the time of recruitment into the study, the kids were either 9, 11 or 13 years of age. The children and their parents, or caregivers, were interviewed each year until the youngsters turned 16, and then periodically thereafter. At each assessment, they were asked if the kids had been bullied in the preceding months, or had bullied others. \n \n A total of 421 participants reported being bullied at least once. And 198 youngsters admitted bullying others: 112 were bullies only, while 86 were both bullies and victims. \n \n Of the original 1,420 children, about 1,270 were followed into adulthood. \n \n “Those who said they had been bullied, plus those who were both victims and aggressors, were at higher risk for psychiatric disorders compared with those with no history of being bullied. The young people who were only victims had higher levels of depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, generalized anxiety, panic disorder and agoraphobia,” according to the study. \n \n What’s more, the study found that those who had been bullies were at increased risk of antisocial personality disorders.', 'Victims of bullying at school, and bullies themselves, are more likely to experience psychiatric problems in childhood, studies have shown. Now researchers have found that elevated risk of psychiatric trouble extends into adulthood, sometimes even a decade after the intimidation has ended. \n \n The new study, published in the journal JAMA Psychiatry on Wednesday, is the most comprehensive effort to date to establish the long-term consequences of childhood bullying, experts said. \n \n “It documents the elevated risk across a wide range of mental health outcomes and over a long period of time,” said Catherine Bradshaw, an expert on bullying and a deputy director of the Center for the Prevention of Youth Violence at Johns Hopkins University, which was not involved in the study. \n \n “The experience of bullying in childhood can have profound effects on mental health in adulthood, particularly among youths involved in bullying as both a perpetuator and a victim,” she added. \n \n The study followed 1,420 subjects from Western North Carolina who were assessed four to six times between the ages of 9 and 16. Researchers asked both the children and their primary caregivers if they had been bullied or had bullied others in the three months before each assessment. Participants were divided into four groups: bullies, victims, bullies who also were victims, and children who were not exposed to bullying at all. \n \n Participants were assessed again in young adulthood — at 19, 21 and between 24 and 26 — using structured diagnostic interviews. \n \n Researchers found that victims of bullying in childhood were 4.3 times more likely to have an anxiety disorder as adults, compared to those with no history of bullying or being bullied. \n \n Bullies who were also victims were particularly troubled: they were 14.5 times more likely to develop panic disorder as adults, compared to those who did not experience bullying, and 4.8 times more likely to experience depression. Men who were both bullies and victims were 18.5 times more likely to have had suicidal thoughts in adulthood, compared to the participants who had not been bullied or perpetuators. Their female counterparts were 26.7 times more likely to have developed agoraphobia, compared to children not exposed to bullying. \n \n Bullies who were not victims of bullying were 4.1 times more likely to have antisocial personality disorder as adults than those never exposed to bullying in their youth. \n \n The effects persisted even after the researchers accounted for pre-existing psychiatric problems or other factors that might have contributed to psychiatric disorders, like physical or sexual abuse, poverty and family instability. \n \n “We were actually able to say being a victim of bullying is having an effect a decade later, above and beyond other psychiatric problems in childhood and other adversities,” said William E. Copeland, lead author of the study and an associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Duke University Medical Center. \n \n Bullying is not a harmless rite of passage, but inflicts lasting psychiatric damage on a par with certain family dysfunctions, Dr. Copeland said. “The pattern we are seeing is similar to patterns we see when a child is abused or maltreated or treated very harshly within the family setting,” he said. \n \n One limitation of the study is that bullying was not analyzed for frequency, and the researchers’ assessment did not distinguish between interpersonal and overt bullying. It only addressed bullying at school, not in other settings. \n \n Most of what experts know about the effects of bullying comes from observational studies, not studies of children followed over time. \n \n Previous research from Finland, based on questionnaires completed on a single occasion or on military registries, used a sample of 2,540 boys to see if being a bully or a victim at 8 predicted a psychiatric disorder 10 to 15 years later. The researchers found frequent bully-victims were at particular risk of adverse long-term outcomes, specifically anxiety and antisocial personality disorders. Victims were at greater risk for anxiety disorders, while bullies were at increased risk for antisocial personality disorder.', 'Besides age, the biggest risk factor for developing Alzheimer’s disease is having a parent or other first-degree relative with the condition. A new study adds to growing evidence that inheriting it from your mother is much worse than inheriting it from your father.Researchers at the University of Kansas School of Medicine recruited 21 adult children (age 63 to 83) of Alzheimer’s patients who were still “cognitively intact.” They examined their brains using an MRI scanner on two occasions, two years apart. Then they compared those brain scans with those of 32 other healthy adults in the same age group with no family history of Alzheimer’s. Members of both groups had similar levels of education and cognitive performance.Though none of the subjects exhibited any outward signs of dementia, the brain scans revealed that the 11 people whose mothers had Alzheimer’s had lost significantly more gray matter over the 2-year period than the 10 people whose fathers had the disease and compared with the 32 people with two healthy parents. That cell loss was especially pronounced in two areas of the brain – the left precuneus (which plays a role in episodic memory, among other functions) and the left parahippocampas gyrus (which is involved in encoding and retrieving memories).Other regions that took a hit were “the anterior cingulate, the bilateral middle temporal gyrus, the right hippocampus, right precuneus, and posterior cingulate,” according to a study in the March 1 edition of the journal Neurology The brains of those whose fathers had Alzheimer’s disease were essentially the same as those of subjects with no family history. Only having a mother with the disease appeared to influence the degree of brain atrophy.The researchers said they don’t know why Alzheimer’s appears to be more aggressive when inherited from one’s mother instead of one’s father. Perhaps it’s related to mitochondrial DNA , which is inherited only from one’s mother and which may be responsible for faulty glucose metabolism in brain tissue affected by Alzheimer’s, they wrote.']",3,"– Bullied kids are at greater risk of a range of psychological problems years later, a study suggests. ""Psychological damage doesn’t just go away because a person grew up and is no longer bullied,"" says a researcher. And that applies to both sexes, the study finds, challenging earlier research that suggested the long-term toll was more pronounced among girls. This study referred to ""a much richer data set,"" researchers say. ""We were actually able to say being a victim of bullying is having an effect a decade later."" Children in North Carolina joined the study at age nine, 11, or 13. Researchers collected data by interviewing the kids and their parents, following 1,270 of them into adulthood, the Globe and Mail reports. Victims had ""higher levels of depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, generalized anxiety, panic disorder, and agoraphobia,"" the study says. They suffered 4.3 times the anxiety disorder risk of children with no bullying in their pasts, the New York Times reports. Bullies themselves faced a higher risk of antisocial personality disorders, while male victims and bullies faced 18.5 times the risk of suicidal thoughts."
191,"['A lawsuit filed Monday by 10 Sandy Hook victims’ families claims Adam Lanza would not have been able to kill 26 people in five minutes without his “weapon of choice,” a Bushmaster AR-15. \n \n “The number of lives lost in those 264 seconds was made possible” by the rifle that was “engineered to deliver maximum carnage with extreme efficiency,” according to the lawsuit against AR-15 manufacturer Bushmaster. \n \n The lawsuit was filed Monday morning in Connecticut superior court against Bushmaster, several other manufacturers, and Riverview Gun Sales, where Lanza’s rifle was purchased. \n \n These defendants know that “as a result of selling AR-15s to the civilian market, individuals unfit to operate these weapons gain access to them... Despite that knowledge, defendants continue to sell the XM15-E52 rifle to the civilian market.” \n \n In making the case against any civilian sales of AR-15s, the plaintiffs say—among other things—“there is not a single state that requires a mental-health examination of a potential purchaser of an AR-15” or to “answer questions about other individuals with whom they intend to share access.” \n \n The reference is unmistakably to Nancy Lanza, who purchased the AR-15 that her son would use to massacre 20 first-grade students and six adults before taking his own life. \n \n Under the title “The Road to Sandy Hook,” the lawsuit painstakingly details the use of the AR-15 in other mass shootings, including those at schools. Yet Bushmaster continued to market the AR-15 as a weapon that would make others “bow down” and kept selling high-capacity magazines with it. \n \n After recounting the individual lives taken by Lanza and his Bushmaster AR-15, the lawsuit says the defendants “knew, or should have known” that the sale of the AR-15 “posed an unreasonable and egregious risk of physical injury to others.” In addition, it should’ve known it would’ve been used in a mass shooting to inflict maximum casualties. \n \n The families created estates in their childrens’ names (with parents as administrators) so they could sue on behalf of the victims. Bushmaster and the other defendants’ conduct, the plaintiffs say, was a “substantial factor resulting in the following injuries and losses.” They are listed for the dead as “terror; ante-mortem pain and suffering; destruction of the ability to enjoy life’s activities; destruction of earning capacity, and death.” \n \n The plaintiffs claim damages in excess of $15,000 and seek further relief for monetary damages, puntitive damages, attorneys’ fees, costs, and injunctive relief.', 'In an article appearing on Today Parents, Nicole Hockley writes a letter to the mom she was before she lost her youngest son Dylan in the Dec. 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. \n \n ""The tragedy changed every single aspect of your life, not only because of the obvious absence of your child, but because of the constant hole inside you that can never be filled,"" Hockley writes. \n \n In the letter, Hockley goes on to talk about gun violence prevention and recognizing the signs of a troubled child, asking parents to get involved by talking to their children, other parents and educators about these issues. \n \n ""Small but meaningful actions create change,"" Hockley writes. \n \n \n \n Read Hockley\'s letter to herself here.', 'Tweet with a location \n \n You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

193,"[""The White House is said to be considering Gov. Brian Sandoval (R-Nev.) as a nominee to replace Justice Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court. Here's what you need to know about him. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) \n \n The White House is considering picking the Republican governor from Nevada to fill the current vacancy on the Supreme Court, scrambling political calculations in what is expected to be a contentious confirmation battle in which Senate Republicans have pledged to play the role of roadblock. \n \n President Obama is weighing the selection of Brian Sandoval, a centrist former federal judge who has served as governor since 2011, according to two people familiar with the process. Though the review process is in its initial phases and it is unclear whether the governor could ultimately emerge as the president’s pick, even the prospect of his nomination poses a difficult dilemma for Senate Republicans who have promised not to consider any nomination before November’s elections. \n \n After The Washington Post published news of Sandoval’s consideration Wednesday, GOP leaders insisted that Obama nominating a Republican would make no difference. \n \n Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who on Tuesday pledged “no action” on any Supreme Court nomination before the election, said in a statement that the nominee “will be determined by whoever wins the presidency in the fall.” \n \n The No. 2 Senate Republican leader, Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas, said likewise: “This is not about the personality.” \n \n [Republicans vow no hearings, no votes for Obama’s Supreme Court pick] \n \n White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters Wednesday he would not comment specifically on whether the administration was considering Sandoval because he did not want “to get into a rhythm of responding” to every report on a potential nominee. But he said that Obama was committed to finding “the best person to fill the vacancy at the Supreme Court,” regardless of party. \n \n “The president’s focused on criteria that, frankly, is more important, and that is that individual’s qualifications, and their experience and their view of the law,” Earnest said. “That will take precedence over any sort of political consideration.” \n \n Sandoval would represent an unconventional pick for the president, a former constitutional law professor who has prized prestigious law pedigrees and extensive legal backgrounds in the jurists he has previously selected for the Court. While the selection of a Republican could heighten the political pressure on Senate GOP leaders, it could also alienate the Democratic base and runs counter to Obama’s emphasis on taking a long view of who deserves to sit on the nation’s highest court. \n \n Speaking to reporters last week, the president said he planned to select someone with extraordinary legal credentials. “We’re going to find somebody who is has an outstanding legal mind, somebody who cares deeply about our democracy and cares about rule of law,” he said. \n \n A Sandoval spokesman, Mari St. Martin, said Wednesday, “Neither Governor Sandoval nor his staff has been contacted by or talked to the Obama administration regarding any potential vetting for the vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court.” \n \n It is clear, however, that Senate Minority Leader Harry M. Reid, a fellow Nevadan with whom Sandoval enjoys cordial relations, is playing a key role as intermediary. While visiting Washington for a meeting of the National Governors Association, Sandoval met with Reid in his Capitol office Monday. \n \n A person familiar with the conversation said that while Sandoval told Reid he had not made a final decision on whether he would accept a Supreme Court nomination, he would allow the vetting process to move forward. Another person in Nevada familiar with the process confirmed that it is underway. \n \n Asked about a potential nomination on Saturday, Sandoval told the Morning Consult, “It would be a privilege.” He called the Supreme Court “the essence of justice in this country.” \n \n [Everything you need to know about appointing a Supreme Court justice] \n \n In a Wednesday interview with CNN, Reid said he would endorse Sandoval for the nomination. “I don’t pick the justices, but I know if he were picked, I would support the man,” he said. “He’s a good person, has a great record, and has been a tremendously good governor in spite of having to deal with some very big problems there.” \n \n But in subsequent remarks to The Post, Reid tempered his praise and said he was “not pushing it with the White House” and was “just responding to people.” \n \n “He was a good judge. He’s been a very excellent governor. I like him very much. I would support him,” Reid said of Sandoval. “I would rather we had somebody a little more progressive…. I’ll do what I can, but I’m not pushing his name.” \n \n Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval spoke about his working-class roots during his address at the 2012 Republican National Convention. (Republican National Convention) \n \n It is unclear how many potential nominees are under White House consideration for the high court vacancy left by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. Obama was seen last week carrying a thick binder of materials on potential picks to review. \n \n As the standoff continued with Senate Republicans, Obama reiterated Wednesday morning that he intended to “do his job” by nominating a candidate during the remaining months of his presidency. \n \n Referring to McConnell and Senate Republicans on Wednesday morning, Obama said: “I recognize the politics are hard for them, because the easier thing to do is to give in to the most extreme voices within their party and stand pat and do nothing.” \n \n But he predicted that the Republican position “may evolve” if the public believes his nominee is “very well qualified.” \n \n “I don’t expect Mitch McConnell to say that is the case today. I don’t expect any member of the Republican caucus to stick their head out at the moment and say that. But let’s see how the public responds to the nominee that we put forward,” the president said. \n \n [Sign up for The Daily 202 and get all the news you need on the Scalia confirmation battle and the presidential campaign] \n \n Some Democrats see a Sandoval nomination as the best opportunity to fracture the front of Republican opposition and force McConnell to take up the nomination in this contentious election year. It would also put on the spot a handful of Senate Republicans who are up for reelection in blue states in November. \n \n Several Republican members of the Judiciary Committee, which is charged with considering a Supreme Court nominee, said Wednesday that it would not matter if Obama picked a Republican. \n \n “The short answer is no, it doesn’t change anything,” said Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah). \n \n But some Republican senators acknowledged a Sandoval pick would put GOP senators in a tough spot politically. \n \n “This is one reason why I have not wanted to shut the door on considering a nominee,” said Sen. Susan Collins (Maine), one of two Senate Republicans who is at least open to a confirmation hearing. “We may well be sent a nominee who is deserving of thorough vetting and consideration.” \n \n Another Republican senator aligned with the GOP court blockade, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak frankly, said a Sandoval nomination would “mix it up” for Republicans. But the lawmaker also said he doubted that Democrats would unite behind Sandoval. \n \n \n \n Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval (R) is being vetted for the vacancy on the Supreme Court (AP Photo/Cathleen Allison, File) \n \n Nominating Sandoval would carry clear political risks for Obama. Sandoval is aligned with Democrats on some key issues, including abortion rights and the environment. As governor, he has moved to implement the Affordable Care Act, and has said he considers same-sex marriage to be a settled issue. \n \n [Who is Brian Sandoval?] \n \n But Sandoval is not seen as labor-friendly — potentially alienating a swath of the Democratic base. His legal credentials are also lacking compared to some of the other names under consideration who are mainly sitting federal judges. And he initially called the landmark health-care law “unconstitutional,” signing onto a brief in 2012 challenging the constitutionality of the measure’s individual mandate. The Supreme Court ultimately rejected that argument, and upheld the law. \n \n A Senate confirmation of Sandoval through this year could deny a Democratic successor to Obama, whether Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders, the opportunity to nominate a more orthodox liberal to the court and cement an ideological shift in its jurisprudence. \n \n Liberal activist groups quickly registered their displeasure with the idea of a Justice Sandoval. Charles Chamberlain, executive director of Democracy for America, said in a statement it was “downright absurd that President Obama would risk his legacy by appointing another anti-labor Republican like Brian Sandoval to an already overwhelmingly pro-big-business Supreme Court.” \n \n “Nominating someone like Sandoval would not only prevent grass-roots organizations like DFA from supporting the president in this nomination fight, it could lead us to actively encouraging Senate Democrats to oppose his appointment,” Chamberlain said. \n \n [Democrats troll GOP by floating a Republican for Supreme Court] \n \n The Senate unanimously confirmed Sandoval as a district court judge in 2005 after he was nominated by President George W. Bush. The Nevada Republican stepped down from the bench in 2009 to run for governor and is now counted among the most popular governors in the nation. He also represents a swing state with a heavy concentration of Latinos who will be important in the presidential race. \n \n One Republican who is considered likely to support Sandoval if nominated is Nevada’s junior senator, Dean Heller. \n \n Heller suggested in a statement last week that the “chances of approving a new nominee are slim,” but he did not discourage Obama from putting forth a nominee. \n \n “[W]ho knows, maybe it’ll be a Nevadan,” he said — a comment widely interpreted as signaling his support for Sandoval. \n \n In a parallel story line, Reid and Sandoval have long had a symbiotic political relationship that sometimes defied logic. \n \n Elected as the state’s attorney general in 2002, Sandoval quickly became one of the more popular Republicans in Nevada. In early 2005, Reid began pushing Sandoval to take a seat on the state’s U.S. District Court – a move that political insiders viewed as a savvy one to take Sandoval off the potential field of rivals who might run against Reid in his 2010 Senate race. \n \n Sandoval was nominated and then confirmed as a federal judge in October 2005 without any opposition, clearing the Senate Judiciary Committee by a voice vote and then winning full Senate confirmation by an 89-0 vote. Four years later, as then-Republican Gov. Jim Gibbons’s popularity was imploding amid a variety of scandals, the state’s GOP elites persuaded Sandoval to bail them out and challenge Gibbons in a June 2010 primary. \n \n Sandoval ousted Gibbons — and in November 2010, he routed Rory Reid, 53 percent to 41 percent, knocking off the Senate leader’s son. \n \n Harry Reid, who is retiring in 2016, won his own reelection that year in a bid that left some surprised by the senator’s seeming reluctance to help boost his son’s campaign against Sandoval. \n \n As governor, Sandoval alienated many conservatives by accepting the Medicaid expansion that was a cornerstone of Obama’s Affordable Care Act. One of his recent budgets, passed over the opposition of many Republicans in the legislature, included tax hikes designed to boost funding for the state’s notoriously underperforming public schools. \n \n As the 2016 election cycle got underway a year ago, Washington Republicans set their sights on Sandoval as their top recruit to try to challenge Reid. However, in public and private, the governor made clear that he had little interest in running in a competitive primary and then challenging Reid in the general election. Reid is retiring in 2016, leaving a competitive open Senate seat behind him. \n \n All this occurred while Reid repeatedly praised Sandoval for his positions on health care, taxes and education. And when the Senate Democratic leader announced in late March 2015 that he would not run for reelection, Sandoval returned the favor by praising his one-time patron for the federal judgeship. \n \n “From humble beginnings in Searchlight to the United States Senate, Senator Reid’s story is one that represents the Nevada and American dream,” Sandoval said. \n \n Paul Kane contributed to this report."", 'President Obama called on Senate Republicans Wednesday to ""fulfill their constitutional duties"" and consider a Supreme Court nominee this year, questioning their reasoning for vowing not to consider his choice to replace Antonin Scalia. \n \n ""I recognize the politics are hard for them because the easier thing to do is to give in to the most extreme voices within their party and stand pat and do nothing,"" he told reporters during a meeting with King Abdullah of Jordan. ""But that\'s not our job. Our job is to fulfill our constitutional duties."" \n \n ""And so my hope and expectation is that once there is an actual nominee, once this is no longer an abstraction, that those on the Judiciary Committee recognize that their job is to give this person a hearing, to show the courtesy of meeting with them,"" he continued. ""They are then free to vote whatever their conscience dictates as to whether this person is qualified or not."" \n \n He added that it\'s up to the American public to decide whether or not his eventual nominee is qualified for the position--and public support for the candidate would make it tougher for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to summarily deny that person a hearing. \n \n ""I think it will be very difficult for Mr. McConnell to explain how, if the public concludes that this person\'s very well-qualified, that the Senate should stand in the way simply for political reasons,"" he said. ""We\'ll see what happens. I think the situation may evolve over time. I don\'t expect Mitch McConnell to say that is the case today. I don\'t expect any member of the Republican caucus to stick their head out at the moment. But let\'s see how the public responds to the nominee that we put forward."" \n \n Obama also said the argument about holding off nominating someone because he\'s a ""lame-duck president"" doesn\'t hold water because he still has a year left in office. \n \n ""There\'s an argument that well, the president shouldn\'t do this because he is a lame duck,"" he said. ""Well, the truth of the matter is that traditionally the term lame duck refers to the two or three months after an election has taken place in which a new president is about to be sworn in. I\'ve got a year to go. I don\'t think they would approve of me abdicating on my duties as commander-in-chief and to stop doing all the other work that I\'ve got to do."" \n \n As for how he\'s going to choose a nominee, the president on Wednesday penned a guest post on SCOTUSblog, a popular Supreme Court analysis website, detailing the qualities he looks for in a nominee and assuring readers that naming a bench appointment is ""a duty that I take seriously."" \n \n For Mr. Obama, the first prerequisite for a justice who would replace the late Antonin Scalia is that the person ""be eminently qualified."" \n \n ""He or she will have an independent mind, rigorous intellect, impeccable credentials, and a record of excellence and integrity,"" the president wrote. ""I\'m looking for a mastery of the law, with an ability to hone in on the key issues before the Court, and provide clear answers to complex legal questions."" \n \n But the president also emphasized a nonpartisan nominee to the court, which has been back in session since Monday. \n \n His chosen appointment would be ""someone who recognizes the limits of the judiciary\'s role; who understands that a judge\'s job is to interpret the law, not make the law."" \n \n The future justice he promised to seek would hand down decisions on court cases ""without any particular ideology or agenda, but rather a commitment to impartial justice, a respect for precedent, and a determination to faithfully apply the law to the facts at hand."" \n \n And Mr. Obama\'s third requirement for the nation\'s highest bench: life experience. \n \n ""I\'m also mindful that there will be cases that reach the Supreme Court in which the law is not clear. There will be cases in which a judge\'s analysis necessarily will be shaped by his or her own perspective, ethics, and judgment,"" the president said. ""That\'s why the third quality I seek in a judge is a keen understanding that justice is not about abstract legal theory, nor some footnote in a dusty casebook."" \n \n ""It\'s the kind of life experience earned outside the classroom and the courtroom,"" he added, ""experience that suggests he or she views the law not only as an intellectual exercise, but also grasps the way it affects the daily reality of people\'s lives in a big, complicated democracy, and in rapidly changing times."" \n \n He also hinted at a potential timetable for when he would officially tap a nominee, saying that he would fulfill that presidential duty ""in the weeks ahead."" \n \n When he does choose to name Scalia\'s successor, Mr. Obama will be fighting an uphill battle to get his nominee confirmed. \n \n On Tuesday, Senate Republicans reached a consensus that they would block all attempts at holding confirmation hearings for the president\'s nominee. \n \n ""I believe the overwhelming view of the Republican conference of the Senate is that this nomination, this vacancy, should not be filled by this lame-duck president,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, told reporters earlier this week after conferring with members of the GOP. Others, including former presidential candidate and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, who sits on the Judiciary committee, had said earlier in the day that there would be ""no hearing, no votes."" \n \n But in his SCOTUSblog post, the president closed with his hope that the Senate would cooperate in the future and ""fulfill their constitutional responsibility"" to consider his nominee. \n \n ""I hope they\'ll move quickly to debate and then confirm this nominee so that the Court can continue to serve the American people at full strength,"" he said.', 'Egypt has been the scene of more than 100 incidents involving the harm or detention of journalists in the past 36 hours, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. \n \n In Egypt, a plainclothes policeman (l.) runs to attack a foreign journalist as others beat a protester during a demonstration on Friday. Journalists have been the target of assault for two days running. \n \n Reports of severe attacks and detentions for journalists working in Egypt paint a dark picture of an orchestrated attempt to shut down the information flow from a country in turmoil. \n \n There have been more than 100 incidents of beatings, detentions, and assaults on journalists in the past 36 hours, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ). While CNN’s Anderson Cooper may be one of the highest-profile incidents involving a member of the US media, journalists from all over the world – including Egypt – have been targeted. \n \n “This is on a scale that is unprecedented,” says Rob Mahoney, deputy director of CPJ. \n \n The crackdown takes place as journalists come under fire more often and with clearer intent than at any time in modern history, he says. ""Most journalists who die are murdered. They don’t step on land mines – and 85 percent of those murders go unpunished,” he adds. \n \n The US State Department would not rule out the possibility that the Egyptian government is behind the crackdown. \n \n ""We condemn in the strongest terms attacks on reporters covering the ongoing situation in Egypt. This is a violation of international norms that guarantee freedom of the press and is unacceptable under any circumstances,"" Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said at a press briefing Thursday. “The Egyptian government must demonstrate its willingness to ensure journalists’ ability to report on these events to the people of Egypt and to the world.” \n \n The US has raised these issues with both the Egyptian ambassador in Washington and ministry officials in Cairo, according to State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley. \n \n The developments raise the question: Why is the press coming under such fire? The logic of attacking reporters amid the Egyptian demonstrations is one that is common in political uprisings, says Barbara DeGorge, academic dean at Northwood University in West Palm Beach, Fla. \n \n “The demonstrators see the journalists as being aligned with the Mubarak government and are angry at them for their support of a repressive regime,” says Ms. DeGorge, who has just returned from six years stationed in Dubai. \n \n At the same time, older, more-conservative Egyptians view the presence of cameras in the midst of an internal dispute as a threat to their country’s stability. “They tend to see Western journalists as reporting news that is beneficial to Western interests, not their own. So they are very suspicious,” she says. \n \n While reporting has always been an inherently messy and potentially dangerous job, “there used to be an intrinsic respect” for the work being done by the fourth estate, says Gene Grabowski, chair of the Crisis and Litigation Practice at Levick Strategic Communications in Washington. \n \n Mr. Grabowski began as an Associated Press reporter in the late 1970s – the dawn of the 24-hour news cycle. These days, the sheer number of people who can set themselves up as some form of journalist has exploded, points out Mr. Mahoney of CPJ. “Today, anyone with a flip-phone camera and access to a blog can call themselves a journalist,” he says. \n \n They can reach more people and do the same job for pennies. Only 25 years ago, a professional would have had to pay thousands of dollars and had access to a pricey satellite uplink to deliver his or her report. \n \n When reporters cover political turmoil in nations that lack the institutions of free speech, it is common to view journalists as threats to the status quo, says Leonard Shyles, an associate professor of communication at Villanova University in Pennsylvania. \n \n “The idea that the public will find out things that are inconvenient to the power holders prompts them to limit access to reporters to avoid scrutiny and preserve anonymity,” Professor Shyles says via e-mail. He adds, “At such times, journalists are at risk and come to be viewed as threats to be thwarted, sometimes at the cost of their lives.” \n \n CBS News correspondent Mark Strassmann is among the many reporters in Cairo who were roughed up and warned to stay away from the political demonstrations. He says he spent Thursday in his hotel. \n \n “I read a poll that said reporters are trusted less than car salesmen,” he said by phone from his hotel in Cairo. However, he notes, the stakes are high in this battle for who will control the information flow. Important decisions are made on the basis of information, and “people have to get their information somewhere,” he says. \n \n Outside media attention provides one of the few pressure points on Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak as protesters demand change. “The thuggery of the last few days is much easier for Mubarak to get away with if nobody is reading about it or seeing it,” he says.', 'The security firm formerly known as Blackwater is looking for new ownership, announcing Monday it is pursuing a sale of the company that became renowned and reviled for its involvement with the U.S. government in Iraq and elsewhere. \n \n The Moyock, North Carolina-based company now called Xe Services announced its decision in a brief statement that gave few details. \n \n ""Xe\'s new management team has made significant changes and improvements to the company over the last 15 months, which have enabled the company to better serve the U.S. government and other customers, and will deliver additional value to a purchaser,"" the statement said. \n \n Owner and founder Erik Prince said selling the company is a difficult decision, but constant criticsm of Xe helped him make up his mind. \n \n ""Performance doesn\'t matter in Washington, just politics,"" Prince said in a further statement. \n \n The private company became famous as Blackwater, which provided guards and services to the U.S. government in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere. It became one of the most respected defense contractors in the world, but also attracted sharp criticism over its role in those missions. \n \n It has been trying to rehabilitate its image since a 2007 shooting in Baghdad that killed 17 people, outraged the Iraqi government and led to federal charges against several Blackwater guards. The accusations later were thrown out of court after a judge found prosecutors mishandled evidence. \n \n In March, Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin suggested the Pentagon should consider banning Xe from a $1 billion deal to train Afghan police. The Michigan Democrat said he thought the company\'s involvement was hindering the U.S. mission in Afghanistan. \n \n Prince, who founded the company in 1997 along with former colleagues from the Navy SEALs, said he does not anticipate having any role in Xe after the sale. \n \n The process of finding a buyer and completing the deal is expected to take several months, according to spokeswoman Stacy DeLuke. \n \n The announcement comes less than three months after Xe sold its aviation division for $200 million to Wood Dale, Illinois-based AAR Corp in a bid to strengthen Xe\'s balance sheet. \n \n More recently, five former executives, including Gary Jackson, the company\'s ex-president, were indicted on charges of conspiring to violate federal firearms laws.

A hearing on whom? Well, per multiple sources who spoke to the Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal, the White House is currently vetting Brian Sandoval, the Republican governor of Nevada. He's described as a ""centrist"" by the Post, who says ""some key Democrats"" see him as ""perhaps the only nominee"" Obama might be able to get Republicans to consider. Mitch McConnell and the Judiciary Committee have pledged to take no action on any Supreme Court nominee from Obama. Would that change if the nominee is a member of their own party? Three GOP senators who sit on the Judiciary Committee all said no, but other Republican senators say getting a nominee like Sandoval could be cause to reconsider. Some Democrats believe nominating Sandoval would put some Republicans up for re-election in November in an awkward position, and could ultimately force the Senate to break its blockade. Sandoval, who has a ""bipartisan record"" per the Post and is aligned with Democrats on abortion rights and the environment, met with Harry Reid Monday, and a source says he allowed the vetting process to proceed but said he hadn't decided whether he'd accept a nomination. It's not clear how many potential nominees the White House is considering, but the Journal notes there are likely more."

A mixture of sulfur and pitch combined with fire was the first way humans gassed their enemies, explains Discovery News. It dredges up 2009 findings by British archaeologist Simon James, who asserts that such a poison gas was used during a siege on the Roman-controlled city of Dura-Europos around AD 256. The site was excavated throughout the 20th century, first in 1920; in the next decade, the bodies of 20 armor-clad Roman soldiers were found in one of the counter-mines they dug in order to access the tunnels made by the invading Sasanian Persians. The original theory was that the collapse of the tunnel killed them. But James offered proof that the Romans were actually gassed: A jar near the bodies contained residue composed of pitch and yellow sulfur crystals. National Geographic shares James' explanation: ""I think the Sasanians placed braziers and bellows in their gallery, and when the Romans broke through, added the chemicals and pumped choking clouds into the Roman tunnel."" Death would have come within minutes. There is one bit of archaeology that could predate it: a sulfur and pitch fireball that struck Alexander’s army in 327 BC. But a Stanford research scholar notes that there's no way to determine whether it was purposefully or accidentally ignited.

They also stopped using cell phones and used encrypted e-mail while on the road to avoid detection by law enforcement, according to the indictment. \n \n To publicize their crimes, court documents allege, the pair used publicly available computers to post what the FBI called “communiques” to extreme animal rights websites. \n \n Buddenberg was the target of federal agents at least once before when, in 2009, he was charged with threatening researchers at UC Berkeley and UC Santa Cruz. Those charges were eventually thrown out by a judge who said prosecutors filed a vague indictment that failed to specify any illegal acts. \n \n If convicted, Buddenberg and Kissane could face up to 10 years in prison and $250,000 in fines.

Graf said she hopes her family will be able to recover restitution for the damage incurred. \n \n The court document lays out Buddenberg and Kissane’s alleged cross-country path after that: \n \n • In Montana, they are accused of releasing a bobcat from Frazier Fur Farm in Plains, then the next day vandalizing the vehicles of the police chief in Darby, who is disliked by animal-rights activists, according to the indictment. \n \n • In Idaho, they released about 1,800 mink from the Moyle Mink Ranch in Burley and destroyed the breeding grounds there, the indictment alleges. \n \n • In the Bay Area, they allegedly glued the locks of various animal-related businesses, slashed the tires on several trucks of a meat distributor and broke windows of a market, the indictment says. \n \n • In Minnesota, they allegedly smashed the windows and glued the locks of Ribnick Fur and Leather in Minneapolis, and later freed about 440 mink from Myhre Mink Ranch in Grand Meadow. \n \n • In Wisconsin, they are accused of vandalizing and trying to flood the Sun Prairie home of an employee of North American Fur Auctions, and later releasing about 2,000 mink from Bonlander Farms in New Holstein. \n \n • In Iowa, the indictment says, they freed up to 500 mink from the Donald B. Conrad Fur Farm in Keota. \n \n • In Pennsylvania, they released 1,000 mink from Rykola Mink Farm in Ebensburg, according to the indictment. \n \n “Communiqués” publicizing their actions were posted on websites associated with animal-rights extremism, authorities said. In the San Diego attack, a Florida animal-rights website posted a message from the Animal Liberation Front that claimed responsibility for the vandalism. The indictment does not mention whether Buddenberg and Kissane are part of any organization. \n \n Authorities say the pair carefully planned the excursions and tried to stay off the grid to avoid detection by law enforcement. \n \n They used only cash during their trips and avoided phones to avoid leaving traces, the indictment says. They are also accused of using encrypted email and public computers to access the Internet while on the road. \n \n The pair were unemployed – although public records show Kissane has a cosmetology license – and raised money for their road trips by selling items on eBay and Amazon, authorities said. \n \n In November and December 2013, authorities allege, the pair were in possession of various tools to carry out the crimes, including acid, wire cutters, handwritten lists of fur farms, latex gloves, super glue, walkie-talkies, a knife, encrypted computers and headlamps. \n \n “Whatever your feelings about the fur industry, there are legal ways to make your opinions known,” U.S. Attorney Laura Duffy said in a statement. “The conduct alleged here, sneaking around at night, stealing property and vandalizing homes and businesses with acid, glue, and chemicals, is a form of domestic terrorism and can’t be permitted to continue.” \n \n The alleged spree was investigated by Joint Terrorism Task Forces around the country, said San Diego’s FBI Special Agent in Charge Eric Birnbaum. \n \n Jerry Vlasak, a press officer with the North American Animal Liberation Press Office, emphasized that the pair are innocent until proven otherwise. \n \n He said in his opinion, forms of economic sabotage and the liberation of animals are legitimate tactics to use as part of the animal rights movement. \n \n “Whoever did these actions are heroes in our book. We support them 100 percent,” Vlasak said. \n \n He added that the “terrorism” label is describing the wrong side. “These people are abusing animals, taking fur-bearing animals, keeping them in cages, anally electrocuting them, skinning them and selling their fur to make a fashion statement and profit. If anyone is terrorizing anyone, it’s those terrorizing these animals.” \n \n This is not the first arrest for Buddenberg. He and three others were charged in 2009 in connection with violent protests outside the homes of UC Santa Cruz and UC Berkeley scientists. Buddenberg lived in Berkeley at the time. \n \n One of the other activists charged was an Oceanside man.

(Associated Press) \n \n The game ends, and the song ""Orioles Magic"" is piped over the loudspeakers as Baltimore celebrates an 8-2 victory in a game that lasted only 2 hours, 3 minutes. \n \n Hmm, maybe playing without fans in the park is actually the best way to speed up a baseball game. \n \n After the handshakes near the mound, both teams retreat to their dugouts on a sun-drenched afternoon. \n \n The integrity of the schedule has been saved, and one of the strangest games in baseball history is over. \n \n And not a single fan left early to beat the traffic. \n \n 4:00 p.m. \n \n Perry Saurers left his mitt at home. He didn\'t have to worry about dropping his popcorn or spilling a beer trying to catch a foul ball when it zipped his way, either. \n \n Saurers was all alone on the Camden Yards concourse. \n \n Saurers, a police officer from Howard County who was helping the Orioles authenticate memorabilia from the historic game, leisurely walked after loose baseballs that had rolled under the green seats or were resting in the concrete walkways. He was collecting the souvenirs most fans dream of snagging at the ballpark. \n \n The baseballs aren\'t going to be added to his collection, though. He had to turn them over to MLB\'s authentication program. \n \n 3:49 p.m. \n \n The Orioles just proceeded with another baseball tradition: announcing the attendance. For the first time in major league history it went, ""Today\'s official paid attendance is zero."" \n \n 3:45 p.m. \n \n Orioles broadcasters point out that without the typical ballpark atmosphere, Camden Yards is a bit like Augusta National Golf Club. \n \n Gary Thorne put on his ""Masters voice"" for a brief moment, giving the play-by-play as Adam Jones took his at-bat in the top of the seventh. Thorne told color analyst Jim Palmer he\'d talked with a producer before the game about the appropriate way to call a game without fans. \n \n The approach was tested immediately when Jones hit the first pitch of the at-bat. \n \n Thorne\'s call: ""Jones will whack the son-of-a-gun to center field. That\'s very deep, it\'s deep and it\'s off the base of the wall. ... Adam Jones has a double, and that green jacket is well within reach, Jim."" \n \n The brief, light moment contrasted sharply from a more serious tone during much of the broadcast, which at times focused little on baseball and more on the strife in Baltimore outside Camden Yards. \n \n 3:40 p.m. \n \n It\'s time for the seventh inning stretch — even if there are no fans to stand up and stretch. \n \n The Orioles organist played the ballpark staple ""Take Me Out to the Ball Game"" to an empty ballpark after the top of the seventh. \n \n 3:19 p.m. \n \n Manny Machado drives a pitch from Jeff Samardzija into the bullpen to put the Orioles ahead 8-2 in the bottom of the fifth inning. \n \n Baltimore\'s third baseman takes a casual trot around the bases while fans assembled beyond the center-field gate cheer. \n \n Under normal circumstances, fans would be heading to the concession stands as the fifth inning ends. But that\'s not happening. For one, the concessions stands are closed. More importantly, there are no fans. Not in the seating bowl, anyway. \n \n 3:16 p.m. \n \n Orioles first baseman Chris Davis caught a throw from second baseman Ray Navarro on Micah Johnson\'s grounder for the final out of the top of the fifth inning. Standard baseball play. Davis then took a few steps toward the Orioles dugout on the first base side and underhand tossed the ball about a dozen rows into the empty stands, clattering in the seats. The O\'s are having a little fun with a 7-2 lead. \n \n 2:50 p.m. \n \n Chicago second baseman Micah Johnson gets the relay throw from right fielder Avisail Garcia, and those around shout ""No!"" as he turns to make a throw to the plate. \n \n That\'s because Everth Cabrera has stopped at third base. \n \n These are the things the fans don\'t usually hear at the game. That, and an infielder yelling, ""I got it!"" as the outfielder closes in. \n \n The crack of the bat sounds louder, too, perhaps because it\'s not accompanied by the sound of a vendor hawking hot dogs. \n \n 2:41 p.m. \n \n Van Halen ""Ain\'t Talking \'bout Love"" between the second and third innings. \n \n They\'re playing music as the teams go from the field to the dugout. But the Crab Shuffle and some of the other silly games that usually are usually displayed on the Camden Yards scoreboard are getting a rest today. \n \n No replays, either. \n \n Those in the press box might be horrified if they opted to run the ""Kiss Cam,"" but it appears that\'s not going to happen. \n \n 2:35 p.m. \n \n Adam Jones says the game needs to be played, but Baltimore needs to heal first. \n \n The Orioles outfielder said Wednesday that\'s what\'s most important to him as his team plays the White Sox without a crowd at Camden Yards. \n \n Baltimore\'s home broadcaster MASN-HD cut to comments by Jones during the top of the second inning, as Ubaldo Jimenez tried to protect a 6-0 lead. \n \n Jones says he hopes the Baltimore community and its children stay strong, get guidance and heed the messages of city leaders. \n \n 2:20 p.m. \n \n There weren\'t any fans in the ballpark, but there was cheering from beyond the center-field wall when Chris Davis hit a three-run homer to give Baltimore a 4-0 lead in the first inning. \n \n Fans watched from behind the iron gate that stands behind the flag court. When Davis\' drive cleared the right-field wall, they yelled their approval. \n \n In addition, fans were lined up on the deck of a hotel that overlooks the stadium. \n \n On another note, Davis\' home run bounced around in front of the warehouse without any fan in pursuit. \n \n The same applied for foul balls, which remained in the stands without being retrieved. \n \n 2:05 p.m. \n \n The public address announcer at Camden Yards announced the playing of national anthem, informing ""ladies and gentlemen"" what was to follow. \n \n A recorded version was played while the White Sox stood in a line outside their dugout and the Orioles stood at attention in their dugout. \n \n A custom in Baltimore is shouting ""O!"" when the song reaches ""O say can you see?"" \n \n No one did it, although one person in the press box carried on the tradition by saying it under his breath. \n \n At the time, the only people in the stands were a couple of scouts behind the plate. \n \n 1:45 p.m. \n \n With media buzzing over the deserted game, Camden Yards may as well have been setting up for a playoff game, with all 92 seats in the press box full. TV camera crews lined the field and are stationed outside the ballpark. \n \n But the grandstands are as vacant as they are in the offseason. \n \n The usually teeming concourse was barren and the concession stands selling $15 crabcakes, $6.50 crab soups and $8 canned beers were locked up. \n \n And those signs cautioning fans to ""Watch Out for Batted Balls"" were pointless for a day. \n \n 12:10 p.m. \n \n Managers of the Tampa Bay Rays and New York Yankees say players in a closed-door game in Baltimore will have to adjust from their usual habits of feeding off a crowd. \n \n Yankees manager Joe Girardi and Rays manager Kevin Cash say the atmosphere will certainly be odd. \n \n Said Girardi: ""This is going back to the days where just your parents showed up on a cold day."" \n \n The lineup board in the Orioles\' clubhouse says it all: In the attendance section there\'s a round ""0\'\' in orange marker. Just beneath it under ""total attendance"" the number read 299,598, an average of nearly 33,300 fans through nine games. \n \n Cash, whose team was visiting the Yankees in New York, said teams ""sometimes feed off the opposing crowd when you\'re going in an opposing city."" \n \n ___ \n \n 12 p.m. \n \n Being locked out of Camden Yards didn\'t stop a small gathering of Orioles fans from peering through a fence beyond the bleacher seats in left-center field. \n \n One Orioles fan yelled: ""Let us in!"" \n \n No such luck. \n \n While watching batting practice from about 450 feet away on Eutaw Street, fan Larry Marsh said that he wishes he was inside, but thinks officials did the right thing in closing the game. He says: ""I\'m just going to stand here and watch as long as I can."" \n \n The game is believed to be the first held in an empty stadium in the 145-year history of the major leagues. \n \n ___ \n \n 11:30 p.m. \n \n White Sox outfielder Adam Eaton created quite a stir on twitter with a playful tweet during a difficult time in Baltimore: ""We are gonna do our best to take the crowd out of it early. Wish us luck..."" The line was retweeted almost 4,000 times and garnered many comments, positive and negative. \n \n To Eaton\'s credit, unlike many stars who delete a controversial post, he left it on his feed but added another: ""Take it easy people. Just trying to lighten the mood. I have the up most respect for Baltimore and its people. Always have, always will."" \n \n ___ \n \n 10:30 a.m. \n \n Only one gate to Camden Yards is open, allowing media in to watch the Orioles play the White Sox in a game fans aren\'t allowed to attend. \n \n The press box is nearly filled 3 1/2 hours before the scheduled first pitch on Wednesday. \n \n While all other gates are locked, a grounds crew is prepping the field to ensure this one-of-a-kind game will actually be played. \n \n MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred says the league\'s adjustment to rioting and looting around Camden Yards takes into account the safety of the people who would be in the stadium and competitive issues. \n \n ___ \n \n 8 a.m. \n \n The first crowdless major league game will have plenty of viewers on TV and online. \n \n MLB has made the Orioles-White Sox game being played Wednesday in an empty Camden Yards its free game of the day on MLB.TV. The streaming service will carry the game for fans outside the Baltimore and Chicago markets, where the games will be televised. \n \n Broadcasters WPWR-HD in Chicago and MASN-HD in Baltimore are producing the games and will have to adjust to the lack of ambience normally highlighted to give viewers at home a sense of atmosphere. \n \n Baseball officials decided to play the games behind closed doors because of a wave of looting and rioting around Camden Yards that broke out amid tensions between residents and police. The turmoil prompting a citywide curfew came hours after the funeral of Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old black man who sustained a fatal spinal cord injury while in police custody.']",3,"– Two animal rights activists who authorities say went on an epic vigilante road trip across the US have been arrested and face jail time. Joseph Buddenberg, 31, and Nicole Kissane, 28, both of Oakland, are accused of freeing about 5,000 mink from various farms along with a slew of vandalism incidents, reports the San Francisco Chronicle. Prosecutors say the pair set out in June 2013 in a Honda Fit and began their spree by vandalizing a San Diego fur store with paint and Super Glue. After that, they allegedly freed mink from cages at farms in Idaho, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, and Pennsylvania, along with one lucky bobcat in Montana, reports the San Diego Tribune. They also vandalized other stores and vehicles (including a police chief's car) along the way, say authorities. “Whatever your feelings about the fur industry, there are legal ways to make your opinions known,” say US Attorney Lura Duffy. “The conduct alleged here, sneaking around at night, stealing property and vandalizing homes and businesses with acid, glue and chemicals, is a form of domestic terrorism and can’t be permitted to continue.” The pair allegedly wrote of their spree in encrypted ""communiques"" on activist websites as it progressed. They're accused of violating the federal Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act, and each faces 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. Both are out on bond with electronic monitoring."

One of Zirkle\'s dogs was hurt in the attack. \n \n ""Reportedly the snowmachiner made three separate attempts or passes at her including turning around several times,"" official Danny Seavey said in a video for the Iditarod Insider. ""She actually used one of the trail-markers to defend herself - the four-foot pieces of lath out there that are marking the trail."" \n \n According to a report by Alaska State Troopers, the snowmachiner attacked Zirkle at one point on the trail and then returned to meet her about 12 miles away from Nulato. ""The snow machine revved up and was pointed at her and then finally left the area with no further injuries to Zirkle or her team,"" Troopers wrote. \n \n Zirkle pulled up to the Nulato checkpoint at about 2:17 a.m. In a video by the Iditarod Insider, when asked how she was by a race official, she responded, ""Really bad... Someone tried to kill me with a snowmachine."" \n \n About 12 miles out of Nulato, Jeff King\'s team was also attacked by a snowmachiner. King was hit from behind and his three-year-old dog, Nash, was killed. Two other dogs, Banjo, 2, and Crosby, 3, were injured, according to race officials. \n \n A video of King arriving in Nulato at 3:25 a.m. by Iditarod Insider shows King telling race officials that he\'d had \'big problems.\' \n \n ""I was hit by a snowmachine. I have one dead and several hurt,"" King said to the official. \n \n In an interview with Channel 2 News, King said the snowmachine approached him \'in a blur.\' \n \n ""He went by me at high speed. It was so incredibly close -- my team was well lit, with lights and reflectors -- that it felt very intentional,"" King said. \n \n King tried to perform triage first aid on his dying and injured dogs. ""I stood there as my dogs struggled in pain, with broken limbs and in the throes of death, for one of them,"" King said. \n \n A piece of cowling from the snowmachine broke off during the attack on King\'s team and the musher brought it with him to Nulato as evidence. \n \n King requested medical treatment for his dogs at the checkpoint and did not report any injuries himself. \n \n Husky Homestead Tours, King\'s kennel, wrote in a message to Channel 2 that their crew at home was sad about what happened but were thankful that it was not worse. ""We also wish the best to Aliy as she continues to Nome,"" office manager Carrie Skinner wrote. \n \n The Village Public Safety Office confirmed to Channel 2 News that soon after the incident, a Nulato man called and confessed but Alaska State Troopers have not yet publicly identified a suspect. \n \n Both mushers plan to continue the race to Nome.', ""The Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race — Alaska's “Last Great Race” — was reeling in the wake of a suspected snowmobile assault on two dog teams along a remote section of the Yukon River that left one dog dead and two others seriously injured. \n \n Alaska State Troopers said Saturday they had caught the snowmobiler responsible. They charged 26-year-old Arnold Demoski of Nulato, a community of about 350 people, with assault, reckless endangerment, reckless driving and criminal mischief after the incidents that left mushers Jeff King of Denali Park and Aliy Zirkle of Fairbanks badly shaken. \n \n Both mushers said they believed Demoski, who has a history of assault, intentionally tried to run them down on the trail in the dark of night. \n \n The Iditarod has witnessed dog deaths before after snowmobiles, or snow machines as they are commonly called in Alaska, accidentally veered into teams, but never a willful assault. \n \n Some residents of Nulato speculated that Demoski might simply have been trying to scare the mushers and then ran into them accidentally. \n \n In a taped interview with Anchorage television station KTUU, Demoski denied any intent to harm anyone. \n \n “It not was intentional,” he said. “That's not me. I don't do stuff like that.” \n \n Demoski gave similar statements to other media and claimed only to have been involved in an unfortunate accident while driving drunk. He did not know what had happened until sleeping off a night of drinking, he said. \n \n According to his version of events, he was driving in an alcoholic blackout and only put the facts together after waking up to find his snow machine damaged and everyone in the village talking about the dog teams run down. \n \n Jeff King Husky Homestead Nash, one of Jeff King's sled dogs, was killed by a snowmobile. Nash, one of Jeff King's sled dogs, was killed by a snowmobile. (Jeff King Husky Homestead) (Jeff King Husky Homestead) \n \n Still, he somehow remembered going back to see whether Zirkle was OK, and then deciding he didn't want to stop and talk to her because he might get in trouble. \n \n The 59-year-old King, a four-time Iditarod champ who suffered the loss of a dog named Nash, viewed the attack as intentional. He said his sled was well lit and easily visible when the snowmobile came screaming into it. \n \n King estimated Demoski's machine was doing 80 mph when it went past the front of his dog sled and slammed into the musher's team with such force the snowmobile's cowling came flying off. King collected the cowling and brought it into the Nulato checkpoint with his dead and injured dogs in the sled. \n \n The cowling matched that missing from Demoski's sled, which was parked in his yard. \n \n Officials of the Iditarod and the Nulato Tribal Council were quick to blame alcohol for what happened and express sympathy for the two mushers. \n \n “We are disturbed and saddened that celebrated Iditarod veteran dog teams led by Jeff King and Aliy Zirkle were struck by a resident of our village,” the tribe said in a written statement. “Nulato recognizes the complex behavioral health issues that impact our village and we ask for prayers as we seek wellness for all.” \n \n Nulato is what is known as a “damp” village in rural Alaska, where alcohol laws are complicated. Some villages ban booze. Some allow it. And some like Nulato live in between. There are no bars or liquor stores in the community, but alcohol is not banned. About 20 miles upriver, Koyukuk, home to about 100 people, is a “wet'' village, where alcohol can be bought at the Last Chance Liquor Store. \n \n The 46-year-old Zirkle, a three-time Iditarod runner-up, shared King's view that the snow machine assault looked intentional, not accidental. She twice told “Iditarod Insider,” a pay-per-view video news service run by Iditarod organizers, that the snowmobile driver “tried to kill me.” \n \n According to state troopers, Zirkle was about five miles downriver from Koyukuk headed for Nulato when her dog sled was first hit on “the side by a snow machine and the snow machine turned around multiple times and came back at her before driving off.” \n \n Those reports said the machine then went on down the river but later returned and approached her again about 12 miles out of Nulato. This time it aimed its headlight at her and revved its engine, but left without incident. Not long after, troopers allege the machine hit King's team from behind, killing the one dog and injuring five others, two seriously. \n \n Demoski's mother said troopers and a Nulato village public safety officer came and took her son to jail around noon Saturday after his interviews with reporters who were in the village to cover the Iditarod race. \n \n Janice Demoski was told her son was to be arraigned in Fairbanks on Sunday. She said she believed he had been in an accident. \n \n “They say it was an accident, so I believe it was,'' she said in telephone interview. \n \n The Demoskis are part of a large extended family in the Alaska Interior. Janice said Rudy Demoski, an Iditarod icon, is her husband's first cousin. Rudy, now 70 years old, ran the first Iditarod in 1974 and finished fourth. He grew up in a time when sled dogs were a way of life in Alaska. \n \n Most of the dogs are gone from rural Alaska now, and the snow machine has taken over. \n \n Among some villagers, the Iron Dog — a 2,000-mile race that follows the Iditarod route and goes well beyond it — has become more popular than the Iditarod. \n \n Reached by telephone at his home, Rudy Demoski said he didn't want to talk about the incident. \n \n “The bad part is my last name,” he said. \n \n The Iditarod dog race is Alaska's most cherished sport. Though it has come under fire from animal-rights activists outside of the 49th state, few dare to speak unkindly of it in the North. \n \n After leaving injured dogs in the care of race veterinarians in Nulato, both Zirkle and King were continuing north along the trail late Saturday afternoon. \n \n Medred is a special correspondent. \n \n ALSO \n \n New snowstorm hits Sierra Nevada as 'March Miracle' continues \n \n After scuffles in Chicago, Trump tells supporters he can unite the country.

One of Zirkle\'s dogs also was injured. Iditarod officials at first reported King had been injured. But the four-time champion said later the snowmobile had missed both him and his sled. \n \n Demoski said when he woke up Saturday morning and heard what had happened to the mushers, he checked his snowmobile and realized he had done it. The snowmobile was missing a part and had rust-colored stains, he said. \n \n Demoski said he doesn\'t remember the collisions, which the Iditarod described as apparently intentional attacks. \n \n ""I just want to say I\'m sorry,"" he said. \n \n Zirkle, 46, who finished second three times from 2012 to 2014, was mushing from Kokukuk to Nulato, a run of less than 20 miles (32.19 kilometers) on the Yukon River, when she was hit, race marshal Mark Nordman said Saturday. \n \n The snowmobile hit the side of Zirkle\'s sled about 5 miles (8.05 kilometers) outside of Koyukuk, turned around multiple times and came back at her before driving off, Alaska State Troopers spokeswoman Megan Peters said by email. \n \n The snowmobile reappeared 12 miles (19.31 kilometers) outside of Nulato. The driver revved up and was pointed at Zirkle before leaving, Peters said. \n \n Demoski told KTUU that he did not return to harass Zirkle. He said he wanted to check to make sure she was OK. \n \n One dog on Zirkle\'s team was bruised. Officials described the injury as non-life-threatening. \n \n Zirkle reached Nulato and told a race official the incident had left her shaken. \n \n ""I\'m really bad. Someone tried to kill me with a snowmachine,"" she said on a video posted to the Iditarod Insider webpage. Snowmachine is what Alaskans call snowmobiles. \n \n King, a four-time Iditarod champion, was behind Zirkle and fared worse. When King reached the vicinity 12 miles outside of Nulato, his team was struck from behind by the snowmobile. \n \n Nash, a 3-year-old male, was killed. Crosby, another 3-year-old male, and Banjo, a 2-year-old male, received injuries and are expected to survive. King told the Iditarod Insider the snowmobile narrowly missed him and his sled, but hit his dogs at high speed. \n \n ""One of my dogs was killed pretty much on the spot, and a couple others I gave first aid to the best I could and loaded them into my sled,"" he told the Iditarod camera crew. ""I kind of felt like a triage ambulance."" \n \n It did not appear to be an accident, he said. ""It seemed like an act of bravado,"" King said. \n \n Rural Alaska communities have many wonderful people, he said, but they also have serious social problems. \n \n ""It is beyond comprehension to me that this was not related to substance abuse,"" King said, adding that ""no one in their right mind would do what this person did."" \n \n King remained in Nulato early Saturday afternoon. \n \n The race leader early Saturday afternoon was Brent Sass, who left the village of Kaltag at 8:20 a.m. \n \n Zirkle rested four hours in Nulato and dropped one dog before heading back onto the Yukon River with 14 dogs in harness. She reached Kaltag at 10: 44 a.m., and after a nine-minute rest, left again in second place. \n \n Current champion Dallas Seavey left Kaltag at 11: 24 a.m. in third place. His father, former champion Mitch Seavey, was in fourth place. \n \n ___ \n \n This story has been corrected to show the positions, records of Mitch Seavey and Dallas Seavey.']",3,"– The 26-year-old Alaskan who says he was driving blackout drunk when he hit two Iditarod sled dog teams Saturday, killing one dog and injuring others, has been arrested and charged on suspicion of assault, reckless endangerment, reckless driving, and six counts of criminal mischief, reports the Los Angeles Times. Arnold Demoski of Nulato is speaking quite freely with media, telling KTUU that the incident was not ""intentional. That's not me. I don't do stuff like that."" Mushers Jeff King and Aliy Zirkle, who were hit, beg to differ, telling authorities they believe the incident was intentional. King's 3-year-old dog, Nash, was killed. ""One of my dogs was killed pretty much on the spot, and a couple others I gave first aid to the best I could and loaded them into my sled,"" King says, per the AP. ""I kind of felt like a triage ambulance."" Demoski says he woke up after the morning after a night of drinking to discover that his snowmobile was missing its hood and had fresh, rust-colored stains on its sides. He called the village police officer to confess, he says. Asked whether he should face jail, Demoski tells KTUU that although he hopes to avoid it, he probably should go ""for at least some time."""

But many of these newly minted doctors can, thanks to one government program, pay just a few hundred dollars a month on their loans—in some cases, far less than the interest that's being tacked on each month. And after 10 years, when the balance has swelled above $200,000, they can have whatever they owe wiped clean. The Wall Street Journal takes a look at this expanding class of borrower: graduate or professional-school students with a six-figure loan who don't expect or intend to pay it back. That attitude isn't a flouting of the rules. As the Journal reports, one 2012 program allows borrowers to pay a max of 10% of their discretionary income (that's any adjusted gross income beyond 1.5 times the poverty line.) And while undergrads are prevented from taking on more than $57,500 in federal loans, as of 2006 grad students stopped being restricted in a similar manner: Once they've borrowed $138,500 in government Stafford loans (that figure includes undergrad debt), the roughly 10-year-old Grad PLUS loans step in, in many cases eliminating the need to fill the gap using private loans. Grad PLUS was actually supposed to help taxpayers, because the interest rates on these loans were higher. But a 2007 measure allows those working full-time for a federal agency or nonprofit to have their balance wiped away if they make 10 years of payments (which, yes, can be capped at the aforementioned 10%) on time—at the taxpayers' expense. The Journal notes that 73% of America's hospitals are nonprofits or government owned, meaning doctors working there qualify."
198,"['In promoting her new book, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) has come forward with several stories of being called ""chubby,"" ""fat,"" and ""porky"" by her male colleagues in Congress. \n \n In one incident from her early days in the Senate, Gillibrand describes an older senator who approached her from behind and squeezed her waist. ""Don’t lose too much weight now,"" she recalls him saying. ""I like my girls chubby.” \n \n It\'s one of many episodes she recounted in an interview with People magazine that is not yet online but which was reported by the New York Post on Wednesday. Most of the remarks were directed toward Gillibrand during her self-described struggle with her weight during and after her second pregnancy. \n \n In the House gym, she recalled, another of her male colleagues advised her to work out to avoid getting ""porky."" \n \n ""Thanks, a—hole,” she quipped in her book. \n \n In yet another instance, a Southern congressman held her arm as they walked down the chamber aisle, telling her, “[y]ou know, Kirsten, you’re even pretty when you’re fat."" \n \n Gillibrand also recounted the time a labor leader advised her to improve her looks if she wanted to win a special election for her Senate seat in 2010. \n \n “When I first met you in 2006 you were beautiful, a breath of fresh air. To win, you need to be beautiful again,"" he said. \n \n Last year in an exchange reported in the New Yorker, Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN) told Gillibrand: “I don’t want you to take this the wrong way, Kirsten, but you’re what my family would call a honey badger.” The remark, according to the New Yorker, was meant to compliment Gillibrand as ambitious and predatory. \n \n Gillibrand served from 2007-09 in the House before she was appointed to the Senate in 2009, filling the seat vacated by Hillary Clinton when she became secretary of state. Gillibrand won the above special election for the Senate seat in 2010 and was elected to a full term in 2012. \n \n Her book, ""Off The Sidelines,"" is scheduled to be released Sept. 9.

She\'s perfectly content where she is at the moment.""I have young kids,"" says the mom of two, when asked if she\'d consider a bid for the White House. ""I really like where I am.""""I don\'t know that I aspire to it,"" she adds. ""It\'s a very different job. I feel like where I am, I can accomplish a lot.""It\'s her current job with the United States Senate that\'s provided the fodder for her insightful – and sometimes groan-worthy – memoir.In Off the Sidelines, Gillibrand, 47, shares a sobering incident in the congressional gym, where an older, male colleague told her, ""Good thing you\'re working out, because you wouldn\'t want to get porky!"" On another occasion, she writes, after she dropped 50 lbs. one of her fellow Senate members approached her, squeezed her stomach, and said, ""Don\'t lose too much weight now. I like my girls chubby!""Gillibrand isn\'t especially offended by her coworkers\' remarks. ""It was all statements that were being made by men who were well into their 60s, 70s or 80s,"" she says. ""They had no clue that those are inappropriate things to say to a pregnant woman or a woman who just had a baby or to women in general.""For more on Sen.

Never, ever, ever!” Tsarnev told PEOPLE via phone from Russia. In a conversation filled with screaming and yelling, he was clearly in a state of disbelief and horrified by the events he watched unfold on TV. \n \n “I feel terrible! Why they kill my son? Something wrong! My sons never do bombing,” he insisted. “They hated guns – how they do bombs?” \n \n “I am hurt for all the people who lost someone,” Alina told PEOPLE from her home in New Jersey. “I lost a relative, my brother.

Kirsten Gillibrand has a new book, Off the Sidelines, out next month, and it takes a frank look at the reality of being a woman on Capitol Hill. Among the more surprising and perhaps not-so-surprising tidbits: Gillibrand reveals she had lost 50 pounds after giving birth when a male senator squeezed her waist from behind. ""Don't lose too much weight now,"" he said. ""I like my girls chubby."" The Washington Post notes that Gillibrand says ""he was one of her favorite senators(!)."" People picks up another quote from a male colleague, handed out while Gillibrand was exercising at the congressional gym: ""Good thing you're working out, because you wouldn't want to get porky!"" Talking Points Memo notes Gillibrand's acerbic response in the book: ""Thanks, a--hole!"" A Southern congressman even told her once, ""You know, Kirsten, you’re even pretty when you're fat,"" Gillibrand wrote, per the New York Post. ""I believed his intentions were sweet, even if he was being an idiot."" Perhaps all the sexist idiocy helped her bond with Hillary Clinton. ""I will help Hillary get elected,"" she told People while promoting the book. ""In my mind, she's definitely running"" in 2016, Gillibrand adds. ""Anytime I've ever talked to her, I've offered every bit of help in the world and she's never said no."" In other way-out-of-date-politician news: A report from two Republican groups finds 49% of female voters view the GOP ""unfavorably,"" including as ""intolerant,"" ""lacking in compassion,"" and ""stuck in the past."" That isn't likely to help the party if Clinton does indeed decide to run, Politico notes."

200,"['Scientists have long wanted to produce sperm and eggs in the laboratory to not only better understand this fundamental reproductive process but also to discover new ways of helping infertile couples conceive. Using embryonic stem (ES) cells, which in theory can produce all of the body\'s cell types, several teams made some progress in the past few years but were unable to produce viable sperm or eggs. Now a Kyoto University group has found a way to turn mouse ES cells into sperm precursor cells and to use the resulting sperm to produce normal mouse pups. Such research may eventually lead to treatments for human male infertility. But that will require resolving several ""very difficult"" technical and ethical issues, says stem cell biologist Mitinori Saitou, leader of the Kyoto team. \n \n Sperm and eggs develop from what are known as primordial germ cells. These germ cells are produced in early stage embryos in a mass of cells called the epiblast. Several years ago, researchers learned how to take epiblast cells from a mouse embryo and create epiblast stem cells that could regenerate in a dish for long periods of time. Researchers hoped that these epiblast stem cells could be used to produce primordial germ cells and ultimately fertile sperm and eggs. But despite years of attempts, no one succeeded. The Kyoto group concluded that when the lab-created epiblast stem cells gained their ability to grow in dishes, they may have lost their ability to form germ cells. \n \n So taking a different approach, the scientists cultured mouse ES cells in cocktails of growth factors and proteins to produce epliblast-like cells that they could keep alive only for several days. They found that they could use 2-day-old cells to generate primordial germ cell-like cells. When injected into the testes of mice unable to produce their own sperm, these primordial germ cells matured into sperm that were able to fertilize eggs in vitro. The researchers implanted the resulting embryos into surrogate mothers, which produced normal offspring. Those mice then produced their own offspring. Saitou and his colleagues report their work online today in Cell. \n \n ""All I can say is wow! It is a breakthrough,"" says Orly Lacham-Kaplan, a reproductive biologist at Monash University in Australia. The work provides evidence ""that ES cell-derived primordial germ cells can generate functional germ cells,"" says Amander Clark, a stem cell biologist at University of California, Los Angeles, who calls the work ""a critical advance to our basic understanding of the principles of germ cell development."" \n \n Saitou says that there are many hurdles to clear. They would like to learn how to develop sperm completely in the laboratory instead of injecting primordial germ cell-like cells into the testes for maturation. They also want to generate eggs in vitro, both to understand the process and to ultimately try to help infertile women. Saitou also says that extending the work to the clinic will require determining if the same recipe they figured out for mouse cells works for human cells as well.', ""Oscar Pistorius sits in court during his trial, in Pretoria, South Africa, Friday, Aug. 8, 2014.

(Associated Press)"", 'COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Ohio\'s marriage laws allowing underage teens to marry are too liberal and create potential for exploiting young girls, said an advocate for organization that\'s called for ending child marriage. \n \n Ohio requires teen girls to be at least 16 and males to be at least 18 before they can legally marry but allows for younger pregnant girls to wed with the permission of parents and juvenile courts, the Dayton Daily News has reported . \n \n The newspaper found that more than 4,400 girls age 17 or younger were married in Ohio between 2000 and 2015, including 59 who were 15 or younger. Three were just 14. \n \n The executive director of a national nonprofit advocating for ending child marriage says Ohio\'s law creates situations comparable to Yemen, Iran and Saudi Arabia. \n \n ""Shame on Ohio for having 16th Century laws still on the book,"" said Fraidy Reiss of Unchained At Last. \n \n People younger than 18 are allowed to marry in all 50 states, though some states, including Connecticut, New York and Texas, have recently adopted laws increasing the minimum age for marriage. \n \n Ohio State Rep. Jeff Rezabek, a Republican from Clayton who practices family and juvenile law, said underage girls marrying much older men raises questions about why judges and parents weren\'t pursuing other remedies in court. While the age of consent in Ohio is 16, an adult could be charged with unlawful sexual conduct with a minor for having sex with someone between the ages of 13 and 15. They would face rape charges for sex with anyone younger. \n \n The newspaper cited a 2012 study conducted by William & Mary law professor Vivian Hamilton that said teens lack maturity and skills to sustain a marriage. The study said marriages involving younger teens fail at a rate of 80 percent compared with 30 percent for those who marry after age 24. \n \n The newspaper\'s story highlighted a case of a pregnant Ohio 14-year-old who married a 48-year-old man in 2002. They remain married 15 years later and have three children. \n \n The now retired judge who permitted the marriage between Tessi and Richard Siders in southern Ohio\'s Gallia County said he ""vaguely"" recalls the case and acknowledged that prosecutors and children\'s protective services weren\'t involved. \n \n Montgomery County Juvenile Judge Anthony Capizzi said law enforcement should have been alerted when that case came before the court. \n \n Tessi Siders, now 29, said in an interview conducted by text that she doesn\'t regret having married at such a young age but probably wouldn\'t allow her children to do so. And she said Ohio should change its law to mandate that everyone be 18 before they can marry. \n \n ""Yes, some get pregnant before 18 but if the father truly loves her, he wait the years to marry her,"" she wrote. \n \n ___ \n \n Information from: Dayton Daily News, http://www.daytondailynews.com']",3,"– Researchers have managed to produce sperm cells from embryonic stem cells—and for the first time, the sperm worked, resulting in healthy baby mice. Researchers in Japan mixed the embryonic stem cells with certain proteins and hormones. They converted the resulting cells into germ cells, which they implanted in the testes of mice. There, they developed into working sperm, Discover reports. Researchers hope the discovery will lead to male infertility treatments, notes ScienceNow. Scientists had previously created sperm-like cells, but they didn’t function. Though the experiment was a success, “very difficult” issues remain—both physical and ethical, says a researcher. For one thing, the scientists would like to generate the sperm cells in the lab, without having to involve the mice at all. They hope to generate eggs, too. But questions remain over whether the process used for mice will work on humans."
201,"['Let the songwriting begin. \n \n After an intense couple months of dating, Taylor Swift and Conor Kennedy have broken up, a close friend of the singer-songwriter confirms exclusively to Us Weekly. \n \n PHOTOS: Taylor\'s fashion tribute to Jackie Kennedy Onassis \n \n ""They quietly parted ways a while ago,"" the friend explains of the ""We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together"" crooner, 22, and the high school senior, 18.

Download the Us Weekly iPhone app now!', 'Happy Taylor Swift Release Day! Have you already spent hours hunched over Red’s liner notes in an attempt to decode the messages hidden therein via Swift’s patented code: capital letters sprinkled throughout the lyrics of each song that spell out a clue? You are not alone in this guessing game. So, as is tradition whenever Swift drops a new album, Vulture now presents our best guesses as to who, exactly, Taylor Swift is singing about on each and every one of her new songs. If your name is Jake Gyllenhaal, you might just want to close the tab right now. \n \n 1. “State of Grace” \n \n Hidden Message: LOVE DOESN’T COUNT AFTER GOOD-BYE \n \n One of the main characters on Red is an ex-boyfriend who just would not leave poor Taylor Swift alone (he’ll pop up again on “All Too Well,” “I Almost Do,” and, of course, “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together”). Now, several of Taylor’s ex-boyfriends could be drunk-texting her at all hours of the night proclaiming their undying love, but it is more fun to assume that she’s talking about the same guy. And that guy, according to the code and the lyrics “twin fire signs and four blue eyes,” would be Jake Gyllenhaal. Jake’s birthday? December 19. Taylor’s birthday? December 13. That makes them both Sagittariuses, which is, of course, one of the three fire signs (read your Susan Miller.) Please remember this fact, because it will be important when we get to … \n \n \n \n 2. “Red” \n \n Hidden Message: SAG \n \n Could SAG stand for “Sagittarius?” Why, yes! Other possible interpretations: Screen Actor’s Guild, to which Jake Gyllenhaal definitely belongs; Sag Harbor, which seems like a place you would see Jake Gyllenhaal (John Mayer is more East Hamptons material); or “SAG” like sag wagon, which is apparently a cycling term and is therefore surely related to these photos of Jake Gyllenhaal in bike shorts. Anyway, it’s Jake. \n \n \n \n 3. “Treacherous” \n \n Hidden Message: WON’T STOP UNTIL IT’S OVER \n \n Not to spoil the later songs, but Conor Kennedy definitely gets a mention — and so we will assume that the lyrics “I will follow you home” are about how Taylor Swift literally followed Conor to his family’s Hyannis Port compound and then bought a home there. Also, “this slope is treacherous” could be about the beach path; Cape Cod is a little rocky. \n \n 4. “I Knew You Were Trouble” \n \n Hidden Message: WHEN YOU SAW ME DANCING \n \n Yeah, we have no idea who Taylor Swift goes clubbing (or wub-wubbing) with, so Vulture chooses to believe that the aforementioned dancing happened after Swift’s single reported date with One Direction heartthrob and noted womanizer Harry Styles. Then he went to Australia and made out with another girl, thus fulfilling the “you never loved me or her or anyone” portion of the lyrics. \n \n \n \n 5. “All Too Well” \n \n Hidden Message: MAPLE LATTES \n \n As Vulture’s Kyle Buchanan points out, “Taylor Swift and Jake Gyllenhaal Share Thanksgiving Maple Lattes” is the third result when you Google “maple lattes.” (The song is also just brutally specific, with references to hanging out at Maggie’s house and plaid days and the trip upstate when they went apple-picking. Advantage Swift.) \n \n 6. “22” \n \n Hidden Message: ASHLEY DIANNA CLAIRE SELENA \n \n GREENE AGRON CALLAWAY GOMEZ. Friendship! \n \n 7. “I Almost Do” \n \n Hidden Message: WROTE THIS INSTEAD OF CALLING \n \n “Each time you reach out, there’s no reply.” Smart money’s on Gyllenhaal. \n \n \n \n 8. “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together” \n \n Hidden Message: WHEN I STOPPED CARING WHAT YOU THOUGHT \n \n This makes a nice before/after with “I Almost Do,” so: Jake Gyllenhaal, you are officially the indie music snob. \n \n \n \n 9. “Stay Stay Stay” \n \n Hidden Message: DAYDREAMING ABOUT REAL LOVE \n \n This song is about a happy relationship, so it’s either Conor, or — based on the code — an imaginary boyfriend whom we will choose to believe is Ryan Gosling. Since paparazzi have not successfully snapped Conor Kennedy “carrying groceries,” Vulture’s gonna go with Ryan Gosling. (Related: The lyrics “Before you, I only dated self-indulgent takers/ who took all of their problems out on me. But you carry my groceries, and now I’m always laughing” are just the Taylor Swift–iest lyrics of all time.) \n \n \n \n 10. “The Last Time” \n \n Hidden Message: L.A. ON YOUR BREAK \n \n Who takes breaks? Actors take breaks from movies (Gyllenhaal, Taylor Lautner); musicians take breaks from tours or recording (Mayer); high-schoolers take breaks from Deerfield. But since L.A. does not really seem like a Kennedy vacation spot, this one goes in the Gyllenhaal column because of the protracted breakup references. \n \n \n \n 11. “Holy Ground” \n \n Hidden Message: WHEN YOU CAME TO THE SHOW IN S.D. \n \n Old-school ex Joe Jonas was spotted at Taylor Swift concerts in L.A. and San Jose, California. Is it then possible that he also attended a show in San Diego? Yes. More important: Is it possible that Taylor Swift could resist the opportunity to sing about her ex-boyfriend making a grand gesture? No. \n \n \n \n 12. “Sad Beautiful Tragic” \n \n Hidden Message: WHILE YOU WERE ON A TRAIN \n \n John Mayer seems like the kind of guy who would find it more romantic to travel by train, right? Also: John Mayer toured with Train — the band — in 2010. And “we both wake in lonely beds, and different cities” certainly sounds like a description of touring musicians. We’re giving it to Mayer. UPDATE: Commenter JJGrey informs us that Gyllenhaal “joined Mumford and Sons and Old Crow Medicine Show on their Railroad Revival Tour, literally on a train.” We were wrong, and we apologize for not being up on our Mumford trivia. \n \n \n \n 13. “The Lucky One” \n \n Hidden Message: WOULDN’T YOU LIKE TO KNOW \n \n Yes, we would like to know if and when the Joni Mitchell biopic is happening. (We are already pretty sure the song is about her.) \n \n \n \n 14. “Everything Has Changed” \n \n Hidden Message: HYIANNIS PORT \n \n This is a no-brainer — it’s Conor Kennedy! — but please look closely at the lyric sheet below. Following the caps-lock code, it would appear that she misspelled Hyannis Port? Or maybe that is how the homeowners spell it? \n \n \n \n 15. “Starlight” \n \n Hidden Message: FOR ETHEL \n \n In case you were not already aware that Taylor Swift and Ethel Kennedy are best friends. Why doesn’t this song mention “dragging”? \n \n \n \n 16. “Begin Again” \n \n Hidden Message: I WEAR HEELS NOW \n \n Just check the height on these maple latte photos — only a dude who just barely meets Taylor’s height would object to her wearing heels. Jake Gyllenhaal, who knew you were so cruel?', 'AP Tim Miller, a spokesman for Jon Huntsman\'s presidential campaign, had this response when asked if his candidate would participate in the Dec. 27 Newsmax debate moderated by Donald Trump: \n \n ""Lol. We look forward to watching Mitt and Newt suck-up to The Donald with a big bowl of popcorn,"" he said in an email to Business Insider. \n \n Huntsman declined to meet with Trump at his New York offices, his campaign said, though Trump said last month that it was he who declined to meet Huntsman. \n \n Deciding to sit-out the debate may help Huntsman with his message that he is the only adult in the GOP field. Another reason is more practical — Huntsman is wagering everything on New Hampshire, and leaving the state for even a day to debate in Iowa detracts from time he can spend wooing Granite State voters. \n \n His decision to withdraw from the CNN Nevada debate to protest the state\'s early primary was well-received in New Hampshire, where he is just beginning to show signs of life — breaking double-digits there for the first time in a poll released earlier this week.']",3,"– Prepare to spend your Thursday evening sobbing into a bowl of Rocky Road, because we are here to tell you that the epic Taylor Swift-Conor Kennedy romance has come to an end. Perhaps because she was cheating on him with his cousin? Not so; a friend insists to Us that ""it was just a distance thing. No hard feelings."" And it happened ""a while ago""—they haven't seen each other in more than a month—which is kinda sad, considering rumors of their relationship cropped up not even three months ago. Even so, the relationship apparently lasted long enough for Taylor to form such a strong bond with Ethel Kennedy that Taylor dedicated a song to Ethel on her new album."
202,"['Updated 6.15pm \n \n THE DÁIL IS to sit late tonight to pass emergency legislation in order to reclassify certain drugs, including ecstasy and magic mushrooms, as illegal following a court ruling this morning which has temporarily made them legal. \n \n A ruling in the Court of Appeal on the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 this morning effectively means that the possession of certain drugs, which had been illegal, is currently legal. \n \n The court ruling found that the 1977 Act was being added to via ministerial order without recourse to the Oireachtas, in violation of article 15 of the Constitution. \n \n Ministerial orders had been used nine times since the Act’s inception to outlaw the possession of drugs like ecstasy, ketamine, magic mushrooms, benzos and other drugs. \n \n Speaking to reporters today, Health Minister Leo Varadkar explained: “It is still the case that the sale, supply, export or import of such substances remains illegal, even now today.” \n \n The ruling could impact on a small number of current court cases that are being prosecuted under the 1977 Act. It will not impact on existing convictions under the Act. \n \n The ruling means that TDs must pass emergency legislation tonight in order to make these drugs illegal again. The bill will then go to the Seanad tomorrow. \n \n The new bill includes a provision that says it can only take effect on the day after it’s signed into law, meaning that the law will not come into force until 12am on Thursday. \n \n It’s understood that party whips were informed of the potential need for emergency legislation last week but were told it was “highly confidential” until the court ruling was handed down. \n \n The need for emergency legislation means that Sinn Fein’s private members’ bill, which calls for emigrants to be allowed vote in presidential elections, has been postponed to tomorrow evening between 6.30pm and 9.30pm. \n \n It’s now understood that the Misuse of Drugs Amendment Bill will be taken in the Dáil by Health Minister between 8pm and 11pm tonight. \n \n First published 12.08pm', 'Minister for Health Leo Varadkar has confirmed the Government is to rush through emergency legislation to ban the possession of certain drugs. \n \n Speaking to reporters at Leinster House on Tuesday, he confirmed the drugs included ecstasy, CAT, “magic mushrooms” and substances commonly known as head shop drugs. \n \n “My objective as Minister for Health is to protect public health and that’s why we are going to bring this emergency legislation to ban possession of these substances,” Mr Varadkar said. \n \n He stressed the sale, supply, import and export of the drugs remained illegal. \n \n Possession is technically legal, albeit temporarily, until the emergency legislation is passed, although it remains illegal to purchase the substances. \n \n Mr Varadkar said an appeal to the Supreme Court was under consideration by the Government, but a situation whereby nothing was done immediately could not be allowed. \n \n Referring to the drugs, he said: “They all have very significant health risks that outweigh any perceived recreational benefits.” \n \n The decision to rush through emergency legislation came after a court struck down the laws banning certain drugs. \n \n In what the Court of Appeal said was a “constitutional issue of far-reaching importance”, the three-judge court unanimously said a regulation making the possession of methylethcathinone illegal was invalid. It is also known as 4-Mec or Snow Blow. \n \n An explanatory memorandum issued by the Department of Health said that as a result of the judgment, “all substances controlled by means of Government Orders made under section 2(2) cease to be controlled with immediate effect, and their possession ceases to be an offence. These include ecstasy, benzodiazepines and new psychoactive substances, so-called ‘headshop drugs’. \n \n It said the judgment had “no implications” for approximately 125 substances, including cannabis, heroin and cocaine. \n \n Stanislav Bederev Judgment \n \n Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill 2015 \n \n In a statement, the Department said: “There is always a degree of uncertainty about the outcome of court cases. The outcome of this case does not affect existing laws regarding the supply, possession or sale of older drugs such as heroin, cocaine or cannabis. \n \n “It does affect the possession of certain newer psychoactive substances which have been added to the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 by successive governments. However, we are advised that sale and supply of psychoactive substances remains an offence under existing legislation. \n \n “The State successfully defended the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 in the original High Court hearing in March 2014. The matter was appealed to the Court of Appeal and the Government made preparations for a possible negative outcome. \n \n “This included the preparation of emergency legislation to be drafted in the event of a negative outcome for the State. It is now important from both a public health and criminal justice perspective that the legislation be enacted as soon as possible.” \n \n Mr Varadkar will introduce the legislation in the Dáil later on Tuesday and the intention is that it will pass through all stages in the Dáil and Seanad within 24 hours, the statement added. \n \n The court said earlier that Section 2(2) of the 1977 Misuse of Drugs Act, under which the regulation was brought in, was unconstitutional because it purports to vest in the Government law-making powers which are in the exclusive authority of the Oireachtas. \n \n The case concerned a prosecution of a man for possession of methylethcathinone which was among a number of substances put on the controlled drugs list in 2010. \n \n Stanislav Bederev, who is denying criminal charges of having the substance for supply in 2012, brought a High Court challenge seeking to stop his trial claiming the regulations were unconstitutional. \n \n Lawyers for Lithuanian-born Mr Bederev argued it was not lawful to put this substance on the controlled drug list because there are no principles and policies guiding the introduction of such rules. \n \n In particular, it was argued by his counsel Sunniva McDonagh, the decision to ban a particular drug was a matter to be considered by the Oireachtas before the relevant government minister could formally initiate the ban. \n \n Not to do so was an “abdication of the role of the Oireachtas” and an impermissible delegation of unfettered power where there were no guiding principles for doing so, it was claimed. \n \n Possession \n \n Mr Bederev had possessed something legal one day and the next was facing a possible prison sentence for something now illegal, it was argued. His trial before Blanchardstown District Court was on hold pending the legal challenge. \n \n The State opposed his application. \n \n Last May, the High Court rejected his challenge saying Section 2.2 of the 1977 Act cannot be read in isolation and must be read in the overall context and purpose of the Act which is to protect individuals and society from the misuse of certain harmful substances. \n \n The Oireachtas may not always be equipped or able to react with sufficient speed to deal with the emergence of new substances and misuse patterns, Mr Justice Paul Gilligan said in his High Court decision. \n \n On behalf of the Court of Appeal, Mr Justice Gerard Hogan said given what had been done in relation to this substance, it might also be asked whether it would be open to the Government to employ the same law to ban other types of drugs which are in everyday use and which are potentially harmful and liable to be misused such as alcohol and tobacco. \n \n Given the breadth of Section 2(2) of the 1977 Act, the Government is “more or less at large in determining which substances or products should be declared controlled drugs”. \n \n In the Bederev case, the judge said, the fundamental choice which remains with the Government, for the purposes of the 1977 Act, “is which dangerous or harmful drugs are liable to misuse such that they should be declared controlled drugs”. \n \n The use of terms such as “misuse”, “dangerous” and “harmful” in the title of the 1977 Act “represent laudable and desirable objectives. \n \n However, they do not in themselves constitute a sufficient restriction on the more or less unlimited power of regulation vested in the Government by Section 2(2) of the Act in relation to what substances should be declared controlled drugs, the judge said. \n \n The conclusion that this section of the Act purports to vest in the Government what, in the absence of appropriate principles and policies in the legislation itself, “are in truth law-making policies is accordingly unavoidable”.', 'The Minister for Health says dozens of people found guilty of drugs offences could now have their convictions overturned - and warned the supply, sale, import and export of ecstasy and other drugs remains illegal. \n \n Leo Varadkar is to bring an emergency bill before the Dáil tonight to restore the ban on drugs like ecstasy and ketamine. \n \n The ban on possession of over 100 drugs was overturned this morning when the Court of Appeal ruled the relevant law to be unconstitutional. \n \n Leo Varadkar, however, said the sale, supply and import of the drugs is still illegal, and only a small number of convictions could now be appealed. \n \n ""I\'m told it\'s dozens, but I can\'t say for certain because what they\'ll have to do now is go thought each individual case and see if the people ion question were charged just under this section of the act, or if they were charged with other acts as well."" \n \n Varadkar is to rush legislation through the Dáil and Seanad over the next few days to deal with possession of ecstasy, ketamine and benzodiazepines. \n \n Emergency legislation will go through the Dáil tonight and the Seanad tomorrow and be sent to the President for signature to restore the ban by Thursday on possession of the drugs. \n \n A statement released by the Department of Health, said there was ""always a degree of uncertainty about the outcome of court cases."" \n \n ""The outcome of this case does not affect existing laws regarding the supply, possession or sale of older drugs such as heroin, cocaine or cannabis. It does affect the possession of certain newer psychoactive substances."" \n \n “We had no way of knowing what the Court would decide today, but we prepared for this possibility. Legislation was prepared and approved in advance by Cabinet. The emergency legislation I am introducing today will re-instate the status quo ante and re-control all drugs that were controlled prior to this judgment,” Minister Varadkar said.']",3,"– A court ruling in Ireland has done a strange thing—legalized possession of certain psychoactive drugs such ecstasy, ketamine, and magic mushrooms. But the freedom is expected to last only about a day as lawmakers race to make the drugs illegal again, reports TheJournal.ie. The rush legislation became necessary after an appeals court today declared a 1977 drug law to be unconstitutional, though the ruling didn't affect older drugs such as marijuana, cocaine, and heroin, reports the Irish Examiner. Lawmakers knew the decision was potentially looming and had legislation prepared in advance, but it will take about 24 hours to get it in place. ""All substances controlled by means of Government Orders made under section 2(2) cease to be controlled with immediate effect, and their possession ceases to be an offense,"" says Ireland's Department of Health, as per the Irish Times. ""These include ecstasy, benzodiazepines, and new psychoactive substances, so-called 'headshop drugs.'"" While the loophole will be quickly fixed, the court's decision means that ""dozens"" of previous convictions have been called into question, says the nation's top health official. They'll have to be reviewed on a case-by-case basis."

204,"['Florida’s highest-ranking government officials are increasing the pressure on state police to get involved in the counting of ballots in heavily Democratic South Florida as Gov. Rick Scott clings to a lead over Bill Nelson during a statewide recount of their nationally relevant U.S. Senate contest. \n \n Attorneys for Scott’s campaign filed emergency motions Sunday requesting that embattled elections supervisors in Palm Beach and Broward counties turn over custody of their vote-tabulation machines and ballots to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and sheriff’s deputies during times when votes aren’t being counted. The motions come days after Scott claimed that “unethical liberals” in the two counties were trying to steal his election after late-developing returns narrowed his margins over Nelson and forced him into an ongoing statewide recount. \n \n Premium content for only $0.99 For the most comprehensive local coverage, subscribe today. SUBSCRIBE NOW \n \n Also on Sunday, Attorney General Pam Bondi told FDLE Commissioner Rick Swearingen in a letter that she was “deeply troubled” by his agency’s decision to decline Scott’s press conference request to investigate elections fraud in the two counties and urged him to reconsider. \n \n Scott has presented no evidence to back up his fraud allegations, and the Department of State has said its elections monitors have uncovered no criminal behavior. But amid a high-stakes battle over each of the 8.3 million votes cast in Tuesday’s midterms, Scott’s campaign is continuing to lean hard on the elections process in a densely populated area of the state that could make or break his 12,562-vote lead. \n \n Letter+to+Swearingen by Dave Wilson on Scribd \n \n “As long as the Supervisor of Elections has unsupervised, unaccountable, and unfettered access to the ballot boxes, she will be able to destroy evidence of any errors, accidents, or unlawful conduct — making it nearly impossible for an aggrieved party to prosecute their claims or discover later what has actually occurred in the electoral process,” attorney Jason Zimmerman wrote in the complaint filed against Broward Supervisor or Elections Brenda Snipes. \n \n SHARE COPY LINK Broward Circuit Judge Carol-Lisa Phillips also held that Brenda Snipes, Broward’s supervisor of elections, was in violation of Florida public-records laws for not turning over the records requested by Gov. Rick Scott’s campaign for U.S. Senate. \n \n Democrats, who’ve accused Scott and Republican attorneys of voter suppression, reacted harshly. Mark Herron, an election lawyer who represented Al Gore in the 2000 presidential recount, called Scott’s push to involve state police an “abuse of power.” Joe Geller, a Miami state representative and election lawyer called it an “extraordinary” and unwarranted request, although courts in New York recently ordered ballots impounded in a congressional race at the request of Democratic frontrunner Anthony Brindisi. \n \n Letter+to+Detzner by on Scribd \n \n Scott’s campaigns filed the lawsuits — including a third that seeks to invalidate any ballots counted in Broward after Saturday’s deadline to submit unofficial results — as elections departments around the state hustled Sunday to try and meet a 3 p.m. Thursday deadline to recount the ballots cast during the state’s midterm elections. Recounts were also ordered in contests for governor and commissioner of agriculture due to a state law that requires a machine recount for any statewide election decided by a half of a percentage point or less. \n \n Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, left, and Republican Gov. Rick Scott. \n \n Starting Saturday, Miami-Dade had employees working 24 hours a day to finish the process. Broward and Palm Beach have struggled. Machine troubles delayed the start of Broward’s recount operations until late Sunday morning. The Palm Beach Post reported that Palm Beach County Supervisor of Elections Susan Bucher warned this weekend that Thursday’s deadline will be “impossible” to meet, presenting the possibility that her unofficial results provided to the state on Saturday will stand. \n \n Interjecting state and local police into the mix could complicate the timeline. \n \n “In suing to seize ballots and impound voting machines, Rick Scott is doing his best to impersonate Latin American dictators who have overthrown Democracies in Venezuela and Cuba,” said Florida Democratic Party Executive Director Juan Peñalosa in an emailed statement Sunday evening. “The governor is using his position to consolidate power by cutting at the very core of our democracy.” \n \n But missteps by Bucher and Snipes, at the very least, have opened the door to warranted skepticism. \n \n Scott last week won court orders from judges in both counties after he alleged in lawsuits that Bucher was improperly conducting activities involving ballots in private that should have been performed in front of the canvassing board, the body responsible for overseeing the ballot-counting process and ruling on ballots of questionable validity. \n \n Snipes, who has been repeatedly slapped by judges over gaffes in recent years, was ordered by a judge to provide information related to uncounted ballots and issues after she repeatedly declined to provide basic details about her operations to the press or the candidates. \n \n Snipes’ staff also managed to mix up 22 invalid provisional ballots with 183 valid ones this week, and included the votes deemed illegitimate by the Broward County canvassing board in her unofficial vote total to the state. In a conference call with reporters, Tim Cerio, an elections attorney representing Scott in South Florida, noted that the only reasons the problematic ballots were discovered in the first place is because attorneys observing the canvassing board demanded that Snipes present the ballots to the board. \n \n “We’re going to stand up to those who would violate the law and particularly those with a rampant history of voter fraud,” said U.S. Sen. Cory Gardner, chairman of the Republican Senate campaign committee. \n \n The recounted vote tallies in South Florida could prove crucial in the ongoing recounts. Once recounted vote tallies are submitted to the state Thursday, any races still within one quarter of 1 percent will be subject to an automatic hand recount, during which so-called “under-votes” and “over-votes” — ballots in which voters chose too few or too many candidates — will be reviewed ballot by ballot by canvassing boards. \n \n While former congressman Ron DeSantis is far enough ahead of Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum that a hand recount is unlikely to occur in the race for governor, Scott and Nelson are expecting to continue fighting on into the weekend. Hand recount tallies would be due by Nov. 18. And South Florida, a heavily Democratic region of the state, contains more than 35,000 ballots that are considered under-votes in the Senate race. Nelson’s campaign is also fighting to include ballots rejected over signature mismatches in voting totals. \n \n With so much attention paid to Broward County, protesters have been virtually camped outside Snipes’ Lauderhill office for three days. An angry crowd shouted down Florida Sen. Perry Thurston and Florida Democratic Party attorney Mitchell Berger when they appeared in a make-shift “free speech zone” designated in the parking lot outside to address the media Sunday afternoon. \n \n “Everyone wants these votes counted,” Berger said, arguing that hundreds of mail-in ballots were caught up in an Opa-locka mail center and not counted due to a federal investigation of the Aventura man who sent more than a dozen pipe bombs to Democrats around the state. \n \n \n \n \n \n “Fake news,” someone shouted. “More Democratic lies,” another yelled. \n \n \n \n \n \n Berger said he and a Republican counterpart, lawyer William Scherer representing Scott’s senate campaign, both observed the recount process Sunday morning and decided it was all above board. “We both agree there’s no fraud going on,” he said, to jeers and laughter. \n \n Inside Snipes’ headquarters, Eugene Pettis, attorney for Broward’s Supervisor of Elections office, said there will be a hearing in front of a judge sometime Monday to discuss the issue of ballot and voting machine custody. \n \n “They have control here,” Pettis said, referring to the law enforcement officers watching the process and the elections monitors watching the process for the last few weeks. \n \n Scott on Sunday seemed to soften his allegations of fraud after he was criticized when he asked the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to investigate Snipes and Bucher. That criticism grew in volume when the FDLE declined to investigate, saying it had received no formal request from Scott or evidence of fraud. State elections monitors in Broward County also reported that they had reported no evidence of criminal behavior. \n \n But Republicans remain concerned, and Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi on Sunday wrote a letter urging the head of FDLE to investigate Snipes and Bucher. \n \n “I am deeply troubled by our announcement that you will not pursue any investigation or inquiry into clearly documented irregularities in the conduct of election officials in Broward and Palm Beach counties in the 2018 elections,” Bondi wrote to FDLE Commissioner Rick Swearingen. \n \n Snipes remains adamant that she has done nothing wrong, and defiant in the face of criticism. Critics also note that Scott could have sought to remove her from office during his eight years as governor over the litany of issues with her office cited in his recent lawsuits. \n \n Ironically, another embattled elected Broward Democrat — Sheriff Scott Israel — would have oversight of ballots if the Scott campaign gets its way. \n \n Supervisors have until Thursday to submit machine recount totals. Under Florida law, any hand recount totals would be due Nov. 18. Final results are to be certified on Nov. 20 by Florida’s Elections Canvassing Commission. The board consists of two members of the Florida Cabinet — and Gov. Rick Scott. \n \n This article has been updated to note that ballots have been impounded in the race for the 22nd congressional district of New York. \n \n Miami Herald reporters Glenn Garvin, Maya Kaufman and Carli Teproff contributed to this report.', 'Broward Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes, left, and judge Betsy Benson of the election canvassing board, listen to arguments, Sunday, Nov. 11, 2018, at the Broward Supervisor of Elections office... (Associated Press) \n \n Broward Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes, left, and judge Betsy Benson of the election canvassing board, listen to arguments, Sunday, Nov. 11, 2018, at the Broward Supervisor of Elections office in Lauderhill, Fla. (Joe Cavaretta /South Florida Sun-Sentinel via AP) (Associated Press) \n \n FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — Mishaps, protests and litigation are overshadowing the vote recount in Florida\'s pivotal races for governor and Senate, reviving memories of the 2000 presidential fiasco in the premier political battleground state. \n \n All 67 counties are facing a state-ordered deadline of Thursday to complete their recounts and half already had begun. Many other counties were expected to begin the work Monday after a weekend of recount drama in Broward and Palm Beach counties, home to large concentrations of Democratic voters. \n \n The developments added up to a tumultuous political day in Florida. More than half of Florida\'s 67 counties began a recount process that\'s unprecedented even in a state notorious for settling elections by razor-thin margins. State officials said they weren\'t aware of any other time a race for governor or U.S. Senate required a recount, let alone both in the same election. \n \n In Broward County, the recount was delayed for hours Sunday because of a problem with one of the tabulation machines. That prompted the Republican Party to slam Broward\'s supervisor of elections, Brenda Snipes, for ""incompetence and gross mismanagement."" \n \n Broward officials faced further headaches after acknowledging the county mistakenly counted 22 absentee ballots that had been rejected. The problem seemed impossible to fix because dismissed ballots were mixed in with 205 legal ballots and Snipes said it would be unfair to throw out all the votes. \n \n Gov. Rick Scott, the Republican candidate for Senate, filed suit against Snipes. He was seeking a court order for law enforcement agents to impound all voting machines, tallying devices and ballots ""when not in use until such time as any recounts."" The suit accused Snipes of repeatedly failing to account for the number of ballots left to be counted and failing to report results regularly as required by law. \n \n The court didn\'t immediately respond, though the outcry from Democrats was immediate. \n \n Juan Penalosa, executive director of the Florida Democratic Party, accused Scott of ""using his position to consolidate power by cutting at the very core of our democracy."" \n \n Meanwhile, in Palm Beach County, the supervisor of elections said she didn\'t think her department could meet Thursday\'s deadline to complete that recount, throwing into question what would happen to votes there. \n \n The recount in other major population centers, including Miami-Dade and Pinellas and Hillsborough counties in the Tampa Bay area, has been continuing without incident. Smaller counties were expected to begin reviews between Monday and Wednesday. \n \n State officials said they weren\'t aware of any other time a race for governor or U.S. Senate required a recount, let alone both in the same election. The recount process in the two nationally watched midterm races is unprecedented even in a state notorious for settling elections by razor-thin margins. \n \n Unofficial results showed Republican former U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis led Democratic Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum by 0.41 percentage points in the governor\'s contest. In the Senate race, Scott\'s lead over Democratic incumbent Bill Nelson was 0.14 percentage points. \n \n State law requires a machine recount in races where the margin is less than 0.5 percentage points. Once completed, if the differences in any of the races are 0.25 percentage points or below, a hand recount will be ordered. \n \n As the recount unfolded, Republicans urged their Democratic opponents to give up and let the state to move on. \n \n Scott said Sunday that Nelson wants fraudulent ballots and those cast by noncitizens to count, pointing to a Nelson lawyer objecting to Palm Beach County\'s rejection of one provisional ballot because it was cast by a noncitizen. \n \n ""He is trying to commit fraud to win this election,"" Scott told Fox News. ""Bill Nelson\'s a sore loser. He\'s been in politics way too long."" \n \n Nelson\'s campaign issued a statement later saying their lawyer wasn\'t authorized to object to the ballot\'s rejection as ""Non-citizens cannot vote in US elections."" \n \n In Fort Lauderdale, Gillum appeared at a predominantly African-American church Sunday evening, warning against vote suppression and declaring voter disenfranchisement isn\'t just about being blocked from the polling booth. He said it also includes absentee ballots not being counted and ballots with mismatched signatures that ""a volunteer may have the option of ... deciding that vote is null and void."" \n \n Gillum and Nelson have argued each vote should be counted and the process should take its course. \n \n Both the state elections division, which Scott runs, and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement have said they have found no evidence of voter fraud. \n \n That didn\'t stop protests outside Snipes\' office, where a crowd of mostly Republicans gathered, holding signs, listening to country music and occasionally chanting ""lock her up,"" referring to Snipes. A massive Trump 2020 flag flew over the parking lot and many members of a Bikers For Trump group wore matching shirts, mingling among a crowd that included a protester wearing a Hillary Clinton mask. \n \n Registered independent Russell Liddick, a 38-year-old Pompano Beach retail worker, carried a sign reading, ""I\'m not here for Trump! I\'m here for fair elections! Fire Snipes!"" He said the office\'s problems ""don\'t make me feel very much like my vote counted."" \n \n Florida is also conducting a recount in a third statewide race. Democrat Nikki Fried had a 0.07 percentage point lead over Republican state Rep. Matt Caldwell for agriculture commissioner, one of Florida\'s three Cabinet seats. \n \n For some, the recounts bring back memories of the 2000 presidential recount, when it took more than five weeks for Florida to declare George W. Bush the victor over Vice President Al Gore by 537 votes, thus giving Bush the presidency. \n \n Much has changed since then. \n \n In 2000, each county had its own voting system. Many used punch cards — voters poked out chads, leaving tiny holes in their ballots representing their candidates. Some voters, however, didn\'t fully punch out the presidential chad or gave it just a little push. Those hanging and dimpled chads had to be examined by the canvassing boards, a lengthy, tiresome and often subjective process that became fodder for late-night comedians. \n \n Now the state requires all Florida counties to use ballots where voters use a pen to mark their candidate\'s name, much like a student taking a multiple-choice test. And how counts proceed is now clearly spelled out. \n \n ___ \n \n AP writers Tamara Lush in St. Petersburg and Brendan Farrington in Tallahassee contributed to this report. \n \n ___ \n \n For AP\'s complete coverage of the U.S. midterm elections: http://apne.ws/APPolitics', 'Speaking Tuesday night in Brooklyn, blocks away from his company headquarters and his father’s apartment, Spike Lee went off on how the neighborhood has changed. The filmmaker, wearing a Knicks beanie, orange socks, blue Nikes, and “Defend Brooklyn” hoodie, was at Pratt Institute for a lecture in honor of African American History Month, surrounded by locals, when he was nearly asked a question about “the other side” of the gentrification debate. “Let me just kill you right now,” Lee interrupted, “because there was some bullshit article in the New York Times saying ‘the good of gentrification.’” (See: “Argument Over a Brownstone Neighborhood” and New York’s “Is Gentrification All Bad?”) \n \n \n \n “I don’t believe that,” said Lee. And for the next seven minutes he explained, with passion, humor, and a fair amount of f-words. \n \n Here’s the thing: I grew up here in Fort Greene. I grew up here in New York. It’s changed. And why does it take an influx of white New Yorkers in the south Bronx, in Harlem, in Bed Stuy, in Crown Heights for the facilities to get better? The garbage wasn’t picked up every motherfuckin’ day when I was living in 165 Washington Park. P.S. 20 was not good. P.S. 11. Rothschild 294. The police weren’t around. When you see white mothers pushing their babies in strollers, three o’clock in the morning on 125th Street, that must tell you something. \n \n [Audience member: And I don’t dispute that … ] \n \n Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. And even more. Let me kill you some more. \n \n [Audience member: Can I talk about something?] \n \n Not yet. \n \n Then comes the motherfuckin’ Christopher Columbus Syndrome. You can’t discover this! We been here. You just can’t come and bogart. There were brothers playing motherfuckin’ African drums in Mount Morris Park for 40 years and now they can’t do it anymore because the new inhabitants said the drums are loud. My father’s a great jazz musician. He bought a house in nineteen-motherfuckin’-sixty-eight, and the motherfuckin’ people moved in last year and called the cops on my father. He’s not — he doesn’t even play electric bass! It’s acoustic! We bought the motherfuckin’ house in nineteen-sixty-motherfuckin’-eight and now you call the cops? In 2013? Get the fuck outta here! \n \n Nah. You can’t do that. You can’t just come in the neighborhood and start bogarting and say, like you’re motherfuckin’ Columbus and kill off the Native Americans. Or what they do in Brazil, what they did to the indigenous people. You have to come with respect. There’s a code. There’s people. \n \n You can’t just — here’s another thing: When Michael Jackson died they wanted to have a party for him in motherfuckin’ Fort Greene Park and all of a sudden the white people in Fort Greene said, “Wait a minute! We can’t have black people having a party for Michael Jackson to celebrate his life. Who’s coming to the neighborhood? They’re gonna leave lots of garbage.” Garbage? Have you seen Fort Greene Park in the morning? It’s like the motherfuckin’ Westminster Dog Show. There’s 20,000 dogs running around. Whoa. So we had to move it to Prospect Park! \n \n I mean, they just move in the neighborhood. You just can’t come in the neighborhood. I’m for democracy and letting everybody live but you gotta have some respect. You can’t just come in when people have a culture that’s been laid down for generations and you come in and now shit gotta change because you’re here? Get the fuck outta here. Can’t do that! \n \n And then! [to audience member] Whoa whoa whoa. And then! So you’re talking about the people’s property change? But what about the people who are renting? They can’t afford it anymore! You can’t afford it. People want live in Fort Greene. People wanna live in Clinton Hill. The Lower East Side, they move to Williamsburg, they can’t even afford fuckin’, motherfuckin’ Williamsburg now because of motherfuckin’ hipsters. What do they call Bushwick now? What’s the word? [Audience: East Williamsburg] \n \n That’s another thing: Motherfuckin’… These real estate motherfuckers are changing names! Stuyvestant Heights? 110th to 125th, there’s another name for Harlem. What is it? What? What is it? No, no, not Morningside Heights. There’s a new one. [Audience: SpaHa] What the fuck is that? How you changin’ names? \n \n And we had the crystal ball, motherfuckin’ Do the Right Thing with John Savage’s character, when he rolled his bike over Buggin’ Out’s sneaker. I wrote that script in 1988. He was the first one. How you walking around Brooklyn with a Larry Bird jersey on? You can’t do that. Not in Bed Stuy. \n \n So, look, you might say, “Well, there’s more police protection. The public schools are better.” Why are the public schools better? First of all, everybody can’t afford — even if you have money it’s still hard to get your kids into private school. Everybody wants to go to Saint Ann’s — you can’t get into Saint Ann’s. You can’t get into Friends. What’s the other one? In Brooklyn Heights. Packer. If you can’t get your child into there … It’s crazy. There’s a business now where people — you pay — people don’t even have kids yet and they’re taking this course about how to get your kid into private school. I’m not lying! If you can’t get your kid into private school and you’re white here, what’s the next best thing? All right, now we’re gonna go to public schools. \n \n So, why did it take this great influx of white people to get the schools better? Why’s there more police protection in Bed Stuy and Harlem now? Why’s the garbage getting picked up more regularly? We been here! \n \n All right, go ahead. Let’s see you come back to that.']",3,"– With an unprecedented double recount underway in Florida, Gov. Rick Scott is fighting to get state police involved. The Republican governor—who is clinging to a slim lead in his Senate race with Democratic rival Bill Nelson—filed lawsuits Sunday calling for elections officials in Palm Beach and Broward counties to turn ballots, voting machines, and vote-counting machines over to law enforcement at times when votes aren't being counted, reports Reuters. Scott has claimed that ""unethical liberals"" in the two heavily Democratic counties are trying to steal the election, in which he currently has a lead of just 12,562 votes over Nelson, the Miami Herald reports. One of Scott's lawsuits warned that Broward Supervisor of Elections Brenda Snipes could ""destroy evidence of any errors, accidents, or unlawful conduct"" if she had ""unsupervised, unaccountable, and unfettered access to the ballot boxes."" Florida Democrats reacted angrily, calling the move to involve police an ""abuse of power,"" the Herald reports. State police and election officials say they have found no evidence of fraud, though protesters, some of them holding pro-Trump signs or chanting ""Lock her up,"" still gathered outside Snipes' office on Sunday, the AP reports. A recount is also happening in the governor's race. (Palm Beach County officials say it will be ""impossible"" to meet the Thursday recount deadline.)"
205,"['Emma Stone: ‘I was holding my best actress card the whole time’ \n \n ""La La Land"" producer Jordan Horowitz interrupts the Oscars telecast Sunday night to announce that ""Moonlight,"" not ""La La Land"" was the real winner for best picture. | ABC \n \n As the gold dust was still settling over the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood following the mistake by presenters Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway during the best picture Oscar announcement, some late developments: \n \n UPDATE: Just after midnight PST, the accounting firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers (the company that for decades has tallied the Oscar votes), released a statement apologizing for the gaffe: “We sincerely apologize to “Moonlight,” “La La Land,” Warren Beatty, Faye Dunaway, and Oscar viewers for the error that was made during the award announcement for Best Picture. The presenters had mistakenly been given the wrong category envelope and when discovered, was immediately corrected. We are currently investigating how this could have happened, and deeply regret that this occurred.” \n \n — Best actress Oscar-winner Emma Stone told reporters backstage at the Oscars telecast that “Of course it was an amazing thing to hear ‘La La Land.’ We would have loved to have won best picture. But we are so excited for ‘Moonlight.’ I think it’s one of the best films of all time. I was also holding my ‘best actress in a leading role’ card that entire time. So whatever story, I don’t mean to start stuff, but whatever story that was, I had that card.” \n \n — There are two sets of cards for every award, so there is the likelihood that Beatty and Dunaway were handed the wrong envelope. Host Jimmy Kimmel had come forward to inform the cast that “Moonlight” had indeed won, showing the inside of the envelope as proof. “I knew I would screw this up,” said Kimmel, a first-time host. (A closeup of the envelope Beatty was holding shows it is indeed labled “Actress in a Leading Role”) \n \n — According to the L.A. Times, Beatty “explained that the reason it had taken him so long to read the card was because he was looking at something that said Emma Stone had won. At that point, he showed it to Dunaway, who announced “La La Land.” Beatty assured viewers that the error was unintentional and he wasn’t trying to turn the biggest award into a joke.” \n \n — It’s not the first time the wrong category winner was an issue at the Oscars. In 1964, Sammy Davis Jr. was handed an envelope for the wrong award, according to ABC News. “Representatives from Oscar’s counting unit at Price Waterhouse had to rush onstage to stop him from blurting out a mistake.

(Photo by Matt Sayles/Invision/AP) (Associated Press) \n \n LOS ANGELES (AP) — It was one of the most awkward moments in the history of the Oscars, of television, in entertainment, heck maybe in American history. \n \n And somehow Warren Beatty, Hollywood\'s ultimate smooth leading man, was at the center of it, and the accounting firm that is responsible for the integrity of Oscar voting apologized and was vowing a full investigation. \n \n The producers of ""La La Land"" were nearly done with their acceptance speeches for Best Picture, the Oscar broadcast\'s credits sequence about to roll, when a stir of whispers began on stage. Moments later ""La La Land"" producer Jordan Horowitz returned to the microphone and said ""Moonlight won Best Picture"" and insisting that ""this is not a joke."" \n \n The collective jaw of the crowd at the Dolby Theatre — and of America — remained dropped long after they became convinced it was no joke, but what academy historians later called an apparently unprecedented Oscar error. The accounting firm PwC, formerly Price Waterhouse Coopers, said early Monday that Beatty and Dunaway had been given the wrong envelope. \n \n ""We sincerely apologize to \'Moonlight,\' \'La La Land,\' Warren Beatty, Faye Dunaway, and Oscar viewers for the error that was made during the award announcement for Best Picture,"" a statement from the firm said. ""The presenters had mistakenly been given the wrong category envelope and when discovered, was immediately corrected. We are currently investigating how this could have happened, and deeply regret that this occurred."" \n \n The statement came several hours after the chaotic ending, which featured Beatty returning to the mic to explain that he had opened the envelope and he was confused when it read ""Emma Stone, La La Land."" He had shown it to co-presenter Faye Dunaway briefly, as though he wanted her to read it, which she did, apparently assuming the Emma Stone part was off but the ""La La"" part correct. \n \n ""It\'s one of the strangest things that\'s ever happened to me,"" Beatty said backstage. ""Thank God there were two of us up there,"" Dunaway responded. \n \n The actress then asked Beatty, ""Who else should I tell?"" \n \n ""Everybody,"" he said. \n \n At that point, a security guard tried to take the real envelope and Beatty said, ""Security is not getting this. I\'m giving it to (Moonlight director) Barry Jenkins at a later time."" Beatty also refused to show it to anyone else. \n \n ABC News, tweeting about the ceremony broadcast on its network, said the envelope held by Beatty read, ""Actress in a leading role."" A close-up photo of Beatty onstage verified that. \n \n PwC has counted votes and provides winner envelopes for the Oscars and has done so for more than 80 years. \n \n When the firm\'s representatives realized the mistake, they raced onstage to right it, but too late, officials told The Associated Press. \n \n The result was a bizarre scene with the entire cast of both movies standing together on stage exchanging sympathetic awkward stares and hugs. \n \n The crowd had to rouse itself from its stunned stupor to try to give ""Moonlight"" its just due for winning the big award. And as the credits rolled, usually bringing sweet relief after a long night, people appeared hesitant to leave in their disbelief. \n \n ""It made a very special feeling even more special, but not in the way I expected,"" a bemused Jenkins, co-writer and director of ""Moonlight,"" said backstage. \n \n ""The folks at \'La La Land\' were so gracious,"" he added. ""I can\'t imagine being in their position and having to do that."" \n \n Filmmaker Kenneth Lonergan, who won a best screenplay award for ""Manchester by the Sea,"" cracked wise backstage: ""It turns out that we actually won best picture, which we\'re really happy about,"" he said. \n \n The ceremony\'s chaotic scene immediately raced to the top of all-time Oscar moments, far more stunning than the nude man who raced across the stage in 1974 as part of the ""streaking"" fad. \n \n And it immediately evoked Steve Harvey\'s recent gaffe of naming the wrong Miss Universe winner. \n \n The Miss Universe Twitter account quickly let the Oscars know they felt their pain. \n \n ""Have your people call our people, we know what to do,"" the tweet read. \n \n That was the beginning of a Tweet pile-on that may be the biggest of all time, with many declaring that ""La La Land"" won the popular vote while ""Moonlight"" won the electoral college. \n \n But this stage, and this audience, were far, far bigger and are likely to last far, far longer in collective memory. \n \n ___ \n \n AP writers Lynn Elber, Beth Harris and Lindsey Bahr contributed to this report.', 'How could the wrong film have been named as the winner of the Oscars’ most important award? Here are the pictures that tell the story \n \n Anatomy of an Oscars fiasco: how La La Land was mistakenly announced as best picture \n \n It will go down in Oscars history as the most awkward, embarrassing moment of all time: an extraordinary failure in the Oscars voting procedure. The traditional high point of the marathon Oscars telecast collapsed in ignominy as organisers were forced to acknowledge that the wrong film – La La Land – had been named best picture winner, instead of the actual victor, Moonlight. We piece together the sequence of events that led to the chaotic scenes. \n \n 1. Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty emerge from the back of the stage to announce the best picture win. \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Kevin Winter/Getty Images \n \n 2. A close-up photograph shows Beatty is clearly carrying a winner’s envelope for best actress – the award for which (to La La Land’s Emma Stone) has just taken place. \n \n 3. Beatty begins to read out the winners card, and is obviously puzzled by what he is reading, looking in the envelope to see if there is anything else in there. \n \n 4.

By now, the La La Land team know they havn’t actually won. Producer Fred Berger takes over the mic and gives a speech anyway, finishing with: “We lost.” Behind him, the representatives of PricewaterhouseCoopers, who oversee the Oscar vote – Brian Cullinan (holding envelope) and Martha Ruiz (in red dress) – are on stage, examining the envelopes. The accountancy firm have apologised and promised an investigation. \n \n 7. Horowitz holds up his hand to stop the celebrations as the La La Land crew acknowledge that they haven’t won. “This is not a joke,” he tells the audience. \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Kevin Winter/Getty Images \n \n 8.

Moonlight is clearly the winner. \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Mark Ralston/AFP/Getty Images \n \n 9. As the Moonlight team come forward, Beatty steps out front to explain to Kimmel and the La La Land team what happened. The card he had been given, he says, read “Emma Stone, La La Land”. “I wasn’t trying to be funny.” \n \n 10. Horowitz hands his Oscar to Barry Jenkins, Moonlight’s director. \n \n \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Kevin Winter/Getty Images \n \n 11. Jenkins closes the show by summing up the extraordinary turn of events. “Even in my dreams this could not be true. But to hell with it, I’m done with dreams – because this is true.”', 'Oscars? Meh. Booooring. La La Land, the hot favourite, won 7, just as everyone guessed. Any hope of a sneak upset was dashed when Faye Dunaway read out the… \n \n Wait. There’s confusion. Hold up a second. The wrong envelope? What? What just happened? What is Warren Beatty trying to explain just happened? Can this possibly be true? \n \n In a last-ditch twist so universally jaw-dropping that M. Night Shyamalan has already – quite genuinely – taken credit for it on Twitter, the actual winner of Best Picture was not La La Land at all. It was Moonlight. \n \n It took an incredible several minutes for this monumental screw-up to be witnessed, addressed and rectified. In this time, the poor La La Land producers had time to thank their agents, their wives, and everyone else in the room while we sat and yawned. Then one of them stepped in with big, urgent news. “This is not a joke,” he was forced to explain. “Moonlight won.” \n \n In came Beatty again. Suddenly it all made sense. He had stared inside the envelope in such bafflement, groping within in case it contained something he couldn’t initially find. It looked like he was horsing around, but he was clearly just confused. He was holding the one that said “Emma Stone, La La Land” inside it. And Faye Dunaway saw the last three words, and fatefully delivered them to the world. \n \n But Moonlight – truly the year’s *best* picture – was the title inside the envelope they should have been given. Moonlight! For it to win in this fashion was an insane coup, a heaven-sent miracle for the movie’s fans. We will pore over this footage for years, scrutinising every detail. The Oscars have never dealt a surprise like this, in 90 years, not once. Narrative drama in any format may have just peaked. And every jaw in Hollywood is still being scraped off the floor.', 'What happened at the Oscars is unprecedented. \n \n The night’s biggest award — Best Picture — was handed to the wrong film, presumed frontrunner La La Land, because presenters Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway were given the wrong envelope. It bore the name of La La Land’s Emma Stone, who had won Best Actress moments before. \n \n The three credited producers for La La Land were almost through their triumphant speeches — indeed, the third, Fred Berger, was in the middle of speaking — when producer Jordan Horowitz was forced to take the microphone and say the film had lost to Moonlight. \n \n Report from @JeffreyLAT backstage: Mid @LaLaLand acceptance, stage hand in wings said ""Oh, f-ck. Oh my God. He got the wrong envelope."" — Amy Kaufman (@AmyKinLA) February 27, 2017 \n \n Essentially everybody involved appeared to believe, initially, that it was a joke, from the moment that Beatty — clearly flummoxed by having an envelope that read “Emma Stone” — tried to make sense of what had happened, only to have the crowd (and his co-presenter Dunaway) think he was unnecessarily prolonging the announcement, to the moment when Berger said, “By the way, we lost.” \n \n PricewaterhouseCoopers, the accounting firm that counts the Oscar ballots, issued a statement taking the blame for the mix-up: \n \n We sincerely apologize to Moonlight, La La Land, Warren Beatty, Faye Dunaway, and Oscar viewers for the error that was made during the award announcement for Best Picture. The presenters had mistakenly been given the wrong category envelope and when discovered, was immediately corrected. We are currently investigating how this could have happened, and deeply regret that this occurred. We appreciate the grace with which the nominees, the Academy, ABC, and Jimmy Kimmel handled the situation. \n \n On Monday, it further clarified the situation in another statement: \n \n PwC takes full responsibility for the series of mistakes and breaches of established protocols during last night’s Oscars. PwC Partner Brian Cullinan mistakenly handed the back-up envelope for Actress in a Leading Role instead of the envelope for Best Picture to presenters Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway. Once the error occurred, protocols for correcting it were not followed through quickly enough by Mr. Cullinan or his partner. \n \n Variety has much more on the mix-up. \n \n In the moment, though, it was chaos. It’s never happened in the 89-year history of the Oscars (much less in the biggest category), and it seemingly disproved one of the longest-running Oscar urban legends. \n \n The Oscars have a procedure for what happens if the wrong name is read — but it apparently doesn’t work that well \n \n Only two people know the names of the Oscar winners before the envelopes are opened and read. They’re always two accountants from PricewaterhouseCoopers, the firm that tabulates Oscar votes, and they carry the results in the famed briefcases that make their way down the red carpet every year. \n \n PWC’s methods for tabulation are said to be quite rigorous, with lots of double checks and redundancies built into their system, which is designed to make sure the right winner is placed into every envelope. But the firm’s method for correcting the situation if the wrong envelope is handed to the presenters — as apparently happened with Beatty and Dunaway — is clearly not as foolproof. \n \n As one of those two PWC accountants explains: \n \n I guess Warren and Leo came from opposite sides https://t.co/wOcicSEg5C pic.twitter.com/EUEf1nO2gi — Ev Williams (@ev) February 27, 2017 \n \n Essentially, the PWC accountants say that in the event of a mix-up, they would signal to a stage manager that the wrong name had been read, and the stage manager would then find a way to halt the proceedings on stage. Indeed, this bit of Oscar trivia is so popular as a “what if” that stories are written about it in the press every year — what would happen if the wrong envelope were opened, or a presenter just decided to take matters into their own hands? \n \n “We would make sure that the correct person was known very quickly. Whether that entails stopping the show, us walking onstage, us signaling to the stage manager — that’s really a game-time decision, if something like that were to happen. Again, it’s so unlikely,” Brian Cullinan, one of the two accountants (the other is Martha Ruiz) who knew the winners for this year’s awards, told the Huffington Post mere days ago. \n \n And, granted, the process for announcing the correct winner makes much more sense for, say, Best Actor, where only one person is taking the stage, than it does for Best Picture, where everybody involved in a film swarms to the microphone. But it’s still remarkable that La La Land had all but completed its speeches, and host Jimmy Kimmel was onstage to wrap up the evening before the announcement was made. \n \n Think of everything that had to go wrong here: Not only did the wrong envelope have to be handed to Beatty and Dunaway, but it had to include the name of the one nominee in the Best Actress category who appeared in a film nominated for Best Picture. (Had, say, Natalie Portman won for Jackie, Beatty and Dunaway would have known immediately what had happened.) \n \n And that Best Picture nominee was the season-long frontrunner — with 14 nominations and six other Oscars to its name from earlier in the evening. So when Beatty and Dunaway announced that it had won, no one batted an eye. \n \n But this has never happened in the history of the Oscars. The only time that comes close was in 1964, when Sammy Davis Jr. presented the award for Adaptation or Treatment Score but was handed the envelope for Original Score. And that’s a completely different situation, because the two categories had completely different sets of nominees. \n \n Moonlight won because it smartly ran all season long as the alternative to La La Land \n \n With La La Land’s loss, one thing becomes clear: You don’t want to be the early Oscar frontrunner. For three years in a row, the frontrunner — Boyhood in 2015, The Revenant in 2016, and La La Land in 2017 — has lost on Oscar night. And they’ve lost in three different ways, too: Boyhood faded in the stretch. The Revenant lost in a tight three-way race (to another early frontrunner, Spotlight). And La La Land lost despite being such a big Oscar frontrunner that I said if it lost, it would be the biggest Oscar upset ever. (And it is, only made more so by the ultra-bizarre circumstances around what happened.) \n \n Only 12 Years a Slave, which won in 2014, managed to hold on to its frontrunner status from its September 2013 debut through the February 2014 awards. And it was bolstered by the sense that both Gravity and American Hustle were nipping at its heels. (Indeed, Gravity ended up winning seven awards, including Director, but not Picture, while 12 Years a Slave won a supporting acting prize and the Adapted Screenplay award along with Picture — with the situations for both eerily mirroring the La La Land vs. Moonlight split.) \n \n You have to go all the way back to The Artist in the Oscar season of 2011 and 2012 to find an early frontrunner that essentially cruised through the whole season with nary a speed bump or major competitor. \n \n And the Oscars’ ranked-choice voting system means that even if you’re not the number one choice of a plurality, you can still be the number two or three choice of a lot of people and pull off the win as those voters’ number one choices drop out. (Read more about this here.) And, indeed, in every other category where Moonlight and La La Land faced off — where a simple plurality carries the day — Moonlight lost. (It lost three of those categories — Cinematography, Score, and Director — to La La Land, and both films lost Editing to Hacksaw Ridge.) \n \n In the past, the ranked-choice system has tilted toward movies about show business, consensus choices that appealed to the entertainment industry, but in 2017 it clearly worked in Moonlight’s favor. Why? \n \n Part of this is thanks to a very smart campaign run by the movie’s studio, A24, which essentially spent the entire awards season hanging out in the runner-up slot, never accruing enough momentum to overtake La La Land, but never fading so much that it was out of the running either. And the Academy’s moves toward developing a more diverse membership, bolstered by a large influx of nominees who don’t fit the typical “older, straight white man” Oscar voter mold, could have also worked in Moonlight’s favor. But that outreach didn’t change the makeup over the Oscar voting body overnight. Something else happened. \n \n Talk to Oscar voters and those connected to them in the weeks leading up to the Oscars, and you heard much more passion for La La Land, but Moonlight was the only other film mentioned at all consistently as everything else faded. (Vulture’s Kyle Buchanan has also talked about this phenomenon.) It certainly didn’t hurt that Moonlight had Plan B Productions — better known as Brad Pitt’s production company — in its corner, either. (Indeed, one of Moonlight’s winners is Pitt’s producing partner Dede Gardner, also an Oscar winner for 12 Years a Slave.) \n \n Moonlight also reflects the Academy’s acceptance of both racially diverse and LGBTQ themes — notable in the wake of two straight years without acting nominees of color and the previous most famous Oscar upset of them all, which saw the historic gay romance Brokeback Mountain bested by a largely unpredicted victory by Crash. In a way, Moonlight winning is a symbolic exemplar of the Academy tossing off both of those albatrosses, if only for a single year. \n \n But that’s not the only explanation for Moonlight’s win. Another contributing factor, among many, may be the fact that Donald Trump is president, Hollywood hates that he’s president, and Academy members may have been looking for ways to symbolically push back against his agenda with their votes. Throughout the night, categories kept going to movies that humanized the targets of Trump’s tweets, proposed laws, and vitriol, whether it was the documentary short winner The White Helmets or the Iranian foreign film winner The Salesman. \n \n And what better film to embrace if you want to send a message to the president — symbolically — than a beautiful, aching, artistic drama about a poor, gay black man coming of age? \n \n Oh, right, this also vindicates Marisa Tomei \n \n One of those weirdo bits of Oscar lore — which was even hinted at in Entertainment Weekly and the Hollywood Reporter — is that when announcing the winner of Best Supporting Actress in 1993, Jack Palance read the wrong name. \n \n He read Marisa Tomei of My Cousin Vinny, when it should have been any of the other nominees. The best explanation — Tomei was the only American in a category full of Brits, so her upset was a victory for patriotism and country — paled in comparison to the idea of an old man just making up a winner. \n \n PWC has always insisted this was not the case, that they would have rushed the stage if Palance had actually read the wrong name. But the urban legend persisted because, well, nothing had ever happened to disprove it. \n \n Until now, when the biggest award of the night was announced to go to the wrong film, and everybody still watching the Oscars thought there was a different Best Picture winner for more than a minute, when the procedure asserted itself for the first time in Oscars history. \n \n It was a hell of a way to end the evening, only made more so by the fact that it accidentally vindicates Marisa Tomei after 24 years of whispers about the invalidity of her Oscar. Good for you, Marisa! You, too, are a winner! \n \n Update: Some wording in this piece has been changed to better reflect the confluence of events that led to Moonlight’s Best Picture win. \n \n Update 2: We’ve added a later statement from PricewaterhouseCoopers.', 'The spotlight is now on PricewaterhouseCoopers, which has overseen the Academy\'s ballot-counting process for 83 years. \n \n Was it the Bonnie and Clyde presenter team\'s fault? A case of the envelopes getting mixed up backstage? Let the finger-pointing begin. \n \n After a stunning and surreal mistake that may be the worst Academy Awards telecast flub in history, the accounting firm in charge of the ballot-counting process is clarifying its role. \n \n ""We sincerely apologize to Moonlight, La La Land, Warren Beatty, Faye Dunaway, and Oscar viewers for the error that was made during the award announcement for best picture,"" said PricewaterhouseCoopers, which has overseen the Academy\'s ballot-counting process for 83 years. \n \n The statement added: ""The presenters had mistakenly been given the wrong category envelope and when discovered, was immediately corrected. We are currently investigating how this could have happened, and deeply regret that this occurred. We appreciate the grace with which the nominees, the Academy, ABC, and Jimmy Kimmel handled the situation."" \n \n In years past, the firm has provided two sets of winners\' envelopes in briefcases that are sent to the Dolby Theatre, one briefcase for either side of the stage. \n \n In what was was supposed to just be a memorable movie reunion, Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway ended up fumbling the presentation of best picture, as they were apparently holding the best actress envelope instead. \n \n Not only did Dunaway read off La La Land as the best picture winner, the confusion wasn\'t fixed until after several members of the Lionsgate movie\'s team had already spoken. ""I opened the envelope and it said \'Emma Stone, La La Land.\' That\'s why I looked at Faye, and at you. I wasn\'t trying to be funny,"" Beatty clarified, laughing nervously. \n \n ""This is very unfortunate, what happened. Personally, I blame Steve Harvey for this,"" emcee Jimmy Kimmel said, trying to salvage the moment with a joke about how Harvey had announced the wrong winner of the ""Miss Universe"" pageant on live TV in 2015. However, this mistake was far worse. \n \n Moonlight director Barry Jenkins appreciated the surreal nature of the moment right away, saying onstage: ""Very clearly, very clearly, even in my dreams, this could not be true. But to hell with dreams, I’m done with it, ’cause this is true. Oh my goodness."" \n \n At the end of the televised portion, Kimmel added one last jab. ""Well, I don’t know what happened. I blame myself for this,"" he said, referencing his self-effacing joke at the top of the show. ""Let’s remember, it’s just an awards show. I mean, we hate to see people disappointed but the good news is, we got to see some extra speeches. We had some great movies. I knew I would screw this show up, I really did."" \n \n La La Land producer Jordan Horowitz had to take a ballot and show the TV audience that, in fact, it said Moonlight. ""I was ecstatic, it was amazing. I thought we won an Oscar,"" Horowitz recalled to The Hollywood Reporter. ""Some guys in headsets started buzzing around. It became clear that was something wrong. They took the envelope I had. It said \'Emma Stone, La La Land\' on it."" \n \n He added: ""It was clear that there was something wrong. We started looking for the best picture envelope. Nobody knew where it was. Then it appeared, they opened it next to me and it said \'Moonlight.\'"" \n \n PwC has had Brian Cullinan and Martha Ruiz as co-ballot leaders overseeing the process for several years. The company touted that the ballot briefcases had made stops in 11 cities across the U.S. before making its way to Hollywood for the big day. \n \n Backstage, Jenkins was asked to explain the moment. ""No explanation; things just happen,"" he said. ""I will say I saw two cards. I wanted to see the card, and Warren refused to show the card to anybody before he showed it to me. He said, \'Barry Jenkins has to see the card. He needs to know.\'"" \n \n Moonlight breakout star Mahershala Ali, who won in the supporting actor category, was reflective. ""It’s very hard to feel joy in a moment like that,” he said, adding: “I feel very fortunate for all of us to have walked away with the best picture award. It’s pretty remarkable.” \n \n With the top honor yanked away from the frontrunner, La La Land ended the evening with six wins, Moonlight claimed three wins and Hacksaw Ridge and Manchester by the Sea took two awards. \n \n Emma Stone, who claimed best actress, was cordial when asked about the confusion by reporters. ""I f—ing love Moonlight,"" she said. ""Of course it was an amazing thing to hear them say La La Land — we would have loved best picture, but we\'re so happy for Moonlight."" \n \n Meanwhile, at the Governors Ball, Dunaway wasn\'t as gregarious about the moment. The presenter told THR, ""No, I\'m not going to speak about it."" \n \n Rebecca Sun, Mia Galuppo and Scott Feinberg contributed to this article.']",6,"– Bonnie and Clyde appear to be off the hook after the most shocking moment in Oscars history—the blunder that saw La La Land announced as Best Picture, only for Moonlight to be declared the real winner when the former film's producers had almost finished their speeches. Accounting firm PwC, which oversees the ballot-counting, says Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway were handed the wrong category envelope. ""We are currently investigating how this could have happened, and deeply regret that this occurred,"" the company formerly known as Price Waterhouse Coopers said in a statement to the AP, apologizing to the presenters, both movies, and Oscars viewers for the fiasco. A roundup of coverage: The Guardian has photos showing moment by moment how things went wrong. Beatty can be seen carrying the red envelope for ""Actress in a Leading Role,"" which he opens, then hands to Dunaway. He later said he was confused because it said ""Emma Stone: La La Land."" She reads out the movie title. With the La La Land team on stage, Oscars overseers can be seen examining the envelope. USA Today reports that as the La La Land team went on stage, a PwC accountant backstage shouted ""He took the wrong envelope!"" and ran onstage. ""I was ecstatic, it was amazing. I thought we won an Oscar,"" La La Land producer Jordan Horowitz tells the Hollywood Reporter. But then, ""some guys in headsets started buzzing around. It became clear that something was wrong."" The New York Times has a transcript of the chaotic minutes onstage. ""I'm going to be really proud to hand this to my friends from Moonlight,"" says Horowitz graciously. La La Land star Ryan Gosling could be seen apparently trying not to laugh during the mix-up, though the BBC's Martha Kearney says he had a ""face like thunder"" while waiting for a limo after the ceremony. This has never happened before in any category in Oscars history, Vox reports in a look at how PwC handles the envelopes—and at its procedure for handling mix-ups. ""It was very quick, I can't talk about it. The card read that way. It was a very odd thing,"" Dunaway tells the Telegraph, adding: ""It wasn't Warren's fault."" La La Land star Stone told the media she was excited for Moonlight, which she considers one of the best movies of all time, the Chicago Sun-Times reports. But she added: ""I was also holding my Best Actress in a Leading Role card that entire time. So whatever story, I don’t mean to start stuff, but whatever story that was, I had that card."" Variety notes that it was also a shock to many that Moonlight had won Best Picture at all, though it had won more best film prizes from critics groups than La La Land. It turns out there was a second big fail on Sunday night."

207,"['With the iPhone 5 possibly on its way to Sprint Nextel, could the end of its much-loved unlimited-data plan be far behind? \n \n commentary Once Sprint Nextel gets the iPhone, you can bid farewell to its unlimited-data plan. \n \n Sprint CEO Dan Hesse, as seen in one of the company\'s much-played black-and-white television commercials. (Credit: CBS/Sprint) \n \n If history is any indication, Sprint will have to make some tough decisions, if Apple\'s blockbuster device starts weighing on its network. It\'s something the other carriers have done, and it\'s part of a broader trend of telecommunication companies struggling to keep up with growing bandwidth consumption. \n \n After suffering through years of heavy bandwidth usage from iPhone users, AT&T; relented and switched to a tiered pricing plan last year. It only took Verizon Wireless a few months after launching its version of the iPhone 4 before it opted to apply similar data caps. \n \n Sprint, which The Wall Street Journal reported today will be getting the iPhone 5 at the same time as AT&T; and Verizon in October, will likely follow the same path. \n \n I have no first-hand knowledge of Sprint\'s thinking on its successful--but taxing--offer of an all-you-can-eat data plan for its smartphones. A Sprint representative wasn\'t immediately available to answer my questions. \n \n But I do know that networks aren\'t fundamentally different from each other, despite the marketing jargon and hype that surrounds them. Sprint doesn\'t have any more capacity than Verizon and AT&T.; In fact, it may be in a worse position now because its unlimited-data offer is unique in the market, likely attracting the heaviest of users. \n \n The carriers\' switch to tiered plans doesn\'t include existing unlimited-data customers, who have had the option to be grandfathered into an unlimited plan. You can see the strain the grandfathering is putting on the carriers, with both AT&T; and Verizon switching to language in their service agreements that allow them to throttle, or choke off, the connection speed when a user exceeds a certain threshold of data consumption. \n \n Sprint is in a touchy spot because it has positioned itself as the unlimited carrier. Ads talk about the company\'s truly limitless plans, and Chief Executive Dan Hesse has been featured on commercials deriding competitors\' actions such as throttling. \n \n As I\'ve written, Verizon\'s decision to switch to a capped plan has been a boon for Sprint. The carrier is the only remaining company to offer a truly unlimited-data plan, a rare marketing and competitive edge outside of cheaper prices. Even Sprint\'s prepaid arm, Virgin Mobile, has decided to employ throttling. \n \n But all good things have to come to an end. Speaking to a roundtable of bloggers and reporters last month, Hesse acknowledged that data traffic could eventually be an issue. \n \n ""Nothing\'s a guarantee that it\'s forever,"" he said at the time. \n \n For Sprint, the choice is a trade-off: keep the unlimited-data plan and spur additional customer growth, or cut back on the plans and ease the need to invest in more capital for the network. Its decision may indicate whether it is favoring the consumer or Wall Street. \n \n When I wrote about Sprint eventually dropping the unlimited-data plan, analysts gave it a year to 18 months before a change would happen. But with the iPhone becoming available to Sprint customers, that timetable could be accelerated. Thanks to its more affordable data plans, Sprint has a higher base of smartphone customers than its rivals--roughly half of its total customers. \n \n While it has gotten used to dealing with the bandwidth-intensive Android phone, Sprint may be in for another pounding, once more customers start upgrading their basic phones for the iPhone. \n \n And even if the iPhone isn\'t significantly more data-hungry than its Android counterparts, Sprint may use the iPhone\'s reputation as an excuse to close off the unlimited-data spigot. \n \n So what does that mean for customers? If the iPhone does come out for Sprint, hop on an unlimited-data plan while you can (and thus get grandfathered in). The plan may not be around much longer.', 'See more of Brian Larson on Facebook']",2,"– The iPhone 5 will be available on Sprint's network as well as Verizon's and AT&T's when the new phone is launched, insiders tell the Wall Street Journal. The device will hit the market in mid-October, not next month as many had expected, the sources say. The iPhone 5 deal will provide a major boost for the nation's third-largest carrier, whose bottom line had suffered without the ability to sell iPhones, analysts say. The deal, however, could end up backfiring on Sprint if it improves AT&T's chances of getting the green light from regulators to buy T-Mobile USA. Verizon ditched its unlimited plans not long after it launched its version of the iPhone 4 earlier this year, notes Roger Cheng at CNET, who recommends that Sprint users hop on unlimited data plans now to get ""grandfathered in"" before the Sprint iPhone arrives."
208,"['Congressman Bob Goodlatte\'s son made the surprise announcement on Twitter Sunday night. | Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP Photo Goodlatte\'s son donates to Democrat running to replace him \n \n A high-ranking Republican lawmaker\'s son donated the ""maximum amount"" to a Democrat running to replace his father. \n \n Bobby Goodlatte, the son of House Judiciary Committee Chairman Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), made the surprise announcement on Twitter Sunday night. Goodlatte is retiring after 13 terms in Congress. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n ""I just gave the maximum allowed donation to Jennifer Lewis, a democrat running for my father\'s congressional seat. I\'ve also gotten 5 other folks to commit to donate the max. 2018 is the year to flip districts — let\'s do this!"" Bobby Goodlatte wrote on Twitter, where he describes himself as a product designer and angel investor based in San Francisco. \n \n Lewis said she was surprised by Goodlatte’s public donation when she woke up Monday, calling it a “very exciting morning, to say the least.” The maximum individual donation is $2,700, according to the Federal Election Commission. \n \n “I really, really admire and respect his willingness to be so public about it, and it\'s tough when you don\'t politically agree with your family. And to do it in such a public way, with Congressman Goodlatte being such a huge force in our political world, it’s just, I\'m at a loss for words in a lot of ways,” Lewis said. \n \n The Lewis campaign raised more than $15,000 in donations after Bobby Goodlatte announced his support, spokesman Josh Stanfield said. \n \n Bobby Goodlatte plans to help out with the Lewis campaign heading into the November midterm elections, Lewis said. His donation has inspired others to follow suit and give money, though Lewis did not say how many donations her campaign had received Monday. Bobby Goodlatte did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \n \n “He is totally willing to help us out in any way we want him to help us. We\'re kind of in discussion of what plans we can make until November,” Lewis said. “We\'re already seeing it has kind of given us an adrenaline shot this morning, for sure.” \n \n Later in the day, Bobby Goodlatte laid into his father after news broke that FBI agent Peter Strzok had been fired. \n \n ""I’m deeply embarrassed that Peter Strzok’s career was ruined by my father’s political grandstanding. That committee hearing was a low point for Congress. Thank you for your service sir. You are a patriot,"" Bobby Goodlatte said in a tweet Monday afternoon. Strzok drew criticism from conservatives earlier this summer when an inspector general investigation unearthed text messages Strzok wrote that were critical of President Donald Trump. \n \n Regardless of his son\'s criticism, Goodlatte’s district is a challenge for Democrats. Trump carried the central Virginia district with nearly 60 percent of the vote in 2016, and Mitt Romney did the same in the 2012 presidential election. Goodlatte received two-thirds of the vote that year. \n \n Republican nominee Ben Cline starts with a base of support in the district after 16 years in the state House of Delegates. Cline had previously served as Goodlatte’s chief of staff. He has outraised Lewis more than 5-to-1 through June 30, the end of the most recent FEC reporting period. Cline’s office did not respond to a request for comment. \n \n Bobby Goodlatte\'s donation comes as Democrats across the country edge toward flipping the House and gaining a majority. Lewis beat three Democratic competitors in the state\'s primary election in June, grabbing 48 percent of the vote. \n \n “I truly believe we will win in November. We’ve been having these conversations with folks where, yes, you may have never voted for a Democrat before, but if you want health care for you and your kids, if you want a living wage for you and your kids, if you want income equality and affordable housing,” Lewis said. “These are the things people are talking about. We’re seeing very good success from canvassing.” \n \n Goodlatte\'s office did not respond to a request for comment.', 'Tweet with a location \n \n You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

He said the effort to find the box could take years. \n \n “Given the remoteness of the site and the depth of the water and the weather down there, the black box will be almost impossible to find,” he told The Telegraph. “It will then be a case of digging through the wreckage field, possibly for a couple of years.” \n \n A further difficulty for the crash investigators is that the crucial moment for understanding the unusual flight revolves around the period during which its communications systems were disabled and it took a sharp turn westward before flying silently for about seven hours. This occurred during the first hour of the flight, but the black box records cockpit communication on a two hour loop and deletes all but the final two hours. \n \n Though the flight data will have survived, Mr Barry said, “the bit we are interested in – where they lost contact with air traffic control – would have been overridden unless power to the recorder was lost.” \n \n On Wednesday Hishammuddin Hussein, Malaysia’s acting transport minister, said new satellite images had found objects ranging from 3 to 75 feet across an area of 154 square miles in the southern Indian Ocean. \n \n He described the sighting of an apparent debris field as “the most credible lead we have so far”. \n \n The images, captured through clouds by Airbus Defence and Space in France four days ago, were about 1,589 miles southwest of Perth in a remote stretch of the southern Indian Ocean. The zone tallies with previous images captured by United States and Chinese satellites. \n \n “We cannot tell whether the potential objects are from MH370,” Mr Hishammuddin said. “Nevertheless, this is another new lead that will help direct the search operation.” \n \n Twelve aircraft flew over the search area on Wednesday but spotted only three objects, including two items believed to be rope and a blue piece of flotsam. No wreckage has been found, nor any confirmed sign of the missing Malaysia Airlines aircraft, since it disappeared with 239 passengers and crew aboard after taking off from Kuala Lumpur for Beijing on March 8. \n \n Mr Hishammuddin said authorities have begun looking at the steps that will need to be taken after the crash site and wreckage are found. The top priority is to locate the black box which will help to explain the cause of the crash. \n \n As the search continued, a multimillion-dollar lawsuit was initiated in the United States against Malaysia Airlines and Boeing. A firm representing families of the passengers filed a petition of discovery in Illinois, requiring the companies to produce evidence of possible flaws in the crashed Boeing 777. “We believe that both defendants named are responsible for the disaster of Flight MH370,” said Monica Kelly, the lead lawyer."", 'World \n \n Ahmad Seth Zaharie, 26, with his sister Aishah Zaharie (left), 27, and mother Faizah Khanum Mustafa Khan. \n \n The son of the experienced pilot who flew the missing Malaysian Airlines flight has insisted his father was not the kind of man who would hijack a plane. \n \n Ahmad Seth, the youngest of Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah\'s three children, told Malaysian media he has paid no attention to suggestions his father may have been involved in a hijacking or suicide mission. \n \n “I\'ve read everything online.

It has been claimed the captain was a political activist who attended the trial of Malaysia’s opposition leader, Anwar Ibrahim, just seven hours before he took control of the passenger jet. \n \n ""We may not be as close as he travels so much. But I understand him,” Mr Seth said. \n \n He said the family was holding out for “the right confirmation” that the aircraft ended its journey in the southern Indian Ocean. \n \n ""I will believe it [that there are no survivors] when I see the proof in front of my eyes,"" he said. \n \n He is the first of the pilot\'s immediate family members to speak publicly since the search began. \n \n Captain Shah joined Malaysia Airlines in 1981 and was certified by Malaysia’s Department of Civil Aviation as a simulator test examiner. \n \n He had 18,365 flying hours experience, and had installed a Boeing 777 flight simulator in his home, from which he made YouTube videos. \n \n smh.com.au', 'Human Rights Watch alleges that villagers were evacuated from a \'national disaster\' and put to work as cheap labor in sugarcane fields. \n \n This February 3,000 families were driven out of an area in southeast Zimbabwe known as Tokwe-Mukosi when flood waters rose dramatically. \n \n The flood was proclaimed a “national disaster” by Zimbabwe’s president Robert Mugabe, after state media reported it was caused by the broken wall of a dam. \n \n International donors pledged food and humanitarian aid, which has been steadily delivered. \n \n In an operation conducted partly by the military, the displaced and destitute families -- about 20,000 people -- were quickly whisked off and resettled in a “transit camp” of tents 80 miles away, on something called the Nuanetsi Ranch. \n \n The ranch is home to sugarcane fields that feed a large ethanol production facility that is also on the ranch. The sugar cane and ethanol project is jointly owned by Mr. Mugabe’s political party, Zanu (PF), and a controversial Zimbabwe businessman named Billy Rautenbach, sometimes called “Africa’s Napoleon.” \n \n From the moment the 3,000 families were relocated, they were told that their new employment was filling a sugarcane farming labor shortage. They were also advised that distribution of their donated food aid was contingent on their work. \n \n Now a Human Rights Watch investigation alleges not only that the families were commandeered as a form of cheap labor to serve Mr. Mugabe’s energy business interests – but that the flood itself was artificially created. \n \n There is no broken dam wall, the investigation found. In interviews with three senior employees of the Italian firm, Salini Impregilo JVC that is helping construct the dam, it is alleged that the flood was created by closing the sluice gates of the dam, which covers an area where two rivers come together. The closed flood gates caused high waters to back up and flood out the villagers. \n \n “What the media reported – that the dam wall collapsed leading to floods – is false information,” said one of the senior Salini officers, all three of whom requested anonymity. “The dam wall did not collapse and was never in danger of collapsing. With sluice gates and spillways open, it would have taken at least five years for the dam to fill up to capacity, but in this case they were deliberately closed because villagers in Tokwe-Mukorsi had resisted relocation.” \n \n Tiseke Kasambala, director of southern Africa for Human Rights Watch, charges that “these 3,000 families have been displaced under questionable circumstances and dumped in a place where their only alternative is to be cheap labor for Zimbabwe’s ruling party.” \n \n The Human Rights Watch charges were vociferously denied by local Zimbabwe officials and members of the ruling Zanu (PF) party, which won reelection last July in a vote that was highly contested. \n \n “That is the most mischievous and ridiculous comment you can get from Human Rights Watch,” said the provincial affairs minister for Masivingo province, Kudakwashe Bhasikiti, where the dispute is taking place. “Flooding was not only experienced in Zimbabwe but even in the UK, Canada.” \n \n Mr. Bhasikiti three days ago banned five journalists from visiting the camp and the area, charging them with bias -- effectively closing off access to the families and to further examination of the dam. \n \n Mr. Bhasikiti also denied that Mr. Rautenbach, the wealthy co-owner of the ethanol project, was formally affiliated with the ruling party. However, Rautenbach’s ties to Mugabe are old and well-known, and on those grounds he has been sanctioned by the US, UK, and EU dating to 2008. \n \n HRW officials contacted by the Monitor confirmed that flooding at the turn of the year had taken place in the region but that leaving the flood gates open would have caused the waters to run off. “This was a water management issue, not a flood,” said one. \n \n Instead, HRW points to local villagers that were displaced who were told by military officials that Mugabe had ordered the reservoir basin at Tokw-Mukosi where they lived to be filled up without delay. \n \n Thousands of children have had their schooling disrupted or no longer have access to education in the tent city refugee camp, according to a visitor there. \n \n A makeshift school set up near the camp is not adequately equipped and staffed to meet the children’s needs. \n \n There were also widespread allegations that Masvingo police and provincial officials responsible for distributing food, blankets, and clothing have diverted some of the aid to the neighboring towns of Triangle and Chiredzi, where they are sold for profit, allegations HRW monitors witnessed to be true. \n \n “The Zimbabwean government has an obligation to ensure that displaced people have food, clothing, and shelter, but when food aid is turning up in local markets instead of in the tents of the displaced, then the responsible local officials need to be investigated,” said Kasambala. \n \n One of the Italian corporate officers that leaked information to HRW summed up the situation by saying, “’Floods’ enabled [the] government to swiftly remove some 20,000 people without compensation under the guise of a national disaster while at the same time attracting international sympathy and aid from the donor community.""']",5,"– Another big lead, but yet more frustration in the hunt for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370: Officials say a Thai satellite has detected ""300 objects of various sizes"" floating near the search area in the Indian Ocean, reports the AP.

211,"['Lenovo IdeaCentre Horizon Table PC hands-on \n \n This week the folks at Lenovo have made it clear that they want to get into your living room, and they want to do it with a massive gaming Table – you read that right. This machine is known as the Lenovo IdeaCentre Horizon Table PC, a beast of a device with a 27-inch touchscreen and the ability to work upright, on its side, and with a set of accessories that make it a full-on board game-capable beast. \n \n The IdeaCentre Horizon Table PC’s full details can be found in our original reveal post, it also making the case for Lenovo’s newest term: Phygital. This term makes for the mix of physical game playing and digital interaction, with this gaming table allowing you to play table hockey, dice-base board games, and everything in-between. \n \n The machine we had a peek at here in its current form had fabulous viewing angles and a rather realistically nice setup – in other words, it felt as though we’d really, actually use it in the real world. Not such a thing can be said about all massive touchscreen devices such as this. What we got from our first experience was this: we definitely need one to be able to play Candy Land in the future. \n \n As it stands, we’ll be playing some of Lenovo’s own games as well as a set of games that have been optimized for play on this device specifically by 3rd party systems. Can’t wait for the real push! Check out the rest of our Lenovo coverage and stick around our CES portal for more action from all angles all week long!', ""This is at once pretty cool and also very, really, incredibly silly and dumb. But that's not a bad thing! Here's Lenovo's Horizon desktop computer. It's half Minority Report, half newjack board game. Oh, and also a full Windows 8 all-in-one computer. \n \n Lenovo's all-in-ones have contorted down to be worked on horizontally for a while now, the Horizon is specifically designed to be picked up, moved around, and used by multiple people. It's got a rubber edge to protect it from bangs, and to make it easier to carry, and its screen is drop-proof (though not spill-proof). \n \n Advertisement \n \n It uses what Lenovo calls the Aura UI, which uses drag-wheels to launch videos, pictures, apps, and games. You can use gestures to isolate one video, zoom or shrink, clean the whole desktop, or close all open files. The Horizon comes with 15 pre-loaded apps, and there are 3000 more in its app store. Lenovo says it's got five major developers making games for the Horizon, headlined by EA and Ubisoft. \n \n The Horizon comes with a bunch joysticks to play its games, and can run on battery power if you want to take it away from its power source—like outside into a club house, if your kids are very rich an insane. It weighs 17 pounds, so they better be strong. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Internally, this is a regular all-in-one. It goes from i3 to i7, can go up to 16GB of RAM, and has discrete graphics. Its cheapest configuration starts at $1000. It's basically the same purchase as if you'd buy any other all-in-one, just with this functionality added. Lenovo has a custom stand for it, so it can be a waist-level console in the middle of your house. Unfortunately, the automated space-age table/desk/gaming center from the video is just a concept for now. \n \n The Horizon is cool—and also very, very gimmicky. It's sort of like the Wii U in that it's deeply centered on in-person, multi-user experiences, but when you're just by yourself, you probably won't use any of this new stuff. Still, it seems like the kind of thing that all your friends might not actually want, but would be more than happy to come over to your house and play with."", 'Apparently Lenovo liked what it saw from Sony\'s Tap 20, because here at CES the company is introducing its own ""portable"" desktop PC. The IdeaCentre Horizon is primarily a Windows 8-enabled all-in-one — Lenovo calls it a ""table PC"" — with a 27-inch, 1080p 10-finger touchscreen, Intel\'s Core i7 processors and discrete graphics. But it\'s also portable, at least in theory, thanks to an internal battery that Lenovo says will power the gigantic device for two hours at a time. The gigantic slate is only 1.06 inches thick, but it weighs 17 pounds, so its actual viability as a tablet will vary with your upper-body strength. In a more practical nod to the Horizon\'s touch-friendliness, Its hinge lets it either sit up at a normal angle for a PC, or lay flat on a table. \n \n When you lay the Horizon flat, Lenovo\'s ""Moon Dial"" interface automatically opens, providing a wheel-based interface for launching apps, flipping through pictures, and moving things around. It\'s incredibly reminiscent of Microsoft\'s original Surface interface, turning your table into a giant touchscreen. Gestures let you move things around, fling them to the edges, shake them to show similar objects, and much more. The Horizon doesn\'t interact with other devices — which was maybe the coolest feature of the original Surface — but it\'s a pretty fun concept nonetheless. We spent a few minutes using the Horizon, and though it\'s definitely a gimmicky idea, it\'s definitely fun to use and play with. \n \n Almost as cool as the Microsoft Surface — but much more gimmicky \n \n Lenovo designed the Horizon for families and offices, for more than one person to use at a time. It comes with a handful of specific accessories to that end, too: four joysticks, e-dice, and strikers, which Lenovo says creates a more physical gaming experience than is typical with a laptop. (It\'s calling that experience ""phygital."" No, really, that\'s what it\'s called.) A number of games also come pre-loaded, like Monopoly, King of the Opera, Raiding Company, and others. We played Air Hockey using the included joysticks, and it was fun, though using a physical joystick to hit a virtual puck felt a little odd. We\'re not so sold on this phygital thing yet. \n \n The Horizon will be available ""in early summer,"" and will start at $1,699. The beginning of a trend for Lenovo, with more of these table PCs coming soon — the company\'s showing off a 36-inch prototype called ""Gamma"" at CES as well. Whether that one can be carried around too, we\'re not quite sure. \n \n Grid View', ""Chiefs, Eric Berry not expected to reach long-term deal, source says The Kansas City Chiefs and franchise-tagged safety Eric Berry are not expected to reach a long-term deal by Friday's 4 p.m. deadline, a source told ESPN NFL Insider Adam Schefter. \n \n NFL Rumor Central: Falcons hoping to reduce Freeman's workload With Tevin Coleman returning from injury, the Falcons hope to reduce Devonta Freeman's workload this season. \n \n Are the Cardinals no longer favorites in the NFC West?

Much of the software demonstrated so far consists of games, with joysticks and air hockey paddles to go with them. So how good is the IdeaCentre Horizon, with versions at $999 and $1,699? A look at some early reactions: It's ""very, really, incredibly silly and dumb. But that's not a bad thing!"" notes Kyle Wagner at Gizmodo.

I followed my father’s path and became an academic neurosurgeon, teaching at Harvard Medical School and other universities. I understand what happens to the brain when people are near death, and I had always believed there were good scientific explanations for the heavenly out-of-body journeys described by those who narrowly escaped death. \n \n The brain is an astonishingly sophisticated but extremely delicate mechanism. Reduce the amount of oxygen it receives by the smallest amount and it will react. It was no big surprise that people who had undergone severe trauma would return from their experiences with strange stories. But that didn’t mean they had journeyed anywhere real. \n \n Although I considered myself a faithful Christian, I was so more in name than in actual belief. I didn’t begrudge those who wanted to believe that Jesus was more than simply a good man who had suffered at the hands of the world. I sympathized deeply with those who wanted to believe that there was a God somewhere out there who loved us unconditionally. In fact, I envied such people the security that those beliefs no doubt provided. But as a scientist, I simply knew better than to believe them myself. \n \n In the fall of 2008, however, after seven days in a coma during which the human part of my brain, the neocortex, was inactivated, I experienced something so profound that it gave me a scientific reason to believe in consciousness after death. \n \n I know how pronouncements like mine sound to skeptics, so I will tell my story with the logic and language of the scientist I am. \n \n Very early one morning four years ago, I awoke with an extremely intense headache. Within hours, my entire cortex—the part of the brain that controls thought and emotion and that in essence makes us human—had shut down. Doctors at Lynchburg General Hospital in Virginia, a hospital where I myself worked as a neurosurgeon, determined that I had somehow contracted a very rare bacterial meningitis that mostly attacks newborns. E. coli bacteria had penetrated my cerebrospinal fluid and were eating my brain. \n \n When I entered the emergency room that morning, my chances of survival in anything beyond a vegetative state were already low. They soon sank to near nonexistent. For seven days I lay in a deep coma, my body unresponsive, my higher-order brain functions totally offline. \n \n Alexander discusses his experience on the Science channel's 'Through the Wormhole.' \n \n Then, on the morning of my seventh day in the hospital, as my doctors weighed whether to discontinue treatment, my eyes popped open. \n \n ‘You have nothing to fear.’ ‘There is nothing you can do wrong.’ The message flooded me with a vast and crazy sensation of relief. (Photo illustration by Newsweek; Source: Buena Vista Images-Getty Images) \n \n There is no scientific explanation for the fact that while my body lay in coma, my mind—my conscious, inner self—was alive and well. While the neurons of my cortex were stunned to complete inactivity by the bacteria that had attacked them, my brain-free consciousness journeyed to another, larger dimension of the universe: a dimension I’d never dreamed existed and which the old, pre-coma me would have been more than happy to explain was a simple impossibility. \n \n But that dimension—in rough outline, the same one described by countless subjects of near-death experiences and other mystical states—is there. It exists, and what I saw and learned there has placed me quite literally in a new world: a world where we are much more than our brains and bodies, and where death is not the end of consciousness but rather a chapter in a vast, and incalculably positive, journey. \n \n On the iPad Read Newsweek’s 2007 story on how science is bringing more heart-attack victims back to life \n \n I’m not the first person to have discovered evidence that consciousness exists beyond the body. Brief, wonderful glimpses of this realm are as old as human history. But as far as I know, no one before me has ever traveled to this dimension (a) while their cortex was completely shut down, and (b) while their body was under minute medical observation, as mine was for the full seven days of my coma. \n \n All the chief arguments against near-death experiences suggest that these experiences are the results of minimal, transient, or partial malfunctioning of the cortex. My near-death experience, however, took place not while my cortex was malfunctioning, but while it was simply off. This is clear from the severity and duration of my meningitis, and from the global cortical involvement documented by CT scans and neurological examinations. According to current medical understanding of the brain and mind, there is absolutely no way that I could have experienced even a dim and limited consciousness during my time in the coma, much less the hyper-vivid and completely coherent odyssey I underwent. \n \n It took me months to come to terms with what happened to me. Not just the medical impossibility that I had been conscious during my coma, but—more importantly—the things that happened during that time. Toward the beginning of my adventure, I was in a place of clouds. Big, puffy, pink-white ones that showed up sharply against the deep blue-black sky. \n \n Reliving History: The search for the meaning of the afterlife is as old as humanity itself. Over the years Newsweek has run numerous covers about religion, God, and that search. As Dr. Alexander says, it’s unlikely we’ll know the answer in our lifetimes, but that doesn’t mean we won’t keep asking. \n \n Higher than the clouds—immeasurably higher—flocks of transparent, shimmering beings arced across the sky, leaving long, streamerlike lines behind them. \n \n Birds? Angels? These words registered later, when I was writing down my recollections. But neither of these words do justice to the beings themselves, which were quite simply different from anything I have known on this planet. They were more advanced. Higher forms. \n \n A sound, huge and booming like a glorious chant, came down from above, and I wondered if the winged beings were producing it. Again, thinking about it later, it occurred to me that the joy of these creatures, as they soared along, was such that they had to make this noise—that if the joy didn’t come out of them this way then they would simply not otherwise be able to contain it. The sound was palpable and almost material, like a rain that you can feel on your skin but doesn’t get you wet. \n \n Seeing and hearing were not separate in this place where I now was. I could hear the visual beauty of the silvery bodies of those scintillating beings above, and I could see the surging, joyful perfection of what they sang. It seemed that you could not look at or listen to anything in this world without becoming a part of it—without joining with it in some mysterious way. Again, from my present perspective, I would suggest that you couldn’t look at anything in that world at all, for the word “at” itself implies a separation that did not exist there. Everything was distinct, yet everything was also a part of everything else, like the rich and intermingled designs on a Persian carpet ... or a butterfly’s wing. \n \n It gets stranger still. For most of my journey, someone else was with me. A woman. She was young, and I remember what she looked like in complete detail. She had high cheekbones and deep-blue eyes. Golden brown tresses framed her lovely face. When first I saw her, we were riding along together on an intricately patterned surface, which after a moment I recognized as the wing of a butterfly. In fact, millions of butterflies were all around us—vast fluttering waves of them, dipping down into the woods and coming back up around us again. It was a river of life and color, moving through the air. The woman’s outfit was simple, like a peasant’s, but its colors—powder blue, indigo, and pastel orange-peach—had the same overwhelming, super-vivid aliveness that everything else had. She looked at me with a look that, if you saw it for five seconds, would make your whole life up to that point worth living, no matter what had happened in it so far. It was not a romantic look. It was not a look of friendship. It was a look that was somehow beyond all these, beyond all the different compartments of love we have down here on earth. It was something higher, holding all those other kinds of love within itself while at the same time being much bigger than all of them. \n \n Without using any words, she spoke to me. The message went through me like a wind, and I instantly understood that it was true. I knew so in the same way that I knew that the world around us was real—was not some fantasy, passing and insubstantial. \n \n The message had three parts, and if I had to translate them into earthly language, I’d say they ran something like this: \n \n “You are loved and cherished, dearly, forever.” \n \n “You have nothing to fear.” \n \n “There is nothing you can do wrong.” \n \n The message flooded me with a vast and crazy sensation of relief. It was like being handed the rules to a game I’d been playing all my life without ever fully understanding it. \n \n “We will show you many things here,” the woman said, again, without actually using these words but by driving their conceptual essence directly into me. “But eventually, you will go back.” \n \n To this, I had only one question. \n \n Back where? \n \n The universe as I experienced it in my coma is ... the same one that both Einstein and Jesus were speaking of in their (very) different ways. (Ed Morris / Getty Images) \n \n A warm wind blew through, like the kind that spring up on the most perfect summer days, tossing the leaves of the trees and flowing past like heavenly water. A divine breeze. It changed everything, shifting the world around me into an even higher octave, a higher vibration. \n \n Although I still had little language function, at least as we think of it on earth, I began wordlessly putting questions to this wind, and to the divine being that I sensed at work behind or within it. \n \n Where is this place? \n \n Who am I? \n \n Why am I here? \n \n Each time I silently put one of these questions out, the answer came instantly in an explosion of light, color, love, and beauty that blew through me like a crashing wave. What was important about these blasts was that they didn’t simply silence my questions by overwhelming them. They answered them, but in a way that bypassed language. Thoughts entered me directly. But it wasn’t thought like we experience on earth. It wasn’t vague, immaterial, or abstract. These thoughts were solid and immediate—hotter than fire and wetter than water—and as I received them I was able to instantly and effortlessly understand concepts that would have taken me years to fully grasp in my earthly life. \n \n I continued moving forward and found myself entering an immense void, completely dark, infinite in size, yet also infinitely comforting. Pitch-black as it was, it was also brimming over with light: a light that seemed to come from a brilliant orb that I now sensed near me. The orb was a kind of “interpreter” between me and this vast presence surrounding me. It was as if I were being born into a larger world, and the universe itself was like a giant cosmic womb, and the orb (which I sensed was somehow connected with, or even identical to, the woman on the butterfly wing) was guiding me through it. \n \n Later, when I was back, I found a quotation by the 17th-century Christian poet Henry Vaughan that came close to describing this magical place, this vast, inky-black core that was the home of the Divine itself. \n \n “There is, some say, in God a deep but dazzling darkness ...” \n \n That was it exactly: an inky darkness that was also full to brimming with light. \n \n I know full well how extraordinary, how frankly unbelievable, all this sounds. Had someone—even a doctor—told me a story like this in the old days, I would have been quite certain that they were under the spell of some delusion. But what happened to me was, far from being delusional, as real or more real than any event in my life. That includes my wedding day and the birth of my two sons. \n \n What happened to me demands explanation. \n \n Modern physics tells us that the universe is a unity—that it is undivided. Though we seem to live in a world of separation and difference, physics tells us that beneath the surface, every object and event in the universe is completely woven up with every other object and event. There is no true separation. \n \n Before my experience these ideas were abstractions. Today they are realities. Not only is the universe defined by unity, it is also—I now know—defined by love. The universe as I experienced it in my coma is—I have come to see with both shock and joy—the same one that both Einstein and Jesus were speaking of in their (very) different ways. \n \n I’ve spent decades as a neurosurgeon at some of the most prestigious medical institutions in our country. I know that many of my peers hold—as I myself did—to the theory that the brain, and in particular the cortex, generates consciousness and that we live in a universe devoid of any kind of emotion, much less the unconditional love that I now know God and the universe have toward us. But that belief, that theory, now lies broken at our feet. What happened to me destroyed it, and I intend to spend the rest of my life investigating the true nature of consciousness and making the fact that we are more, much more, than our physical brains as clear as I can, both to my fellow scientists and to people at large. \n \n I don’t expect this to be an easy task, for the reasons I described above. When the castle of an old scientific theory begins to show fault lines, no one wants to pay attention at first. The old castle simply took too much work to build in the first place, and if it falls, an entirely new one will have to be constructed in its place. \n \n I learned this firsthand after I was well enough to get back out into the world and talk to others—people, that is, other than my long-suffering wife, Holley, and our two sons—about what had happened to me. The looks of polite disbelief, especially among my medical friends, soon made me realize what a task I would have getting people to understand the enormity of what I had seen and experienced that week while my brain was down. \n \n One of the few places I didn’t have trouble getting my story across was a place I’d seen fairly little of before my experience: church. The first time I entered a church after my coma, I saw everything with fresh eyes. The colors of the stained-glass windows recalled the luminous beauty of the landscapes I’d seen in the world above. The deep bass notes of the organ reminded me of how thoughts and emotions in that world are like waves that move through you. And, most important, a painting of Jesus breaking bread with his disciples evoked the message that lay at the very heart of my journey: that we are loved and accepted unconditionally by a God even more grand and unfathomably glorious than the one I’d learned of as a child in Sunday school. \n \n Today many believe that the living spiritual truths of religion have lost their power, and that science, not faith, is the road to truth. Before my experience I strongly suspected that this was the case myself. \n \n But I now understand that such a view is far too simple. The plain fact is that the materialist picture of the body and brain as the producers, rather than the vehicles, of human consciousness is doomed. In its place a new view of mind and body will emerge, and in fact is emerging already. This view is scientific and spiritual in equal measure and will value what the greatest scientists of history themselves always valued above all: truth. \n \n Proof of Heaven by Eben Alexander, M.D. To be published by Simon & Schuster, Inc.. Copyright (c) 2012 by Eben Alexander III, M.D. \n \n This new picture of reality will take a long time to put together. It won’t be finished in my time, or even, I suspect, my sons’ either. In fact, reality is too vast, too complex, and too irreducibly mysterious for a full picture of it ever to be absolutely complete. But in essence, it will show the universe as evolving, multi-dimensional, and known down to its every last atom by a God who cares for us even more deeply and fiercely than any parent ever loved their child."", 'Once upon a time, a neurosurgeon named Eben Alexander contracted a bad case of bacterial meningitis and fell into a coma. While immobile in his hospital bed, he experienced visions of such intense beauty that they changed everything—not just for him, but for all of us, and for science as a whole. According to Newsweek, Alexander’s experience proves that consciousness is independent of the brain, that death is an illusion, and that an eternity of perfect splendor awaits us beyond the grave—complete with the usual angels, clouds, and departed relatives, but also butterflies and beautiful girls in peasant dress. Our current understanding of the mind “now lies broken at our feet”—for, as the doctor writes, “What happened to me destroyed it, and I intend to spend the rest of my life investigating the true nature of consciousness and making the fact that we are more, much more, than our physical brains as clear as I can, both to my fellow scientists and to people at large.” \n \n Well, I intend to spend the rest of the morning sparing him the effort. Whether you read it online or hold the physical object in your hands, this issue of Newsweek is best viewed as an archaeological artifact that is certain to embarrass us in the eyes of future generations. Its existence surely says more about our time than the editors at the magazine meant to say—for the cover alone reveals the abasement and desperation of our journalism, the intellectual bankruptcy and resultant tenacity of faith-based religion, and our ubiquitous confusion about the nature of scientific authority. The article is the modern equivalent of a 14th-century woodcut depicting the work of alchemists, inquisitors, Crusaders, and fortune-tellers. I hope our descendants understand that at least some of us were blushing. \n \n As many of you know, I am interested in “spiritual” experiences of the sort Alexander reports. Unlike many atheists, I don’t doubt the subjective phenomena themselves—that is, I don’t believe that everyone who claims to have seen an angel, or left his body in a trance, or become one with the universe, is lying or mentally ill. Indeed, I have had similar experiences myself in meditation, in lucid dreams (even while meditating in a lucid dream), and through the use of various psychedelics (in times gone by). I know that astonishing changes in the contents of consciousness are possible and can be psychologically transformative. \n \n And, unlike many neuroscientists and philosophers, I remain agnostic on the question of how consciousness is related to the physical world. There are, of course, very good reasons to believe that it is an emergent property of brain activity, just as the rest of the human mind obviously is. But we know nothing about how such a miracle of emergence might occur. And if consciousness were, in fact, irreducible—or even separable from the brain in a way that would give comfort to Saint Augustine—my worldview would not be overturned. I know that we do not understand consciousness, and nothing that I think I know about the cosmos, or about the patent falsity of most religious beliefs, requires that I deny this. So, although I am an atheist who can be expected to be unforgiving of religious dogma, I am not reflexively hostile to claims of the sort Alexander has made. In principle, my mind is open. (It really is.) \n \n But Alexander’s account is so bad—his reasoning so lazy and tendentious—that it would be beneath notice if not for the fact that it currently disgraces the cover of a major newsmagazine. Alexander is also releasing a book at the end of the month, Proof of Heaven: A Neurosurgeon’s Journey into the Afterlife, which seems destined to become an instant bestseller. As much as I would like to simply ignore the unfolding travesty, it would be derelict of me to do so. \n \n But first things first: You really must read Alexander’s article. \n \n I trust that doing so has given you cause to worry that the good doctor is just another casualty of American-style Christianity—for though he claims to have been a nonbeliever before his adventures in coma, he presents the following self-portrait: \n \n Although I considered myself a faithful Christian, I was so more in name than in actual belief. I didn’t begrudge those who wanted to believe that Jesus was more than simply a good man who had suffered at the hands of the world. I sympathized deeply with those who wanted to believe that there was a God somewhere out there who loved us unconditionally. In fact, I envied such people the security that those beliefs no doubt provided. But as a scientist, I simply knew better than to believe them myself. \n \n What it means to be a “faithful Christian” without “actual belief” is not spelled out, but few nonbelievers will be surprised when our hero’s scientific skepticism proves no match for his religious conditioning. Most of us have been around this block often enough to know that many “former atheists”—like Francis Collins—spent so long on the brink of faith, and yearned for its emotional consolations with such vampiric intensity, that the slightest breeze would send them spinning into the abyss. For Collins, you may recall, all it took to establish the divinity of Jesus and the coming resurrection of the dead was the sight of a frozen waterfall. Alexander seems to have required a ride on a psychedelic butterfly. In either case, it’s not the perception of beauty we should begrudge but the utter absence of intellectual seriousness with which the author interprets it. \n \n Everything—absolutely everything—in Alexander’s account rests on repeated assertions that his visions of heaven occurred while his cerebral cortex was “shut down,” “inactivated,” “completely shut down,” “totally offline,” and “stunned to complete inactivity.” The evidence he provides for this claim is not only inadequate—it suggests that he doesn’t know anything about the relevant brain science. Perhaps he has saved a more persuasive account for his book—though now that I’ve listened to an hour-long interview with him online, I very much doubt it. In his Newsweek article, Alexander asserts that the cessation of cortical activity was “clear from the severity and duration of my meningitis, and from the global cortical involvement documented by CT scans and neurological examinations.” To his editors, this presumably sounded like neuroscience. \n \n The problem, however, is that “CT scans and neurological examinations” can’t determine neuronal inactivity—in the cortex or anywhere else. And Alexander makes no reference to functional data that might have been acquired by fMRI, PET, or EEG—nor does he seem to realize that only this sort of evidence could support his case. Obviously, the man’s cortex is functioning now—he has, after all, written a book—so whatever structural damage appeared on CT could not have been “global.” (Otherwise, he would be claiming that his entire cortex was destroyed and then grew back.) Coma is not associated with the complete cessation of cortical activity, in any case. And to my knowledge, almost no one thinks that consciousness is purely a matter of cortical activity. Alexander’s unwarranted assumptions are proliferating rather quickly. Why doesn’t he know these things? He is, after all, a neurosurgeon who survived a coma and now claims to be upending the scientific worldview on the basis of the fact that his cortex was totally quiescent at the precise moment he was enjoying the best day of his life in the company of angels. Even if his entire cortex had truly shut down (again, an incredible claim), how can he know that his visions didn’t occur in the minutes and hours during which its functions returned? \n \n I confess that I found Alexander’s account so alarmingly unscientific that I began to worry that something had gone wrong with my own brain. So I sought the opinion of Mark Cohen, a pioneer in the field of neuroimaging who holds appointments in the Departments of Psychiatry & Biobehavioral Science, Neurology, Psychology, Radiological Science, and Bioengineering at UCLA. (He was also my thesis advisor.) Here is part of what he had to say: \n \n This poetic interpretation of his experience is not supported by evidence of any kind. As you correctly point out, coma does not equate to “inactivation of the cerebral cortex” or “higher-order brain functions totally offline” or “neurons of [my] cortex stunned into complete inactivity”. These describe brain death, a one hundred percent lethal condition. There are many excellent scholarly articles that discuss the definitions of coma. (For example: 1 & 2) \n \n \n \n We are not privy to his EEG records, but high alpha activity is common in coma. Also common is “flat” EEG. The EEG can appear flat even in the presence of high activity, when that activity is not synchronous. For example, the EEG flattens in regions involved in direct task processing. This phenomenon is known as event-related desynchronization (hundreds of references). \n \n \n \n As is obvious to you, this is truth by authority. Neurosurgeons, however, are rarely well-trained in brain function. Dr. Alexander cuts brains; he does not appear to study them. “There is no scientific explanation for the fact that while my body lay in coma, my mind—my conscious, inner self—was alive and well. While the neurons of my cortex were stunned to complete inactivity by the bacteria that had attacked them, my brain-free consciousness ...” True, science cannot explain brain-free consciousness. Of course, science cannot explain consciousness anyway. In this case, however, it would be parsimonious to reject the whole idea of consciousness in the absence of brain activity. Either his brain was active when he had these dreams, or they are a confabulation of whatever took place in his state of minimally conscious coma. \n \n \n \n There are many reports of people remembering dream-like states while in medical coma. They lack consistency, of course, but there is nothing particularly unique in Dr. Alexander’s unfortunate episode. \n \n Okay, so it appears that my own cortex hasn’t completely shut down. In fact, there are further problems with Alexander’s account. Not only does he appear ignorant of the relevant science, but he doesn’t realize how many people have experienced visions similar to his while their brains were operational. In his online interview we learn about the kinds of conversations he’s now having with skeptics: \n \n I guess one could always argue, “Well, your brain was probably just barely able to ignite real consciousness and then it would flip back into a very diseased state,” which doesn’t make any sense to me. Especially because that hyper-real state is so indescribable and so crisp. It’s totally unlike any drug experience. A lot of people have come up to me and said, “Oh that sounds like a DMT experience,” or “That sounds like ketamine.” Not at all. That is not even in the right ballpark. \n \n \n \n Those things do not explain the kind of clarity, the rich interactivity, the layer upon layer of understanding and of lessons taught by deceased loved ones and spiritual beings. \n \n “Not even in the right ballpark”? His experience sounds so much like a DMT trip that we are not only in the right ballpark, we are talking about the stitching on the same ball. Here is Alexander’s description of the afterlife: \n \n I was a speck on a beautiful butterfly wing; millions of other butterflies around us. We were flying through blooming flowers, blossoms on trees, and they were all coming out as we flew through them… [there were] waterfalls, pools of water, indescribable colors, and above there were these arcs of silver and gold light and beautiful hymns coming down from them. Indescribably gorgeous hymns. I later came to call them “angels,” those arcs of light in the sky. I think that word is probably fairly accurate…. \n \n \n \n Then we went out of this universe. I remember just seeing everything receding and initially I felt as if my awareness was in an infinite black void. It was very comforting but I could feel the extent of the infinity and that it was, as you would expect, impossible to put into words. I was there with that Divine presence that was not anything that I could visibly see and describe, and with a brilliant orb of light…. \n \n \n \n They said there were many things that they would show me, and they continued to do that. In fact, the whole higher-dimensional multiverse was this incredibly complex corrugated ball and all these lessons coming into me about it. Part of the lessons involved becoming all of what I was being shown. It was indescribable. \n \n \n \n But then I would find myself—and time out there I can say is totally different from what we call time. There was access from out there to any part of our space/time and that made it difficult to understand a lot of these memories because we always try to sequence things and put them in linear form and description. That just really doesn’t work. \n \n Everything that Alexander describes here and in his Newsweek article, including the parts I have left out, has been reported by DMT users. The similarity is uncanny. Here is how the late Terence McKenna described the prototypical DMT trance: \n \n Under the influence of DMT, the world becomes an Arabian labyrinth, a palace, a more than possible Martian jewel, vast with motifs that flood the gaping mind with complex and wordless awe. Color and the sense of a reality-unlocking secret nearby pervade the experience. There is a sense of other times, and of one’s own infancy, and of wonder, wonder and more wonder. It is an audience with the alien nuncio. In the midst of this experience, apparently at the end of human history, guarding gates that seem surely to open on the howling maelstrom of the unspeakable emptiness between the stars, is the Aeon. The Aeon, as Heraclitus presciently observed, is a child at play with colored balls. Many diminutive beings are present there—the tykes, the self-transforming machine elves of hyperspace. Are they the children destined to be father to the man? One has the impression of entering into an ecology of souls that lies beyond the portals of what we naively call death. I do not know. Are they the synesthetic embodiment of ourselves as the Other, or of the Other as ourselves? Are they the elves lost to us since the fading of the magic light of childhood? Here is a tremendum barely to be told, an epiphany beyond our wildest dreams. Here is the realm of that which is stranger than we can suppose. Here is the mystery, alive, unscathed, still as new for us as when our ancestors lived it fifteen thousand summers ago. The tryptamine entities offer the gift of new language, they sing in pearly voices that rain down as colored petals and flow through the air like hot metal to become toys and such gifts as gods would give their children. The sense of emotional connection is terrifying and intense. The Mysteries revealed are real and if ever fully told will leave no stone upon another in the small world we have gone so ill in. This is not the mercurial world of the UFO, to be invoked from lonely hilltops; this is not the siren song of lost Atlantis wailing through the trailer courts of crack-crazed America. DMT is not one of our irrational illusions. I believe that what we experience in the presence of DMT is real news. It is a nearby dimension—frightening, transformative, and beyond our powers to imagine, and yet to be explored in the usual way. We must send fearless experts, whatever that may come to mean, to explore and to report on what they find. (Terence McKenna, Food of the Gods, pp. 258-259.) \n \n Alexander believes that his E. coli-addled brain could not have produced his visions because they were too “intense,” too “hyper-real,” too “beautiful,” too “interactive,” and too drenched in significance for even a healthy brain to conjure. He also appears to think that despite their timeless quality, his visions could not have arisen in the minutes or hours during which his cortex (which surely never went off) switched back on. He clearly knows nothing about what people with working brains experience under the influence of psychedelics. Nor does he know that visions of the sort that McKenna describes, although they may seem to last for ages, require only a brief span of biological time. Unlike LSD and other long-acting psychedelics, DMT alters consciousness for merely a few minutes. Alexander would have had more than enough time to experience a visionary ecstasy as he was coming out of his coma (whether his cortex was rebooting or not). \n \n Does Alexander know that DMT already exists in the brain as a neurotransmitter? Did his brain experience a surge of DMT release during his coma? This is pure speculation, of course, but it is a far more credible hypothesis than that his cortex “shut down,” freeing his soul to travel to another dimension. As one of his correspondents has already informed him, similar experiences can be had with ketamine, which is a surgical anesthetic that is occasionally used to protect a traumatized brain. Did Alexander by any chance receive ketamine while in the hospital? Would he even think it relevant if he had? His assertion that psychedelics like DMT and ketamine “do not explain the kind of clarity, the rich interactivity, the layer upon layer of understanding” he experienced is perhaps the most amazing thing he has said since he returned from heaven. Such compounds are universally understood to do the job. And most scientists believe that the reliable effects of psychedelics indicate that the brain is at the very least involved in the production of visionary states of the sort Alexander is talking about. \n \n Again, there is nothing to be said against Alexander’s experience. It sounds perfectly sublime. And such ecstasies do tell us something about how good a human mind can feel. The problem is that the conclusions Alexander has drawn from his experience—he continually reminds us, as a scientist—are based on some very obvious errors in reasoning and gaps in his understanding. \n \n Let me suggest that, whether or not heaven exists, Alexander sounds precisely how a scientist should not sound when he doesn’t know what he is talking about. And his article is not the sort of thing that the editors of a once-important magazine should publish if they hope to reclaim some measure of respect for their battered brand.', 'On Wednesday, President Obama spoke at a news conference in Martha\'s Vineyard about American journalist James Foley, who Islamic State militants beheaded in a video.

It came after at least six European hostages freed by the militants this spring had been debriefed by U.S. intelligence. \n \n “The president authorized earlier this summer an operation to attempt the rescue of American citizens held by ISIL,” said one of two senior officials who provided information on the mission, using one of the acronyms that refer to the Islamic State. \n \n “We had a combination of . . . intelligence that was sufficient to enable us to act on it,” the official said, and the military moved “very aggressively, very quickly to try and recover our citizens.” \n \n The official said the effort “was not ultimately successful because the hostages were not present . . . at the site of the operation.” Other officials said the captives were believed to have been there but had been moved before the raid, possibly several weeks earlier. \n \n \n \n This September 2012 photo posted on the Web site FreeJamesFoley.org shows journalist James Foley in Aleppo, Syria. (Manu Brabo/AP) \n \n In an announcement after the initial publication Wednesday of details about the operation, the White House and Pentagon issued statements confirming that President Obama had authorized the mission following assessments that “these hostages were in danger with each passing day.” \n \n The Islamic State on Tuesday released a video of Foley’s execution, which it said was in response to U.S. airstrikes in Iraq. Obama called the beheading “appalling” and “a brutal murder.” \n \n The two officials, who were authorized by the White House to speak anonymously to a small group of reporters, would not specify the number or identity of Americans being held alongside Foley. They are believed to number at least four, one of whom, freelance journalist Steven Joel Sotloff, also appeared in the Foley video, as the executioner warned that “the life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision.” \n \n The failed operation “was conducted by a joint force with virtually every service represented,” one of the senior officials said, including “special operators and aircraft both rotary and fixed-wing,” with surveillance aircraft overhead. \n \n That official said that there were a “good number” of militant casualties at the site but that one U.S. service member received a “minor injury when one aircraft did take some fire.” \n \n The two senior officials declined to specify the location of the raid, whether the hostages had ever been there, the specific U.S. units that had taken part in the operation or how long they were on the ground. “It wasn’t an extraordinarily long period,” one said. \n \n In a statement Wednesday night, National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said: “We never intended to disclose this operation. An overriding concern for the safety of the hostages and for operational security made it imperative that we preserve as much secrecy as possible. We only went public today when it was clear a number of media outlets were preparing to report on the operation and that we would have no choice but to acknowledge it.” \n \n The Washington Post, which participated in the briefing, first inquired about the operation Wednesday morning. \n \n Other current and former U.S. officials, who were not part of the briefing, said that Foley and others were held at an eastern Syria site near Raqaa, a city that is held by Islamic State fighters. \n \n The officials said that U.S. forces landed modified, heavily armed Black Hawk helicopters flown by the Army’s 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, which works with both the Army’s Delta Force and Navy SEAL commandos. The regiment is known as the “Night Stalkers.” \n \n The current and former officials also said that unspecified materials belonging to the militants had been seized at the site of the raid. \n \n Obama said Wednesday that the United States “will be vigilant and we will be relentless” against the Islamic State group and will “do what’s necessary to see that justice is done” to Foley’s killers. \n \n Obama, who spoke to Foley’s parents Wednesday morning, offered no new policy measures to confront the militants. Referring to neighboring countries and U.S. allies, he said “there has to be a common effort to extract this cancer so that it does not spread.” \n \n In Denver, FBI Director James Comey called Foley’s killers “savages,” saying they had turned the search for the journalist into a homicide investigation.Asked whether the United States might consider suspending its airstrikes, one U.S. official said the “only question is if we do more.” Officials said that attacks against the Islamic State would continue in Iraq under an authorization Obama signed early this month. \n \n The U.S. Central Command said it had carried out 14 airstrikes in northern Iraq near the Mosul Dam on Wednesday, after Foley’s execution, bringing the total to 84 since the air campaign began Aug. 8. Obama authorized the airstrikes to aid Iraqi and Kurdish forces fighting the Islamic State, to help rescue besieged civilians, and to protect U.S. personnel and facilities in Iraq. \n \n Since early June, Obama has sent about 800 U.S. troops to Iraq to assist in those missions. On Wednesday, the State Department requested an additional 300 to help protect the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad and a consulate in Irbil, the capital of the northern Kurdish region. A White House spokesman said no decision had been made on the request. \n \n Foley, 40, was kidnapped in November 2012 while covering Syria’s civil war. According to his employer, the Boston-based Web site Global\xadPost, he was held in eastern Syria with at least a dozen other captives, including other Western journalists, by British members of the Islamic State, which last week sent his family and employer an e-mail threatening to kill him. \n \n “We knew exactly where he was from the released hostages,” Global\xadPost president and chief executive Philip Balboni said. “We knew that his immediate jailers were British jihadists.” \n \n “There was talk of paying a ransom,” Balboni said. “I think the fact that others were released for money certainly gave us hope that a similar outcome could be effectuated for Jim.” \n \n U.S. policy has long been opposed to paying ransom for hostages, although a number of European governments and companies are believed to have paid for releases. \n \n Six European journalists — two Spanish and four French — believed to have been held by the Islamic State were released in the spring, although the circumstances of their freedom is not known. \n \n Foley’s parents said they had heard from him indirectly during his captivity via released hostages, one of whom memorized a letter from their son and recited it to them in a telephone call. \n \n Diane and John Foley, who spoke to reporters outside their home in Rochester, N.H., did not identify the transmitter of the letter. \n \n For the first year of his captivity, Global\xadPost and Foley’s family were sure he was being held by the Syrian government, according to articles on the Web site at the time. But last fall, they announced that they no longer believed that to be the case and said they would make no further comments on his situation. \n \n In Britain on Wednesday, Prime Minister David Cameron cut short a family vacation and returned to London to chair emergency meetings on Iraq and Syria, amid indications that a British citizen was involved in Foley’s killing. In the video, his masked executioner speaks in English with what sounds like a British accent. \n \n Of the 84 U.S. airstrikes carried out in Iraq this month, about 30 were launched by fighter jets based on the U.S.S. George H.W. Bush, an aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf, and other ships in its strike group, Navy commanders on the ship said Wednesday. The remainder of the airstrikes have been conducted by drones and regular fighter aircraft based in countries in the region that the Pentagon has declined to identify. \n \n Navy Capt. D.L. Cheever, air-wing commander for the carrier strike group, told reporters in a conference call that aircraft from nine squadrons have conducted about 1,000 sorties since early June, when the Bush shifted operations from assisting with the war in Afghanistan to the new mission over Iraq. The vast majority of the flights have been to conduct reconnaissance over Iraq. \n \n Cheever declined to say whether U.S. pilots had taken fire from enemy forces on the ground but added: “We can handle whatever they have and complete the mission.” Other U.S. military officials said that the Islamic State does not appear to have the ability to shoot down warplanes. \n \n Craig Whitlock and Greg Miller contributed to this report.']",3,"– Dr. Eben Alexander held a scientific worldview until, he says, he went to heaven.

213,"['When Wilco\'s ace guitarist Nels Cline told The Times recently that his band leader, Jeff Tweedy, was a ""collage artist,"" one who would resurrect ""treasured items,"" Cline was talking pop structures. Yet he apparently could have been discussing an appreciation for vintage cartoons. In what\'s a rare proper music video from Wilco, which is in the midst of a three-night stand in Los Angeles this week, the band\'s ""Dawned on Me"" has been re-fashioned as a tale of love and jealously centered on Popeye the Sailor Man and his familiar cast of characters. \n \n The cartoon, a collaboration between Wilco\'s label dBpm Records and Blow Me Down! King Features, was directed by designer-branding guru Darren Romanelli. Said to be the first hand-drawn Popeye cartoon since 1987, the clip sees the popular spinach-eating sailor trying to distract the love of his life, Olive Oyl, from failling for Wilco\'s Tweedy. The girl, of course, chooses the musician (sigh). \n \n ""Dawned on Me"" is one of the more lighthearted songs on Wilco\'s new album, ""The Whole Love,"" although lyrically it has a slightly dark undercurrent in its midsection. Amid brightly colored guitar and keyboard textures, what at first appears to be a bouncy number about calling a loved one is revealed to be something a little more sinister when it\'s made clear that the couple are no longer together. \n \n But never mind all of that. There\'s a cartoon to watch:', 'Popeye meets Wilco in hand-drawn cartoon music video \n \n [Video Link] The Wilco track ""Dawned On Me"" re-imagined as a classic, early-era Popeye cartoon. The song is from the band\'s Grammy-nominated 2011 album, ""The Whole Love."" They\'re on tour now, and should not be missed, as they are one of the greatest live acts on the planet. The animation is a collaboration with King Features, and is ""the first hand-drawn Popeye cartoon in more than 30 years."" Directed by Darren Romanelli. Best url ever: wilcospinach.com. \n \n A little more about how the video came to be, below, from Wilco and Romanelli... \n \n This collaboration between American icons is one of the first music videos Wilco has released since 1999 and it presents the band to the masses in a fresh, new way: as animated images, side-by-side with Popeye and his friends Olive Oyl, Swee’ Pea, Wimpy and Bluto. As one of the earliest animated characters, introduced in 1933 by Fleischer Studios, Popeye has become one of the most enduring and iconic cartoon characters of all time and is forever entwined in the evolution of animation. The music video marks the first new Popeye cartoon since “Popeye’s Voygage: The Quest for Pappy,” the 3-D CGI primetime TV special and deluxe DVD release produced by King Features Syndicate for Popeye’s 75th Anniversary in 2004. In what has become a primarily digital world, this new video marks the first hand-drawn, frame-by-frame rendering for Popeye cell animation since the Popeye and Son series from 1987. This certainly isn’t Popeye’s first foray into love territory: the Sailor Man first met his “goil,” Olive Oyl, in Elzie Crisler Seagar’s popular Thimble Theatre comic strip in the 1930s and their legendary love only grew and captivated the imagination of fans all over the world. The couple even made People Magazine’s list of the Greatest Love Stories of the 20th Century. \n \n (thanks, Tara McGinley, and Darren Romanelli!)', 'Bad Bard: a tax dodger and famine profiteer \n \n Jonathan Cake as Coriolanus: the play is set during a famine (Mark Ellidge) \n \n FOR centuries it has been regarded as a plea for the starving poor, but could Shakespeare’s Coriolanus have been his way of trying to expunge a guilty conscience? \n \n The play depicts a famine created and exploited by rich merchants and politicians to maximise the price of food and includes the lines: “They ne’er cared for us yet: suffer us to famish, and their store-houses crammed with grain”. \n \n It has now emerged that as Shakespeare wrote the play at the height of the 1607 food riots, he was himself hoarding grain. As one of the biggest landowners in Warwickshire, he was ideally placed to push prices up and then sell at the top of the market. \n \n “There was another side to Shakespeare besides the brilliant playwright — as a ruthless businessman who did all he could to avoid taxes, maximise profits at others’ expense and exploit the vulnerable — while also writing plays']",3,"– If you're a fan of Wilco and/or Popeye, the band's new video for Dawned on Me is must-viewing, notes Xeni Jardin at BoingBoing.

After they left, at least one loose nugget could be seen amid the disarray of the crime scene. \n \n Shock and consolation \n \n Along with shock, Robert Chandler, a retired historian for Wells Fargo and an authority on Western history, actually felt consolation Tuesday. \n \n “When we found out they smashed the gold scale case, I was so worried, but I’m relieved they didn’t take the scale itself,” Chandler said. “It’s been in that museum since it opened ... and it has far more significance than any nuggets they had there.” \n \n The 2-foot-high brass and copper scale was made by the Howard and Davis company of Boston and was used at the height of the California Gold Rush when Wells Fargo was crafting its reputation as the foremost authority for banking and weighing gold dug from the Sierra Nevada. \n \n The ripped-off nuggets and ore might be worth at least five times as much if they were able to be fenced for their historical value as Gold Rush-era artifacts — but that’s highly unlikely, said Don Kagin, a Tiburon gold and coin dealer who just published the book “Profit from Gold and Rare Coins Now.” \n \n That’s because Kagin and every other dealer of note is already sending out notices of the theft to professional associations and sellers around the world. If the gold shows up on the market, it is likely to raise alarms. \n \n “We check the background of historical gold, and nuggets are like rare coins — they’re worth more depending on the pedigree,” said Kagin. “They are artifacts; they tell a story. They’re more interesting than just plain gold.” \n \n The thieves may try to pass the gold off as historic, but not from Wells Fargo. Otherwise they will have to sell it for meltdown price. \n \n A meltdown sale may have been the fate of about $1 million in historic gold nuggets — 750 ounces worth — taken from the Siskiyou County courthouse in Yreka in 2012, the biggest such burglary in recent years. Two Bay Area men are doing prison time for the heist, but they never revealed what became of the gold. \n \n “That gold is either out of the country or melted down, and I believe it will never be recovered,” said Lisa Gioia, director of the Siskiyou County Museum. “It’s just terrible. That gold was worth a lot more than monetary value. It was our heritage. And now it’s just gone.” \n \n Museum will be back \n \n Wells Fargo said little Tuesday about the robbery, but spokesman Ruben Pulido issued a statement saying, “We’re disturbed this happened to the Wells Fargo History Museum, but are grateful no team member was harmed.” He said the museum, a popular attraction for schoolchildren that was redesigned last year, will reopen once the damage is cleared. \n \n Crash-and-grab robberies like Tuesday’s, in which criminals use a vehicle bumper instead of a crowbar, have been snaring headlines in recent months, but there was no immediate word on whether the thieves in a past heist may have struck again. \n \n On Jan. 19, crooks backed a U-Haul van through the front of the Patagonia store near San Francisco’s Fisherman’s Wharf, loaded it with pricey goods and sped off, authorities said. In a pair of November heists in the city’s Union Square, burglars busted into luxury boutiques — Chanel and Prada — and made off with handbags. \n \n In 2013, thieves plowed a pickup into a Tiffany and Co. in Walnut Creek, while in May, someone crashed a Pontiac Grand Am into an Apple Store in Berkeley. No arrests have been announced in any of the cases. \n \n \'People are crazy’ \n \n People walking past the ravaged Wells Fargo entry early Tuesday stepped over piles of broken glass, many snapping pictures while staring quizzically at the wreckage of the audacious crime. \n \n “People seem to be driving cars into things all the time in San Francisco,” said Justin Hogsett, who works at a nearby restaurant and ventured over to the museum after hearing about the burglary. \n \n “This is terrible,” said Justin Flores, 42, who has worked maintenance in a building across the street from the museum for eight years. “It’s a museum. People are crazy. They have no respect. This is where schools come on field trips.” \n \n Chandler, the Wells Fargo historian, said Tuesday’s robbery was probably the first time gold thieves have hit a Wells Fargo bank of any kind — museum though it is — since the 1930s. \n \n He was confident, however, that the same bank whose investigators nailed stagecoach bandit Black Bart in 1883 — in San Francisco — will get the bad guys this time, too. \n \n “I’ve got three comments,” Chandler said. “This is personal. Hang the bastards. And Wells Fargo never forgets.” \n \n Evan Sernoffsky and Kevin Fagan are San Francisco Chronicle staff writers.

The surveillance images of Cummins and Thomas – the first obtained by investigators since the alleged kidnapping on March 13th – clearly show Tad Cummins with an altered appearance to darken his hair. The same images show Elizabeth may currently have red hair. Efforts to determine what vehicle they were traveling in remain ongoing. \n \n Thomas, 15, disappeared on Monday, March 13th and is believed to have been kidnapped by 50-year-old Tad Cummins, a former teacher at her school in Maury County, Tennessee. The school district in Maury County terminated Cummins in the wake of an ongoing investigation into alleged inappropriate contact he had with Thomas at the school earlier this year. \n \n Thomas is a 15-year-old white female, with hazel eyes, stands 5\'0"" and weighs 120 pounds. She was last seen wearing a flannel shirt and black leggings. Cummins is a white male, who stands 6\'0"", weighs approximately 200 pounds, and has brown hair and eyes. He is believe to be armed with two handguns and driving a silver Nissan Rogue with Tennessee tag 976-ZPT. A warrant has been issued for Cummins for Sexual Contact with a Minor and Aggravated Kidnapping. On Friday, the TBI added him to the state\'s ‘Top 10 Most Wanted\' list. There is a $1,000 reward for information leading to his capture. \n \n As of this morning, the TBI received more than 1,200 tips from across the country. The TBI would urge the public to remain vigilant and report any information that may prove beneficial in the ongoing search to 1-800-TBI-FIND. If you spot the vehicle and can verify the license plate to be TN 976-ZPT, call 911 immediately.""', ""This illustration provided by NASA shows the New Horizons spacecraft.

But Japanese police saw it differently, arresting the 26-year-old American last month for allegedly smuggling illegal amphetamines into Japan, the Oregonian reports. ""We're left in a state of disbelief,"" says her dad, a Portland teacher. ""We would never imagine something like this assaulting us from a civilized country like Japan."" But Adderall is strictly illegal there, and police can hold Russell for up to 23 days without charging her. Meanwhile, her family, US politicians, and even her doctor are trying to get her out of a possible years-long prison sentence—for carrying a drug that's one of America's most widely prescribed, NPR reports. Trouble is, Japan's drug laws are among the world's toughest. The country routinely announces busts of amphetamines, which Yakuza crime syndicates smuggle into Japan for those who pull long hours, like white-collar workers, students, and truck drivers. Another problem: Russell's mom sent her the prescription in an old Tylenol bottle, which created the appearance of smuggling. She says she did it to ward off thieves and avoid identifying Russell's illness—attention deficit disorder—in a country where mental illness is stigmatized. But warnings against taking Adderall to Japan do exist online, and so far Japanese authorities haven't budged. ""She made a mistake,"" her stepfather wrote Japanese prosecutors. ""Carrie has been humiliated and punished enough for that mistake, which she will never make again."" (A tourist was once jailed in Dubai after reporting a rape.)"
216,"['This image show the mummy of an ancient Egyptian man in his 50s who had rectal cancer. \n \n Archaeologists have uncovered six cases of cancer while studying the bodies of ancient Egyptians who were buried long ago in the Dakhleh Oasis. The finds include a toddler with leukemia, a mummified man in his 50s with rectal cancer and individuals with cancer possibly caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). \n \n The researchers found these cancer cases while examining the remains of 1,087 ancient Egyptians buried between 3,000 and 1,500 years ago. \n \n Extrapolating from these cases, the researchers estimated that the lifetime cancer risk in the ancient Dakhleh Oasis was about 5 in 1,000, compared with 50 percent in modern Western societies, wrote El Molto and Dr. Peter Sheldrick in a paper published in a special cancer issue of the International Journal of Paleopathology. ""Thus, the lifetime cancer risk in today\'s Western societies is 100 times greater than in ancient Dakhleh,"" they wrote. [Photos: Ancient Egyptian Cemetery with 1 Million Mummies] \n \n Molto, a retired anthropology professor at Western University in Ontario, Canada, cautioned that some people living at Dakhleh could have died of cancer without any traces being left in their remains and that people in the ancient world tended to have shorter life spans than people today. However, even accounting for these factors, the researchers believe the risk of cancer was considerably lower in ancient Egypt. \n \n In five of the six cases, scientists determined that they had cancer by studying lesions (holes and bone damage) on their skeletons. Those holes were left when cancer spread throughout their bodies. For instance, a woman in her 40s or 50s had a hole on her right hip bone that is about 2.4 inches (6.2 cm) in size that researchers believe was caused by a tumor. In one case (the man in his 50s with rectal cancer), an actual tumor was preserved. Researchers cannot be certain where the cancers originated in many of the cases. \n \n Three of the six cases (two females and one male) were people in their 20s or 30s, an age when it is rare for people to get cancer, the researchers said. \n \n An ancient Egyptian woman in her 20s suffered from cancer that had spread to her skull. She may have had the HPV virus, researchers believe. Credit: Image courtesy El Molto \n \n ""When the Dakhleh cases were first presented at professional meetings, a common comment against accepting the diagnosis of cancer was that \'their ages were too young,\'"" wrote Molto and Sheldrick, a physician in Chatham, Ontario, in their paper, referring to the three young adults. [Image Gallery: Digging Up a Cemetery in Dakhleh Oasis] \n \n However, recent research has revealed that HPV is a major cause of several forms of cancer, including those that often affect young adults. ""HPV is a confirmed cause of cancer of the uterine cervix and testes, and it evolved in Africa long before Homo sapiens emerged,"" wrote Molto and Sheldrick in their paper. \n \n ""The two female and the male burials from Dakhleh, all young adults, could have, respectively, developed cancer of the uterine cervix and testicular cancer,"" the authors wrote. ""We know from current cancer epidemiology research that both types of cancers peak in the young adult cohorts."" \n \n While scientists were not able to genetically test the three young adults to see if they had HPV, other studies confirm that it did exist in the ancient world, Molto and Sheldrick wrote, noting that the virus likely existed in the ancient Dakhleh Oasis. \n \n So far, research into Egyptian medical texts and human remains have revealed no indication that the ancient Egyptians had a specific treatment for cancer. \n \n This image shows an ancient Egyptian child from the Dakhleh Oasis who was between 3 and 5 years old at death. This child died of leukemia, research indicates. His bones were riddled with holes caused by the disease. Credit: Image courtesy El Molto \n \n ""They knew that something nasty was going on,"" Molto told Live Science. However, ""we have no indication as to specific treatments for cancer, because they didn\'t understand [what cancer was],"" Molto said, adding that the ancient Egyptians may have tried to treat some of the symptoms such as skin ulcers. \n \n The researchers said they hope that in the future, data will be gathered on cancer and other diseases in the modern-day Dakhleh Oasis. This data could then be compared to the ancient rate to provide more clues as to how the risk of cancer has changed over time. \n \n Originally published on Live Science.', 'Archive-It Partner 1067: The Political TV Ad Archive, a project of the Internet Archive, collects political TV ads and social media sites in key 2016 primary election states, unlocking the metadata underneath and highlighting quality journalism to provide journalists, civic organizations, academics, and the general public with reliable information on who is trying to influence them & how.']",2,"– Diagnoses have just been made for patients who've been dead for thousands of years. Researchers digging in Egypt have uncovered six cases of cancer among ancient Egyptians, including a young child with leukemia, a middle-aged woman with a carcinoma—most likely ovarian, breast, or colorectal cancer—and a middle-aged man with a preserved tumor indicating rectal cancer, per Live Science and ScienceAlert. Based on those and three other cancer cases perhaps caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV), found among the remains of 1,087 Egyptians buried 1,500 to 3,000 years ago in a cemetery in the Dakhleh Oasis, researchers say ancient residents had a 0.5% risk of developing cancer during their lifetimes, compared to the ""100 times greater"" risk of 50% for people living in the West today. In most cases, researchers had to identify cancers based on bone damage, including holes left by tumors, and admit traces of disease could've long ago vanished. Still, the finding makes sense since ancient Egyptians had significantly shorter life spans than modern humans (which would affect lifetime cancer risk) and ""the carcinogenic load in their past environments would have been considerably less carcinogenic than modern Western societies,"" anthropologist El Molto and doctor Peter Sheldrick write in the International Journal of Paleopathology. As three of the six cases occurred in people who died relatively young, in their 20s and 30s, the pair suspect HPV could be to blame. ""HPV is a confirmed cause of cancer of the uterine cervix and testes"" and ""both types of cancers peak in the young adult cohorts,"" write the authors, who found no evidence of cancer treatment.

217,"['The cabin of a Qatar Airways plane. AP American Airlines on Thursday said it received an unsolicited notice from Qatar Airways of its intention to make a ""significant investment."" \n \n In a conversation between the CEOs of both companies, Qatar Airways said it wanted to buy about 10% of public shares, American Airlines said in a regulatory filing . \n \n Qatar Airways filed under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, as required for its proposed investment of at least $808 million, American Airlines said. It added that anyone who wanted to buy over 4.75% of the company must gain board approval but that it hadn\'t received such a request. \n \n ""The proposed investment by Qatar Airways was not solicited by American Airlines and would in no way change the company\'s board composition, governance, management or strategic direction,"" American Airlines said. \n \n The carrier added that it remained committed to pursuing fair competition with airlines based in Gulf nations. US airlines have raised concerns that the subsidies that Qatar Airways, Etihad Airways, and Emirates receive from their home countries create unfair competition and could squeeze them out of key markets. \n \n Earlier in June, Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern neighbors cut diplomatic ties with Qatar, accusing it of supporting terrorism. The countries also closed their airspace to Qatar Airways, which could be devastating because Qatar has very little airspace relative to its size. \n \n The airline said in April that it had seen a drop in bookings because of the US and UK governments\' ban on large electronics in the cabins of certain international flights. \n \n American Airlines shares gained about 6% in premarket trading.', 'American Airlines is not happy with Qatar Airways\' intent to invest. \n \n American Airlines CEO Doug Parker sent a letter to employees on Thursday in response to Qatar Airways announcing their offer to acquire a 10 percent stake in the company. \n \n In the letter, Parker uses the word ""puzzling"" to describe Qatar Airways\' intention to invest and specifically points out ""illegal subsidies"" as the reason behind his criticism. \n \n ""While anyone can purchase our shares in the open market, we aren\'t particularly excited about Qatar\'s outreach, and we find it puzzling given our extremely public stance on the illegal subsidies that Qatar, Emirates and Etihad have all received over the years from their governments,"" Parker wrote. \n \n Parker, a longtime critic of Gulf carriers such as Qatar, continued by saying the company is still maintaining efforts to stand against illegally subsidized companies. \n \n ""While today\'s news for some of our team may be puzzling, at best, and concerning, at worst, here\'s what we know for sure: We will not be discouraged or dissuaded from our full court press in Washington, D.C., to stand up to companies that are illegally subsidized by their governments,"" Parker wrote.', 'American Airlines is no fan of the world’s favorite airline, Qatar Airways. The feeling isn’t mutual. \n \n The gulf carrier says it is seeking a stake as large as 10% in American, the world’s largest carrier by traffic. It’s a new twist in the battle between US carriers and their Gulf rivals. US airlines have long protested that Middle Eastern counterparts Qatar, Emirates, and Etihad receive subsidies from their governments that allow them to compete unfairly. Those complaints were recently brought to the Trump administration. \n \n In a letter to employees, American’s chief executive, Doug Parker, said that rival Qatar Airways’ plan was “puzzling given our extremely public stance on the illegal subsidies” that American alleges Qatar Airways and the other two gulf carriers receive. \n \n Government-owned Qatar Airways has been embroiled in its own troubles, such as the US electronics ban, and a diplomatic crisis with its neighbors that allege Qatar supports terrorism, which the country denies. Its neighbors have closed their airspace to Qatari planes. \n \n Earlier this week, Qatar Airways won the top spot from travelers in airline-analysis firm Skytrax’s world airline awards, which it dubs “the Oscars of the aviation industry.” American ranked 74th, up from 77th a year ago. \n \n Despite its plush cabins Qatar Airways is tiny compared with American and other competitors. To compensate for its size, it is hopscotching the globe, snatching up pieces of other airlines, including British Airways’ parent IAG, Chile-based LATAM, and Italy’s Meridiana. It recently announced plans to launch an airline in fast-growing India. \n \n Airline Qatar Airways’ stake Meridiana (pending) 49% IAG 20% LATAM 10% \n \n American Airlines said Qatar plans to buy at least $808 million, or up to a 4.75% stake, of its stock, which would be subject to review by the US Department of Justice’s antitrust division. Qatar Airways also has designs on a stake as large as 10%, American said. That would make the airline one of American’s largest shareholders, a group that includes Warren Buffett. But the US airline hasn’t changed its stance on the subsidies dispute. \n \n “American Airlines continues to believe that the President and his administration will stand up to foreign governments to end massive carrier subsidies that threaten the US aviation industry and that threaten American jobs,” it said in a filing. \n \n Qatar is purchasing the shares on the open market, so there is little American Airlines can do currently. But the company’s board will have to approve any stake larger than 4.75%, and foreign voting interest is capped at 24.9%. While Qatar Airways said it only wants a passive stake in the company” a bigger position could be a tough sell. \n \n Update: The post has been updated to include comments from the airlines.', 'It’s a stark display of how the #MeToo movement has hit every corner of Hollywood. \n \n This year, among the usual plane tickets, holidays and luxury cosmetic items given away to Oscar nominees, will be a canister of pepper spray and other personal safety products. \n \n “This event is a unique opportunity for us to lend a helping hand in the #MeToo movement with solutions that take aim at the harassment culture that’s been pervasive most notably in the entertainment industry and in broader society,” said David Nance, the CEO of security systems company Sabre. \n \n “We hope to help others by inspiring self-empowerment.” \n \n Sabre is giving away five products in the Oscar gift bag, including a key-ring sized pepper spray, a gel pepper spray, two personal body alarms and a kit to test whether your drink has been drugged. \n \n The organisers of the Oscars have previously taken legal action over the unofficial gift bags, provided by outside companies, but still the bags, sometimes worth as much as $100,000, are given to nominees. \n \n (Credit: Sabre) More \n \n As well as the items from Sabre, there’s also another branded lightweight pepper spray called Pepperface. \n \n “In the aftermath of the Harvey Weinstein scandal, PepperFace is arriving in Hollywood at the perfect time.” said the company’s CEO Brian Pennington. \n \n “We want to be an awareness symbol to help end violence against women and also provide resources for those unfortunate enough to have become a victim of violence.” \n \n Other items in this year’s offering include a 12-day trip to Tanzania, a ’24 karat gold facial’, and a ‘conflict-free’ diamond necklace. \n \n Strangely, pepper sprays have appeared in the Oscar gift bags in the past, in 2014 when a pink and camouflage-print mace pepper gun was given away. \n \n The ceremony takes place at the Dolby Theater in Los Angeles on March 4. \n \n Read more \n \n Pitt and DiCaprio to star in Tarantino’s Charles Manson movie \n \n UK police investigating 10 cases against Harvey Weinstein \n \n Six Oscar upsets that could happen']",4,"– Shares of American Airlines stock may have jumped after news that Qatar Airways was interested in buying a 10% stake in the company, but American CEO Doug Parker threw cold water on any shareholder celebration.

218,"['The Bluefin-21 underwater vehicle is hoisted back aboard the Australian ship Ocean Shield after successful buoyancy testing in the Indian Ocean. (U.S. Navy / Getty Images / ) \n \n BEIJING -- An unmanned underwater vehicle will be deployed to look for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 on the floor of the Indian Ocean, Australian authorities said Monday, and investigators have collected samples from an oil slick discovered in the search area. \n \n With six days having passed with no further detection of “pings” from what may have been the plane’s black boxes, searchers on the Australian ship Ocean Shield will cease using the U.S. Navy’s towed pinger locator and deploy the Bluefin-21 underwater search vessel, officials said. \n \n “It is time to go underwater,” said Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, who is coordinating the search from Perth, Australia. \n \n The Bluefin-21, Houston said, will search an area of about 15 square miles on its first 24-hour mission. It takes two hours to get to the sea floor and will search for 16 hours. It takes another two hours to bring the Bluefin-21 to the surface and four hours to download and analyze the data it has collected. The Bluefin-21, which moves at a walking pace, produces a high-resolution, 3-D map of the sea floor. \n \n Meanwhile, searchers will work to send the oil slick sample, collected Sunday evening, to a laboratory on shore for analysis, Houston said. “We don’t think it’s from the ships” involved in the search, he said. \n \n Monday marked day 38 of the search for the Boeing 777, which disappeared March 8 en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people aboard. The aircraft’s black box batteries have a guaranteed shelf life of 30 days, so hope is dwindling that further transmissions from the transponders will be detected. Four acoustic signals were earlier picked up by the towed pinger locator. \n \n Houston said the air and surface search for floating debris in the area where the plane “most likely” entered the water would be concluded within two to three days. After that, he suggested, the countries involved in the search would need to consult with one another and determine how to proceed. No debris has been found. \n \n Eleven military planes, one civil aircraft and 15 ships were participating in Monday’s search about 1,300 miles northwest of Perth. \n \n The ocean where investigators believe the plane went down is extremely deep -- 2.8 miles -- and not much detail is known about the terrain. This is an area, Houston said, that is “new to man.” \n \n Asked if other underwater vehicles besides the Bluefin-21 would be joining the search, Houston indicated that investigators had no plans at this point. However, he indicated that if the depth of the ocean proves to exceed 2.8 miles, a different type of vehicle will be necessary because the Bluefin-21 cannot go deeper than that. \n \n ALSO: \n \n Crowds flood Vatican City for dual papal canonization \n \n U.S., allies to add sanctions against Russia over Ukraine \n \n Runoff set for June 7 to settle Afghanistan presidential election \n \n julie.makinen@latimes.com \n \n Twitter: @JulieMakLAT', 'Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption ACM Angus Houston: Bluefin-21 will create a 3D map of the ocean floor \n \n Teams searching for the missing Malaysia Airlines plane are to deploy a robotic submarine for the first time. \n \n Search chief Angus Houston said the Bluefin-21 drone would be sent down as soon as possible to search for wreckage on the sea floor. \n \n Teams have been using a towed pinger locator to listen for signals from the plane\'s ""black box"" flight recorders. \n \n But no new signals have been heard since 8 April, amid concerns the flight recorders\' batteries have expired. \n \n Flight MH370 went missing on 8 March with 239 people on board.

But I do not want to speculate on that at the moment."" \n \n U.S. officials familiar with the investigation told CNN they have been told that no other cell phones were picked up by the Penang tower. \n \n Pilots are supposed to turn off their cell phones before pushing back from the gate. \n \n ""It would be very rare in my opinion to have someone with a cell phone on in the cockpit,"" safety analyst David Soucie said. ""It\'s never supposed to be on at all. It\'s part of every check list of every airline I am familiar with."" \n \n When the plane first went missing, authorities said millions of cell phone records were searched, looking for evidence that calls had been made from the plane after it took off, but the search turned up nothing. \n \n Underwater search is shortened \n \n Efforts to find the missing plane and the 239 people aboard were focused beneath the choppy surface of the southern Indian Ocean on Monday as Australian authorities sent a U.S. Navy-contracted submersible diving toward the sea floor. \n \n But after completing just six hours of searching for underwater debris, the autonomous underwater vehicle Bluefin-21 returned to the surface, according to the Joint Agency Coordination Centre in Perth, Australia. \n \n It should have taken the probe and its operators 24 hours to map the first portion of the search area: 16 hours to map, four hours\' travel time to just above the ocean floor and back, and four hours for analysts to examine the data gathered. \n \n It is unclear how much of the area -- 5 kilometers by 8 kilometers (3.1 miles by 4.9 miles) -- the Bluefin scanned. It could take up to two months to scan the entire search area. \n \n Officials said a built-in safety feature recalled the underwater search vehicle after it exceeded its operating depth of 4,500 meters (14,763 feet). \n \n Capt. Mark Matthews, who heads the U.S. presence in the search effort, said the Bluefin aborted so the crew could refine the mission parameters. Charts indicated the ocean was at most 4,400 meters (14,436 feet) deep, so when the Bluefin went deeper than that, it was returned to the surface. \n \n ""It happened in the very far corner of the area it\'s searching, so they are just shifting the search box a little bit away from that deep water and proceeding with the search,"" he told CNN\'s ""Erin Burnett OutFront."" \n \n The decision to put the Bluefin-21 into the water for the first time in the 38-day search comes nearly a week after listening devices last heard sounds that could be from locator beacons attached to the plane\'s ""black boxes."" \n \n ""We haven\'t had a single detection in six days,"" Australian chief search coordinator Angus Houston said. ""It\'s time to go underwater."" \n \n The probe is equipped with side-scan sonar -- acoustic technology that creates pictures from the reflections of sound.

""This will be a slow and painstaking process."" \n \n The bottom of the search area is not sharply mountainous -- it\'s more flat and almost rolling, Houston said. But he said the area probably has a lot of silt, which can ""complicate"" the search. \n \n The search area for the Bluefin is in what officials labeled the most likely area the plane could be. \n \n ""It was the site of the highest signal strength or the loudest received signal,"" Matthews told CNN, referring to the pings detected by a towed pinger locator, a wing-shaped listening device connected to the ship by a cable.

The surface search was among the last, Houston said. \n \n ""The air and surface search for floating material will be completed in the next two to three days in the area where the aircraft most likely entered the water,"" Houston said. \n \n That search was energized last week when searchers using the Navy-owned pinger locator and sonobuoys detected sounds that could have been from the plane\'s black boxes, or data and voice recorders. \n \n But after a week of silence, the batteries powering the locator beacons are probably dead, a top official from the company that manufactures the beacons told CNN on Sunday. They were certified to last 30 days, a deadline that\'s already passed. \n \n That means searchers may not be able to detect any more pings to help lead them to those pieces of the missing plane. \n \n ""More than likely they are reaching end of life or already have.

""', ""Ramzi Bin al-Shibh, one of five 9/11 defendants at the military commission trial at Guantánamo, told the judge that problems with the food amounted to torture by the military guards. \n \n Here's why Marco Rubio may need to drop out \n \n In this sketch by courtroom artist Janet Hamlin, accused 9/11 co-conspirator Ramzi bin al Shibh (r.) confers with legal counsel during a pre-trail hearing at the U.S. Naval Base Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, August 19. \n \n In a strange twist in an increasingly unusual case, a defendant in the 9/11 military commission trial at Guantánamo suddenly asked midway through a pre-trial hearing on Tuesday to be taken back to his cell after complaining of being subjected to “psychological torture” by military guards. \n \n Ramzi Bin al-Shibh asked the judge to be returned to the terror detention camp rather than remain in the courtroom for the rest of the day’s proceeding. \n \n The judge, US Army Col. James Pohl, asked the defendant whether he was voluntarily waiving his right to be present during the hearing. \n \n “I cannot remain here,” Mr. Bin al-Shibh told the judge in open court. “There are problems with the food that was provided.” \n \n He said he was experiencing a “daily problem” with food and that when he had meetings with his lawyers during the lunch hour sometimes he was not provided any lunch at all. \n \n “This is one sort of psychological torture,” he said. “They cause problems (between) me and the guards on a daily basis,” he said through an Arabic translator. He added that it was not just a problem for him but for “the brothers as well,” referring to his co-defendants in the case. \n \n The strange action came on the second day of a weeklong series of hearings addressing a range of pre-trial legal issues in the military commission trial of alleged 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Mr. Bin Al-Shibh, and three others at the US Naval Base at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. \n \n The hearings are being monitored by news reporters at Guantánamo and via a live video feed at Fort Meade, Md. \n \n Bin al-Shibh was the only defendant of the five who chose to attend Tuesday’s hearing. The four other co-defendants waived their right to be present at the hearing and opted instead to remain in their cells at the terror detention camp. \n \n Bin al-Shibh did not describe his “problem” in detail, but whatever happened in the holding cell during the lunch break was enough to convince him to ask to return to his cell. \n \n After consulting with his client, defense lawyer James Harrington said there were underlying problems with detention camp guards that Mr. Harrington said he would seek to resolve with camp officials. \n \n “Sometimes things build up and build up and build up, and that is what happened in this case,” he told the judge. \n \n Another of Bin al-Shibh’s lawyers, US Navy Lt. Cmdr. Kevin Bogucki, noted that the judge had earlier issued an order to the guard force at the detention camp in response to complaints from Bin al-Shibh about noises and vibrations in his cell. \n \n Government lawyers said at the time that there was no evidence that Bin al-Shibh was being subjected to intentional noises and vibrations. But Judge Pohl nonetheless issued an order asking camp officials to stop doing anything that might be causing such a problem. \n \n Lt. Cmdr. Bogucki said that when Bin al-Shibh tried to cite the judge’s order to military guards after the ruling was issued, he was told they knew nothing of such an order. \n \n When Bogucki confronted camp officials about the matter, he said he was told: “This is not a judge issue, this is our issue,” and “if you don’t like it, file a motion.” \n \n The defense lawyer told the judge that detention camp officials showed a “complete lack of respect for your order.” He said based on reports from his client, the harassing activity was both ongoing and retaliatory. \n \n Judge Pohl said that the first time the complaints of noises and vibrations were brought to his courtroom, government lawyers suggested that perhaps the noises and vibrations existed only in Bin al-Shibh’s mind. \n \n “My client suffers from no such delusional disorder,” Bogucki replied. \n \n Pohl said that the appropriate response would be for defense lawyers to contact the camp commander and raise the issue directly with him. \n \n “The camp commander is part of the problem,” Bogucki said. “The quotes I gave you were from the camp commander.” \n \n The lawyer added: “This is a case unprecedented in American history given the treatment that these men have had, so we do have to proceed in some manner.” \n \n All five of the defendants were held for years in secret custody by the Central Intelligence Agency where they were subjected to prolonged and harsh interrogation techniques. Those techniques included sleep deprivation and sensory deprivation combined with prolonged exposure to loud noises. \n \n A spokesman for the detention camp at Guantánamo denied the existence of any significant problem between Bin al-Shibh and the guards. \n \n “A freshly-prepared standard detainee halal meal was provided to the defendant by the Joint Task Force during the lunch recess. The defendant complained that his lunch did not include condiments such as olives and honey,” US Navy Capt. Robert Durand, Director of Public Affairs, Joint Task Force Guantánamo, said in a statement. \n \n All five defendants are facing a military tribunal on charges that they helped plan and/or help with logistics in the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks that left nearly 3,000 dead. If convicted they face the death penalty. \n \n At a hearing on Monday, another defendant, Walid Bin Attash, complained that he was too ill to remain in the courtroom. \n \n His lawyer said he wanted to remain present during the hearing, but that a stomach condition was too painful. The judge called an early recess to the public portion of the hearing. \n \n It was not clear what might happen if Mr. Bin Attash was still feeling sick on Tuesday but did not want to waive his right to be present. That issue did not arise since Bin Attash told a detention camp official early Tuesday that he did not want to attend that day’s court hearing. \n \n The pre-trial hearings are set to continue through Friday."", 'BEIRUT Fierce fighting erupted between state forces and rebels in several parts of Syria on Thursday, activists said, including a town close to the capital Damascus, where an advance U.N. peacekeeping team was expected to arrive. \n \n Explosions and heavy machinegun fire rocked Douma, just 12 kilometers (8 miles) from the seat of government, activists from the Revolutionary Council of the Damascus Countryside said. \n \n They said columns of smoke were spiraling from several buildings. \n \n Syria has been struggling to suppress a year-long revolt against President Bashar al-Assad\'s rule that has turned from a peaceful uprising to, at least partly, an armed insurgency. \n \n The flare-up in violence comes ahead of the arrival of a United Nations advance team to Damascus, that will be trying to broker a deal to deploy observers to monitor a ceasefire plan agreed by the government. \n \n The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said army reinforcements were being sent into Douma as fighting continued amid unconfirmed reports of civilian casualties. \n \n In northern Aleppo province, close to the Turkish border, the Observatory said security forces were trying to storm two villages and had been fighting rebels for more than two hours. \n \n ""The loudspeakers at local mosques called for members of the regime army to defect and come into the towns,"" the group said, citing information from its network of activists inside Syria. \n \n Four soldiers were killed and several civilians were reported wounded, it said. \n \n In neighboring Idlib province, a rebel was shot dead by snipers and three civilians were injured by random gunfire in the town of Khan Sheikhoun, it added. \n \n (Reporting by Erika Solomon)']",5,"– After six days with no fresh pings detected, the chief of the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 says it's time to go underwater. The Bluefin-21 underwater autonomous vehicle will now be deployed to search for wreckage in an area defined by signals picked up last week that are believed to have been from the missing jet's data recorders, reports the BBC. Search chief Angus Houston says the robotic sub will be in a ""reduced and manageable search area on the ocean floor"" and, with the data recorders' batteries now almost certainly dead, efforts to detect pings will cease. On its first 24-hour mission, the Bluefin-21 will search an area of around 15 square miles, producing a high-resolution map of the sea floor, the Los Angeles Times reports. Houston warns, however, that the underwater search will be a ""slow and painstaking process"" with no guarantee of results. The area being searched, he says, is extremely deep—2.8 miles—and is largely unknown terrain ""new to man."" An oil slick detected on the surface of the area last night, meanwhile, is being analyzed and officials believe it didn't come from any of the search vessels, CNN reports."
219,"['Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. \n \n / Updated By Ken Dilanian, Peter Alexander. and Courtney Kube \n \n Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and one of his senior advisers, has come under FBI scrutiny in the Russia investigation, multiple U.S. officials told NBC News. \n \n Investigators believe Kushner has significant information relevant to their inquiry, officials said. That does not mean they suspect him of a crime or intend to charge him. \n \n The FBI’s scrutiny of Kushner places the bureau’s sprawling counterintelligence and criminal investigation not only on the doorstep of the White House, but the Trump family circle. The Washington Post first reported last week that a senior White House official close to Trump was a ""person of interest,"" but did not name the person. The term ""person of interest"" has no legal meaning. \n \n The officials said Kushner is in a different category from former Trump aides Paul Manafort and Michael Flynn, who are formally considered subjects of the investigation. According to the Justice Department\'s U.S. Attorneys\' Manual, ""A \'subject\' of an investigation is a person whose conduct is within the scope of the grand jury\'s investigation."" \n \n Records of both Manafort and Flynn have been demanded by grand jury subpoenas, NBC News has reported. \n \n Related: Feds Subpoena Records for $3.5M Mystery Mortgage on Manafort\'s Home \n \n It is not known whether Kushner has received any records requests from federal investigators. \n \n Also unclear is what precisely about Kushner’s activities has drawn the FBI’s interest as it investigates whether Trump associates coordinated with the Russian campaign to interfere in the election. Former FBI Director Robert Mueller is now leading the probe as a special counsel. \n \n Kushner met at least once in December with the Russian ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, and he also met last year with a Russian banker, Sergey Gorkov. \n \n Related: Flynn, Manafort Are Key Figures in Russia Probe That Mueller Will Lead \n \n “Mr. Kushner previously volunteered to share with Congress what he knows about these meetings,"" Kushner\'s lawyer, Jamie Gorelick, told NBC News. ""He will do the same if he is contacted in connection with any other inquiry."" \n \n Congressional aides have said they would like to question Kushner about that meeting, and Kushner has said he would voluntarily appear before the Senate intelligence committee as part of its Russia investigation. \n \n Gorkov is chairman of VneshEconomBank, a Russian government-owned institution that has been under U.S. sanctions since July 2014. Gorkov studied at the training school for the FSB, one of Russia’s intelligence services. \n \n Kushner, whose family’s real estate empire is worth $1.8 billion, according to Forbes, wields significant power in the White House. He is married to Trump’s daughter, Ivanka.', 'The Democratic National Committee (DNC) is calling for the suspension of Jared Kushner’s security clearance while the senior White House adviser is under FBI scrutiny. \n \n “The FBI’s Russia investigation reached Trump’s backyard, and now it’s in his house,” DNC Deputy Communications Director Adrienne Watson said in a statement Thursday. “Kushner’s security clearance should be suspended until the FBI’s findings are complete.” \n \n NBC News on Thursday reported that Kushner has come under scrutiny in the FBI’s investigation of possible collusion between Russia and President Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential election. \n \n The FBI’s focus on Kushner does not mean he is suspected of a crime or considered a subject of the bureau’s wider probe of Russian election meddling last year. \n \n Kushner’s attorney on Thursday said that top Trump administration official would cooperate on any probes of his past meetings with Russians. \n \n ADVERTISEMENT \n \n “Mr. Kushner previously volunteered with Congress what he knows about these meetings,” Jamie Gorelick said in a statement. “He will do the same if he is contacted in connection with any other inquiry” \n \n The Washington Post on Thursday reported that investigators are instead examining Kushner’s meetings with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak and a Russian banking executive late last year. The news comes a week after reports that the law enforcement investigation of Russian election intrusions had identified a current White House official as a person of interest, though the person’s identity was not revealed. \n \n Kushner ranks among Trump’s closest confidants as is married to the president’s daughter Ivanka and oversees a vast agenda in his administration.', 'Jared Kushner, a senior adviser to Donald Trump and the president\'s son-in-law, is under scrutiny by the FBI as part of the Russia investigation, it was reported on Thursday night. \n \n Officials believe that Mr Kushner has ""significant information"" and they are reportedly focusing on meetings he held with the Russian ambassador to the US and a banker from Moscow in the weeks after Mr Trump\'s election victory last December. \n \n Mr Kushner, a real estate developer who is married to the president\'s eldest daughter Ivanka Trump, has not been accused of committing any crimes.', 'WASHINGTON—An attorney for senior White House aide Jared Kushner said Thursday that Mr. Kushner would cooperate with any investigations into meetings he had with Russians, amid a federal probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. \n \n Mr. Kushner’s attorney, Jamie Gorelick, said in a statement: “Mr. Kushner previously volunteered to share with Congress what he knows about these meetings. He will do the same if he is contacted in connection with any other inquiry.” \n \n ...']",4,"– Jared Kushner will be cooperating with any probe of Russian links to his father-in-law's campaign, a lawyer confirmed Thursday after reports that investigators are focusing on the senior White House adviser surfaced. Attorney Jamie Gorelick said Kushner has already offered to tell Congress all about his meetings with Russian officials and he will do the same ""if contacted in connection with any other inquiry."" Sources tell the Wall Street Journal that federal investigators have been looking into Kushner's Russian contacts for months, though he has not yet been contacted by the FBI. In other coverage: Sources tell NBC News that investigators believe Kushner has information that could be very useful to the Russia investigation, though he's not personally suspected of wrongdoing. Kushner met Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak and Russian banker Sergey Gorkov last year. Democrats are calling for Kushner's White House security clearance to be pulled, the Hill reports. ""The FBI's Russia investigation reached Trump's backyard, and now it's in his house,"" DNC Deputy Communications Director Adrienne Watson said in a statement. ""Kushner's security clearance should be suspended until the FBI's findings are complete."" Investigators are also looking into possible financial crimes, according to the Telegraph, though the Justice Department isn't providing details. ""I can't confirm or deny the existence or non-existence of investigations or subjects of investigations,"" spokesperson Sarah Isgur Flores said. While much is still unclear, there will be plenty of people saying ""I told you so"" if corruption allegations involving Kushner surface, according to Aaron Blake at the Washington Post. Trump's hiring of a family member for a senior White House role was strongly criticized, and ""as any expert on corrupt authoritarian regimes throughout history will tell you, those regimes' wrongdoing will often run through family members with official titles,"" he writes. In a separate development linked to the Russia investigation, House Oversight Committee chief Rep. Jason Chaffetz said he wants to review former FBI Director James Comey's contacts with the White House and Justice Department going all the way back to 2013, the AP reports. He told acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe that he wants to ""better understand"" Comey's interactions with the White House. Chaffetz announced his surprise resignation last week, and Republicans are pushing to have him replaced by somebody who will be in office for longer."
220,"['The back-to-school season is here, and as parents take their children to shop for school supplies, I suspect that many of them will be visiting a Staples store. I\'m very familiar with those stores because Staples is one of many businesses we helped create and expand at Bain Capital, a firm that my colleagues and I built. The firm succeeded by growing and fixing companies. \n \n The lessons I learned over my 15 years at Bain Capital were valuable in helping me turn around the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. They also helped me as governor of Massachusetts to turn a budget deficit into a surplus and reduce our unemployment rate to 4.7%. The lessons from that time would help me as president to fix our economy, create jobs and get things done in Washington. \n \n A broad message emerges from my Bain Capital days: A good idea is not enough for a business to succeed. It requires a talented team, a good business plan and capital to execute it. That was true of companies we helped start, like Staples and the Bright Horizons child-care provider, and several of the struggling companies we helped turn around, like the Brookstone retailer and the contact-lens maker Wesley Jessen. \n \n My presidency would make it easier for entrepreneurs and small businesses to get the investment dollars they need to grow, by reducing and simplifying taxes; replacing Obamacare with real health-care reform that contains costs and improves care; and by stemming the flood of new regulations that are tying small businesses in knots. \n \n My business experience confirmed my belief in empowering people. For example, at Bain Capital we bought Accuride, a company that made truck rims and wheels, because we saw untapped potential there. We instituted performance bonuses for the management team, which had a dramatic impact. The managers made the plants more productive, and the company started growing, adding 300 jobs while Bain was involved. My faith in people, not government, is at the foundation of my plan to strengthen America\'s middle class. \n \n I also saw firsthand through these investments how energy costs impact the ability of a business to grow. Today, energy costs are weighing on job creators across America because President Obama has limited energy exploration and restricted development in ways that sap economic performance, curtail growth, and kill jobs. I will take a sensible approach to tapping our energy resources, which will both create jobs and make energy more affordable for every sector of our economy. \n \n In the 1990s, when the ""old-technology"" steel industry in the U.S. was failing, Bain Capital helped build a new steel company, Steel Dynamics, which has grown into one of the largest steel producers in America today, holding its own against Chinese producers. The key to its success? State-of-the-art new technology. \n \n Here are two lessons from the Steel Dynamics story: First, innovation is essential to the competitiveness of U.S. manufacturing. We are the most innovative, entrepreneurial nation in the world. To maintain that lead, we must give people the skills to succeed. My plan for a stronger middle class includes policies to give every family access to great schools and quality teachers, to improve access to higher education, and to attract and retain the best talent from around the world. \n \n The second lesson is that we must have a level playing field in international trade. As president, I will challenge unfair trade practices that are harming American workers. \n \n Running a business also brings lessons in tackling challenges. I was on the board of a medical diagnostic-laboratory company, Damon, when a competitor announced that it had settled with the government over a charge of fraudulent Medicare billing. I and fellow Damon outside board members joined together and immediately hired an independent law firm to examine Damon\'s own practices. \n \n The investigation revealed a need to make some changes, which we did. The company, along with several other clinical-laboratory companies, ended up being fined for billing practices. And a Damon manager who was responsible for the fraud went to jail. The experience taught me that when you see a problem, run toward it or it will only get worse. \n \n That will be my approach to our federal budget problem. I am committed to capping federal spending below 20% of GDP and reducing nondefense discretionary spending by 5%. This will surely result in much wailing and gnashing of teeth in Washington. But a failure of leadership has created our debt crisis, and ducking responsibility will only cripple the economy and smother opportunity for our children and grandchildren. \n \n I\'m not sure Bain Capital could have grown or turned around some of the companies we invested in had we faced today\'s anti-business environment. Andy Puzder, the chief executive of CKE Restaurants Inc., which employs about 21,000 people at Carl\'s Jr. and Hardee\'s restaurants, has said that the ""current unfriendly economic environment perhaps best explains why American companies are sitting on over $2 trillion which they could invest."" \n \n President Obama has piled on excessive regulations, proposed massive tax increases, added more than $5 trillion in federal debt, and failed to address the coming fiscal cliff—all of which is miring our nation in sluggish growth and high unemployment. \n \n I know what it takes to turn around difficult situations. And I will put that experience to work, to get our economy back on track, create jobs, strengthen the middle class and lay the groundwork for America\'s increased competitiveness in the world. \n \n Mr. Romney is the Republican Party candidate for president. \n \n A version of this article appeared August 24, 2012, on page A11 in the U.S. edition of The Wall Street Journal, with the headline: What I Learned at Bain Capital.', 'The back-to-school season is here, and as parents take their children to shop for school supplies, I suspect that many of them will be visiting a Staples store. I\'m very familiar with those stores because Staples is one of many businesses we helped create and expand at Bain Capital, a firm that my colleagues and I built. The firm succeeded by growing and fixing companies. \n \n The lessons I learned over my 15 years at Bain Capital were valuable in helping me turn around the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. They also helped me as governor of Massachusetts to turn a budget deficit into a surplus and reduce our unemployment rate to 4.7%. The lessons from that time would help me as president to fix our economy, create jobs and get things done in Washington. \n \n A broad message emerges from my Bain Capital days: A good idea is not enough for a business to succeed. It requires a talented team, a good business plan and capital to execute it. That was true of companies we helped start, like Staples and the Bright Horizons child-care provider, and several of the struggling companies we helped turn around, like the Brookstone retailer and the contact-lens maker Wesley Jessen. \n \n My presidency would make it easier for entrepreneurs and small businesses to get the investment dollars they need to grow, by reducing and simplifying taxes; replacing Obamacare with real health-care reform that contains costs and improves care; and by stemming the flood of new regulations that are tying small businesses in knots. \n \n My business experience confirmed my belief in empowering people. For example, at Bain Capital we bought Accuride, a company that made truck rims and wheels, because we saw untapped potential there. We instituted performance bonuses for the management team, which had a dramatic impact. The managers made the plants more productive, and the company started growing, adding 300 jobs while Bain was involved. My faith in people, not government, is at the foundation of my plan to strengthen America\'s middle class. \n \n I also saw firsthand through these investments how energy costs impact the ability of a business to grow. Today, energy costs are weighing on job creators across America because President Obama has limited energy exploration and restricted development in ways that sap economic performance, curtail growth, and kill jobs.

Demarest, 13, and a seventh-grade student at Greenwich Central School, was pronounced dead at around 10 p.m. Tuesday, after he and a friend were dug out of the snow pile. \n \n Bell said police began searching for the two boys after an older sister of one of the boys reported that they had not returned before dark, as was typical, and she was concerned. \n \n Police found footprints leading to the lot, which is used by the village to dump snow after storm cleanups. The village does not own the lot, Bell said. Police dogs were brought to the lot and one of them alerted rescuers to the snow pile, Bell said. \n \n That\'s when rescuers began digging. \n \n ""I bet they moved seven ton of snow, easily, out of that pile by hand, shovel, snow rakes -- I can\'t even tell you what they used ... to recover those two boys,"" he said. \n \n Demarest was recovered from the pile at around 7:15 p.m., and rescuers began CPR. He was taken to Saratoga Hospital. \n \n \n \n The second boy, Tyler J. Day, 12, and also a seventh-grader at Greenwich Central, was found a few minutes later, Bell said. He started yelling and talking to his rescuers as they freed him from the pile, and he was also taken to Saratoga Hospital, Bell said. \n \n Demarest\'s mother was in New Jersey at the time of the accident to deal with funeral arrangements for Josh Demarest\'s grandmother, who died at 3 p.m. on Tuesday, Bell said. \n \n ""Our hearts go out to that family ... it\'s just a tragic day all around,"" he said. \n \n Day was treated for hypothermia and was home and resting Wednesday morning. \n \n ""In talking with Tyler last night in the emergency room ... it\'s a true tragedy, it\'s an accident ... and exactly what happened, I don\'t think we\'ll ever know, but Tyler states that him and his friend went into this area, they dug holes into the snowbanks and ... made what they call forts in there,"" Bell said. \n \n The boys heard trucks coming, and Tyler said he heard beeping sounds before everything went black, Bell said. \n \n Authorities believe the last truck to dump snow in the lot was there at around 3:30 p.m. That would mean the boys were stuck in the snow pile for more than three hours, Bell said. \n \n The Greenwich Board of Education posted a statement addressing the school community on the district\'s website Wednesday. \n \n ""As parents and educators, we so often say: \'Go outside. Be kids. Play and explore. Do something... anything. Please,\'"" the statement reads. ""We never expect it to end tragically under a pile of snow or beneath the weight of a rock on a hiking trail, but twice in the last nine months this is what our school and community (the 7th grade class in particular) has had to endure."" \n \n In March, Connor McLaughlin, 12, of Greenwich, was struck and killed by a falling boulder while hiking with his uncle at Roaring Brook Falls in the Adirondacks. \n \n ""The coming days and weeks will undoubtedly be difficult,"" the statement continues.

221,"['This collection contains collaborative Election crawls performed by IA.', 'Article Body 2010 \n \n A reformulation of OxyContin that makes it harder to abuse has curtailed the drug’s illicit use. But some 25 percent of drug abusers entering rehab said they still abused the prescription painkiller despite package labeling that emphasizes its abuse-deterrent properties, new research indicates. \n \n The study, by researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, is published March 11 in JAMA Psychiatry. \n \n Surveying almost 11,000 drug users at 150 drug-treatment facilities in 48 states, the researchers found that an abuse-deterrent formulation of the prescription drug OxyContin was successful in getting abusers and addicts to stop using the drug, but only to a point. \n \n \n \n “We found that the abuse-deterrent formulation was useful as a first line of defense,” said senior investigator Theodore J. Cicero, PhD, a professor of neuropharmacology in psychiatry. “OxyContin abuse in people seeking treatment declined, but that decline slowed after a while. And during that same time period, heroin use increased dramatically.” \n \n The original formulation of OxyContin contained high levels of the pain-killing drug oxycodone. It was designed so that small amounts of the drug were released over a long period of time. However, abusers in pursuit of an intense high found they could crush the pills and snort the powder, or dissolve the pills in liquid and then inject the drug. \n \n To discourage abuse, the newer formulation of OxyContin was designed to make it harder to crush or dissolve the pills. \n \n The abuse-deterrent formulation was introduced in 2010 at a time when 45 percent of study participants entering drug treatment reported they had used OxyContin to get high at least once in the previous 30 days. Two years later, the percentage of those who got high with the abuse-deterrent form of the drug in the month before entering a treatment center had fallen to 26 percent. \n \n These abusers continued to use OxyContin to get high by either taking the drug orally or finding new ways to snort or inject it. \n \n Perhaps even more worrisome, almost half of the drug abusers surveyed in 2014 reported they had used heroin in the 30 days before they entered treatment. \n \n “Some people found ways to get around the abuse-deterrent formulation so that they could snort or inject it, and others simply swallowed the pills,” Cicero explained. “But many people switched to heroin, and that’s a major concern.” \n \n Robert Boston Theodore J. Cicero, PhD, professor of neuropharmacology in psychiatry at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, reviews drug-abuse data. \n \n Cicero, also vice chairman for research in the Department of Psychiatry, explained that of those who had stopped using OxyContin and switched to another drug, 70 percent started using heroin instead. Many said they made that switch for economic reasons. \n \n “A few years ago when we did interviews with people in treatment, many would tell us that although they were addicts, at least they weren’t using heroin,” he said. “But now, many tell us that a prescription opioid might run $20 to $30 per tablet while heroin might only cost about $10.” \n \n In addition, he said, many of the people who sell heroin aren’t quite as frightening as they once seemed. Addicts no longer have to find dealers in dark alleys in rough neighborhoods. It has become easy to find heroin virtually anywhere, including suburban and rural areas. \n \n “Some people have come to see it as a cost-effective method of getting high,” Cicero said. “If they can tolerate the intravenous injection and overcome their reluctance to give themselves a shot, many of the people in our study said it was a fairly simple decision and that heroin now represents a cheaper, more attractive alternative.” \n \n Limiting access to a prescription drug by making it harder to abuse does not change the demand side of the drug abuse equation, he said. People who want to get high find ways to continue doing so. \n \n “The newer formulations are less attractive to abusers, but the reality is — and our data demonstrate this quite clearly — it’s naïve to think that by making an abuse-deterrent pill we can eliminate drug abuse,” he said. “There are people who will continue to use, no matter what the drug makers do, and until we focus more on why people use these drugs, we won’t be able to solve this problem.” \n \n The data were collected as part of the SKIP (Survey of Key Informants’ Patients) program, a component of the RADARS (Researched Abuse, Diversion and Addiction-Related Surveillance) system, funded through an unrestricted research grant sponsored by the Denver Health and Hospital Authority, which collects subscription fees from 14 pharmaceutical firms. The researchers also were supported by private university funds. \n \n Cicero TJ, Ellis MS. Abuse-deterrent formulations and the prescription opioid abuse epidemic in the United States.

How did he do it and what does it mean? Here’s what people are saying: “Obama didn't just work harder to clear this hurdle. He worked deeper,” writes John Dickerson of Slate. For the first time he made a cause personal, framing it in moral terms, and urging lawmakers to risk sacrificing their jobs to do the right thing. He showed a newfound “combative stubbornness,” writes Peter Nicholas of the LA Times. Republicans thought this would be his “Waterloo,” but Obama proved “that a president who picks a goal, adopts a battle plan and sticks with it” is tough to beat. The president basically schmoozed his way to victory, says Jennifer Bendery on Roll Call. Through one-on-one talks and social events, he flipped even tough votes like Dennis Kucinich. Republicans have delighted in calling Obama ineffective or incompetent, but that’s all over, writes Jonathan Chait of The New Republic; Obama has sealed his place in history. “He will never be plausibly compared with Jimmy Carter.”"
222,"[""Caffeine is America's favorite drug, bar none. And while we've extolled the culinary and social aspects of coffee over the years, sometimes people don't have time for a leisurely cup of joe and just want a quick fix. \n \n Today Ben Yu, 21, one of Peter Thiel's 20 Under 20 fellows, and his partner Deven Soni, have introduced a patent-pending form of caffeine that you spray directly on your skin. (This is not to be confused with Aeroshots, another novelty energy booster that is a powder you spray in your mouth.) The marketing materials claim that caffeine diffuses through your system more gradually through the skin than through drinking. Plus, at $15 for 40 doses, it's wayyy cheaper than Red Bull. \n \n Yesterday morning, I tried it. \n \n 6:15 am: It's my morning to get up with my toddler daughter. She is super psyched to be alive as usual. I am moving a little more slowly. \n \n 9:20 am: I miss my morning coffee. Cold brew from Brooklyn roasters Oslo with milk and two packets of raw sugar. Instead I take the four-inch-long atomizer and deliver 4 sprays to the inside of my left wrist. The foamy liquid delivers no residue on the skin. I sniff—no aroma whatsoever, let alone a rich, roasty one. Sigh. \n \n 9:27 am: My eyes pop open like Betty Boop's. \n \n 9:43 am: Whoo-hoo! The rush is a little bit disconcerting. Despite the claims, it feels like I drank my coffee very, very quickly. The tiny bottle contains 40 doses, 160 sprays. It's recommended not to take more than 20 sprays in a day, but it would be pretty easy to overdose with such a small bottle, or if you just lose count. \n \n 10:06 am: I offer my office mate at the co-working space a couple of sprays, but he says no way. \n \n 11:04 am: I'm writing my third blog post of the day, feeling no more jittery or distracted than usual. \n \n 2:15 pm: I'm hitting the post-lunchtime slump. The little caffeine canister is sitting right there on the corner of my desk, and the free cans of Coke Zero are all the way downstairs. I take a little squirt to the back of the neck. \n \n 2:17 pm: Whoo!! Heart is beating fast. \n \n 4:49 pm: Well, I got through my day. \n \n I can't say that I'll be converting to Sprayable Energy any time soon. It turns out I like the ritual, and the flavor and aroma, of coffee. And without these atmospherics, I feel too much like a caffeine addict jonesing for a fix. It's also worth remembering that there are growing health and legal concerns arising from products with huge amounts of caffeine. \n \n On the other hand, the $40 billion energy products market might have room for a solution that delivers this kind of jolt this quickly, with an extra spray of novelty to boot. \n \n [Image courtesy of Sprayable Energy]"", 'The people want Sprayable Energy. \n \n Why? Part of the stated appeal is simplicity. No scary chemicals. The product is a just three ingredients: caffeine, water, and a compound that helps it be absorbed by our skin (a derivative of the naturally-occurring amino acid tyrosine). Though Yu and Soni have also sort of obfuscated their premise by calling it a ""secret sauce."" \n \n (Sprayable Energy) \n \n Yu and Soni say their recommended dose—four sprays—should deliver about the same amount of caffeine as a cup of coffee. \n \n Their Sprayable Energy website also clearly states: ""The product is odorless, colorless, and safe."" The Indiego pitch says, in bold font, ""Never be concerned for your health when using caffeinated products again."" \n \n Who better than the proprietor of a new transdermal stimulant product to tell us that it\'s safe? We don\'t have reason to expect it to be any less safe than other caffeine delivery methods, though it\'s not been tested by the FDA. This sort of product is exempt. In May the FDA announced that it planned to look into our large-scale deployment of caffeine, retroactively. It said at the time, ""In response to a trend in which caffeine is being added to a growing number of products [jelly beans, waffles, gum, syrup], the agency will investigate the safety of caffeine in food products, particularly its effects on children and adolescents."" \n \n Image from the Sprayable Energy campaign. If this is relatable, consider an EKG. And start reusing your cups. \n \n So the organization in charge of making sure that everything we consume topically and otherwise is safe for us is, decades into the mass marketing and sale of caffeinated products without regulation, planning to look into their safety. As I wrote at the time, the only time the FDA explicitly approved adding caffeine was beverages (colas) in the 1950s (not long after increased caffeine had replaced the psychoactive component of coca leaves in soda—the latter, essentially cocaine, having been implicated in a spate of rapes). The current FDA stance is that beverages should not contain more than .02 percent caffeine. \n \n The FDA\'s mid-century caffeine approval almost certainly did not anticipate fortified waffles and skin sprays. Michael Taylor, a deputy commissioner at FDA, said in May, ""We believe that some in the food industry are on a dubious, potentially dangerous path. If necessary, and the science indicates that it is warranted, we are prepared to go through the regulatory process to establish clear boundaries and conditions on caffeine use. We are also prepared to consider enforcement action against individual products as appropriate."" \n \n An upside to Sprayable Energy—though I wouldn\'t go as far as Yu and Soni do in their pitch (""Caffeine products currently suck"")—is that coffee can cause stomach ulcers and yellow teeth. And energy drinks can come with a load of extra sugar. Both can add up cost-wise if you\'re using regularly. (These are the aforementioned issues.) For some, a cutaneous route of delivery may turn out to be a relatively healthy way to get caffeine.', 'These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

Just seeing or being told about the signature at the end of the diary would have been enough for him to reach for the phone. \n \n “He was not very literate and the idea that he would have been capable of producing such a sophisticated and credible forgery is not remotely plausible.” \n \n MOST READ IN LIVING GREAT BRITISH BUZZ OFF We rate sex toys from Poundland Bullet to Tango Lipstick to see if discount brands are an anti-climax fresh princess Remember Ashley from the Fresh Prince of Bel Air?

Rarely do I give thanks for the experience, but this year marks the 155th anniversary of the London Underground, that efficient marvel of public transport. \n \n On January 9, 1863, the world’s first-ever underground railway train, steam-operated, pulled out of Paddington Station, and rumbled 3.5 miles down the tubular tunnel to Farringdon Station. The line, which was financed by Metropolitan Railway, was an instant success: Approximately 40,000 people lined up for the novelty of riding a train underground. Within six months, 26,000 people were riding the train each day. \n \n By 1884, there were more than 800 trains in operation in what was called the Inner Circle, a circular line that enclosed central London and that is now just the Circle Line.

THE MAJORITY OF THE LONDON UNDERGROUND IS NOT UNDERGROUND. \n \n \n \n iStock \n \n The entire London Underground network is approximately 249 miles long, employing more than 4100 trains, and linking 270 stations. But only about 45 percent of those miles are underground. \n \n 2. EACH TRAIN TRAVELS ABOUT 114,500 MILES A YEAR. \n \n Each Tube train travels an average of 114,500 miles a year, or 4.6 times around the world. The longest distance between adjacent stations is approximately 3.9 miles, between Chesham to Chalfont & Latimer. The shortest distance is about 984 feet, between Leicester Square and Covent Garden on the Picadilly Line (and since Covent Garden is usually mobbed, you’re better off getting off at Leicester Square and walking). \n \n 3. MORE THAN 1 BILLION JOURNEYS ARE MADE EACH YEAR. \n \n Each year, about 1.3 billion journeys are made on the London Underground. The busiest station in the network is Waterloo, which sees about 100.3 million passengers per year; the least used is Roding Valley. \n \n 4. HALF A MILLION MICE CALL THE UNDERGROUND HOME. \n \n An estimated 500,000 mice live in the tunnels, but they’re not the only pests—the mosquitoes that live in the Tube are of a different and somewhat more vicious species than their aboveground cousins. Called Culex pipiens molestus, they’re supposedly known for their voracious appetites. \n \n 5. THERE AE SOME GHOSTS REPORTEDLY LIVING DOWN THERE, TOO. \n \n The London Underground is also supposedly home to a group of subterranean Londoners, who, just like the Mole People of New York’s Subway, took to the tunnels and mutated. The Tube is also reportedly home to a host of ghostly apparitions, including the Faceless Woman of Beacontree Station, the Toothy Man of Channelsea Depot, and the Screaming Spectre of Farringdon Station. \n \n 6. THE AVERAGE LONDONER SPENDS 11.5 DAYS OF EACH YEAR ON THE TUBE. \n \n The average Londoner spends an average of about 11.5 days each year on the Underground—5.2 of those days in the Underground’s underground tunnels. (What’s unknown is how many hours of those days are spent stopped underground, waiting for a signal failure to be resolved, another train to move along, or for whatever bit of rubbish that has been thrown on the tracks at the station ahead of you to be cleared.) \n \n 7. THE FASTEST TRAINS TRAVEL AT SPEEDS OF OVER 60 MILES PER HOUR. \n \n The fastest line is the Metropolitan, where trains can reach speeds of more than 60 miles per hour, but the average speed of a London Underground train is only around 20.5 miles per hour. \n \n 8. THE DEEPEST STATION IS NEARLY 200 FEET BELOW STREET LEVEL. \n \n The deepest Underground station is Hampstead, on the Northern Line, which is located nearly 192 feet below street level. There’s an elevator, of course, but also an emergency spiral staircase featuring more than 320 steps, in case of emergency (or a fit of exercise mania). \n \n 9. IN 1969, QUEEN ELIZABETH TOOK CONTROL OF THE VICTORIA LINE. \n \n In 1969, Queen Elizabeth II commemorated the opening of the Victoria Line by driving one of the new trains from Green Park to Oxford Circus. It was her second ride ever on a London Underground train, the first being when she was 13 and accompanied by her sister and governess. Presumably her stint as Tube driver was without incident as eight years later, the Queen was again allowed in the cab of a Picadilly Line train when she presided over the opening of the line’s extension. \n \n 10. THE FIRST ESCALATOR WAS A MISERABLE FAILURE. \n \n The Underground’s first real escalator was built in 1911 at Earl’s Court, but four years before that, a spiral escalator was installed at Holloway Road Station. It didn’t last very long—in fact, it only lasted a day of testing and never actually saw public use. Its remains are held at the London Transport Museum’s Depot, which is only open to the public a few times per year. \n \n 11. THE LONGEST ESCALATOR IS NEARLY 200 FEET LONG. \n \n The longest escalator at any Underground station is the 197-foot-long moving stair at Angel, in Islington, on the Northern line. \n \n 12. PEOPLE HAVE LEFT A LOT OF WEIRD THINGS ON THE TRAINS. \n \n Among the strangest things left on the Underground and collected by the Lost Property Office: A jar of bull semen; outboard motor; three dead bats in a container; a vasectomy kit; a harpoon gun, which may have gone with the 14-foot long boat; a stuffed eagle; breast implants; false teeth and a surprising number of prosthetic limbs; a four-foot tall Mickey Mouse; six full-sized mannequins; and an urn containing a dead man’s ashes, which was reunited with his brother five years after it was lost. \n \n 13. JERRY SPRINGER WAS BORN AT HIGHGATE STATION. \n \n Politician-turned-trash talk show host Jerry Springer was born at Highgate Station on the Northern Line on February 13, 1944, when his mother sought shelter during a Luftwaffe raid during World War II. \n \n 14. MANY PEOPLE USED TUBE STATIONS ARE AIR RAID SHELTERS DURING WORLD WAR II, EVEN THOUGH THE GOVERNMENT BANNED THE PRACTICE. \n \n Speaking of air raids: At the start of the London Blitz, Germany’s nightly bombing raids on the British capital in September 1939, the government banned people from using the Tube stations as air raid shelters, claiming that the stations should be reserved only for transport. People got around the ban by simply buying a ticket and refusing to the leave the platform. A month later, the government realized that the ban was unenforceable at best and cruel at worst, and gave the go-ahead for stations to be used as shelters. \n \n By the end of the war, sheltering in the Underground had became so regular that a ticketing scheme was introduced to keep people from panicking at the queues, and more than 22,000 bunk beds were installed in stations across the system to provide places for them to sleep. \n \n 15. ITS ICONIC MAP WAS INSPIRED BY A CIRCUIT BOARD. \n \n \n \n iStock \n \n The London Underground’s iconic map, which bears no relationship to actual topographical or geographical features, was designed in 1933 by Harry Beck. Beck, an engineering draftsman who worked in the London Underground’s signals office, was supposedly inspired by electronic circuit boards, and saw ways of tidying up the lines. But the department rejected the initial proposal, claiming it was too radical, and Beck was paid a paltry less than $15 for his work. Two years and some modifications later, however, the Underground adopted the map and has used it ever since.', 'A federal judge on Wednesday upheld most of the sections of Alabama’s far-reaching immigration law that had been challenged by the Obama administration, including portions that had been blocked in other states. \n \n The decision, by Judge Sharon Lovelace Blackburn of Federal District Court in Birmingham, makes it much more likely that the fate of the recent flurry of state laws against illegal immigration will eventually be decided by the Supreme Court. It also means that Alabama now has by far the strictest such law of any state. \n \n “Today Judge Blackburn upheld the majority of our law,” Gov. Robert Bentley said in a brief statement he delivered outside the State Capitol in Montgomery. “With those parts that were upheld, we have the strongest immigration law in the country.” \n \n The judge did issue a preliminary injunction against several sections of the law, agreeing with the government’s case that they pre-empted federal law. She blocked a broad provision that outlawed the harboring or transporting of illegal immigrants and another that barred illegal immigrants from enrolling in or attending public universities. \n \n The governor, in his statement, said he believed even the sections that were temporarily enjoined on Wednesday would eventually be upheld, and added that the state would consider appealing if that did not happen. \n \n For the most part, Judge Blackburn, who was appointed by the elder President George Bush, disagreed with the Justice Department’s arguments, including those that had been successful in challenges to laws in Arizona and Georgia. \n \n The judge upheld a section that requires state and local law enforcement officials to try to verify a person’s immigration status during routine traffic stops or arrests, if “a reasonable suspicion” exists that the person is in the country illegally. And she ruled that a section that criminalized the “willful failure” of a person in the country illegally to carry federal immigration papers did not pre-empt federal law. \n \n In both cases, she rejected the reasoning of district and appeals courts that had blocked similar portions of Arizona’s law. Legal experts expected the Justice Department to appeal. \n \n “The department is reviewing the decision to determine next steps,” Xochitl Hinojosa, a department spokeswoman, said in a statement. “We will continue to evaluate state immigration-related laws and will not hesitate to bring suit if, in fact, a state creates its own immigration policy or enforces state laws in a manner that interferes with federal immigration law.” \n \n The Alabama law was the latest, and broadest, of the state laws against illegal immigration, going further than one passed in Arizona. \n \n While Alabama is estimated to have a relatively small population of people who are in the country illegally, the numbers have been growing. \n \n Acting on a pledge that they would crack down on illegal immigration, Republicans passed the bill when they won a supermajority in the State Legislature in the 2010 elections. Mr. Bentley signed it into law in June. \n \n Del Marsh, the Republican president pro tem of the Alabama Senate, said in a statement after Wednesday’s ruling, “Our goal has always been to make sure Alabama jobs and taxpayer-funded resources are going to legal Alabama residents, and Judge Blackburn’s ruling is a significant win for this cause.” \n \n All summer, rallies for and against the law have been taking place throughout the state. Farmers and even the state agriculture commissioner have raised concerns about the law’s effect on farms, sheriffs have condemned it as too onerous for financially hurting counties and others have worried that it could seriously hinder the state’s efforts to rebuild after last April’s devastating tornadoes. \n \n The law’s backers argued that most of the concerns arose out of a misreading of the law that they believed in some cases was intentional. \n \n The judge ruled on three suits challenging the law on Wednesday, one brought by the federal government, another by a group of church leaders and another brought by civil rights groups. \n \n She dismissed the suit brought by church leaders, who had argued that the law prevented them from carrying out crucial duties of their ministry, concluding that they did not have standing to challenge one part of the law and that she had addressed the other challenge in her ruling on the federal law. \n \n Judge Blackburn agreed with the arguments of the civil rights groups on several sections or subsections of the law, but did not address many of their arguments because they overlapped with those put forth in the Justice Department’s suit. \n \n “We’re really disappointed,” said Andre Segura of the American Civil Liberties Union, a plaintiff in one of the suits. “We already know that this is going to cause a lot of problems in Alabama.” \n \n The civil rights groups are planning an appeal. \n \n Among the other sections Judge Blackburn upheld: one that nullifies any contracts entered into by an illegal immigrant; another that forbids any transaction between an illegal immigrant and any division of the state, a proscription that has already led to the denial of a Montgomery man’s application for water and sewage service; and, most controversially, a section that requires elementary and secondary schools to determine the immigration status of incoming students. \n \n The civil rights groups challenged this last section on the ground that it would unlawfully deter students from enrolling in school, even if it did not explicitly allow schools to turn students away. The judge dismissed their challenge for lack of standing, though she did not rule on the argument’s merits. \n \n Peter J. Spiro, a law professor at Temple University, said: “This decision really gives the anti-immigration folks more of a victory than they’ve been getting in other courts. There’s a lot for them to be happy about.” \n \n Still, Professor Spiro added, “This is not the last word on the constitutionality of this statute.”']",3,"– In 1992, a 9,000-word diary was found in the floorboards of a home in England containing a detailed confession to murders tied to Jack the Ripper, the serial killer who terrorized London for 10 weeks in 1888. It ended thusly: ""I give my name that all know of me, so history do tell, what love can do to a gentleman born. Yours Truly, Jack The Ripper."" It appears to belong to wealthy Liverpool cotton Merchant James Maybrick, who died a year later, but many experts dismissed the tell-all tome as a sophisticated forgery. Now, the Telegraph reports, a team led by writer and film director Bruce Robinson has unearthed timecards that show which electricians were working on Maybrick's home, Battlecrease House, on March 9, 1992, the morning the book was said to have been found. The man who came up with the diary, scrap metal dealer Mike Barrett, claimed to have gotten it through a family friend who died soon thereafter, leading many to believe it was a fake. But Barrett was a colorful character who frequented the Saddle Inn public house in Anfield, where one of the electricians working on Battlecrease House was also a regular. Because Barrett fancied himself a writer, it is believed that the electricians who found the book passed it onto Barrett, who then famously contacted a London literary agent that very day in March claiming he had Jack the Ripper's diary, adds the Sun. Mental Floss notes that many suspects have been proposed over the decades, including a former royal obstetrician. (The Ripper's last known victim remains mysterious.)"
224,"[""THE SHOCKING and tragic death of the President of Poland, his wife and a large official delegation in an air crash has prompted press speculation as to why Poland still used an ageing Soviet aircraft to carry national leaders, a Tupolev Tu-154. \n \n \n \n As a question, it pales beside the enormity of the loss that Poland has suffered--made all the more painful because the delegation of Polish leaders were on their way to commemorate another of the country's greatest moments of loss, the Katyn massacre of 20,000 Polish reservist officers by Soviet secret police in 1940. \n \n \n \n But if it helps clear up such speculation, your correspondent has part of an answer, after having discussed this very question with a senior Polish official, under happier circumstances. A few years ago, I was invited by the defence ministry to visit a NATO base then watch Polish troops training for a mission in Afghanistan. My small group of journalists were flown from Brussels to Poland and then around the country on one of the smaller planes in the Polish government VIP fleet, a Soviet-built Yak 40. There was no doubting the plane's age, though it appeared immaculately maintained and the Polish air force crew were exceedingly professional. \n \n \n \n Nonetheless, given the strong attachment of today's Poland to modernity and the western world, I asked one of our hosts why the VIP fleet still used aircraft from the Soviet era. The answer was pragmatism. The old planes were noisy and were not fuel efficient, but they were serviceable and tough. \n \n \n \n In the case of the Tu-154, it was dated, noisy and not that comfortable, but it had one great strength, I was told. A three-engined jet, it was significantly faster than the modern, two-engined airliners widely used by other governments for long-distance VIP transport. This difference in speed was such that when European leaders took off from New York, more or less en masse, to return from the United Nations General Assembly, it was noticeable that the Tupolev was always first across the Atlantic and back in European airspace. This speed played a role in keeping the plane in Polish government service. \n \n \n \n This detail hardly matters now at a time of such national sorrow, but if it helps explain why a large, modern and technologically-advanced country like Poland was flying such an old plane, perhaps that is of some small assistance."", 'Bill Clinton’s ‘change’ pitch \n \n Former President Bill Clinton’s speech offered an intimate tribute to Mrs. Clinton, describing for a rapt audience their courtship and early marriage — and their upward climb together in politics. \n \n His most telling praise, however, was about Mrs. Clinton’s grit as a reformer. With Donald J. Trump casting the 2016 election as a choice between drastic change and an unhappy status quo, the former president insisted that Mrs. Clinton, rather than her opponent, is best prepared to wrest change from an unwilling system. \n \n Mr. Clinton asked voters to cast aside the “cartoon” version of Mrs. Clinton promoted by Republicans, and urged them to think optimistically about the future. “Life in the real world is complicated, and real change is hard,” he said. Of his wife, Mr. Clinton said, “She is the best darn change-maker I have ever known.” \n \n Democrats have long aimed to beat Mr. Trump by discrediting his promises of change. But Mr. Clinton’s speech confirmed that Democrats know they must do more than that, and that they must compete hard for the votes of people who want Washington overhauled from top to bottom. \n \n Leaning into the Russian connection \n \n Mr. Trump was rarely mentioned on Tuesday night; the night’s headliner, Mr. Clinton, did not mention him at all. But the most prominent speakers who went after Mr. Trump attacked him on a notable theme: his friendly stance toward President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia warned against “giving the nuclear codes to a man who praises Vladimir Putin and Saddam Hussein.” Madeleine Albright, a former secretary of state, rebuked Mr. Trump for praising those two leaders and Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea. And she alluded to the release of hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee to suggest outright that Russia is boosting Mr. Trump. \n \n “Putin is eager to see Trump win,” Ms. Albright said, “and that should worry every American.” \n \n Mr. Trump has dismissed suggestions that Mr. Putin is trying to help him, but he has also not shied away from praising the Russian strongman. Democrats signaled that they intend to tie him closely to Mr. Putin in the fall campaign. \n \n A careful message on policing and civil rights \n \n Republicans had a simple message last week on policing, led by Mr. Trump’s blunt calls for stronger “law and order.” Democrats had to deliver a more nuanced set of views — voicing the party’s mounting concerns about racial bias in policing, while paying tribute to law enforcement amid a rash of police killings. \n \n That textured message came through in a series of speeches by lower-profile figures: black mothers who lost children to gun violence and in run-ins with the police, and a former New York City police detective who helped handle the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. And Eric H. Holder Jr., a former United States attorney general, called both for defending the police and for attacking inequities in the justice system. \n \n “The majority of police officers are good people doing a good job,” said Lucia McBath, the mother of a black teenager in Florida who was shot and killed by a driver after an argument over loud music. “And we’re also going to keep using our voices and our votes to support leaders like Hillary Clinton, who will help us protect one another so that this club of heartbroken mothers stops growing.” \n \n The revolution peters out \n \n Photo \n \n The worst of the Bernie Sanders-bloc tantrums may be over. After the roll-call vote that anointed Mrs. Clinton the Democratic nominee, dozens of Sanders supporters stormed out and encamped in one of the media tents, holding forth to throngs of reporters about their anger at the party and its presidential candidate. \n \n But inside the hall, the loud disruptions of Monday evening had faded. When Mr. Clinton mentioned the trade deals of the 1990s, which Mr. Sanders has blasted, there was no jeering from the crowd. Mrs. Clinton will still have to shore up her support on the left, but the Democratic nightmare scenario — a convention plunged into chaos and recriminations — appears to have been averted. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n It was ’90s night in Philadelphia \n \n For a party with an image of relative youth and dynamism, the Democrats showcased a very familiar set of faces. At times, the speaking lineup could have come out of a Democratic convention in 1996 or 2000: Ms. Albright; Mr. McAuliffe, a longtime Clinton ally; Donna Brazile, the acting party chairwoman who managed Al Gore’s 2000 campaign; and, most of all, Mr. Clinton himself. \n \n There were newer stars who spoke on Monday — like Senators Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker — and others set to speak later in the week. But the convention’s second night highlighted the durability of a party establishment that has managed Democratic politics, on and off, for a quarter-century, holding onto power even during the anti-establishment 2016 campaign. \n \n The lineup was striking, in part, because of the absence of similar leaders last week at the Republican National Convention, as the Bush family and its political network mostly sit out the 2016 race.']",2,"– As Poland wrestles with the death of President Lech Kaczysnki and 96 others in today's plane crash, attention is turning to the pilots' actions and the Soviet-era plane involved: The pilots ignored orders not to try to land because of heavy fog, reports AP. The plane involved is a 20-year-old Soviet-era Tupelo 154 that had been overhauled in December. Wall Street Journal blogger Marcin Sobczyk notes the planes were nicknamed ""flying coffins"" in Poland. So why are Polish leaders using such old planes? An Economist blogger who flew in one notes that the Tu-154 ""was dated, noisy and not that comfortable, but it had one great strength, I was told.

He also said that he didn't kiss the woman and that they were walking to the dance floor when McDowell attacked them. \n \n McDowell is currently facing misdemeanor battery charges. \n \n In a statement to CBS12, McDowell explained her side of the story, which read in part: \n \n Now I’ll tell my truth. I was told, by Darby Johns, that he would be attending a friend’s wedding and would be going alone. The day of the wedding, I was told by a shocked/dumbfounded friend, who knew that Darby and I were together, that she had seen Darby and Crystal Munoz getting too close to be “just friends.” After hearing this, I decided I needed to see the situation and the actions that were occurring for myself. So, I showed up to the wedding. In the beginning, I wore a black wig, so that nobody would recognize me. I just wanted to find out what was going on, unnoticed, and leave. My intention was to SEE what was happening, and if I saw him betraying me, it would have been a way for me to know and understand that our relationship was over. \n \n To me, lying to and cheating on someone you love is the utmost betrayal. Like I stated earlier, I was going to sit down, see if what I heard was true, and then LEAVE. I sat down at a table alone and spotted them. It was quite effortless to spot him, since Crystal was sitting on his lap. I watched them with their arms around each other, laughing, drinking, and even kissing. When they got up and held hands to walk to the dance floor is when my emotions took over. I picked up a drink, walked to where they were, and poured the drink, intended for Darby, on them. He was the one that had deceived me. However, Crystal thought the drink being poured was meant for her. I never aimed anything towards her. \n \n After this incident, I walked to the bathroom, where I bawled my eyes out because of what I had just witnessed. While sitting in a bathroom stall crying, I was interrupted by 4 girls yelling and banging on my stall door. I ignored them at first, because I was so disturbed, but one of the girls crawled under my stall door and demanded to know who I was and why I was there. I opened the stall door, tried to get around the girl on the ground, and I said, “I am here because Darby and Crystal were together, and Darby and I are in a relationship.” They continued to shout at me and I tried to leave, but I was punched in the face, drug to the ground, and even strangled. Might I add, I was in a car accident just a little over a year ago, where I received an emergency spinal fusion. I have 2 rods and 7 screws in my back, so imagine being tackled to the ground and the stress my spine received. The girls were eventually pulled off me. I stayed in the bathroom to clean up, and then I was going to leave. \n \n I am aware that going to a wedding uninvited is wrong. I am aware that pouring a drink on someone is also wrong. I just wanted to see if Darby was really cheating, so that I could know it was forever over between us. It was always about him, never Crystal. I never intended for there to be a scene. After the drink incident, if the girls had not of attacked me, there would never have been such a chaotic scene. I am very apologetic towards the bride and groom, since this happened at their wedding. Like I said, I never intended for it to have gotten so out of control.""]",3,"– Bridesmaids who party together, fight together. That was apparently the unspoken code at a wedding last Sunday in Palm Coast, Fla., where the New York Post reports an uninvited interloper caused a scene with a man she claimed was her boyfriend. Per WKMG, deputies say 20-year-old Shelby McDowell snuck into the Hammock Beach Resort to keep tabs on Darby Johns, who was attending a wedding there as an invited guest and who McDowell says is her romantic partner. Once there, McDowell said she saw Johns making out with a woman on the dance floor. That woman told cops McDowell rushed over to where she and Johns were, tossed a drink on the pair, then punched her face; Johns says they hadn't even made it to the dance floor yet when McDowell came onto the scene, and he denies kissing the other woman. After allegedly assaulting Johns' companion, witnesses say McDowell then ran to a resort bathroom—and that's when the wedding party apparently decided to get involved. McDowell says a bunch of bridesmaids yanked her out of a bathroom stall by her feet and started hitting her, but the resort manager told police that when he arrived on the scene to break up the brawl, McDowell was on top of the woman who'd been with Johns and was punching her. To make matters more complicated, at least for McDowell: Johns says she's not his girlfriend. McDowell was booked at the Flagler County Jail and faces misdemeanor battery charges, per WPEC.

226,"['AFP/Getty Images NBA Finals MVP LeBron James of the Miami Heat holds the championship trophy after defeating the Oklahoma City Thunder in Game 5 of the NBA Finals. \n \n MIAMI—When speaking about his oft-criticized and overanalyzed star, LeBron James, Miami Heat coach Erik Spoelstra has a line: You can\'t win unless you win. \n \n LeBron James won in every conceivable way Thursday as his Heat beat the Oklahoma City Thunder, 121-106, in Game 5 of the NBA Finals to win James\'s first NBA title. Jared Diamond has details on Lunch Break. Photo: Getty Images. \n \n James won in every conceivable way Thursday as his Heat beat the Oklahoma City Thunder, 121-106, in Game 5 of the NBA Finals to win James\'s first NBA title, erasing nine years of doubts and disappointment. \n \n Enlarge Image Close Getty Images LeBron James celebrated late in the fourth quarter. \n \n The man dubbed ""The King"" in high school finally had his coronation, and while the game will go down in history as James\'s vindication party, it will not be remembered as particularly dramatic. The Heat led by 24 points after three quarters and were never threatened. Despite the fact that this was a mere formality—the Heat had a commanding 3-1 lead in the series and frankly, the Heat were expected to win the title due to their talent—the mood among the team, especially James, was giddiness and joy. Drenched in champagne, he could not stop smiling. In the packed, alcohol-soaked locker room, he became separated from his Finals MVP trophy and immediately started hollering that he needed to hold it again. It is apparently good to be King. \n \n For the Heat, this is the reward for an impossibly wacky two years that began in the summer of 2010, when it became possibly the most disliked team in sports after James ditched the Cleveland Cavaliers to team up with Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade to form a megateam in South Florida. In a twist, Thursday\'s win didn\'t look like the superstar circus the team usually looks like: Sharpshooter Mike Miller, a role player with a bad back, made seven 3-pointers to score 23. Bosh had 24, and Wade added 20. \n \n Podcast \n \n The players, wearing white championship T-shirts, spoke of the evolution of an often-clumsy team that struggled to mesh and sometimes played out like a bad novel. After one game last year, Spoelstra revealed players were crying; in another, Spoelstra and James had what looked to be an angry collision. Miller, in fact, characterized the team by saying ""Everyone\'s dealing with something"" as if it were a soap opera, and oftentimes it was. Wade said the process of becoming a workable if colossal entity was finished this season when he took what could be considered a secondary role. \n \n ""I know I\'m playing with the best player in the world and that doesn\'t take anything away from me at all,"" Wade said. ""It was hard for me to do it, and no one would understand, but it was easy for me to do it for this team."" \n \n That didn\'t come easily last year when the Heat made the Finals but lost to the Dallas Mavericks in one of the biggest flops in recent NBA history. Wade said he saw the team\'s stars ""not wanting to step on each other"" while James saw what he had to improve on—namely, everything. \n \n ""[Losing last year] was the best thing that ever happened to me in my career,"" James said.

When asked another question about the shortened season, he answered simply that none of it mattered, he was an NBA champion. \n \n James notched a triple-double in a superb 44 minutes, with 26 points, 13 assists and 11 rebounds to set a steady pace for a drubbing. \n \n Oklahoma City was led by Kevin Durant, who had 32 points. \n \n ""I didn\'t want to admit it during the series, but those guys are really good,"" said Durant. \n \n James, meanwhile, said the same about the team he\'d just vanquished and hinted at a sequel: ""This won\'t be the last time we see them in Finals."" \n \n Write to Kevin Clark at kevin.clark@wsj.com', ""LeBron James, Miami Heat win NBA championship, rout Oklahoma City Thunder 121-106 in Game 5 King James' gets triple-double, wins Finals MVP and leads Miami to NBA title two years after televised special 'The Decision' broke hearts of hometown \n \n HEAT 121, THUNDER 106 \n \n \n \n MIAMI — LeBron James danced the last few precious seconds away, soaking up the moment and waiting to take a confetti shower. The one-time child prodigy, with a smile you could see from Cleveland, was a kid once more. \n \n \n \n And finally a King. \n \n \n \n PHOTOS: LEBRON, HEAT WIN NBA TITLE \n \n \n \n “It’s about damn time,” James said when it was over. “It’s about damn time.” \n \n \n \n A few weeks shy of the two-year anniversary of his infamous made-for-television special, “The Decision,” James delivered on his promise to bring an NBA championship to Miami. \n \n \n \n LUPICA: LEBRON'S HEAT WILL TORMENT KNICKS LIKE JORDAN'S BULLS \n \n \n \n Only time will tell if he ever lives up to “five, six, seven” titles he once predicted, but at least James and the Miami Heat have something to build on. \n \n \n \n Title No. 1 for James was clinched on Thursday night as the Miami Heat overpowered the upstart Oklahoma City Thunder, 121-106, in Game 5 of the NBA Finals. James, who uttered the phrase, “I’m going to take my talents to South Beach” when he announced he was leaving the Cleveland Cavaliers after seven seasons to sign with Miami, punctuated his first championship by recording a triple-double. \n \n \n \n LAWRENCE: KING JAMES SILENCES CRITICS WITH RING \n \n \n \n “This right here is the happiest day of my life,” James said from the podium after embracing his mother, Gloria. “It’s a dream come true.” \n \n \n \n The world’s best all-around player also pulled off a rare double by being named NBA Finals MVP in the same year when he was MVP of the regular season. \n \n \n \n It was a fitting encore to the “LBJ Redemption Tour,” which started when he admitted that he should have handled his exit from his home state of Ohio with more class. James also publicly acknowledged that he failed miserably as the Heat lost the NBA Finals to the Dallas Mavericks in six games last season. \n \n \n \n “I was a selfish player,” James said. “I was a selfish person.” \n \n \n \n The hurt from that performance served as motivation for James to return this season as a better, more mature player. He was dominant during Miami’s playoff run, which began with victories over the Knicks, Pacers and Celtics. \n \n \n \n Overall, he scored 30 or more points in 13 of 23 playoff games, including two games against the Thunder. He was averaging 29 points in four Finals games, but with the Heat in control for a majority of Game 5, James didn’t need his A-game. And yet, he still ended the season with 26 points, 13 assists and 11 rebounds. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n LeBron James hugs partner-in-crime Dwyane Wade after the duo help the Miami blowout the Thunder. (Ronald Martinez/Getty Images) \n \n \n \n When Erik Spoelstra cleared his bench with 3:01 to play, James hugged veteran teammate Juwan Howard before raising his right index finger to the crowd. He was then mobbed by his teammates and coaches when he got to the bench. \n \n \n \n Chris Bosh, who left the Toronto Raptors as a free agent two summers ago to join James and Dwyane Wade, added 24 points while Wade scored 20. \n \n \n \n “This is why we came here,” Bosh said. \n \n \n \n “We came here to win a championship.” \n \n \n \n The Heat also got a huge performance from Mike Miller in what could have been his final game. The veteran shooting guard is suffering from a serious back injury and he may be forced to retire. \n \n \n \n If so, Miller, a class act, went out in grand style. He scored 23 points and made 7-of-8 three-point shots. Point guard Mario Chalmers, the hero of Game 4, added 10 points and Shane Battier had 11. \n \n \n \n It was a disappointing finish for Oklahoma City, which reached the Finals by beating three quality opponents: the Mavs, Lakers and Spurs. But after Game 1 of the Finals, the Thunder lost four straight and at times played like a young team in its first Finals. Oklahoma City had only one three-game losing streak during the regular season. \n \n \n \n \n \n LeBron James - aka 'King James' - is finally on top of the NBA. (LynneSladky/AP) \n \n Kevin Durant finished with 32 points, and Russell Westbrook 19 for the Thunder. Sixth Man of the Year James Harden, who struggled throughout the series, scored 19 points, reaching double figures for the second time in the five games. The Thunder trailed over the final 42 minutes while Miami went up by 27 in the fourth quarter. \n \n \n \n Through it all, Heat president Pat Riley sat emotionless for much of the night in his customary seat across from the Miami bench. Riley’s decision to resign as Knicks coach following the 1994-95 season has paid off handsomely for the Heat. Miami has its second title in six years, which gives the franchise as many trophies as the Knicks, who began play in 1946-47 and last won in 1973. The Miami Heat entered the league in 1988-89. \n \n \n \n “I hope to see OKC again,” Riley said from the podium. “I think we will.” \n \n \n \n James and the Heat may just be getting started. At 27, James is in the prime of his career and after losing in two previous Finals appearances, he appears to be more comfortable in this setting. James’ teams went 2-9 in his first 11 NBA Finals games. He has now won four straight and the throne is his. \n \n \n \n It’s good to be the King."", 'ROCKWALL, Texas (AP) — When he was a boy and working in a pharmacy in this town east of Dallas, Ralph Hall once sold cigarettes and Coca-Cola to Bonnie and Clyde, the notorious bank robbers who would later die in a hail of lawmen gunfire. \n \n In this April 11, 2014 photo, U.S. Rep.

(Associated Press) \n \n In this April 11, 2014 photo, U.S. Rep. Ralph Hall mingles with fellow military veterans at a weekly ""Band of Brothers"" happy hour he attends nearly every week in his hometown of Rockwall, Texas. A 90-year-old... (Associated Press) \n \n Now 90 and the oldest-ever member of the U.S. House, Hall is facing a potential political shootout of his own — against a Republican primary challenger barely half his age, backed by national conservative groups and well-schooled in digital- and data-heavy modern campaigning. \n \n It\'s shaping up to be a test of whether old-style, face-to-face campaigning can prevail against the new election engineering and organizational techniques that are coming to dominate American politics. Is Hall\'s vast political experience still an asset or simply proof he\'s out of touch with today\'s conservatives? \n \n ""I\'m doing the same thing that I\'ve always done,"" the 17-term incumbent said amid a ""Band of Brothers"" happy hour at a Rockwall country club. Most Friday afternoons, Hall, who flew Hellcat fighters during World War II, hops a plane from Washington to Texas, then heads straight to the weekly gathering of U.S. military veterans. \n \n That routine may no longer be enough. Hall\'s district is safely Republican but he captured just 45 percent of the vote against five challengers in last month\'s primary, and has been forced into his first runoff since being elected to Congress in 1980. His opponent, 48-year-old former U.S. attorney John Ratcliffe, won 29 percent and has been endorsed by powerful tea-party-aligned organizations, including the Senate Conservatives Fund and the Club for Growth, who see Ratcliffe as the race\'s only true conservative. \n \n A former mayor of the town of Heath, Ratcliffe said he knows he\'s challenging an institution in the district of big-city suburbs and small towns that stretches to the Louisiana and Arkansas borders. \n \n ""I\'m running against a guy who has an airport, highway and lake named after him,"" Ratcliffe said, referring to Rockwall\'s municipal airport, and a nearby expressway and man-made lake project. \n \n Hall, who turns 91 before the May 27 runoff, shrugs off tea party suggestions he\'s a Washington insider. \n \n ""I just tell them, \'Look at my record. I vote with my party when I can. I vote with my district every time,"" said Hall, who described his campaign strategy as ""walking through every courthouse and walking the cities in the district."" \n \n An avid jogger, Hall moves at a brisk pace as he meets passers-by, stopping frequently to chat or hand out pennies fitted with a special silver band bearing his name. He also mails the coins around the district, and when aides tried to scrap the program for something more-modern, they got an earful from supporters wondering about pennies they were used to receiving. \n \n Known in Congress for promoting NASA and energy production, Hall largely forgoes formal campaign stops, instead attending Republican breakfast gatherings or just encountering voters while out and about. Joe Lynch, 65, says he\'ll remain a Hall supporter for life after running into him at Wal-Mart. \n \n ""I saw him coming up the aisle by himself just as unassuming as he could be,"" Lynch said. ""His car with House plates was in the parking lot. How many members of Congress do you think actually shop at Wal-Mart?"" \n \n Ratcliffe, by contrast, exploits Web-based advertising and has hired an analytics firm for micro-targeting. \n \n ""We\'ve tried to use that to better define and identify the voters within this district and folks that would be supportive of me,"" Ratcliffe said. He said he hasn\'t made Hall\'s age an issue but, ""I put him in a class of career politician that has gone to Washington, stayed too long, promised too much and become part of the problem."" \n \n In 2012, Hall went skydiving two days before the Republican primary. This time, he made a playful television ad calling his wrinkles political battle scars. \n \n Since the primary, his campaign hired a former Reagan administration media relations director, as well as a veteran of the Republican National Committee chairman\'s office. \n \n The congressman recently lent his campaign $100,000, his first personal loan in recent memory. Ratcliffe, meanwhile, has given his campaign about $575,000 and said he\'s ready to spend more. He\'s also expecting outside groups to spend enough to shape the race. \n \n Hall knows his age is an issue. He even referred to a rumor that his congressional office still uses typewriters (it doesn\'t.) \n \n But he\'s not reluctant to describe his brush with Bonnie and Clyde, who Hall remembers from the early 1930s when they ""bought two cartons of Old Golds, two Coca-Colas and all the newspapers we had."" \n \n ""He was a funny looking little guy. She was acceptable looking,"" Hall said. ""I saw them. But I don\'t think it\'s that unusual. They were a lot of places.""']",3,"– LeBron James was king of the court last night as the forward finally made good on his promise to bring an NBA championship to Miami. The Heat suffocated the Oklahoma City Thunder 121-106 in Game 5. LeBron was the star, chalking up a triple-double in 44 minutes, with 26 points, 13 assists, and 11 rebounds. The Heat led by 24 points after three quarters, and never looked back, notes the Wall Street Journal. ""It’s about damn time,"" James said during the trophy presentation, calling it ""the happiest day in my life"" and ""a dream come true."" James averaged 28.6 points, 10.2 rebounds, and 7.4 assists in the series, and was named the most valuable player by a unanimous vote. Chris Bosh, who left the Toronto Raptors as a free agent two summers ago to join LeBron and Dwyane Wade, added 24 points to last night's game while Wade scored 20. Mike Miller, suffering from a serious back injury that could end his career, scored 23 points and nailed 7 of 8 three-pointers, reports the New York Daily News. James' disappointing history as the antihero of the ESPN special The Decision, when he made his painful announcement he was leaving Ohio for Miami, his flawed role in last year's finals, and his inability to deliver a championship to his Cleveland hometown was blown away in Game 5. Now, ""the greatest NBA player"" without a championship ring ""will soon have one,"" notes the New York Times."
227,"['The Internal Revenue Service is demanding a whopping $7 billion or more in back taxes from the world’s most profitable hedge fund, whose boss’s wealth and cyber savvy helped Donald Trump pole-vault into the White House. \n \n Suddenly, the government’s seven-year pursuit of Renaissance Technologies LLC is blanketed in political intrigue, now that the hedge fund’s reclusive, anti-establishment co-chief executive, Robert Mercer, has morphed into a political force who might be owed a big presidential favor. \n \n With Trump in the Oval Office, Mercer and his daughter Rebekah, who has become his public voice, seem armed with political firepower every which way you look – and that’s even though presidential adviser Stephen Bannon, their former senior executive and political strategist, appears to have recently lost influence. \n \n Since the IRS found in 2010 that a complicated banking method used by Renaissance and about 10 other hedge funds was a tax-avoidance scheme, Mercer has gotten increasingly active in politics. According to data from the Center for Responsive Politics, he doled out more than $22 million to outside conservative groups seeking to influence last year’s elections, while advocating the abolition of the IRS and much of the federal government. \n \n The Mercer Family Foundation, run by Rebekah Mercer, also has donated millions of dollars to conservative nonprofit groups that have called for the firing of IRS Commissioner John Koskinen, an Obama administration holdover whose five-year term expires in November. \n \n One of them, the Heritage Foundation, received $1.5 million from the Mercer foundation from 2013 through 2015, according to its most recent public tax filings. \n \n Bob has always been very good at leveraging his money. . . . Bob’s been very dissatisfied with U.S. politics for many years. . . . I remember him being very outspoken about Hillary Clinton. Renaissance co-founder Nick Patterson, who recruited Mercer to the hedge fund in 1993 \n \n IRS leader Koskinen has said publicly that he intends to finish his term. On his watch, the agency hasn’t been cowed by the Mercers. \n \n The IRS recently released a little-noticed advisory stating that its top targets in future business audits will include so-called “basket options,” the instruments that Renaissance and some other hedge funds have used to convert short-term capital gains to long-term profits that have lower tax rates. \n \n But Renaissance, with assets estimated at $97 billion on Dec. 31, 2016, has shown no signs of buckling to the IRS’s demands. \n \n Nor has there been a hint as to whether Trump, a real estate developer who has refused to make his tax returns public, will intercede. The White House declined to respond to questions about the matter. \n \n Richard Painter, chief White House ethics adviser under President George W. Bush, said the optics surrounding the Mercers’ political connections and the IRS case “are terrible.” \n \n “The guy’s got a big case in front of the IRS,” said Painter, now a University of Minnesota law professor who is also vice chairman of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. “He’s trying to put someone in there who’s going to drop the case. Is the president of the United States going to succumb to that or is he not?” \n \n “Are we going to have a commissioner of the IRS who aggressively enforces the law and takes good cases to Tax Court or (somebody who) just throws away tax cases so billionaires don’t have to pay their taxes and the rest of us can pay more taxes?” \n \n The case against Renaissance was initiated before Koskinen became commissioner. \n \n It’s illegal for the IRS to discuss ongoing tax cases, and the agency declines to comment about Renaissance. But in 2014, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations issued a blistering report detailing Renaissance’s use of so-called “basket options” trades by its employees-only Medallion Fund to slash taxes on $34 billion in profits. The panel estimated that Renaissance’s back tax bill dating to the earliest IRS audit would be at least $6.8 billion. \n \n Jonathan Gasthalter, a spokesman for the Mercers, declined to comment on the case. \n \n He pointed McClatchy to a Renaissance statement issued in 2014 in response to the Senate findings. Renaissance said then that its tax calculations were “appropriate under current law” and that it had “cooperated fully” with the IRS inquiry. \n \n Robert Martin, a lawyer in the IRS’s chief counsel’s office who co-authored the agency’s legal notices on the issue in 2010 and 2014, said the law covering reporting of the options profits had held up for more than 75 years. \n \n Trump has the legal authority to replace Koskinen and the IRS’s chief counsel, the other agency position requiring Senate confirmation. The latter post is occupied by an acting chief counsel. \n \n John Coffee, a law professor at Columbia University who monitors the behavior of Wall Street firms, said the Mercers might win Koskinen’s ouster, but he doubts they could undermine the case. \n \n “I don’t know they’re going to get their candidate in,” he said, “and I’m not sure many candidates are going to try to reverse the staff on something that’s already deeply advanced in either litigation or negotiation.” \n \n Dennis Ventry, an expert in tax law policy from the University of California at Davis School of Law, said he was unaware of any instance in which a president had intervened to stop a tax audit or prosecution. So far, he said, Trump “has been remarkably restrained regarding the IRS.” \n \n The guy’s got a big case in front of the IRS. He’s trying to put someone in there who’s going to drop the case. Is the president of the United States going to succumb to that or is he not? Richard Painter, chief White House ethics adviser under President George W. Bush \n \n A former IBM computer scientist, Mercer has forged a web of relationships reaching high into the new administration. \n \n At the top is Bannon, a former senior executive of Cambridge Analytica, a data analysis firm in which Mercer owns the largest stake. The firm, a U.S. subsidiary of a British company, is credited with playing a key role in Trump’s victory by providing his campaign with electronic dossiers shedding light on the views of 220 million Americans. \n \n Mercer funded Bannon to produce hard-edged political films and a book attacking Hillary Clinton, Trump’s opponent in the presidential race. Mercer also invested millions of dollars to become majority owner of far-right Breitbart News with Bannon at the helm. The Mercers and Bannon helped to fuel conservatives’ anger over the IRS’s 2013 investigations challenging the tax-exempt status of right-leaning nonprofit groups, and Mercer funded a number of efforts calling for Koskinen’s impeachment. \n \n On March 29, at least 30 conservative leaders, including a Heritage Foundation representative, converged on the White House for an off-the-record meeting with Trump aides. The groups pressed a range of agendas, especially urging Koskinen’s firing, said one attendee, President Tom Fitton of the nonprofit group Judicial Watch. \n \n In a phone interview, Fitton said “the conservative movement is united in its belief there need to be changes at the IRS,” but he voiced frustration “that the Trump administration seems to be of two minds on whether or not to replace” Koskinen before his term expires. \n \n Fitton declined to identify other attendees, and the Trump White House has abandoned a longtime practice of publicly releasing visitor logs. \n \n The meeting was organized by White House aide Paul Teller, who worked with Rebekah Mercer on Texas Sen. Ted Cruz’s failed Republican presidential campaign – an effort that Robert Mercer backed with $13.5 million in donations to an independent, pro-Cruz super PAC freed of the usual contribution limits. Mercer gave millions of dollars more to the committee after Cruz bowed out and the super PAC threw its financial allegiance to Trump. \n \n Other groups that have joined the anti-IRS and anti-Koskinen choruses also got money from the Mercer foundation – $600,000 to the Cato Institute in 2014 and 2015 and $250,000 to Citizens for Self-Governance in 2014. \n \n Perhaps the biggest Mercer foundation beneficiary has been the Citizens United Foundation, which received $3.8 million from 2011 through 2015. The foundation’s advocacy arm, Citizens United, wants Koskinen to be impeached. It also spearheaded attacks on Clinton last year over her use of a personal email account to conduct official business during eight years as secretary of state. David Bossie, who is president of both Citizens United entities, and Rebekah Mercer collaborated on the super PAC that backed Trump and later as members of Trump’s transition team. \n \n “Bob (Mercer) has always been very good at leveraging his money” in both business and politics, said Nick Patterson, a Renaissance co-founder and former intelligence code-breaker who recruited Mercer to the hedge fund in 1993. “Bob’s been very dissatisfied with U.S. politics for many years.” \n \n Spokespeople for the Heritage Foundation, Cato, Citizens for Self-Governance and Citizens United did not respond to requests for comment. \n \n Robert Mercer became co-CEO at Renaissance, or RenTech, in November 2009 as the federal government was cracking down on abuses that had contributed to the nation’s worst financial crisis since the Depression. \n \n As a high-volume, high-frequency trader, RenTech’s role in the crisis attracted scrutiny from the Securities and Exchange Commission and the IRS. Federal agents were alarmed by what they found. \n \n In 2010, the IRS issued a public memorandum warning hedge funds and banks about using “basket options,” structures in which banks loaned funds for the traders to purchase derivatives, which they held in “baskets.” It didn’t mention RenTech by name. \n \n The IRS memo said that hedge funds – not their partner banks – controlled the underlying assets and thus should pay taxes at a higher capital gains rate. \n \n Some hedge funds and banks stopped using basket options, but RenTech persisted. \n \n Then, in July 2014, Democratic Chairman Carl Levin of the Senate Investigations Subcommittee and its ranking Republican, Arizona Sen. John McCain, issued the report accusing Renaissance of a giant tax dodge on hundreds of millions of options trades dating to 1999. \n \n The panel said basket-trading also had enabled RenTech to dramatically increase its leverage, meaning it could borrow up to 10 times more money against its securities portfolio. \n \n Following the Senate investigation, the IRS issued a notice in 2015 that left no doubt basket-option contracts were taxable as ordinary income. \n \n Without identifying the affected party, IRS attorney Martin confirmed in a phone interview that one ongoing IRS enforcement case stems from basket trades. He said such options cases came down to ensuring that financial instruments were defined for what they really were. \n \n “If you are going to call it a derivative . . . it has to function like a derivative,” he said. “And if it functions like a brokerage account, that’s how it has to be treated.” \n \n The Renaissance case is not yet in tax court. \n \n In the years since the case began, the father-daughter Mercer team has set an agenda that amounts to a full-fledged assault on the established order. \n \n Besides the IRS, targets have included former President Barack Obama, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Reserve, the Department of Justice, various Democratic and moderate Republican members of Congress, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, and burdensome regulations and agencies that hinder Mercer’s energy investments. \n \n Mercer has called the Civil Rights Act of 1964 a mistake and has voiced disdain for other federal measures to protect the rights of African-Americans and other minorities. \n \n The Mercers’ foundation gave nearly $11 million from 2011 to 2014 to the Media Research Center, an advocacy group whose “sole mission,” according to its website, “is to expose and neutralize the propaganda arm of the Left: the national news media.” \n \n In a rare public statement weeks before Trump’s upset victory, the Mercers said they believe that “America is finally fed up and disgusted with its political elite.” \n \n “Trump is channeling this disgust,” they said, “and those among the political elite who quake before the boom-box of media blather do not appreciate the apocalyptic choice that America faces.” \n \n In 2010, the same year the IRS issued its memo, the Supreme Court handed down a landmark ruling lifting restraints on how much money wealthy donors such as the Mercers may spend to influence election outcomes. \n \n RenTech soon tripled its lobbying expenditures. Last year, it paid $300,000 to a Washington lobbyist and tax strategist, James Miller, a former high-ranking attorney in the IRS’s office of chief counsel. Miller’s public disclosures say his lobbying topics included taxes on derivatives. \n \n And by 2014 the Mercer Family Foundation had distributed $70 million in donations, mainly to conservative nonprofit groups. \n \n By 2016, Renaissance’s founder and chairman, Jim Simons, was one of the Democratic Party’s top backers, and Mercer was a leading Republican donor, making RenTech a leading player in national politics. \n \n Some of Mercer’s projects sought to unseat his Republican adversaries, such as McCain, who became the target of negative ad campaigns during a primary race. \n \n Meanwhile, Rebekah Mercer accumulated so much clout she has been credited with influencing Trump’s choices of several top appointees, including Bannon, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, presidential counselor Kellyanne Conway and former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general, resigned in February after revelations that he had misled the White House about post-election discussions with Russia’s ambassador. \n \n In January, Rebekah Mercer attended a private meeting in which she had “substantative communications” with Jay Clayton, Trump’s likely nominee to chair the SEC, Clayton later revealed in response to questions from the Senate Banking Committee in advance of his confirmation hearings. The SEC regulates hedge funds. \n \n The Mercers’ struggle didn’t end with Trump’s election. \n \n Bannon, the former Mercer political strategist who now speaks for the White House, seemed to capsulize it in a speech to conservative activists in February. \n \n The goal, he said, amounts to nothing less than unfettered American capitalism and the “deconstruction of the administrative state.”', 'Last month, when President Donald Trump toured a Boeing aircraft plant in North Charleston, South Carolina, he saw a familiar face in the crowd that greeted him: Patrick Caddell, a former Democratic political operative and pollster who, for forty-five years, has been prodding insurgent Presidential candidates to attack the Washington establishment. Caddell, who lives in Charleston, is perhaps best known for helping Jimmy Carter win the 1976 Presidential race. He is also remembered for having collaborated with his friend Warren Beatty on the 1998 satire “Bulworth.” In that film, a kamikaze candidate abandons the usual talking points and excoriates both the major political parties and the media; voters love his unconventionality, and he becomes improbably popular. If the plot sounds familiar, there’s a reason: in recent years, Caddell has offered political advice to Trump. He has not worked directly for the President, but at least as far back as 2013 he has been a contractor for one of Trump’s biggest financial backers: Robert Mercer, a reclusive Long Island hedge-fund manager, who has become a major force behind the Trump Presidency. During the past decade, Mercer, who is seventy, has funded an array of political projects that helped pave the way for Trump’s rise. Among these efforts was public-opinion research, conducted by Caddell, showing that political conditions in America were increasingly ripe for an outsider candidate to take the White House. Caddell told me that Mercer “is a libertarian—he despises the Republican establishment,” and added, “He thinks that the leaders are corrupt crooks, and that they’ve ruined the country.” Trump greeted Caddell warmly in North Charleston, and after giving a speech he conferred privately with him, in an area reserved for V.I.P.s and for White House officials, including Stephen Bannon, the President’s top strategist, and Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law. Caddell is well known to this inner circle. He first met Trump in the eighties. (“People said he was just a clown,” Caddell said. “But I’ve learned that you should always pay attention to successful ‘clowns.’ ”) Caddell shared the research he did for Mercer with Trump and others in the campaign, including Bannon, with whom he has partnered on numerous projects. The White House declined to divulge what Trump and Caddell discussed in North Charleston, as did Caddell. But that afternoon Trump issued perhaps the most incendiary statement of his Presidency: a tweet calling the news media “the enemy of the American people.” The proclamation alarmed liberals and conservatives alike. William McRaven, the retired Navy admiral who commanded the 2011 raid that killed Osama bin Laden, called Trump’s statement a “threat to democracy.” The President is known for tweeting impulsively, but in this case his words weren’t spontaneous: they clearly echoed the thinking of Caddell, Bannon, and Mercer. In 2012, Caddell gave a speech at a conference sponsored by Accuracy in Media, a conservative watchdog group, in which he called the media “the enemy of the American people.” That declaration was promoted by Breitbart News, a platform for the pro-Trump alt-right, of which Bannon was the executive chairman, before joining the Trump Administration. One of the main stakeholders in Breitbart News is Mercer. Mercer is the co-C.E.O. of Renaissance Technologies, which is among the most profitable hedge funds in the country. A brilliant computer scientist, he helped transform the financial industry through the innovative use of trading algorithms. But he has never given an interview explaining his political views. Although Mercer has recently become an object of media speculation, Trevor Potter, the president of the Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan watchdog group, who formerly served as the chairman of the Federal Election Commission, said, “I have no idea what his political views are—they’re unknown, not just to the public but also to most people who’ve been active in politics for the past thirty years.” Potter, a Republican, sees Mercer as emblematic of a major shift in American politics that has occurred since 2010, when the Supreme Court made a controversial ruling in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission. That ruling, and several subsequent ones, removed virtually all limits on how much money corporations and nonprofit groups can spend on federal elections, and how much individuals can give to political-action committees. Since then, power has tilted away from the two main political parties and toward a tiny group of rich mega-donors. Private money has long played a big role in American elections. When there were limits on how much a single donor could give, however, it was much harder for an individual to have a decisive impact. Now, Potter said, “a single billionaire can write an eight-figure check and put not just their thumb but their whole hand on the scale—and we often have no idea who they are.” He continued, “Suddenly, a random billionaire can change politics and public policy—to sweep everything else off the table—even if they don’t speak publicly, and even if there’s almost no public awareness of his or her views.” Through a spokesman, Mercer declined to discuss his role in launching Trump. People who know him say that he is painfully awkward socially, and rarely speaks. “He can barely look you in the eye when he talks,” an acquaintance said. “It’s probably helpful to be highly introverted when getting lost in code, but in politics you have to talk to people, in order to find out how the real world works.” In 2010, when the Wall Street Journal wrote about Mercer assuming a top role at Renaissance, he issued a terse statement: “I’m happy going through my life without saying anything to anybody.” According to the paper, he once told a colleague that he preferred the company of cats to humans. Several people who have worked with Mercer believe that, despite his oddities, he has had surprising success in aligning the Republican Party, and consequently America, with his personal beliefs, and is now uniquely positioned to exert influence over the Trump Administration. In February, David Magerman, a senior employee at Renaissance, spoke out about what he regards as Mercer’s worrisome influence. Magerman, a Democrat who is a strong supporter of Jewish causes, took particular issue with Mercer’s empowerment of the alt-right, which has included anti-Semitic and white-supremacist voices. Magerman shared his concerns with Mercer, and the conversation escalated into an argument. Magerman told colleagues about it, and, according to an account in the Wall Street Journal, Mercer called Magerman and said, “I hear you’re going around saying I’m a white supremacist. That’s ridiculous.” Magerman insisted to Mercer that he hadn’t used those words, but added, “If what you’re doing is harming the country, then you have to stop.” After the Journal story appeared, Magerman, who has worked at Renaissance for twenty years, was suspended for thirty days. Undaunted, he published an op-ed in the Philadelphia Inquirer, accusing Mercer of “effectively buying shares in the candidate.” He warned, “Robert Mercer now owns a sizeable share of the United States Presidency.” Nick Patterson, a former senior Renaissance employee who is now a computational biologist at the Broad Institute, agrees that Mercer’s influence has been huge. “Bob has used his money very effectively,” he said. “He’s not the first person in history to use money in politics, but in my view Trump wouldn’t be President if not for Bob. It doesn’t get much more effective than that.” Patterson said that his relationship with Mercer has always been collegial. In 1993, Patterson, at that time a Renaissance executive, recruited Mercer from I.B.M., and they worked together for the next eight years. But Patterson doesn’t share Mercer’s libertarian views, or what he regards as his susceptibility to conspiracy theories about Bill and Hillary Clinton. During Bill Clinton’s Presidency, Patterson recalled, Mercer insisted at a staff luncheon that Clinton had participated in a secret drug-running scheme with the C.I.A. The plot supposedly operated out of an airport in Mena, Arkansas. “Bob told me he believed that the Clintons were involved in murders connected to it,” Patterson said. Two other sources told me that, in recent years, they had heard Mercer claim that the Clintons have had opponents murdered. The Mena story is one of several dark fantasies put forth in the nineties by The American Spectator, an archconservative magazine. According to Patterson, Mercer read the publication at the time. David Brock, a former Spectator writer who is now a liberal activist, told me that the alleged Mena conspiracy was based on a single dubious source, and was easily disproved by flight records. “It’s extremely telling that Mercer would believe that,” Brock said. “It says something about his conspiratorial frame of mind, and the fringe circle he was in. We at the Spectator called them Clinton Crazies.” Patterson also recalled Mercer arguing that, during the Gulf War, the U.S. should simply have taken Iraq’s oil, “since it was there.” Trump, too, has said that the U.S. should have “kept the oil.” Expropriating another country’s natural resources is a violation of international law. Another onetime senior employee at Renaissance recalls hearing Mercer downplay the dangers posed by nuclear war. Mercer, speaking of the atomic bombs that the U.S. dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, argued that, outside of the immediate blast zones, the radiation actually made Japanese citizens healthier. The National Academy of Sciences has found no evidence to support this notion. Nevertheless, according to the onetime employee, Mercer, who is a proponent of nuclear power, “was very excited about the idea, and felt that it meant nuclear accidents weren’t such a big deal.” Mercer strongly supported the nomination of Jeff Sessions to be Trump’s Attorney General. Many civil-rights groups opposed the nomination, pointing out that Sessions has in the past expressed racist views. Mercer, for his part, has argued that the Civil Rights Act, in 1964, was a major mistake. According to the onetime Renaissance employee, Mercer has asserted repeatedly that African-Americans were better off economically before the civil-rights movement. (Few scholars agree.) He has also said that the problem of racism in America is exaggerated. The source said that, not long ago, he heard Mercer proclaim that there are no white racists in America today, only black racists. (Mercer, meanwhile, has supported a super PAC, Black Americans for a Better Future, whose goal is to “get more Blacks involved in the Republican Party.”) “Most people at Renaissance didn’t challenge him” about politics, Patterson said. But Patterson clashed with him over climate change; Mercer said that concerns about it were overblown. After Patterson shared with him a scientific paper on the subject, Mercer and his brother, Randall, who also worked at the hedge fund, sent him a paper by a scientist named Arthur Robinson, who is a biochemist, not a climate expert. “It looked like a scientific paper, but it was completely loaded with selective and biased information,” Patterson recalled. The paper argued that, if climate change were real, future generations would “enjoy an Earth with far more plant and animal life.” Robinson owns a sheep ranch in Cave Junction, Oregon, and on the property he runs a laboratory that he calls the Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine. Mercer helps subsidize Robinson’s various projects, which include an effort to forestall aging. Patterson sent Mercer a note calling Robinson’s arguments “completely false.” He never heard back. “I think if you studied Bob’s views of what the ideal state would look like, you’d find that, basically, he wants a system where the state just gets out of the way,” Patterson said. “Climate change poses a problem for that world view, because markets can’t solve it on their own.” Magerman told the Wall Street Journal that Mercer’s political opinions “show contempt for the social safety net that he doesn’t need, but many Americans do.” He also said that Mercer wants the U.S. government to be “shrunk down to the size of a pinhead.” Several former colleagues of Mercer’s said that his views are akin to Objectivism, the philosophy of Ayn Rand. Magerman told me, “Bob believes that human beings have no inherent value other than how much money they make. A cat has value, he’s said, because it provides pleasure to humans. But if someone is on welfare they have negative value. If he earns a thousand times more than a schoolteacher, then he’s a thousand times more valuable.” Magerman added, “He thinks society is upside down—that government helps the weak people get strong, and makes the strong people weak by taking their money away, through taxes.” He said that this mind-set was typical of “instant billionaires” in finance, who “have no stake in society,” unlike the industrialists of the past, who “built real things.” Another former high-level Renaissance employee said, “Bob thinks the less government the better. He’s happy if people don’t trust the government. And if the President’s a bozo? He’s fine with that. He wants it to all fall down.” The 2016 Presidential election posed a challenge for someone with Mercer’s ideology. Multiple sources described him as animated mainly by hatred of Hillary Clinton. But Mercer also distrusted the Republican leadership. After the candidate he initially supported, Senator Ted Cruz, of Texas, dropped out of the race, Mercer sought a disruptive figure who could upend both the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. Patterson told me that Mercer seems to have applied “a very Renaissance Technologies way of thinking” to politics: “He probably estimated the probability of Trump winning, and when it wasn’t very high he said to himself, ‘O.K., what has to happen in order for this twenty-per-cent thing to occur?’ It’s like playing a card game when you haven’t got a very good hand.” Mercer, as it happens, is a superb poker player, and his political gamble appears to have paid off. Institutional Investor has called it “Robert Mercer’s Trade of the Century.” \n \n In the 2016 campaign, Mercer gave $22.5 million in disclosed donations to Republican candidates and to political-action committees. Tony Fabrizio, a Republican pollster who worked for the Trump campaign, said that Mercer had “catapulted to the top of the heap of right-of-center power brokers.” It’s worth noting that several other wealthy financiers, including Democrats such as Thomas Steyer and Donald Sussman, gave even more money to campaigns. (One of the top Democratic donors was James Simons, the retired founder of Renaissance Technologies.) Nevertheless, Mercer’s political efforts stand apart. Adopting the strategy of Charles and David Koch, the billionaire libertarians, Mercer enlarged his impact exponentially by combining short-term campaign spending with long-term ideological investments. He poured millions of dollars into Breitbart News, and—in what David Magerman has called “an extreme example of modern entrepreneurial philanthropy”—made donations to dozens of politically tinged organizations. Like many wealthy families, the Mercers have a private foundation. At first, the Mercer Family Foundation, which was established in 2004, had an endowment of only half a million dollars, and most of its grants went to medical research and conventional charities. But by 2008, under the supervision of Mercer’s ardently conservative daughter, Rebekah, the foundation began giving millions of dollars to interconnected nonprofit groups, several of which played crucial roles in propagating attacks on Hillary Clinton. By 2015, the most recent year for which federal tax records are available, the foundation had grown into a $24.5-million operation that gave large sums to ultraconservative organizations. On top of this nonprofit spending, Mercer invested in private businesses. He put ten million dollars into Breitbart News, which was conceived as a conservative counterweight to the Huffington Post. The Web site freely mixes right-wing political commentary with juvenile rants and racist innuendo; under Bannon’s direction, the editors introduced a rubric called Black Crime. The site played a key role in undermining Hillary Clinton; by tracking which negative stories about her got the most clicks and “likes,” the editors helped identify which story lines and phrases were the most potent weapons against her. Breitbart News has been a remarkable success: according to ComScore, a company that measures online traffic, the site attracted 19.2 million unique visitors in October. Mercer also invested some five million dollars in Cambridge Analytica, a firm that mines online data to reach and influence potential voters. The company has said that it uses secret psychological methods to pinpoint which messages are the most persuasive to individual online viewers. The firm, which is the American affiliate of Strategic Communication Laboratories, in London, has worked for candidates whom Mercer has backed, including Trump. It also reportedly worked on the Brexit campaign, in the United Kingdom. Alexander Nix, the C.E.O. of the firm, says that it has created “profiles”—consisting of several thousand data points—for two hundred and twenty million Americans. In promotional materials, S.C.L. has claimed to know how to use such data to wage both psychological and political warfare. “Persuading somebody to vote a certain way,” Nix has said publicly, “is really very similar to persuading 14- to 25-year-old boys in Indonesia to not join Al Qaeda.” Some critics suggest that, at this point, Cambridge Analytica’s self-promotion exceeds its effectiveness. But Jonathan Albright, an assistant professor of communications at Elon University, in North Carolina, recently published a paper, on Medium, calling Cambridge Analytica a “propaganda machine.” As important as Mercer’s business investments is his hiring of advisers. Years before he started supporting Trump, he began funding several conservative activists, including Steve Bannon; as far back as 2012, Bannon was the Mercers’ de-facto political adviser. Some people who have observed the Mercers’ political evolution worry that Bannon has become a Svengali to the whole family, exploiting its political inexperience and tapping its fortune to further his own ambitions. It was Bannon who urged the Mercers to invest in a data-analytics firm. He also encouraged the investment in Breitbart News, which was made through Gravitas Maximus, L.L.C., a front group that once had the same Long Island address as Renaissance Technologies. In an interview, Bannon praised the Mercers’ strategic approach: “The Mercers laid the groundwork for the Trump revolution. Irrefutably, when you look at donors during the past four years, they have had the single biggest impact of anybody, including the Kochs.” Last summer, Bannon and some other activists whom the Mercers have supported—including David Bossie, who initiated the Citizens United lawsuit—came together to rescue Trump’s wobbly campaign. Sam Nunberg, an early Trump adviser who watched Mercer’s group take over, said, “Mercer was smart. He invested in the right people.” Bannon and Rebekah Mercer have become particularly close political partners. Last month, when Bannon denounced “the corporatist, globalist media” at the Conservative Political Action Conference, in his first public appearance since entering the White House, Rebekah Mercer was part of his entourage. Bannon supports some initiatives, such as a major infrastructure program, that are anathema to libertarians such as Robert Mercer. But the Wall Street Journal has described Bannon joking and swearing on the deck of the Mercers’ yacht, the Sea Owl, as if he were a member of the family. Bannon assured me that the Mercers, despite all their luxuries, are “the most middle-class people you will ever meet.” Robert and Diana Mercer brought up their three daughters in a modest home near I.B.M.’s Thomas J. Watson Research Center, in Westchester County. The girls attended public schools, and Robert and Diana worried about paying three college tuitions. According to Donna D’Andraia, a family friend, Diana was a PTA member and a “tiger mom” who “made sure that the girls did all the right things—they were in the honor society, and stayed out of trouble.” D’Andraia recalled Diana saying that Robert was brilliant, but D’Andraia found it hard to tell, because “he was very quiet—he didn’t talk to anybody.” The eldest Mercer daughter, Jennifer, or Jenji, attended Stanford. Rebekah, the middle daughter, enrolled at Cornell and then transferred to Stanford. Majoring in biology and math, she graduated in 1996; a few years later, she got an M.A., in operations research. The youngest daughter, Heather Sue, “was the spitfire,” D’Andraia recalled. When Heather Sue was a junior in high school, she tried out to be a place kicker on the football team. She made it, and, after enrolling at Duke University, she joined its varsity squad. When the Duke coach refused to treat her as the equal of her male teammates, she sued the school for gender discrimination, and won two million dollars in damages. Ron Santavicca, Heather Sue’s high-school coach, described the Mercers, who still invite him to their Christmas parties, as “the salt of the earth.” He added, “The whole family is very determined. When they have a mission, they go after it.” In 1993, when Nick Patterson mailed Robert Mercer a job offer from Renaissance, Mercer threw it in the trash: he’d never heard of the hedge fund. At the time, Mercer was part of a team pioneering the use of computers to translate languages. I.B.M. considered the project a bit of a luxury, and didn’t see its potential, though the work laid the foundation for Google Translate and Apple’s Siri. But Mercer and his main partner, Peter Brown, found the project exciting, and had the satisfaction of showing up experts in the field, who had dismissed their statistical approach to translating languages as impractical. Instead of trying to teach a computer linguistic rules, Mercer and Brown downloaded enormous quantities of dual-language documents—including Canadian parliamentary records—and created code that analyzed the data and detected patterns, enabling predictions of probable translations. According to a former I.B.M. colleague, Mercer was obsessive, and at one point took six months off to type into a computer every entry in a Spanish-English dictionary. Sebastian Mallaby, in his 2010 book on the hedge-fund industry, “More Money Than God,” reports that Mercer’s boss at I.B.M. once jokingly called him an “automaton.” In 2014, Mercer accepted a lifetime-achievement award from the Association for Computational Linguistics. In a speech at the ceremony, Mercer, who grew up in New Mexico, said that he had a “jaundiced view” of government. While in college, he had worked on a military base in Albuquerque, and he had showed his superiors how to run certain computer programs a hundred times faster; instead of saving time and money, the bureaucrats ran a hundred times more equations. He concluded that the goal of government officials was “not so much to get answers as to consume the computer budget.” Mercer’s colleagues say that he views the government as arrogant and inefficient, and believes that individuals need to be self-sufficient, and should not receive aid from the state. Yet, when I.B.M. failed to offer adequate support for Mercer and Brown’s translation project, they secured additional funding from DARPA, the secretive Pentagon program. Despite Mercer’s disdain for “big government,” this funding was essential to his early success. Meanwhile, Patterson kept asking Mercer and Brown to join Renaissance. He thought that their technique of extracting patterns from huge amounts of data could be applied to the pile of numbers generated daily by the global trade in stocks, bonds, commodities, and currencies. The patterns could generate predictive financial models that would give traders a decisive edge. In the spring of 1993, Mercer experienced two devastating losses: his mother was killed, in a car crash, and his father, a biologist, died six weeks later. With life’s precariousness made painfully clear, and with tuition bills mounting, he decided to leave I.B.M. for a higher-paying job at Renaissance. Brown made the leap, too. Renaissance was founded by James Simons, a legendary mathematician, in 1982. Simons had run the math department at Stony Brook University, on Long Island, and the hedge fund took a uniquely academic approach to high finance. Andrew Lo, a finance professor at M.I.T.’s Sloan School of Management, has described it as “the commercial version of the Manhattan Project.” Intensely secretive and filled with people with Ph.D.s, it has been sensationally profitable. Its Medallion Fund, which is open only to the firm’s three hundred or so employees, has averaged returns of almost eighty per cent a year, before fees. Bloomberg News has called the Medallion Fund “perhaps the world’s greatest moneymaking machine.” In “More Money Than God,” Mallaby, who interviewed Mercer, describes his temperament as that of an “icy cold poker player”; Mercer told him that he could not recall ever having had a nightmare. But Mercer warms up when talking about computers. In the 2014 speech, he recalled the first time he used one, at a science camp, and likened the experience to falling in love. He also spoke of the government lab in New Mexico. “I loved the solitude of the computer lab late at night,” he said. “I loved the air-conditioned smell of the place. I loved the sound of the disks whirring and the printers clacking.” The speech lasted forty minutes—“more than I typically talk in a month,” he noted. Patterson told me that when Mercer arrived at Renaissance the firm’s equities division was lagging behind other areas, such as futures trading. Mercer and Brown applied their algorithms to equities trading. “It took several years,” Patterson recalled, but the equities group eventually accounted for the largest share of the Medallion Fund’s profits. Mercer and Brown’s code took into account nearly every conceivable predictor of market swings; their secret formula became so valuable that, when a pair of Russian mathematicians at the firm tried to take the recipe elsewhere, the company initiated legal action against them. Renaissance’s profits were further enhanced by a controversial tax maneuver, which became the subject of a 2014 Senate inquiry. According to Senate investigators, Renaissance had presented countless short-term trades as long-term ones, improperly avoiding some $6.8 billion in taxes. The Senate didn’t allege criminality, but it concluded that Renaissance had committed “abuses.” The I.R.S. demanded payment. (Renaissance defended its practices, and the matter remains contested, leaving a very sensitive material issue pending before the Trump Administration.) The Medallion Fund made Renaissance employees among the wealthiest people in the country. Forbes estimates that Simons, who has the biggest share, is worth eighteen billion dollars. In 2009, Simons stepped aside, to focus on philanthropy, and named Mercer and Brown co-C.E.O.s. Institutional Investor’s Alpha estimates that, in 2015, Mercer earned a hundred and thirty-five million dollars at Renaissance. \n \n Mercer’s fortune has allowed him and his family to indulge their wildest material fantasies. He and Diana moved into a waterfront estate in Head of the Harbor, a seaside community on Long Island, and called the property Owl’s Nest. Mercer, a gun enthusiast, built a private pistol range there. (He is also a part owner of Centre Firearms, a company that claims to have the country’s largest private cache of machine guns, as well as a weapon that Arnold Schwarzenegger wielded in “The Terminator.”) At Owl’s Nest, Mercer has installed a $2.7-million model-train set in his basement; trains chug through a miniature landscape half the size of a basketball court. The toy train attracted unwanted tabloid headlines, such as “Boo-hoo over 2m Choo-choo,” after Mercer sued the manufacturer for overcharging him. (The case was settled.) Mercer retains a domestic staff that includes a butler and a physician; both accompany him whenever he travels. But this, too, has sparked bad publicity. In 2013, three members of the household staff sued to recover back wages, claiming that Mercer had failed to pay overtime, as promised, and that he had deducted pay as punishment for poor work. One infraction that Mercer cited as a “demerit” was a failure to replace shampoo bottles that were two-thirds empty. This suit, too, was settled. Mercer has bought several spectacular yachts, including the Sea Owl, which is two hundred and three feet long. A 2013 photo shows the gates of the Tower Bridge, in London, raised high to allow it to proceed up the Thames. The Sea Owl has a crew of eighteen, and features a hand-carved “tree” that twists through four levels of decks. Designed, in part, as a place where the extended Mercer family can gather, the yacht has many fanciful and didactic touches for the Mercer grandchildren, such as frescoes that allude to the discoveries of Darwin and Newton. There’s a self-playing Steinway, a spa pool, and an elevator. Mercer has given major credit to his family for the yacht’s special details, telling Boat International that they are “endowed with both exceptionally good taste and exceptionally strong opinions.” The Mercer daughters are indeed forceful. When a Manhattan bakery that the sisters loved, Ruby et Violette, threatened to close, depriving the Mercers of their favorite cookies, they bought it. In a Fox News interview, Heather Sue recalled telling the others, “We are going to buy a bakery!” The Mercers still own the business, although it is now online-only. After graduating from Duke, Heather Sue began competing in high-stakes poker tournaments; she is admired on the circuit for her cool manner. When Mercer insisted that Heather Sue take a security guard with her, Santavicca said, “they became friends, then they became whatever, and now they’re married, with two beautiful daughters.” Jenji has a law degree from Georgetown, but she has pursued an interest in horses instead. In 2008, the Mercers bought a horse farm in Wellington, Florida, for $5.9 million. Jenji and Diana regularly attend the Winter Equestrian Festival, in Palm Beach. They are investors in an equestrian center in North Carolina, and have announced plans to open one in Colorado. Diana is also listed as the owner of Equinimity, a horse stable in Florida. According to the stable’s Web site, it specializes in Equine Facilitated Learning, a system that teaches “non-verbal leadership and interpersonal communication skills through non-predatory horse-inspired wisdom.” Rebekah worked for a few years at Renaissance after graduating from Stanford. A former colleague recalls her as smart but haughty. In 2003, she married a Frenchman, Sylvain Mirochnikoff, who is a managing director of Morgan Stanley. They had four children and bought a twenty-eight-million-dollar property—six apartments joined together—at Trump Place, on the Upper West Side. Now forty-three, she is divorcing Mirochnikoff. She homeschools the children, but in recent years she has become consumed by politics. “She is the First Lady of the alt-right,” Christopher Ruddy, the owner of the conservative outlet Newsmax Media, said. “She’s respected in conservative circles, and clearly Trump has embraced her in a big way.” Amity Shlaes, the conservative writer and the chair of the Calvin Coolidge Presidential Foundation, where Rebekah Mercer is a trustee, told me, “In the dull crowds of policy, the Mercers are enchanting firecrackers.” She likened the Mercer sisters to the Schuylers—the high-spirited, witty sisters made famous by the musical “Hamilton.” Shlaes went on, “The Mercers have strong values, they’re kind of funny, and they’re really bright. Their brains are almost too strong.” Rebekah, she noted, supports several think tanks, but grows tired of talk; she “is into action.” \n \n After the Citizens United decision, in 2010, the Mercers were among the first people to take advantage of the opportunity to spend more money on politics. In Oregon, they quietly gave money to a super PAC—an independent campaign-related group that could now take unlimited donations. In New York, reporters discovered that Robert Mercer was the sole donor behind a million-dollar advertising campaign attacking what it described as a plan to build a “Ground Zero Mosque” in Manhattan. The proposed building was neither a mosque nor at Ground Zero. The ads, which were meant to boost a Conservative Party candidate for governor, were condemned as Islamophobic. “I love a hearty soup.” In Oregon, the Mercers gave six hundred and forty thousand dollars to a group that attacked Representative Peter DeFazio, a Democrat, with a barrage of negative ads during the final weeks of his 2010 reëlection campaign. This effort also failed—it didn’t help when DeFazio announced that a New York hedge-fund manager and his daughter were meddling in Oregon politics. Press accounts speculated that Robert Mercer may have targeted DeFazio because DeFazio had proposed a tax on a type of high-volume stock trade that Renaissance frequently made. But several associates of Mercer’s say that the truth is stranger. DeFazio’s Republican opponent was Arthur Robinson—the biochemist, sheep rancher, and climate-change denialist. The Mercers became his devoted supporters after reading Access to Energy, an offbeat scientific newsletter that he writes. The family has given at least $1.6 million in donations to Robinson’s Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine. Some of the money was used to buy freezers in which Robinson is storing some fourteen thousand samples of human urine. Robinson has said that, by studying the urine, he will find new ways of extending the human life span. Robinson holds a degree in chemistry from Caltech, but his work is not respected in most scientific circles. (The Oregon senator Jeff Merkley, a Democrat, has called Robinson an “extremist kook.”) Robinson appears to be the source of Robert Mercer’s sanguine view of nuclear radiation: in 1986, Robinson co-authored a book suggesting that the vast majority of Americans would survive “an all-out atomic attack on the United States.” Robinson’s institute dismisses climate change as a “false religion.” A petition that he organized in 1998 to oppose the Kyoto Protocol, claiming to represent thirty thousand scientists skeptical of global warming, has been criticized as deceptive. The National Academy of Sciences has warned that the petition never appeared in a peer-reviewed journal, though it is printed in “a format that is nearly identical to that of scientific articles.” The petition, however, still circulates online: in the past year, it was the most shared item about climate change on Facebook. Robinson, who calls himself a “Jesus-plus-nothing-else” Christian, has become a hero to the religious right for homeschooling his six children. Robert and Rebekah Mercer have praised a curriculum that Robinson sells. (An advertisement for it casts doubt on evolution: “No demonstration has ever been made of the process of ‘spontaneous origin of life.’ ”) Robinson has said that the “socialist” agenda of public schools is “evil” and represents “a form of child abuse.” \n \n Even though 2010 was a successful election year for Republicans, the candidates that the Mercers had supported in Oregon and New York both lost decisively. Their investments had achieved nothing. Wealthy political donors sometimes make easy marks for campaign operatives. Patrick Caddell, the former pollster, told me, “These people who get so rich by running businesses get so taken in when it comes to politics. They’re just sheep. The consultants suck it out of them. A lot of them are surrounded by palace guards, but that’s not true of the Mercers.” By 2011, the Mercers had joined forces with Charles and David Koch, who own Koch Industries, and who have run a powerful political machine for decades. The Mercers attended the Kochs’ semiannual seminars, which provide a structure for right-wing millionaires looking for effective ways to channel their cash. The Mercers admired the savviness of the Kochs’ plan, which called for attendees to pool their contributions in a fund run by Koch operatives. The fund would strategically deploy the money in races across the country, although, at the time, the Kochs’ chief aim was to defeat Barack Obama in 2012. The Kochs will not reveal the identities of their donors, or the size of contributions, but the Mercers reportedly began giving at least a million dollars a year to the Kochs’ fund. Eventually, they contributed more than twenty-five million. The Mercers also joined the Council for National Policy, which the Times has described as a “little-known club of a few hundred of the most powerful conservatives in the country.” The Mercers have contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars. The group swears participants to secrecy. But a leaked 2014 roster revealed that it included many people who promoted anti-Clinton conspiracy stories, including Joseph Farah, the editor of WorldNetDaily. The group also brought the Mercers into the orbit of two people who have become key figures in the Trump White House: Kellyanne Conway, who was on the group’s executive committee, and Steve Bannon. In 2011, the Mercers met Andrew Breitbart, the founder of the fiery news outlet that bears his name, at a conference organized by the Club for Growth, a conservative group. They were so impressed by him that they became interested in investing in his operation. Breitbart, a gleefully offensive provocateur, was the temperamental opposite of Robert Mercer. (In 2010, Breitbart told this magazine, “I like to call someone a raving cunt every now and then, when it’s appropriate, for effect.”) Nevertheless, the Mercers were attracted to Breitbart’s vision of “taking back the culture” by building a media enterprise that could wage information warfare against the mainstream press, empowering what Breitbart called “the silenced majority.” Breitbart soon introduced the Mercers to Steve Bannon. For a while, Breitbart News operated out of office space that Bannon owned in Santa Monica. A Harvard Business School graduate, Bannon had worked at Goldman Sachs, but he eventually left the world of finance and began making political films. His ambition, apparently, was to become the Michael Moore of the right. In the aughts, he directed polemical documentaries, among them “Fire from the Heartland” and “District of Corruption.” A former associate of Bannon’s in California recalls him as a strategic thinker who was adept at manipulating the media. A voracious reader, he was quick and charming, but, according to the former associate, he had a chip on his shoulder about class. He often spoke of having grown up in a blue-collar Irish Catholic family in Richmond, Virginia, and of having served as a naval officer when he was young. Bannon seemed to feel excluded from the social world of Wall Street peers who had attended prep schools. He had left Goldman Sachs, in 1990, without making partner, and, though he was well off, he had missed out on the gigantic profits that partners had made when the company went public, in 1999. In 2011, Bannon drafted a business plan for the Mercers that called for them to invest ten million dollars in Breitbart News, in exchange for a large stake. At the time, the Breitbart site was little more than a collection of blogs. The Mercers signed the deal that June, and one of its provisions placed Bannon on the company’s board. Nine months later, Andrew Breitbart died, at forty-three, of a heart attack, and Bannon became the site’s executive chairman, overseeing its content. The Mercers, meanwhile, became Bannon’s principal patrons. The Washington Post recently published a house-rental lease that Bannon signed in 2013, on which he said that his salary at Breitbart News was seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Under Bannon’s leadership, the Web site expanded dramatically, adding a fleet of full-time writers. It became a new force on the right, boosting extreme insurgents against the G.O.P. establishment, such as David Brat, who, in 2014, took the seat of Eric Cantor, the Virginia congressman. But it also provided a public forum for previously shunned white-nationalist, sexist, and racist voices. One pundit hired by Bannon was Milo Yiannopoulos, who specialized in puerile insults. (He recently resigned from the site, after a video of him lewdly defending pederasty went viral.) In 2014, Bannon began hosting a radio show that often featured Patrick Caddell, who effectively had been banished by Democratic Party leaders after years of tempestuous campaigns and fallings-out. On the air, Caddell floated dark theories about Hillary Clinton, and often sounded a lot like Bannon, describing “economic nationalism” as the driving force in American politics. Under Barack Obama, he said, America had turned into a “banana republic.” “Now that we’ve fallen in love, I have a confession. I’m not a giraffe—I’m fifty-eight weasels in a trenchcoat.” By 2016, Breitbart News claims, it had the most shared political content on Facebook, giving the Mercers a platform that no other conservative donors could match. Rebekah Mercer is highly engaged with Breitbart’s content. An insider there said, “She reads every story, and calls when there are grammatical errors or typos.” Though she doesn’t dictate a political line to the editors, she often points out areas of coverage that she thinks require more attention. Her views about the Washington establishment, including the Republican leadership, are scathing. “She was at the avant-garde of shuttering both political parties,” the insider at Breitbart said. “She went a long way toward the redefinition of American politics.” The Mercers’ investment in Breitbart enabled Bannon to promote anti-establishment politicians whom the mainstream media dismissed, including Trump. In 2011, David Bossie, the head of the conservative group Citizens United, introduced Trump to Bannon; at the time, Trump was thinking about running against Obama. Bannon and Trump met at Trump Tower and discussed a possible campaign. Trump decided against the idea, but the two kept in touch, and Bannon gave Trump admiring coverage. Bannon noticed that, when Trump spoke to crowds, people were electrified. Bannon began to think that Trump might be “the one” who could shake up American politics. “Breitbart gave Trump a big role,” Sam Nunberg, the aide who worked on the early stages of Trump’s campaign, has said. “They gave us an outlet. No one else would. It allowed us to define our narrative and communicate our message. It really started with the birther thing”—Trump’s false claim that Obama was not born an American citizen—“and then immigration, and Iran. Trump was developing his message.” By 2013, Nunberg said, Trump, like others on Breitbart, was “hitting the establishment” by slamming the Republican leadership in Congress, including Paul Ryan. Nunberg added, “It wasn’t like Charlie Rose was asking us on.” \n \n The Mercer Family Foundation kept expanding its political investments. Between 2011 and 2014, it gave nearly eleven million dollars to the Media Research Center, an advocacy group whose “sole mission,” according to its Web site, “is to expose and neutralize the propaganda arm of the Left: the national news media.” The group’s founder, L. Brent Bozell III, is best known for his successful campaign to get CBS sanctioned for showing Janet Jackson’s bared breast during the 2004 Super Bowl broadcast. The Mercers have been among the M.R.C.’s biggest donors, and their money has allowed the group to revamp its news site, and it now claims to reach more than two hundred million Americans a week. In 2012, the Mercer Family Foundation donated two million dollars to Citizens United, which had trafficked in Clinton hatred for years. During the Clinton Administration, David Bossie, the group’s leader, was a Republican congressional aide, and he was forced to resign after releasing misleading material about a Clinton associate. In 2008, Citizens United released a vitriolic film, “Hillary: The Movie.” Two years ago, after the group received an additional five hundred and fifty thousand dollars from the Mercers’ foundation, it filed a Freedom of Information Act request demanding access to Hillary Clinton’s State Department e-mails. When the e-mails were released, her Presidential campaign became mired in negative news stories. Bannon has often collaborated with Bossie, producing half a dozen films with him. In 2012, Bossie suggested a new joint project: a movie that urged Democrats and independents to abandon Obama in the Presidential election. The film’s approach was influenced by polling work that Patrick Caddell had shared with Bannon. The data suggested that attacking Obama was counterproductive; it was more effective to express “disappointment” in him, by contrasting him with earlier Presidents. Caddell and Bannon made an unholy alliance, but they had things in common: both men were Irish Catholic sons of the South, scourges to their respective parties, and prone to apocalyptic pronouncements. “We hit it off right away,” Caddell told me. “We’re both revolutionaries.” Bannon was excited by Caddell’s polling research, and he persuaded Citizens United to hire Caddell to convene focus groups of disillusioned Obama supporters. Many of these voters became the central figures of “The Hope & the Change,” an anti-Obama film that Bannon and Citizens United released during the 2012 Democratic National Convention. After Caddell saw the film, he pointed out to Bannon that its opening imitated that of “Triumph of the Will,” the 1935 ode to Hitler, made by the Nazi filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl. Bannon laughed and said, “You’re the only one that caught it!” In both films, a plane flies over a blighted land, as ominous music swells; then clouds in the sky part, auguring a new era. The disappointed voters in the film “seared into me,” Bannon said, the fact that middle-class Americans badly wanted change, and could be lured away from the Democratic Party if they felt that they had been conned. In 2012, Citizens United’s foundation paid Bannon Strategic Advisors, a consultancy group founded by Bannon, three hundred thousand dollars for what it described to the I.R.S. as “fund-raising” services. Bossie told me that the tax filing must have been made in error: the payment was actually for Bannon’s “film development” work. Charitable groups are barred from spending tax-deductible contributions on partisan politics, yet, as Breitbart News noted at the time, “The Hope & the Change” was a “partisan” film “targeting Democrats” during an election year. Even so, the Mercers took a hefty tax deduction for their two-million-dollar donation to Citizens United. Bossie told me that “the Mercers are very interested in films.” Indeed, Rebekah Mercer is on the board of the Moving Picture Institute, a conservative group devoted to countering Hollywood liberalism with original online entertainment. Among its recent projects was a cartoon, “Everyone Coughs,” which spread the rumor that Hillary Clinton was mortally ill. The film ended by depicting an animated Clinton literally coughing herself to death.', 'Apple has discovered multiple cases of child labour in its supply chain, including one Chinese company that employed 74 children under the age of 16, in the latest controversy over the technology giant\'s manufacturing methods. \n \n An internal audit found a flipside to the western consumer\'s insatiable thirst for innovative and competitively priced gadgets. It uncovered 106 cases of underage labour being used at Apple suppliers last year and 70 cases historically. The report follows a series of worker suicides over working conditions at Foxconn, the Taiwanese company that assembles must-have products such as the iPad and iPhone, and lethal explosions at other plants. \n \n Apple\'s annual supplier report – which monitors nearly 400 suppliers – found that children were employed at 11 factories involved in making its products. A number of them had been recruited using forged identity papers. \n \n The report uncovered a catalogue of other offences, ranging from mandatory pregnancy tests, to bonded workers whose wages are confiscated to pay off debts imposed by recruitment agencies. They also found cases of juveniles being used to lift heavy goods, workers having their wages docked as a punishment and one factory dumping waste oil in the toilets. \n \n One Chinese supplier, a circuit board component maker called Guangdong Real Faith Pingzhou Electronics, was axed by Apple after 74 children under the age of 16 were recruited to work on its production lines. According to Apple, the children had been knowingly supplied by one of the region\'s largest labour agencies, Shenzhen Quanshun Human Resources. Its investigators found that the agency conspired with families to forge identification documents. Apple did not disclose the ages of the children involved, but its code of conduct states it will not employ workers under the age of 15, or under the legal working age in any jurisdiction – which is 16 in China. \n \n Apple\'s chief executive, Tim Cook, who in a previous role was responsible for building Apple\'s supply chain, has been under pressure to push through changes after the suicides at Foxconn, whose manufacturing operations are largely based in China. Last September a brawl involving up to 2,000 workers forced Foxconn to close a plant in northern China. \n \n Last year he described the use of underage labour as ""abhorrent"", saying it was ""extremely rare in our supply chain"", and stepped up measures to weed out bad practice including hiring an independent auditor, the Fair Labor Association. \n \n ""Underage labour is a subject no company wants to be associated with, so as a result I don\'t believe it gets the attention it deserves, and as a result it doesn\'t get fixed like it should,"" said Jeff Williams, senior vice president of operations at Apple. He vowed to eradicate the practice, but said it could take some time. \n \n At Pingzhou, the children were returned to their families and the employer was ""required to pay expenses to facilitate their successful return"". Although 95% of the facilities scrutinised by Apple complied with child labour laws, transgressors were told to return minors to a school chosen by their family, pay for their education, and give them an income equal to their factory wages. \n \n Bonded labour was discovered at eight factories. In order to find work, some foreign labourers pay fees to a string of recruitment agencies and sub-agencies, amassing huge debts. Their wages are then automatically handed over to pay the debts, tying them to jobs until the balance has been paid off. \n \n Apple ordered its suppliers to reimburse excessive recruitment fees – anything higher than one month\'s wages – and said $6.4m (£4m) was handed back to contract workers in 2012. \n \n Investigators found 90 facilities that deducted wages to punish workers, prompting Apple to order the reimbursement of employees. Mandatory pregnancy testing was found at 34 places of work, while 25 tested for medical conditions such as hepatitis B. At four facilities, payroll records were falsified to hide information from auditors, and at one, a supplier was found intentionally dumping waste oil ""into the restroom receptacle"". \n \n Apple said it took measures to protect whistleblowers, and that it made 8,000 calls last year to workers interviewed by auditors in order to find out if they had suffered intimidation.', 'One person was killed and at least seven were injured when a runaway tractor-trailer careening down East Hill crashed into Simeon’s restaurant Friday afternoon in downtown Ithaca. By 7:45 a.m. Saturday, the truck was removed from the building and East State Street was reopened. North Aurora Street was closed and fenced off from the Commons to The Mahogany Grill. Restaurants on the east side of Aurora Street were not affected. The driver of the truck sustained superficial injuries and was being questioned at Ithaca police headquarters, police said Friday. The cause of the crash and whether speed was a factor were being investigated. Lindsey Pou, 26, a pastry chef at nearby Madeline’s Restaurant, said she was sitting outside on The Commons when she saw the tractor-trailer barreling down East State Street and smash into the building. She said the driver did not sound the horn, and she did not hear any screeching brakes. There were a number of diners sitting in the restaurant, and more Simeon’s employees were arriving for the evening shift when the accident occurred, she said. A group of construction workers renovating The Commons were standing in the truck’s path and had to leap out of the way to avoid being hit, according to Pou. “Everyone screamed. A lot of people ran to try and help, to see what they could do,” she said. “The response time for the police was really quick, which was awesome. They took hold of the situation.” Police evacuated the 100 block of North Aurora Street and the 200 block of East State-MLK Street, according to Ithaca Police Department Public Information Officer Jamie Williamson. A small fire started in the bar area of Simeon’s immediately after the collision but was extinguished. The city engineer’s office as well as an outside engineering firm were evaluating the building. After the truck collided with the restaurant, the building’s front corner collapsed, leaving a gaping hole in the apartments above Simeon’s. Ithaca Mayor Svante Myrick said the occupants of the apartments were not home at the time of the collision. \n \n (Page 2 of 3) \n \n Myrick advised people to avoid the east end of The Commons for the time being. “There is some risk of the building collapsing,” he said. “We did bring in a crane. We have our building inspectors on the scene. They are going to tell us what we need to do to the building to keep it stable. We want to save the building if we can. It’s beautiful land, it’s historic, but safety is our number one priority right now. If we feel that the building is going to collapse, we will take it down ourselves.” Late Friday evening, a crane tore a section off the four-story building’s roof. Tow trucks were on the scene to remove the car carrier. Williamson said four injured people had been transported to Cayuga Medical Center with an additional person possibly arriving on their own. A hospital spokesperson said seven injured people had been admitted. None of the injuries was considered life-threatening, they said. The names of the person killed and of the driver were not immediately released. Previous accidents Pou noted that the particular location has a history of such accidents. In September 2010, a dump truck headed down the State-Martin Luther King Street hill and hit the Community School of Music and Art building at Seneca Way. Only the driver was hurt. Authorities said he apparently lost control of the gravel-laden truck, which then rolled over and hit parked cars, then the building. The driver was pinned but extricated within 15 minutes. The building was evacuated and closed until damages were repaired and it was confirmed safe. In 2008, police suspected brake failure when a northbound car headed down South Hill on Aurora Street and hit a parked delivery truck in the 100 block of the street. The driver and four children riding with her were hospitalized. “I don’t want to say this frequently happens, but this isn’t the first time we’ve had a horrible accident of this magnitude here,” Pou said. Myrick said tractor-trailers are allowed on East State-Martin Luther King Jr. Street, given that it is a state route, and he noted that bollards are installed on The Commons to avoid such accidents, although they were not enough to withstand a large tractor-trailer towing two decks of cars.']",4,"– Two key facts about billionaire Robert Mercer: He is, in the words of a recent New Yorker profile, the ""reclusive hedge-fund tycoon behind the Trump presidency."" Second, the IRS is going after his Renaissance Technologies fund for nearly $7 billion in back taxes. All of which sets up a dicey situation for President Trump, as a story at McClatchy News Service explains. Mercer wants IRS chief John Koskinen booted from office, and he's pushing Trump to fire him before his five-year term expires in November. The president has not tipped his hand on whether he'll do that, but it makes for ""bad optics,"" per the chief ethics adviser in the George W. Bush White House. ""The guy’s got a big case in front of the IRS,"" says Richard Painter. ""He’s trying to put someone in there who’s going to drop the case. Is the president of the United States going to succumb to that?"" Mercer, whose daughter Rebekah is a major political player on the right as well, ramped up political contributions to conservative groups after the IRS began investigating his fund's use of a complicated banking method known as ""basket options"" in 2010 to cut its tax bill, reports McClatchy. The method involves converting short-term gains on trades into long-term gains, which are taxed at a lower rate. The IRS does not comment on ongoing cases, but a Senate panel accused the fund of short-changing the agency of at least $6.8 billion. The company has maintained that it did nothing illegal. One thing that could work in the Mercers' favor: They have long ties to top Trump strategist Steve Bannon. Still, a Columbia professor says that even if the Mercers succeed in getting Koskinen fired, it's doubtful that would upend a years-long IRS case."
228,"['BALTIMORE (WJZ) — A Baltimore attorney defending a man accused of rape is now out of jail after authorities say they caught him trying to bribe the victim and a witness in the case. \n \n Christos Vasiliades faces a litany of charges, including obstruction of justice and witness intimidation. \n \n “This is terrible. This is as bad as it gets. You’ve got an officer of the court, who is supposed to uphold the law, really attempting to induce a witness not to testify,” says Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh. \n \n Vasiliades’ lawyer released the following statement: \n \n “The State has the enormous burden of proving guilt beyond reasonable doubt. Unless and until the State proves each and every allegation to a near certitude, Mr. Vasiliades is innocent.” \n \n The investigation into Vasiliades began back in April, when he is accused of contacting the victim his client, Mario Aguilar-Delossantoso, is accused of raping, along with a witness in the case. \n \n During that meeting, he reportedly warned the victim and witness of the increased risk of deportation if they were to testify in court. He also offered to pay them is they didn’t show up to court and dropped the charges. \n \n Frosh says the local attorney tried to take advantage of a climate of fear in Baltimore’s immigrant population. Many who are afraid to report crimes. \n \n “We’ve heard rumblings that these kinds of actions go on, but we haven’t been able to prove it. In this case, we have a taped conversation,” Frosh says. \n \n The victim contacted police, and agreed to wear a recording device when they met up with Vasiliades again. \n \n They met with Vasiliades again on May 18, and during that meeting, he ordered everyone to keep their cell phones in the lobby, and didn’t allow them to bring phones into the office. \n \n During that meeting, authorities say they caught Vasiliades on tape offering the victim and the witness $3,000 each if they didn’t show up to testify, and if the case got “thrown out.” \n \n On the recording court documents say Vasiliades tells the victim’s husband “you know how things are with Trump’s laws now; someone goes to court, and boom, they get taken away.” \n \n Vasiliades had a plan that on the court date, the victim and witness should wait outside the courthouse, with a man who would have the cash. When the case was “thrown out” after the didn’t appear to testify, Vasiliades would give the other man a thumbs up, and he would then give them the money. \n \n He also reportedly told the victim and witness that instead of testifying, they should take the money, then “find [Aguilar-Delossantoso] and wear him out,” and “if we were back home where I’m from, from Greece… we would go **** him up, that’s it, if you want to do that, that’s fine.” \n \n The indictment shows he also said, “$3,000, and then find him and kick his ass,” and, “I did my job, I did very good, and I can go home and go to sleep, OK, and then you get something, and then you find him outside, brother, and you **** him up, that’s it.” \n \n He also reportedly reiterated the increased chance of deportation if they were to testify. \n \n “Cases like this that really take us two steps backward are such a shame,” says Elizabeth Alex of CASA of Maryland. \n \n Alex says the organization has spent years trying to eliminate fear and encourage immigrant victims to report crimes. \n \n She hopes this isn’t a setback. \n \n “There is such a big and supportive environment here in Baltimore for these victims when they do come out, but its about getting the message to them that it’s not your fault and there’s people here to help,” Casa says. \n \n Frosh says if convicted, Vasiliades is facing a lot of jail time for most of the charges and could also lose his license to practice law. \n \n Vasiliades pleaded not guilty to the charges. \n \n Follow @CBSBaltimore on Twitter and like WJZ-TV | CBS Baltimore on Facebook', 'A Baltimore defense attorney was arraigned Wednesday on charges of obstruction of justice and witness intimidation for allegedly trying to dissuade a rape victim from testifying against his client by telling her she risked deportation by the Trump administration. \n \n In a recorded conversation, Christos Vasiliades, 38, and another man charged in the case, Edgar Ivan Rodriguez, told the alleged victim\'s husband about the ""current environment for immigrants in this country"" and offered $3,000 cash if she did not show up to court, which would force prosecutors to drop the case, the indictment alleges. \n \n ""You know how things are with Trump\'s laws now; someone goes to court, and boom, they get taken away,"" Rodriguez told the victim\'s husband in the recorded conversation, according to an indictment by the Maryland attorney general\'s office. \n \n Vasiliades also offered an alternative solution: Just beat up his client. \n \n ""If we were back home where I\'m from, from Greece ... we would go (expletive) him up, that\'s it, if you want to do that, that\'s fine,"" Vasiliades was recorded saying, according to court documents. ""He\'s an (expletive), I think you should find him and kick his (expletive), personally."" \n \n Vasiliades was arrested Tuesday afternoon in the hallway of the Courthouse East building, as the trial of his client, Mario Aguilar-Delosantos, was set to start, according to the sheriff\'s office and court records. \n \n Vasiliades returned to that courthouse Wednesday afternoon — wearing a yellow jumpsuit and hands cuffed behind his back. Prosecutors agreed to release him and Rodriguez under pre-trial supervision. \n \n Rodriguez, who identified himself as Vasiliades\' interpreter, also was charged with obstruction of justice and witness intimidation, according to court records. \n \n Both pleaded not guilty. \n \n Billy Murphy, Vasiliades\' attorney, and Joseph Murtha, Rodriguez\'s attorney, left the courthouse without commenting. \n \n The charges against Aguilar-Delosantos come amid heightened concerns for immigrants as the Department of Justice steps up immigration enforcement. Arrests by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement were up 40 percent in the first 100 days of the Trump administration. \n \n ""If you\'re an immigrant, you live in a climate of fear at this point, and these folks were trying to capitalize on that,"" Attorney General Brian Frosh told The Baltimore Sun. \n \n The Baltimore state\'s attorney\'s office issued a memo to prosecutors recently, advising them to consider the ""potential consequences to the victim, witnesses, and the defendant"" in minor, nonviolent crimes. \n \n City prosecutors were handling the rape case, and asked the attorney general\'s office to get involved due to a possible conflict, Frosh said. \n \n The state\'s attorney\'s office declined to comment on the case but said it ""has and will continue to partner and combine our efforts with the attorney general\'s office, not only in protecting immigrant populations but also in the prosecution of these individuals."" \n \n Aguilar-Delosantos, of the unit block of South Broadway in Fells Point, is charged with second-degree rape, third- and fourth-degree sex offenses, and second-degree assault. The incident dates to March 25, 2016, and he has been free on $250,000 bond. \n \n As a result of his attorney\'s arrest, his trial date has been pushed back to August. \n \n The attorney general\'s office said in court papers that Rodriguez was present for and participated in the meetings in which Vasiliades attempted to dissuade the alleged victim and her husband from testifying in court. \n \n The indictment alleges Vasiliades contacted the victim\'s husband in April and said the case ""had become \'more complicated\'"" and that Vasiliades wanted to meet to discuss the case. \n \n At that meeting, the victim\'s husband said Vasiliades and Rodriguez warned of the potential risk for the couple if they testified in court. They ""explained that the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) would likely be present in the courtroom for their client … and cited new federal laws and policies and maintained there is a high risk that"" they would be deported if they testified in court, according to the indictment. \n \n Vasiliades said his client was ""very sorry and could offer compensation if they did not come to court and testify against him."" \n \n ""Vasiliades and Rodriguez indicated that the monetary compensation would help ensure that [they] would not get deported,"" the indictment says. \n \n On May 15, the victim\'s husband placed a phone call to Vasiliades at the direction of law enforcement and said he wanted to meet to discuss the offer. They agreed to meet three days later, and the victim\'s husband wore a recording device provided by law enforcement. \n \n Vasiliades made everyone place their cell phones on a desk in the lobby of the building where the meeting took place, then led them into an office, according to the indictment. Vasiliades and Rodriguez said ICE was ""looking at this case"" regarding their client, and cited recent immigration statistics. \n \n ""They\'re going to ask, \'You have your documents?\'"" Rodriguez was recorded saying, according to the indictment. \n \n Vasilades offered to give the victim $3,000, the indictment alleges. He said Rodriguez would wait outside the courthouse holding the cash. Once the case was dropped, Vasiliades said he\'d walk outside and give a thumbs up to Rodriguez, who would then deliver the cash, the indictment said. \n \n Then Vasiliades suggested assaulting his client. ""Find him and wear him out,"" he said, according to the indictment. \n \n Vasiliades has been an attorney since 2011, working for Murtha\'s firm. In one of his online biographies, he was described as an ""aggressive trial attorney dedicated to client service."" \n \n He is related to the Vasiliades family that owns the Sip & Bite diner in Canton. In 2015, then-Sip & Bite owner Anthony Vasiliades was arrested and pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court in Virginia after giving $50,000 cash to a government cooperator in exchange for two kilograms of cocaine. \n \n Christos Vasiliades is currently listed as the resident agent for Sip & Bite.

He was scheduled to appear in court Wednesday afternoon. \n \n He was representing Mario Aguilar-Delossantos in a rape case when he called the victim\'s husband in April and said things had become ""complicated"" and asked to meet. \n \n That night, he and an associate serving as a Spanish interpreter sat down with the couple at a restaurant and warned them that immigration agents would be in the courtroom for their client and that they could be deported, too, prosecutors charged. \n \n The couple reported the incident to law enforcement and authorities were listening in when the husband called Vasiliades a few weeks later and said he wanted to meet to talk more about the offer. \n \n “ I think you should find him and kick his ass, personally.” \n \n The next day, the group gathered again in an office, and this time the husband was wearing a wire when the attorney warned that his client would finger the victim as someone who is in the country illegally. \n \n ""My guy\'s going to be like, \'I\'m here, but she is too!\'"" the lawyer said, according to the indictment. ""They\'re going to ask, \'You have your documents?\' Then everybody\'s f-----."" \n \n He said that on the trial date, the couple should wait outside the courthouse, where the attorney\'s associate, Edgar Rodriguez, would be holding the cash, authorities alleged.

229,"['With financial help from his father and other partners, Mr. Balin opened the Matrix in 1965, designing the stage to accommodate a six-member band. Jefferson Airplane was the first band to play there, and it went on to perform frequently at the club, both on its own and as a backup band for visiting bluesmen. It was the first psychedelic San Francisco band to sign to a major label, RCA, and it released its debut album, “Jefferson Airplane Takes Off,” in 1966. \n \n Grace Slick replaced Ms. Anderson, and Spencer Dryden took over the drums from Skip Spence before the release of the second Jefferson Airplane album, “Surrealistic Pillow,” in 1967, the year of the Summer of Love. “White Rabbit” and “Somebody To Love” — two songs Ms. Slick brought to the band — became Top 10 hits. (Mr. Kantner and Ms. Anderson died in 2016, Mr. Dryden in 2005 and Mr. Spence in 1999.) \n \n For Mr. Balin, Jefferson Airplane was focused on live performance, not commercial formula. “We got to a place where the music was playing us, we weren’t playing it,” he told Relix magazine in 1993. “That’s where you want to get to. And from the first note you hit, no matter where you are, even in the biggest hall in the world, from the first note of the first song, you know at that moment you are there or you’re not.” \n \n Mr. Balin stayed with Jefferson Airplane through three more studio albums that have endured as psychedelic touchstones: “After Bathing at Baxter’s,” “Crown of Creation” and “Volunteers,” for which he and Mr. Kantner wrote the title track. Yet the escalating tension within the band, along with his sorrow at the death of a friend, Janis Joplin, in 1970, led to his departure from Jefferson Airplane in 1971. \n \n Mr. Kantner invited Mr. Balin to complete a song that became “Caroline” on Jefferson Starship’s 1974 album, “Dragon Fly,” with Mr. Balin on lead vocals. He joined the band as a full member in 1975 and was its frontman for pop successes including “Miracles,” “Count on Me,” “Runaway” and “With Your Love” before leaving in 1978.', 'Marty Balin, a co-founder of Jefferson Airplane and a member of its later incarnation Jefferson Starship, whose high and soulful voice defined many of both groups’ songs, died Thursday, his rep confirmed. He was 76; the cause of death was not announced. \n \n His wife, Susan Joy Balin, was “by his side,” according to the announcement. \n \n Although Balin had his greatest impact as one of the architects of the musical counterculture during his 1965-71 tenure in Jefferson Airplane, he had his greatest commercial success when he rejoined the remnants of that group a few years later in Jefferson Starship, as the sole lead singer on both of that band’s singles to reach the top 10, “Miracles” in 1975 and “Count on Me” in 1978. \n \n He was a member of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, having been inducted with other members of the Airplane in 1996. It was 20 years later that the band received the Recording Academy’s lifetime achievement award, with Patti Smith writing in the Grammy Awards’ program book about her appreciation for “the soaring combination of Grace Slick’s acerbic wit and fearless charisma and the romantic purity of Marty Balin.” \n \n Born Martyn Jerel Buchwald, Balin was a young folksinger in San Francisco when he formed a band with fellow folkie Paul Kantner, who specialized in 12-string guitar. The pair teamed up with guitarist Jorma Kaukonen, bassist Jack Casady, drummer Skip Spence and singer Signe Anderson as the Jefferson Airplane and released their debut album, “Jefferson Airplane Takes Off,” in 1966. Anderson and Spence soon left the band and were replaced by Grace Slick and Spencer Dryden, respectively, and the group’s 1967 album “Surrealistic Pillow” — featuring the Slick-sung hits “White Rabbit” and “Somebody to Love,” along with several songs co-written by Balin — vaulted the group into superstardom. The harmonies between Slick, Balin and Kantner became a signature of the group’s sound. \n \n Balin was a galvanizing member of both the band and the San Francisco scene, and in 1965 helped launch a club in the city called the Matrix that hosted many groups of the era, ranging from the Airplane, the Doors and Janis Joplin to the Velvet Underground. He sold his interest in the club after the Airplane’s star began to rise. \n \n Jefferson Airplane issued several more albums into the early 1970s and played at both Woodstock and Altamont (where he was famously knocked out by a Hell’s Angel after trying to intervene amid the violence). \n \n The group splintered in the early 1970s but several members, including Slick and Kantner, reunited as Jefferson Starship in the mid-‘70s, and Balin was persuaded to reunite with his former partners during the recording of their debut album. His high tenor voice became a centerpiece of the group’s sound via hits like “Miracles” and “With Your Love.” That group splintered as well before reuniting without Balin several years later as a pure pop outfit under the abbreviated name Starship. \n \n Balin went solo and enjoyed a top 10 hit of his own in 1981 with the song “Hearts.” In 1989, he joined up with a short-lived Airplane reunion tour and returned four years later to Jefferson Starship, finally leaving for good in 2008. His final solo album, “The Greatest Love,” was released in early 2016. \n \n He underwent open-heart surgery in 2016 and later sued New York’s Mount Sinai Beth Israel Hospital for medical malpractice, claiming multiple injuries from the operations. Balin’s illness rendered him unable to attend the Grammys when the Airplane was awarded lifetime achievement honors, but he released a statement at the time, saying, “”I am grateful for the beautiful musical journey my life continues to take. To all my fellow Jefferson Airplane Band members, through its various metamorphoses, I thank you for a dream come true.” \n \n In a statement, Susan and Balin’s family issued a statement that noted how Balin “also enjoyed painting all his life. He painted vibrant, large-scale portraits of many of the most influential musicians and good friends Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison and Jerry Garcia, to name a few.” \n \n “Marty was the one who started the San Francisco scene,” says Bill Thompson, Balin’s roommate back in the mid-’60s and former manager of both Jefferson Airplane and Jefferson Starship. \n \n “Back in those days Marty was quite the businessman,” said Paul Kantner, who passed away in 2016. “He was the leader of the band on that level. He was the one who pushed us to do all the business stuff, orchestrating, thinking ahead, looking for managers and club opportunities. He was very good at it.” \n \n Balin is survived by Susan, daughters Jennifer Edwards and Delaney Balin, and stepdaughters Rebekah Geier and Moriah Geier. \n \n “Marty and I shared the deepest of love — he often called it Nirvana — and it was,” Susan Balin said in a statement. “But really, we were all touched by his love. His presence will be within my entire being forever.”', 'Jefferson Airplane vocalist-guitarist Marty Balin, who co-founded the San Francisco psychedelic rock band in 1965 and played a crucial role in the creation of all their 1960s albums, including Surrealistic Pillow and Volunteers, died Thursday at the age of 76. Balin’s rep confirmed the musician’s death to Rolling Stone, though the cause of death is currently unknown. \n \n “RIP Marty Balin, fellow bandmate and music traveler passed last night,” Jefferson Airplane bassist Jack Casady said in a statement. “A great songwriter and singer who loved life and music. We shared some wonderful times together. We will all miss you!!!!” \n \n “Marty and I were young together in a time that defined our lives,” Jefferson Airplane guitarist Jorma Kaukonen wrote on his blog. “Had it not been for him, my life would have taken an alternate path I cannot imagine. He and Paul Kantner came together and like plutonium halves in a reactor started a chain reaction that still affects many of us today. It was a moment of powerful synchronicity. I was part of it to be sure, but I was not a prime mover. Marty always reached for the stars and he took us along with him.” \n \n Born Martyn Jerel Buchwald, Balin was a struggling folk guitarist on the San Francisco scene when he formed a band with Paul Kantner after meeting the 12-string guitarist at a hootenanny. They met up with Kaukonen, Casady, drummer Skip Spence and singer Signe Toly Anderson, and cut their 1966 debut LP, Jefferson Airplane Takes Off. They developed a strong following around the budding San Francisco rock scene, but became nationwide superstars in 1967 when Anderson left the group and was replaced by Grace Slick. \n \n Balin co-wrote five songs on their breakthrough LP, Surrealistic Pillow, including “Comin’ Back to Me” and album opener “She Has Funny Cars,” and his tenor voice became a key component of their signature sound. He played with the group at all of its most famous gigs, including the 1967 Human Be-In in San Francisco’s Golden Gate Park, the Monterey Pop Festival, Woodstock and Altamont. At the latter gig, Balin was brutally beaten by the Hells Angels after he dived into the audience to help an audience member in distress. “I woke up with all these boot marks all over my body,” he told Relix in 1993. “I just walked out there. I remember Jorma saying, ‘Hey, you’re a crazy son of a bitch.’ ” \n \n A little over a year later, Balin quit the group. “I thought everybody [was] kind of an asshole,” he said earlier this year. “It was a period of cocaine then.…Everybody took cocaine. And people I would work with, they would yell at you and it got intense. The Airplane was on that kind of trip. You know, I personally just drank alcohol. But some of the chemicals made people crazy and very selfish, and it just wasn’t any fun to be around for me. So I bailed.” \n \n Balin spent a few years managing rock bands in San Francisco, but he was pulled back into the group’s orbit by Kantner in 1974, though by that point Casady and Kaukonen had defected and the remaining members were billing themselves as Jefferson Starship. The offshoot band was incredibly successful and scored more hits than the original Airplane, including the Balin-penned “Miracles,” from Red Octopus, hitting Number Three in 1975. But by 1978, Balin grew tired of touring, especially since Slick’s alcohol issues caused many uneven performances, and he left the group for a solo career. In 1989, he participated in the short-lived Jefferson Airplane reunion tour and returned four years later to Jefferson Starship, finally leaving for good in 2008. \n \n In 2016, Balin underwent open-heart surgery at Mount Sinai Beth Israel Hospital in New York. He later sued for medical malpractice, claiming negligence caused him a myriad of injuries, including a paralyzed vocal cord, bedsores, kidney damage, and the loss of his left thumb and half his tongue.', 'There was a government handout under way at the White House on Saturday evening — a sweet one. \n \n President Obama and the first lady, Michelle Obama, celebrated Halloween by handing out candy and other goodies to more than 2,000 trick-or-treaters from selected Washington, Virginia and Maryland elementary schools. The children filled the North Lawn of the White House — bathed in orange light for the occasion — as a giant black spider and a long web dangled from the North Portico. \n \n It was the first Halloween at the White House for the Obama family, and they opened up the gates to kids, ages 6 to 14, who were allowed to roam around in their costumes. It was a curious scene, with goblins, monsters and characters of all kinds mingling around real-life Secret Service agents. \n \n Mr. Obama did not dress up, wearing just a sweater and slacks — perhaps his costume was president of the United States. Mrs. Obama played the role of Cat Woman. The White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, dressed as Darth Vader, and the United States ambassador to the United Nations, Susan E. Rice, went as the Disney character Goofy. \n \n For about 30 minutes, the president, the first lady and the first grandmother, Marian Robinson, smiled broadly as they handed out treats on the front steps of the North Portico. \n \n Later, a few hundred military families, chosen by each service, roamed the first floor of the White House as an old-fashioned turntable played albums. Costumes and characters abounded. \n \n “They’re adorable,” Mr. Obama said, “as is, by the way, my wife — a very nice-looking Cat Woman.” \n \n So what kind of loot did the president prepare? \n \n A white-and-blue box of M&Ms — imprinted with Mr. Obama’s autograph — and a sweet butter cookie made by the White House pastry chef. And in keeping with the theme of healthy eating inside the White House that Mrs. Obama has promoted, the children were also given a dried fruit mix of cherries, apricots, pears, apples and papayas.']",4,"– A major figure in the emergence of psychedelic rock in the 1960s has died. Marty Balin, who co-founded Jefferson Airplane and played on and off with its later iteration, Jefferson Starship, died en route to the hospital in Tampa, Florida, at age 76, reports the New York Times. The cause of death wasn't immediately known. The Times calls Balin a ""prime mover in the flowering of psychedelic rock in mid-1960s San Francisco,"" not only through the band he co-founded in 1965 but through a nightclub he owned called the Matrix. Rolling Stone has a detailed obituary on Balin's interesting career, noting that he was a struggling folk guitarist when he met another guitarist named Paul Kantner and decided to form a band. Other original Airplane members were guitarist Jorma Kaukonen, bassist Jack Casady, drummer Skip Spence, and singer Signe Toly Anderson, but the band didn't truly take off until Anderson left and was replaced by Grace Slick in 1967, notes Rolling Stone. Balin wrote or co-wrote many of the songs, and his ""high and soulful"" voice became a signature sound for the group, per Variety. (Here is ""Comin' Back to Me."") But he was also a savvy businessman, as this old quote from the late Kanter shows: “He was the leader of the band on that level. He was the one who pushed us to do all the business stuff, orchestrating, thinking ahead, looking for managers and club opportunities. He was very good at it.”"

""State leaders in power keep forcing people to opposite corners to prepare for a fight instead of coming together to get things done."" \n \n Davis has said that her experience going from being a single teen mother living in a trailer to a successful Harvard-trained attorney in the Texas Senate informed her political views. She said Texas needed to be ""a lot less lone and a lot more star."" \n \n ""Until the families who are burning the candle at both ends can finally make ends meet, we will keep going. Until the amazing health care advances being pioneered in this state reach everyone who needs them, we will keep going,"" she said to about 1,500 people at the Wiley G. Thomas Coliseum. \n \n Davis then blasted ""the current leadership"" in Austin for creating a partisan atmosphere and appealing to the right wing of the Republican party. \n \n ""Texans deserve better than failed leaders who dole out favors to friends and cronies behind closed doors,"" she said. ""It\'s time for a governor who believes that you don\'t have to buy a place in Texas\' future. It\'s time for a governor who believes that the future of Texas belongs to all of us."" \n \n Republican Gov. Rick Perry has chosen not to seek re-election next year. The front-runner for the GOP nomination is Attorney General Greg Abbott, who said in an interview with The Associated Press on Thursday that Davis is too liberal for Texas. \n \n Davis rose to national prominence in June for her nearly 13-hour filibuster against new abortion restrictions in Texas, but she didn\'t mention the subject Thursday. Instead, she talked about her 2011 filibuster to block passage of the state budget after the Republican majority cut $5 billion for public schools. \n \n Davis\' opponents plan to use her support for abortion rights to rally conservative Christian voters next fall. About 40 anti-abortion demonstrators marched outside the venue where Davis was speaking Thursday, and Texas Right to Life plans to begin airing an ad over the weekend that calls her an ""abortion zealot."" \n \n Abbott called her filibuster ""inconsequential"" and sought to tie her to President Barack Obama. \n \n ""Obama\'s political operation is the muscle behind Wendy Davis\' political operation,"" Abbott said. ""She is an extremist with regards to imposing the kind of spending and regulation that\'s reckless for government."" \n \n If her defense of abortion rights angered the right, it inspired Democrats who urged her to run for governor in 2014 and reinvigorate a party that hasn\'t won statewide office since 1994. Her speech in the Legislature also added to her donor list, both in Texas and across the country. \n \n ""I thought the filibuster was inspiring and it seems like she really cares about people,"" said Amanda Fisher, a 24-year-old from Dallas. Fisher said she was considering volunteering for a political campaign for the first time. \n \n At a watch party in McAllen, a city along the border with Mexico, retired hospice chaplain Elizabeth Gearhart said Davis could help Democrats. \n \n ""She\'s going to inspire everyone. She\'s especially going to inspire women,"" Gearhart said. ""And there\'s a lot of us."" \n \n Davis must raise money quickly to compete with Abbott, He has already raised $25 million to her more than $1 million. \n \n Experts say Davis and the political action committees supporting her will need to spend about $40 million to make it a competitive campaign in Texas, where Democrats have not won more than 42 percent of the vote in the last three elections. \n \n But national Democratic support and changing state demographics give Davis a chance to end the party\'s 20-year losing streak in Texas, Democratic consultants say. \n \n Davis\' personal story _ from a trailer park to Texas Christian University to the Harvard Law School _ has captured the imagination of many of her supporters. \n \n She was a successful attorney when she decided to enter politics by challenging a veteran Republican state senator in Tarrant County in 2008. She narrowly won that race and a tough re-election bid in 2012, when most voters in her district cast ballots for GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press reporter Paul J.

But somehow you just have the energy to do what you have to do,�? she told Vogue of being a single mom and attending community college classes in the morning while she worked as a paralegal. “And the great thing was, after a year, I realized that college wasn’t only for other people.�? \n \n Davis’ hair struggles (she admitted to having “super-supercurly hair�?), clothing (“She loves to put on something nice, dresses by Chloé and Victoria Beckham, and Miu Miu heels or Louboutins�?), home life (she lives in a “Spanish-style town house�?) and speculation about a potential run for Texas governor are also prominently featured. \n \n In the profile, Davis revealed that she was not always interested in politics, finding such conversations boring when out with her second husband Jeff Davis, a lawyer and the youngest person to be elected to the Fort Worth city council. \n \n “I remember we’d go into restaurants and everyone wanted to talk politics, and I thought, God, this is soooo boring,�? she said. \n \n From bored with politics to Harvard law, law career to city council seat, and State Senate to household name, the profile delves into her potential run for governor. \n \n “I feel confident that the next campaign will sort itself out in due time,�?

But unlike everyone else, I also read them with a mounting sense of guilt. It was me, after all, who first introduced Paul to Heather, at the Mirror's Pride of Britain Awards in 1999. \n \n I remember the moment well. It was Macca's first real public appearance since the death of his wife, Linda, and he turned up an hour late after agonising all morning whether to come or not. \n \n 'This is not easy for me,' he whispered tearfully in my ear, as one particularly heroic piece of child bravery was saluted. \n \n More here... \n \n \n \n • The McCartneys at war \n \n \n \n \n \n I genuinely felt for him. But Paul perked up enormously when a feisty buxom lady called Heather Mills marched on stage and delivered a speech about a young girl who had lost her legs to meningitis. \n \n Heather was articulate, opinionated, determined, well-researched and inspiring. \n \n I introduced her to Paul after the show, and before I knew it they'd fallen in love. It was supposed to be the happy-ever-after script that everyone wanted for the world's favourite, tragic, Beatle. \n \n But Heather quickly began attracting unfavourable headlines. Her past, to put it mildly, was 'murky'. She'd been a party girl for wealthy Arabs, had run through boyfriends and fiancés like a bull through Pamplona, and developed an unfortunate tendency to tell endless porky pies about herself. \n \n She was also a fiery little number, prone to rages, rows and general 'anger management' issues. \n \n Stories soon emerged that the marriage was in trouble - at one stage I was played a tape of a message Paul had left for Heather on her mobile phone. \n \n It was heartbreaking. The couple had clearly had a tiff, Heather had fled to India, and Paul was pleading with her to come back. He sounded lonely, miserable and desperate, and even sang 'We Can Work It Out' into the answerphone. \n \n But despite it all, I still rather liked and admired Heather. When I interviewed her for a TV series, I found her to be a tough cookie with a waspish sense of humour, who was rightly proud of the very effective work she does for charity. \n \n But I also didn't believe a lot of what she said, and thought she was ludicrously obsessed with - and touchy about - the Press. I could also sense a growing - and even more ludicrous - irritation that she had to constantly play second fiddle to Paul. \n \n Becoming 'Lady' Heather had compounded her sense of self worth to dangerously high levels, and I began hearing more and more stories of her diva behaviour. \n \n The separation, when it came, only served to confirm what many already suspected: there had been three of them in the marriage - Paul, Heather and her Ego, and one of them had to go. It was Paul. \n \n Since the split, she's been fighting a PR war with Macca - from being photographed locked out of his house, to hiring Princess Diana's divorce lawyer. Operation Make-Me-A-Martyr has been fought with ruthless efficiency in the pages of the popular press over the last few months. \n \n What Heather has never understood, though, is that she can NEVER supplant a Beatle in public affection. However difficult Paul might be - and I suspect that, like most geniuses, he's not the easiest guy to live with - he's still the man who wrote Yesterday, Hey Jude and Let It Be. And the man who had one of the happiest, most loyal marriages in showbusiness, until Linda was so cruelly taken from him. \n \n We all love Macca because he's always seemed such a nice, ordinary type, relatively untainted by fame. And that's why Heather has made such a hideous mistake in making all these horrible allegations about her husband in the divorce papers. \n \n Even if she was not directly responsible for the leak, she must have known that the details would come out, and presumably assumed we'd all read them with horror and a sudden new sympathy for this poor, tortured, tormented soul. \n \n But we didn't, Heather. We all read them with horror alright - horror that you could be so disgusting about our Paul. As for sympathy, that's all going to swing even further his way. Fast. \n \n Let me be clear at this point. There is nothing remotely comical about genuine victims of domestic abuse. But the woman who emerges from these papers is no victim. \n \n The picture the documents paint is of a self-obsessed, demanding, selfish, whining woman, apparently intent on making Paul's life as unhappy as possible. \n \n Every two paragraphs, another incident seems to have occurred because Heather was, by her own admission, 'in a bad mood', usually because someone's said something nasty about her on TV or in a paper. \n \n On one extraordinary occasion she even tries to get Paul to pull out of the Superbowl in America, the single biggest entertainment event in the world, because the Sunday Times is about to be bitchy about her - and Rupert Murdoch owns both the paper and Fox TV, the Superbowl's official broadcaster. \n \n I laughed out loud when I read that. The sheer scale of her self delusion is scary. \n \n As is her hypocrisy. Heather always used to bang on about how she didn't want people to think of her as 'disabled.' She wanted us to treat her as a perfectly normal, able-bodied person. \n \n Yet her court papers are peppered with constant references to her disability. She's permanently either 'crawling up' stairs, or slithering on her hands and knees on to planes, or trapped wheelchair-bound and helpless. \n \n But later we read that she's strong enough to haul a drunken Macca out of the bath, upstairs and into bed. \n \n Make your mind up Heather, you're either Stephen Hawking or Superwoman. Which is it to be? \n \n I felt thoroughly sickened by the time I finished raking through this self-serving rant. \n \n Any sympathy I once had for Miss Mills has evaporated. Instead, I am filled with guilt and sorrow that, as a lifelong Beatles fan, I am at least partly responsible for the hell Paul McCartney is going through at the hands of this vengeful, shameless, ghastly woman. \n \n Paul, it may be a bit late now, but I'm sorry.""]",3,"– Wendy Davis officially announced her candidacy for governor of Texas yesterday, and Judith Warner thinks she's exactly what Democrats need—and not just because of her filibuster-generated fame.

Its $63.5 million opening day in China set a record, demolishing the previous record of $36 million for “Transformers 4.” \n \n Ron Meyer, vice chairman of studio parent NBCUniversal, sent out a congratulatory note to the staff. \n \n “At Universal we have had franchises with strong results at the box office, including ‘Jurassic Park,’ ‘Despicable Me’ and the ‘Bourne’ series, and although we take great pride in these accomplishments, what distinguishes ‘Fast and Furious’ is that it is an original live action concept with an entirely diverse cast,” Meyer noted. “It is the only franchise of its kind to reach a total of more than $3.39 billion and counting.” \n \n Meyer also noted the unique circumstances created by star Paul Walker’s death in late 2013. \n \n “When our friend and colleague Paul Walker tragically passed away in the middle of production, our team, led by Jeff Shell and Donna Langley, and the filmmakers, along with the cast and crew, did what they do best: They focused on family first; then talked to the fans; then got to work on making a great film that we can all be proud of,” he said. “We were all saddened and honored to be a part of Paul’s final career performance and to celebrate his defining role in our lives.” \n \n UPDATE, 10:11 p.m. — Variety’s first story said that “Furious 7” is the first Universal film to go past $1 billion. It is actually the first Universal film to do so in its initial release. The studio’s “Jurassic Park” reached $1.044 billion after the 3D re-release in 2013."", 'Despite being in American theaters for less than a month, Furious 7 just grossed a billion dollars at the box office. For those keeping track at home, that is faster than any movie has ever hit the billion-dollar mark, according to Variety. It’s an impressive feat, but it should come as no surprise that a film all about speed has raced to the top of the box office and into the record books. \n \n The James Wan-directed film, which stars Vin Diesel, Dwayne Johnson, Paul Walker, Ludacris, Jason Statham, Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, and Tyrese Gibson, hit the billion-dollar milestone in just 17 days. That coup let the film just squeak past the previous box office record jointly held by The Avengers, Avatar, and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2, which all crossed the billion-dollar mark in 19 days. \n \n “At Universal we have had franchises with strong results at the box office, including Jurassic Park, Despicable Me and the Bourne series, and although we take great pride in these accomplishments, what distinguishes Fast and Furious is that it is an original live action concept with an entirely diverse cast,” said Ron Meyer, vice chairman of studio parent NBCUniversal, in a congratulatory note. “It is the only franchise of its kind to reach a total of more than $3.39 billion and counting.” Furious 7 is the first film from Universal Studios to gross $1 billion. (Jurassic Park also crossed the threshold, but only after it was re-released in 3-D in 2013.) Thanks to the success of the “thrilling, ridiculous, and, yes, sad” film, the rumored Furious 8 is probably a go. (Hear that, Helen Mirren?) \n \n Furious 7 is the 20th film ever to reach the $1 billion benchmark and the first since last year’s Transformers: Age of Extinction. While Furious 7 may be roaring now, it still has a way to go if it wants to challenge Avatar for the title of all-time worldwide box office record holder. James Cameron’s special effects-laden sci-fi spectacular made a whopping $2.79 billion at the box office, which even a Na’vi wouldn’t sneeze at. Cameron also holds the record for second place in box office hauls for Titanic, which took in $2.19 billion (and the hearts of all who watched). \n \n Do you have what it takes? \n \n Test your knowledge of the Seven Kingdoms with Vanity Fair ’s Game of Unknowns. \n \n Make your predictions', 'Website \n \n Press enquiries: press@ColdSh.com \n \n Feature Articles About The Cold Shoulder \n \n Japanese ""GetNews"" \n \n Video Interviews with Dr. Wayne Hayes: \n \n You\'ll need an HTML5 capable browser to see this content.

What you\'re about to read is going to sound like science fiction, but it\'s not. Scientists have spent decades studying how mild cold exposure can enhance calorie burn. Quietly, and without fuss, the evidence for cold exposure induced calorie burn has been accumulating. It\'s time to bring the science to the public. That\'s what I\'m here to do: to explain to you what is probably the most novel, evidence-based calorie-burning idea that\'s come out of the scientific community in many years, and to tell you how you can take advantage of it without pain, without discomfort, and without taking more than 2 minutes of time out of your busy day. With KickStarter\'s help, we\'ll be able to bring this vest to the masses at a reasonable price. \n \n Let\'s be blunt: there is no magic pill for weight loss, and The Cold Shoulder is no exception to that rule. The cold, hard truth is that the foundation of weight control is your diet. In order to maintain a healthy weight, do what grandma told you: eat your veggies, cut the fat off your steak, and avoid junk food, especially sweets. If you continue to eat junk, then no amount of exercise, cold exposure, or weirdly named supplements or powders will help you lose weight. The vest can burn up to 500 calories per day if used as directed, but you can easily nullify the effect by eating an extra 500 extra calories. So don\'t expect that you can continue to eat junk food, wear the vest, and lose weight. You can\'t. \n \n But if you are already eating well and getting moderate exercise and want to accelerate your calorie-burning efforts by burning excess calories while at rest, there\'s no simpler, easier, or more time-efficient way than wearing our vest. \n \n We\'d like to emphasize exactly under what conditions The Cold Shoulder can induce the burning of excess calories. Basically, you need to be in an environment where you are otherwise at a comfortable temperature, and you are not exercising. If you are sitting down at rest in a room (or your car, or whatever) that is at a comfortable temperature, then wearing The Cold Shoulder directly from the freezer, and with a shirt underneath, will extract heat from your body and cause you to burn extra calories in order to stay warm. \n \n If you are in a hot environment, the The Cold Shoulder will help you stay cool, but it won\'t burn excess calories, because you\'re not cold. If you are working out in the gym, then The Cold Shoulder can help you stay cool, but will not enhance your calorie burn, because you\'re not cold in that environment. If the vest is not cold, or if the ice has all melted, it will not induce excess calorie burn. Remember that the goal of The Cold Shoulder is to force you to burn calories at a time when you otherwise would not: sitting down, at rest, in a comfortable environment at room temperature. \n \n So, to burn excess calories, wear The Cold Shoulder sitting on the couch watching the game, or in front of your computer, or in your car during your commute. Any time you\'d normally just be sitting around comfortable---that\'s the time to don The Cold Shoulder and enhance your calorie burn. \n \n Whether you\'re an athlete, an actor/model, or a couch potato, almost everybody today could benefit from burning a few more calories without expending time or effort. Note that The Cold Shoulder cannot claim to diagnose, treat, prevent, or cure any disease, illness or condition. \n \n The Problem - Exercise is not the only way to burn calories \n \n The first thing I always hear when I say I’m touting a “cold vest” is, “I don’t like being cold.” But think of all the other crazy things people do in order to try to lose excess fat. Starving themselves? Eating zero-calorie clay just to feel full, which carries a risk of arsenic poising? Exhausting themselves in the gym? Ingesting questionable supplements that, if they work at all, have side effects like insomnia or over‐stimulation? How about wearing a corset just to appear thinner? Drug injections? Liposuction? Freezing fat cells? Gastro‐intestinal surgery? Considering these options, wearing a cool, calorie-burning vest is pretty tame in comparison. The Cold Shoulder has no known side effects. Users who start skeptical end up wearing it routinely, and even find they look forward to putting it on at the end of a long day. \n \n There is an aspect of the calorie equation that has been largely neglected for too long. There is a huge hole in our collective knowledge. Although exercise is definitely good, most people think that exercise is the only way to burn excess calories. But it\'s not. \n \n The Solution - Burn excess calories using mild cold exposure \n \n In addition to exercise, there’s another, much less well-known but scientifically well-established way to burn calories. It’s called mild cold exposure. Basically, if you extract heat from your body, even if you’re sitting on your couch in front of the T.V., your body will need to burn calories to stay warm. This is a scientific fact – and I should know, since I work at NASA with a group of scientists that study ice. The trick is to figure out how to harness mild cold exposure without being uncomfortable. \n \n The idea of using mild cold exposure to burn calories has slowly started to percolate into the popular media. Articles on the subject have appeared in many places, including the venues mentioned at the top of this page. The problem is that they often recommend painful or impractical methods of cold exposure, like cold showers or ice baths. Very few people have the courage to try that. \n \n I was studying the science of how cold exposure burns calories, when I had a light-bulb moment. I thought, ""If cold exposure burns calories, there’s got to be a way I can harness its power to help ordinary people increase their calorie burn."" That’s when I began the work that eventually led me to develop The Cold Shoulder. It\'s a vest that drapes ice over the shoulder and back, and extracts calories while you wear it. The vest looks like this: \n \n The Cold Shoulder Calorie Burning Vest \n \n I have put it to the scientific test and proved this vest\'s efficacy in controlled clinical trials. Here are a few before-and-after shots after just 3 weeks of using The Cold Shoulder: \n \n Results of 3 weeks of wearing The Cold Shoulder \n \n Considering all the crazy things that people do to burn excess fat, from starvation diets to liposuction, a vest that burns calories while you continue about your day seems pretty tame, don\'t you think? \n \n Why You’ll Love The Cold Shoulder \n \n 1. Burns calories without exercise. Whether you’re a gym rat or a couch potato, our ice vest will burn excess calories for you – the equivalent of up to 500 calories a day. This can more than double the calorie deficit you\'d get from dieting alone. \n \n 2. Saves time. It takes about 30s to get the vest out of the freezer and put it on. Then you go about your day until the ice melts, and it\'s another thirty seconds to take it off and put it back into the freezer. Do that twice a day, and you\'ve spent 2 minutes to burn 500 calories. Compare that to the same calories burned in a gym workout, which can consume several hours once you include travel time, change room time, and waiting for the machines that are busy when you want to use them. Two minutes vs. two hours, for the same 500 calories. \n \n 3. It’s effective. The idea is based on decades of research by scientists from Harvard to Cambridge and beyond. Mild cold exposure burns calories – it’s a scientific fact. The only question is how to do it comfortably, effortlessly.... even fashionably! \n \n 4. It’s comfortable. The first time you wear it, yes, it\'ll feel cold. But you won’t shiver. After trying it a few times, you’ll hardly notice you’re wearing it. Some of our current users actually look forward to putting it on. \n \n 5. It gets more effective the more you use it. As your body acclimatizes to periodic mild cold exposure, it gets more used to the idea of turning on your internal furnace to burn calories. It gets easier and easier to burn off more and more calories, just like going to the gym gets easier the more you do it. This is exactly opposite to drugs or supplements, which usually decrease in effectiveness as your body builds a tolerance to them. \n \n 6. It’s fashionable. You can wear it pretty much anywhere. I\'ve worn it to fancy French restaurants, as part of a 3-piece suit. I even tried wearing it on my wedding day, but my fiancé – now wife – decided it wasn’t quite ready for that. \n \n 7. Sold direct at wholesale prices. Expect to pay significantly more once this is available in retail stores. There’s no middle man on KickStarter. We’ll manufacture your vest and ship it directly to you. \n \n How Does It Work? \n \n The Science Behind Cold-exposure Based Calorie Burn \n \n You don\'t need to be a scientist to understand that too much cold exposure – such as, say, floating in the North Atlantic after the Titanic sank – can extract so many calories so quickly that it can kill you. On the other hand, mild cold exposure is perfectly healthy, and has been studied by scientists for decades as a way to burn calories. \n \n For example, Olympic swimmers burn many more calories per day than other Olympic athletes, and it has nothing to do with the exercise. It’s the water. They spend their day in water that’s 20 degrees (F) below their body temperature, and this temperature difference makes them burn way more calories than the exercise alone. \n \n Due to the temperature difference between the body and the water, heat flows from the body to the water, burning many more calories than the exercise alone. \n \n Any mild cold exposure causes your body to burn extra calories, whether it’s a cold day outside, air conditioning set too high, or your skin being in contact with a cold object. Scientists have been studying the effects of mild cold exposure for decades, and it’s a well documented fact that mild cold exposure induces calorie burn. \n \n Our vest, The Cold Shoulder, has ice draped over the shoulder and across the back: \n \n Due to the temperature difference between the body and the ice vest, heat flows from the body to the vest, causing your body to burn calories. \n \n These are the most comfortable places to put the ice because that\'s where your body has the fewest nerve endings. It\'s also the most scientifically valid place to put the ice because, just under the skin of the shoulders and back, there\'s a type of tissue called Brown Adipose Tissue (BAT). BAT burns calories when you encounter mild cold. Our clinical trials show that wearing our vest twice a day for about an hour burns up to 500 calories more per day than you\'d burn without it. \n \n Example clinical trial result - Nick Hamilton \n \n Below is a graph of the body fat of Nick Hamilton over a 16-week period. Nick was one of our early testers of The Cold Shoulder. He was on a 16 week, tightly controlled diet and exercise regimen. The only change Nick made in the last 2 weeks was to start using The Cold Shoulder ice vest. You can see how much it accelerated his fat loss. \n \n Nick Hamilton greatly accelerated his fat loss just by wearing The Cold Shoulder for an hour each morning and evening, for the last 2 weeks of his 16-week diet + exercise regimen. \n \n Evidence from independent scientists \n \n For more info on cold exposure and calorie burn, see this page. Note that some of it is rather technical---definitely not light reading. But if you want some of the cold, hard scientific facts from independent researchers, this is the place to start. Most of the research was done even before I conceived of The Cold Shoulder, so you know it\'s independent and objective. \n \n Our Mission \n \n We want to bring the most functional, comfortable, and stylish clothing-based calorie-burning aid to the global market. We want to spread the word that burning calories doesn’t have to require time-consuming gym visits, sweaty exercise, crazy calorie-restricted diet fads, or taking untested, questionable supplements with unknown side effects. Instead, we advocate that a healthy lifestyle must contain not only a healthy diet and moderate exercise, but also a regular dose of mild cold exposure. \n \n Why We Need You! \n \n Although we have the designs and prototypes finished and our manufacturer stands ready to produce the vests, the cost of production is high unless we fulfill minimum order quantities. In order to cover the costs of fabric and production at this level, we need to commit to this minimum order quantity to secure the best deal, which can then be passed onto you, with special rewards exclusively offered here on Kickstarter! \n \n Will It Fit Me? \n \n We have sizes to fit everybody from XS to XXX-L. We’ll get your sizing option after the funding period is over. \n \n The Details \n \n Inside-out view of the front + back of the vest, showing ice pocket locations. \n \n Re-inforced stitching at stress points \n \n Velcro closure on ice pockets to firmly hold ice packs in place \n \n Velcro closure at the front of the vest, which allows tightening the waist as you lose weight \n \n The Cold Neck can be used alone or in conjunction with the vest to add an additional 20-25% calorie burn. \n \n Backer Rewards \n \n Stretch Goals: \n \n Women’s sizes: Although the current vest is unisex, it\'s not particularly flattering to the female form. If we reach about $40k in funding, we will have enough spare capital to hire a female clothing designer to design a version more tailored to the female form. We envision it as having a fashionable waist-level fabric body-wrapping belt to adjust the waist size, rather than Velcro. If we get here, and you want a female version of the vest, you\'ll be able to choose that after the funding period is over, but it\'ll probably add about an extra month to your delivery date. \n \n Production Plan \n \n Once funded, we will put in our order for materials. Delivery and preparation of materials may take 2-4 weeks. During that time we’ll confirm sizing for all of our backers and prepare the manufacturing process. To ensure quality construction, we’re personally overseeing manufacturing of our vests in the Los Angeles Fashion district, which requires 4-6 weeks. We source our ice packs from the USA. Once the vests are made, we’ll prepare them for shipment (at most 1-2 weeks), and then ship them to your door (2-3 days Domestic US, or 1-2 weeks International). \n \n Total time from funding to shipment: Between 8-12 weeks within the continental US, plus another 1-2 weeks for international shipments. \n \n Our Guarantee \n \n We are confident that you will be happy with your vests and the results it will produce, but if for any reason you’re not completely satisfied, just send it back (you pay shipping, and please give us a “heads up” first), and we\'ll repair or replace your vest and ship it back to you free of charge. \n \n TESTIMONIALS \n \n “The Cold Shoulder allowed me to cut body fat while still gaining Lean Body Mass.

Romney campaign adviser Kevin Madden piled on, saying, ""I don't think the message to voters right now ought to be playing Scrabble with your opponent's name"" and that the Obama campaign, for lack of vision, has reduced itself ""to very small attacks like ‘Romnesia’, along with this talk about binders, this talk about Big Bird."" Obama campaign manager Stephanie Cutter defended talk of Big Bird as important ""because that’s the only thing Mitt Romney could point to as to how he’s going to reduce the deficit.""

I don’t know how to square all the polling that NBC is releasing."" Lindsay Graham on Iran talks: ""As we talk with the Iranians, whether it’s bilaterally or unilaterally, they continue to enrich, and the vice president and the president have said we will do nothing without coordinating with Israel. I think it’s pretty obvious they are trying to continue a dialogue using our election cycle in a pretty clever way."" Gallup editor Frank Newport on his methodology: “People come at you from either side if they don't like the results. Our methodology is extremely solid. We’re very open about how we do it."" Graham on Libya: ""The Benghazi consulate was becoming a death trap. The British left, the Red Cross left. We should have closed that consulate long before Sept. 11, and I put that on the president of the United States.” Dick Durbin on GOP and Libya: ""Darrell Issa does a document dump with sensitive information about those in Libya who are helping keep America safe. It shows the lengths many will go to politicize this tragic situation."" Newt Gingrich on Libya: “Should Ronald Reagan not have talked about (the Iran hostage crisis) for 444 days? The fact is, we're in the middle of a mess in the Middle East, the mess keeps evolving, there continue to be incidents. If that offends the president, then that’s his problem and he ought to get over it."""

In fact! Here’s a sample: \n \n “in my defense my style of writing is not laziness or lack of knowledge of proper usage of the english language it is a form of grammatical resistance as a deconstructionist in the manner of many writers especially american poet ee cummings he graduated with a master degree in english from harvard university and they called him experimental and innovative not words likely to be used to describe an indigenous writer who breaks all the rules of writing (the behavioural ethics board at the university of british columbia suggested that i hire an editor as it appeared that i did not know the english language) times though they are changing” \n \n “Stewart explains that he ‘wanted to make a point about aboriginal culture, colonialism, and ‘the blind acceptance of English language conventions in academia,’” the National Post adds. \n \n Congratulations to Patrick Stewart on his newly earned PhD. \n \n The fact that his thesis was not originally published on Thought Catalog is the biggest shock of all. \n \n [National Post via Inside Higher Ed.

So make that Dr. Patrick Stewart. “I like to say that it’s one long, run-on sentence, from cover to cover,” the 61-year-old tells the newspaper. ""There’s nothing in the (UBC dissertation) rules about formats or punctuation."" Stewart belongs to indigenous Nisga'a First Nation, and he says his dissertation was a protest of the “the blind acceptance of English language conventions in academia.” A sample: “in my defense my style of writing is not laziness or lack of knowledge of proper usage of the english language it is a form of grammatical resistance as a deconstructionist"" The dissertation caught the attention of Inside Higher Ed, while a Gawker post likens Stewart's style to that of a 19-year-old ""who has only recently discovered ee cummings."""

(Associated Press) \n \n The storm, part of a system that began in the Rockies earlier in the week, led airlines to cancel more than 1,000 flights and caused whiteout conditions that left roads dangerous to drive on. It was blamed for deaths in at least five states, with parts of Iowa and Wisconsin hit with more than a foot of snow. \n \n While some people went to work on digging themselves out even as the storm continued Thursday, others had less control: They were stuck waiting for word of new flight times. \n \n Most of the canceled flights were in Chicago, where aviation officials said more than 350 flights were called off at O\'Hare International Airport and more than 150 at Midway International Airport. \n \n Southwest Airlines, which canceled all of its flights out of its Midway hub after 4:30 p.m. Thursday, was anticipating normal operations Friday morning in Chicago. United Airlines also planned to operate a full schedule, though spokeswomen for both airlines cautioned travelers to check their flight status before heading to the airport. \n \n Erin Henderson is among the people hoping to get out of O\'Hare Friday morning. The 20-year-old college student was trying to return home to Kansas City after five months of studying abroad in Italy when she arrived in Chicago early Thursday evening to learn the last leg of her flight had been canceled. \n \n Exhausted and teary-eyed, Henderson said she planned to get some sleep in a nearby hotel before trying to catch a flight to St Louis early Friday. She said her father planned to drive across Missouri to get her. \n \n ""It was the closest I can get,"" Henderson said. \n \n In Madison, Wis., more than 19 inches of snow fell, prompting the University of Wisconsin at Madison to cancel Thursday\'s finals. Senior Elle Knutson, 21, said she spent most of the day in her apartment chatting with friends on the Internet and staring out her window at the snow. \n \n ""At first it was kind of nice, but I\'m going a little stir-crazy,"" Knutson said Thursday night. \n \n The storm made travel difficult from Kansas to Wisconsin, forcing road closures, including a 120-mile stretch of Interstate 35 from Ames, Iowa, through Albert Lea, Minn. Iowa and Wisconsin activated National Guard troops to help rescue stranded drivers. \n \n In Iowa, two people were killed and seven injured in a 25-vehicle pileup. Drivers were blinded by blowing snow and didn\'t see vehicles that had slowed or stopped on Interstate 35 about 60 miles north of Des Moines, state police said. A chain reaction of crashes involving semitrailers and passenger cars closed down a section of the highway. \n \n Three other states also had traffic deaths that were blamed on the storm. There were at least two deaths in each Nebraska and Wisconsin, and one in Kansas. \n \n In southeastern Utah, a woman who tried to walk for help after her car became stuck in snow died Tuesday night. \n \n On the southern edge of the storm system, tornadoes destroyed several homes in Arkansas and peeled the roofs from buildings, toppled trucks and blew down oak trees and limbs in Alabama. \n \n The flight cancellations were getting a lot of attention because the storm came just a few days before Christmas. But Daniel Baker, CEO of flight tracking service FlightAware.com, called it ""a relatively minor event in the overall scheme of things."" \n \n By comparison, airlines canceled more than 13,000 flights over a two-day period during a February 2011 snowstorm that hit the Midwest.

Restoring normal road traffic in the region could take longer. (Dec. 21) AP \n \n Blizzard warnings were in effect in Iowa, Wisconsin, Minnesota and Illinois, according to the National Weather Service. The Weather Channel reported that parts of 17 states are under winter weather advisories -- as far west as Washington state and as far east as Maine. \n \n The storm brought much-needed precipitation for drought-plagued regions but was bad news for holiday travelers. Most of the nation\'s big airlines responded to the storm\'s threat by enacting flexible rebooking policies for passengers scheduled to fly into the storm\'s path. \n \n The storm led airlines to cancel about 1,000 flights ahead of the Christmas holiday — relatively few compared to past big storms, though the number was climbing. \n \n More than 600 flights were canceled at Chicago\'s two airports, O\'Hare and Midway. O\'Hare is a major hub for both United and American, meaning the disruption could ripple out and affect fliers at other airports. \n \n MORE: Storm snarls flights in Chicago, Midwest \n \n Southwest Airlines, which canceled all of its flights out of its Midway hub after 4:30 p.m. Thursday, was anticipating normal operations Friday morning in Chicago. \n \n United Airlines also planned to operate a full schedule, though spokeswomen for both airlines cautioned travelers to check their flight status before heading to the airport. \n \n American Airlines cancelled flights scheduled to depart after 8 p.m. CT on Thursday. \n \n The snowstorm walloped Iowa, where almost a foot of snow has fallen in Des Moines. State police said a 25-vehicle pileup killed at least two people, and across Iowa 30,900 customers were without power Thursday, including more than 25,000 in the Des Moines area. \n \n The storm dropped as much as 13 inches of snow on portions of central Iowa, paralyzed travel, knocked out power to scores of people and closed schools, government offices and businesses across the state. \n \n ""It\'s just awful out there,"" Capt. Mike Winter of the Iowa State Patrol said. ""People need to just stay home."" \n \n The storm made travel difficult from Kansas to Wisconsin, forcing road closures, including a 120-mile stretch of Interstate 35 from Ames, Iowa through Albert Lea, Minnesota. \n \n Most major roads across Iowa remained closed either by official order or impassible due to snow and ice buildup late Thursday. \n \n The Iowa State Patrol said at least 88 crashes occurred on highways and interstate systems Wednesday night through Thursday afternoon. There were also at least 164 emergency calls from the public and 161 motorist assists. \n \n On the southern edge of the storm system, tornadoes destroyed several homes in Arkansas and peeled the roofs from buildings, toppled trucks and blew down oak trees and limbs Alabama. \n \n In southeastern Wisconsin, where a blizzard warning was in effect, sheriff\'s officials said slick conditions led to at least two fatalities late Wednesday when a driver lost control of his car in Rock County, about 90 miles northwest of Chicago. \n \n The weather service was forecasting ""thundersnow"" in Milwaukee and the surrounding areas, where snow could fall at the rate of 2-3 inches an hour. \n \n Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker issued an executive order declaring a state of emergency, which put the state emergency government, National Guard, State Patrol and other agencies on high alert. \n \n At least two people in Nebraska died in crashes blamed on poor driving conditions, the State Patrol said. In many areas, drivers were being told to stay off the roads because of whiteout conditions. Most of I-80 in the state was closed. Nebraska\'s biggest school districts canceled classes, as did many districts across the region. \n \n In Utah, Washington County sheriff\'s detective Nate Abbott says the woman and a man were driving when their car got stuck in rural Washington County on Tuesday night during the storm that hit the Rocky Mountain region. \n \n He says the pair started walking for help, but the woman couldn\'t go any farther and sought shelter while the man continued on. Search-and-rescue teams later found her body. \n \n Although the Plains and Midwest could do without the travel headaches, precipitation should be welcome. \n \n More than 93% of the high Plains region and 54% of the Midwest are enduring drought conditions, according to Thursday\'s U.S. Drought Monitor, a federal website that tracks drought. \n \n Out west, the leading edge of a powerful storm system arrived in Washington, Oregon and Northern California. Rain is expected across Northern California from late Thursday through the weekend, with heavy snow possible in the Sierra Nevada range as the system moves east. \n \n Four to seven feet of snow is forecast to fall above 7,000 feet, prompting the U.S. Forest Service to issue an avalanche warning for Mount Shasta. \n \n Contributing: Ben Mutzabaugh, USA TODAY; Michael Winter, USA TODAY; the Associated Press; The Des Moines Register \n \n Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/RHTLA8', ""Uber said it protects you from spying.

Those revelations could be especially relevant now that Uber has begun collecting location information even after a trip ends. \n \n Spangenberg is suing the San Francisco-based ride-hailing behemoth for age discrimination (he’s 45) and whistleblower retaliation. He has worked information security jobs for a variety of tech companies. Uber tasked him with helping develop security procedures and responding to problems from around the world. \n \n In addition to the security vulnerabilities, Spangenberg said Uber deleted files it was legally obligated to keep. And during government raids of foreign Uber offices, he said the company remotely encrypted its computers to prevent authorities from gathering information. \n \n After beginning in March 2015, Spangenberg said he frequently objected to what he believed were reckless and illegal practices, and Uber fired him 11 months later. \n \n “I also reported that Uber’s lack of security, and allowing all employees to access this information (as opposed to a small security team) was resulting in a violation of governmental regulations regarding data protection and consumer privacy rights,” he stated in the declaration, referring to requirements that companies notify consumers of any breach of personal information. \n \n Michael Sierchio, a tech industry veteran who was a senior security engineer at Uber from early 2015 until June of this year, agreed that Uber had particularly weak protections for private information. \n \n “When I was at the company, you could stalk an ex or look up anyone’s ride with the flimsiest of justifications,” he said. “It didn’t require anyone’s approval.” \n \n DONATE \n \n In a statement, Uber said it maintains strict policies to protect customer data and comply with legal proceedings. It acknowledged that it had fired employees for improper access, putting the number at “fewer than 10.” \n \n “We have hundreds of security and privacy experts working around the clock to protect our data,” Uber said in a statement. \n \n “This includes enforcing strict policies and technical controls to limit access to user data to authorized employees solely for purposes of their job responsibilities, and all potential violations are quickly and thoroughly investigated,” the company said. \n \n Uber would not give more details on its technical controls. In practice, the security sources said, Uber’s policy basically relies on the honor system. Employees must agree not to abuse their access. But the company doesn’t actually prevent employees from getting and misusing the private information in the first place, the security sources said. \n \n As Uber has rapidly grown to more than 40 million users worldwide, the gig-economy giant has also been dogged by leaks, hacks and privacy scandals. \n \n In 2014, BuzzFeed reported that an Uber official had tracked its reporter’s movements without her permission, around the same time another executive suggested digging up dirt on critical journalists. The controversy – and an entrepreneur’s claim that he was tracked as well – drew attention to the company’s internal God View tool, which provided a real-time aerial view of Uber cars in a city and details of who was inside of them. \n \n It later came out that a data breach that year exposed the personal information of more than 100,000 drivers. \n \n After the embarrassments of 2014, Uber hired chief security officer Joe Sullivan, a prominent tech figure who previously held that post at Facebook and used to be a federal prosecutor. His team drew heavily from Facebook, including chief information security officer John “Four” Flynn. \n \n The Federal Trade Commission, the consumer protection agency, is investigating Uber’s information security practices and recently deposed Sullivan, according to security sources. \n \n Spangenberg and Sierchio – as well as three other former Uber security professionals granted anonymity to confirm their accounts – describe a startup culture that pushed back against security protections in favor of unbridled growth. \n \n “Early on, ‘growth at all costs’ was the mantra, so you can imagine that security was an afterthought,” said Sierchio, whose tech career includes designing video games for Atari in the early 1980s. \n \n Even after Uber assembled a security team, the pushback continued when employees raised concerns, he said. \n \n “One of the things I was told is, ‘It’s not a security company,’” Sierchio said. Spangenberg said he was told the same thing. \n \n As disclosures about God View sizzled on the internet in 2014, the company posted a statement saying that, “Uber has a strict policy prohibiting all employees at every level from accessing a rider or driver’s data. The only exception to this policy is for a limited set of legitimate business purposes.” \n \n Lawmakers, including Sen. Al Franken, D-Minnesota, demanded details about those “legitimate business purposes.” Franken later wrote he was “concerned about the surprising lack of detail in their response.” \n \n Sierchio, who said he was pushed out in June, said the company’s policy limiting access was “never enforced.” \n \n After an investigation by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, Uber settled in January and promised to “limit access” to real-time trip data “to designated employees with a legitimate business purpose.” \n \n Even after the attorney general settlement, Spangenberg and Sierchio said thousands of employees could still search Uber’s database to get real-time ride information. The company said it complies with the settlement. \n \n Uber did adopt some reforms. There was a pop-up message warning employees that their activity was being monitored, but few took it seriously, Spangenberg said. Another change flagged searches for customers considered “MVPs.” But that didn’t protect anyone not labeled an MVP, Spangenberg said. \n \n It also changed the name of God View to Heaven View, Spangenberg said. \n \n Don't miss the next big story. Brave investigations that change minds, laws and lives. Emailed directly to you. \n \n An internal audit team searched for abnormalities in all the database activity to nab employees tracking customer data illicitly, said Spangenberg, who assisted the investigations. Those they caught were referred to HR to be fired, he said. \n \n “If you knew what you were doing, you could get away with it forever,” Spangenberg said. “The access is always there, so it was a matter of whether you got caught in the noise.” \n \n Many employees, Uber said, need access for reasons such as providing customer refunds and investigating traffic accidents. The company added that it blocks some teams of employees from getting the data without approval, though it did not specify which teams or how the approval process works. \n \n Drivers’ personal details, including Social Security numbers, were also available to all Uber employees, Spangenberg said in his declaration. \n \n Spangenberg said he argued for shutting off access to sensitive data for those who didn’t need it. \n \n “I would say, ‘We can’t keep this information, you can’t allow this information to be stored like this, you can’t leave it all connected like this,’” he said. \n \n Uber, in its statement, said, “We have made significant investment in tightening our access controls during the past several years. Allegations that simply acknowledging our policy in a pop-up window would provide access to customer data for unauthorized employees are not correct in our current environment.” \n \n According to his lawsuit, Uber told Spangenberg he was fired for violating a code of conduct and reformatting his computer, which erases everything on it. He said he deleted and began rebuilding his laptop because it had crashed, and that it was common practice. \n \n He also got in trouble for accessing emails that dealt with his own job performance review. Spangenberg said he was only testing out a program to search company emails. The whole thing was a pretext, he said, to get rid of him. \n \n In court filings, Uber responded that it “generally denies each and every allegation” made by Spangenberg. \n \n Spangenberg accuses Uber of destroying information he believed it was obligated to preserve. “Uber routinely deleted files which were subject to litigation holds, which was another practice I objected to,” his declaration says. \n \n A company can face legal penalties or be held in contempt of court for scrubbing evidence it was supposed to keep. \n \n Among his duties, Spangenberg said he was also a point person when foreign government agencies raided company offices abroad. \n \n “Uber would lock down the office and immediately cut all connectivity so that law enforcement could not access Uber’s information,” his declaration states. \n \n In May 2015, for example, the tax agency Revenu Quebec raided Uber’s Montreal office to gather evidence of tax evasion. Spangenberg said he worked from San Francisco to encrypt the office’s computers. \n \n “My job was to just make sure that any time a laptop was seized, the protocol locked the laptops up,” he said. \n \n Indeed, Quebec investigators – armed with a warrant to copy information from Uber computers – went back to a judge to say the computers had been remotely restarted and apparently encrypted, according to court records. They got permission to take the computers with them, but the machines are of little value if the information on them stays encrypted. \n \n Efforts to encrypt data once a government search is in process “raises red flags and serious concerns,” said Judith Germano, a cybersecurity expert and former federal prosecutor. \n \n A company could argue it was protecting sensitive information, she said. But if a judge determined it was a deliberate effort to hide evidence, the judge could impose legal sanctions or fines, and order the company to decrypt the data. \n \n In its statement, Uber said, “We’ve had robust litigation hold procedures in place from our very first lawsuit to prevent deletion of emails relevant to ongoing litigation.” Uber said it has an obligation to protect personal information and that “we cooperate with authorities when they come to us with appropriate legal process.” \n \n Uber challenged the Quebec search warrants in court, but in May, a Canadian judge wrote in French that Uber’s actions had “all the characteristics of an attempt to obstruct justice,” suggesting that “Uber wanted to shield evidence of its illegal conduct.” Uber is still appealing. \n \n Looking back, Spangenberg describes a tangle of questionable practices and gaping vulnerabilities. \n \n “The only information, truthfully, that I ever felt was safe inside of Uber is your credit card information,” he said. “Because it’s not stored by Uber.”""]",3,"– Seven people died across four states as a winter storm continued to tear through the Midwest, dumping more than a foot of snow on sections of Iowa and Wisconsin. A 25-car pileup in Iowa killed two people, and nearly 100 accidents were reported in the state by late last night. Kansas, Wisconsin, and Nebraska also suffered deaths, the AP reports. Weather warnings are in effect in 17 states spanning the lower 48, from Washington to Maine.

235,"[""Tokyo condemns ‘absolutely unacceptable’ provocation, as Pyongyang reacts to imposition of new UN sanctions following missile tests \n \n We will sink Japan and turn US to 'ashes and darkness', says North Korea \n \n North Korea has threatened to sink Japan and said the US should be “beaten to death like a rabid dog” after the two countries spearheaded fresh UN security council sanctions in response to the regime’s recent nuclear test. \n \n The Korea Asia-Pacific peace committee, which oversees North Korea’s relations with the outside world, described the UN security council, which passed a new round of sanctions on Monday, as a “tool of evil” in the pay of Washington, and called for it to be broken up. \n \n 'Quite backwards': Chinese tourists gawk at impoverished North Koreans Read more \n \n It is the first time that Pyongyang has issued an explicit threat to Japan since it fired a medium-range ballistic missile over the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido at the end of last month, triggering emergency sirens and mass text alerts. \n \n “The four islands of the [Japanese] archipelago should be sunken into the sea by the nuclear bomb of Juche,” the committee said in a statement carried by the official KCNA news agency. Juche is the ideology of self-reliance pioneered by Kim Il-sung, the country’s founder and grandfather of the current leader, Kim Jong-un. \n \n “Japan is no longer needed to exist near us,” the committee added. \n \n The 15-member security council voted unanimously in support of a US-drafted resolution condemning the missile test and imposing measures that include a ban on North Korean textile imports and restrictions on oil exports to the country. \n \n \n \n In response, the committee said the US should be “beaten to death like a rabid dog” for the “heinous sanctions resolution”. \n \n “Let’s reduce the US mainland into ashes and darkness. Let’s vent our spite with mobilisation of all retaliation means which have been prepared till now,” it said. \n \n Japan’s top government spokesman, Yoshihide Suga, described the statement as “extremely provocative and egregious”. \n \n He added: “It is something that markedly heightens regional tension and is absolutely unacceptable.” \n \n A new report has claimed that the detonation on 3 September of what North Korea claimed was a hydrogen bomb involved a device with an estimated yield of 250 kilotons – making it far more powerful than initially thought. \n \n The US-based 38 North website noted that the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organisation had revised upwards the seismic power created by the test from magnitude 5.8 to 6.1. \n \n How has North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme progressed this year? Read more \n \n It added: “This revision is significant because, rather than providing an equivalent yield of about 120 kilotons derived from the lower magnitude estimates, the application of standard formula with appropriate constants shows that the yield can now be estimated to have been roughly 250 kilotons (one quarter megaton). \n \n “Regardless of whether this most recent test was an operational warhead for an ICBM [intercontinental ballistic missile] or simply a device, the yield of the test clearly shows North Korean progress in increasing the yields of their nuclear weapons.” \n \n After weeks of heightened tensions and threats emanating from Pyongyang and Washington, there are signs that US and other officials may be attempting to engage the regime diplomatically. \n \n Play Video 2:10 UN Security Council steps up sanctions against N Korea – video \n \n Japan’s public broadcaster NHK claimed on Thursday that US and North Korean officials had met “secretly” on the sidelines of a security forum in Switzerland earlier this month. \n \n The report did not offer details, but said that Choe Kang-il, deputy director general for North American affairs at the North Korean foreign ministry, and Evans Revere, a former senior official at the state department, had raised North Korea’s ballistic missile and nuclear tests. \n \n While Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has refused to consider negotiations unless Pyongyang abandons its nuclear weapons programme, an MP has claimed that support is rising inside the governing Liberal Democratic party for possible engagement with the regime. \n \n Antonio Inoki, a former professional wrestler, said he had spoken to several unnamed LDP MPs who supported sending a delegation of Japanese parliamentarians to Pyongyang in an attempt to defuse tensions. \n \n In the court of Kim Jong-un: a ruthless, bellicose despot, but not mad Read more \n \n “We are seeing a situation where [Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un] is raising his fist, and the situation is escalating,” said Inoki, who met North Korea’s top diplomat, Ri Su-yong, and other officials during a trip to Pyongyang last week. “It’s important to see who can be the first to lower his fist and reduce tensions.” \n \n The 74-year-old, who has visited North Korea 32 times, said LDP lawmakers had become more receptive to the idea of dialogue. “The political wind has changed direction,” he said, adding that North Korean officials were receptive to the idea. “I made a proposal and was told they would be happy to receive such a delegation.” \n \n In another gesture apparently aimed at lowering the diplomatic temperature, South Korea’s government is considering an $8m (£6m) aid package for North Korea. \n \n Seoul suspended aid to North Korea, provided via UN agencies, after the regime conducted nuclear and missile tests in 2016. But under a proposal that could be approved next week, the South would provide $4.5m to a World Food Programme project to help infants and pregnant women, and $3.5m to Unicef, according to Yonhap news agency. \n \n “The government’s basic stance is that humanitarian assistance to those who are vulnerable in North Korea should be continued regardless of political considerations,” Yonhap quoted a unification ministry official in Seoul as saying. \n \n “Seoul plans to decide the details of the aid and its timing after taking into account the inter-Korean situation,” he added."", 'Once An Ancient Village, Soon An Entertainment Complex? \n \n Enlarge this image toggle caption Joe Raedle/Getty Images Joe Raedle/Getty Images \n \n As work began on one of the last pieces of undeveloped ground in Miami\'s fast-changing downtown, archaeologists uncovered the site of an American Indian village. It was already centuries old by the time Columbus arrived in the New World. \n \n The question now for the city and the developer of the planned entertainment complex is how much of the site will be preserved. \n \n To the untutored eye, the site doesn\'t make much of an impression at first. It\'s a series of six circles outlined by postholes cut in the bedrock. The circles are smaller versions of the Miami Circle, a similar site found 15 years ago and now preserved as a National Historic Landmark. \n \n The Miami Circle is believed to be a ceremonial site built by the Tequesta tribe. This new site is something different. Archaeologist Bob Carr says it appears to be the remains of a Tequesta village. \n \n ""This is probably the earliest prehistoric town plan ever found in eastern North America,"" says Carr, who oversaw the discovery of the Miami Circle. \n \n Enlarge this image toggle caption Greg Allen/NPR Greg Allen/NPR \n \n Carr was called in to survey this site, a 2-acre lot surrounded by high-rises. Nearby, one of Miami\'s electric rail cars passes overhead on elevated tracks. \n \n On the ground, the soil has been scraped down to expose the limestone bedrock. Carr walks to the first of the six circles he found, one he calls the Royal Palm Circle. It\'s 36 feet in diameter with a double set of holes curving into a circle. \n \n The postholes, Carr believes, anchored pine poles that formed the sides of structures, probably with thatched roofs, where the Tequesta lived, ate and slept. \n \n The Tequesta structures were elevated, Carr says. And he\'s found signs they were all connected with walkways — the equivalent of village streets. \n \n ""We suspect that what these probably represent are a series of boardwalks or elevated structures connecting these circular structures,"" Carr says, indicating a series of postholes lined up in straight lines. \n \n Carbon testing dates the site to 600 A.D. Carr says the Tequesta were still living in the area when the Spaniards arrived hundreds of years later. \n \n ""They probably encountered Ponce de Leon, who apparently did land somewhere near the Miami River,"" says Carr. ""Menendez, who was the founder of St. Augustine, also encountered them and set up the first European mission and fort at this same location."" \n \n After first contact with Europeans, the Tequesta demise happened quickly, Carr explains. Within 200 years, a population of thousands dwindled to less than 300. \n \n Carr found this first circle several years ago when he began working at the site. But then, with the real estate bust, the developer put the project on hold. \n \n Carr had been talking to the developer about possibly lifting and moving the Royal Palm Circle so it could be preserved and displayed. But when Carr resumed work here recently, he discovered the site contained more than another Miami Circle — it held an entire village. \n \n ""It wasn\'t really until probably September that we began to get an idea of the significance of the find there,"" says William Hopper, chairman of Miami\'s Historic and Environmental Preservation Board, the body that will decide how much — if any — of the Tequesta village should be preserved. \n \n Hopper says the board is just starting to explore its options. And, he notes, whatever action it takes may be appealed to Miami\'s City Commission. \n \n ""But we want to see what we can do to preserve as much of that as we can, so that people in future generations can have an understanding of what happened there at the mouth of the river,"" Hopper says. \n \n The developer that owns the site, the MDM Group, says it\'s pleased with the discoveries there. But it\'s still moving ahead with plans to build an upscale shopping complex. The company has said it has signed leases with tenants and plans to have it finished late next year. \n \n MDM is in discussions with city and county officials about the site, and scenarios for preserving all or part of it. \n \n Jeff Ransom, the Miami-Dade County archaeologist, has been in those meetings, and he\'s optimistic the site will be preserved. \n \n ""It needs to be preserved,"" he says. ""Development and cultural heritage can coexist in this case."" \n \n Ransom says the Tequesta village takes up just about half of the 2-acre site. It\'s possible the site can still be developed and the six prehistoric circles preserved — perhaps even featured in the project\'s lobby. \n \n But that would require the developer to redesign the final phase of a billion-dollar project and consider a question: How much is history worth?', '(LEAD) N. Korea invites S. Korean bizmen, officials to talks \n \n SEOUL, May 28 (Yonhap) -- In what appeared to be a conciliatory move, North Korea on Tuesday invited South Korean officials as well as businessmen for talks on reopening a suspended joint industrial complex in its territory.The joint industrial complex in the North\'s border city of Kaesong remains shut down since early April when the communist country withdrew all of its 53,000 workers hired by 123 small-size South Korean factories operating there.South Korea has since proposed working government-level talks to try to reopen the factory zone but North Korea has turned it down, demanding that Seoul should first address more fundamental issues such as joint military exercises with the U.S.On Tuesday, the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea, the North\'s arm for dealing with cross-border affairs with Seoul, said that Pyongyang is willing to start talks on the future of the industrial complex.In a statement issued by its unidentified spokesman, the committee noted that North Korea has already approved a plan by the South Korean business representatives to visit the industrial complex for maintenance and other purposes.""We have given permission for the visit and can even discuss the shipment of products at the industrial complex,"" it said, adding that if the South Korean entrepreneurs visit the North, discussions can be made on the normalization of the complex.The North\'s committee said it will fully guarantee safe passage of all South Koreans who would cross the border for the visit.""If the South feels uneasy, it can send members of the Kaesong Industrial District Management Committee with the businessmen,"" the statement said. The committee is not a government organization but represents the country\'s interests in Kaesong. Its chairman Hong Yang-ho is a former Ministry of Unification vice minister.South Korea\'s Unification Ministry, which handles inter-Korean affairs, was cautious in assessing the North\'s move, saying that government-level talks should be held first. It said business representatives have no authority to discuss the matter.Related to the proposal made, Yang Moo-jin, a political science professor at the University of North Korean Studies, said the North may be trying to abide by the promise it made to China through its special envoy, to engage in talks.North Korean leader Kim Jong-un\'s special envoy Choe Ryong-hae was in Beijing last week and promised to engage in dialogue with interested parties, including in the stalled six-party talks. Choe, the director of the General Political Bureau of North Korea\'s People\'s Army, met with Chinese President Xi Jinping and delivered Kim\'s personal message,""Pyongyang seems to be aiming to first hold talks with businessmen, followed by working level governmental talks that can pave the way for other exchanges,"" Yang speculated.In a separate statement, the North\'s committee criticized Seoul for banning the proposed joint civilian celebrations of the upcoming anniversary of the historic June 15, 1980 inter-Korean summit.""The participation of South Koreans in the event must be permitted and if Seoul is fearful of the gathering triggering internal discord, it can send government officials with the group,"" it said.Pro-unification civic activist groups from both Koreas had jointly marked the anniversary almost every year since the historic inter-Korean summit until a conservative government took office in Seoul in 2008.The sitting South Korean government of President Park Geun-hye barred this year\'s joint civilian celebration of the anniversary, saying that it could create discord among South Koreans.The two Koreas, which remain divided since 1945, are in a state of conflict, as they did not sign a peace treaty at the end of the 1950-53 Korean War.(END)']",3,"– North Korea has made more of the kind of blood-curdling threats that the world found easier to shrug off before Pyongyang stepped up its nuclear program. The ""Korea Asia-Pacific Peace Committee,"" North Korea's state agency for dealing with the outside world, issued a statement Thursday calling for the islands of Japan to be ""sunken into the sea"" with nuclear bombs and for the US mainland to be reduced to ""ashes and darkness,"" the Guardian reports. ""Japan is no longer needed to exist near us,"" said the committee's statement, which also called for the US to be ""beaten to death like a rabid dog"" and denounced the United Nations Security Council as a ""tool of evil."" The committee called for the breakup of the Security Council, which imposed its toughest-ever sanctions on North Korea earlier this week. It called the council a ""money-bribed"" group that does whatever the US asks it to. Before the sanctions vote, which passed the 15-member council unanimously, Pyongyang warned that the US would face the ""greatest pain"" in its history. Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said Pyongyang's threat to sink the country is ""extremely provocative and outrageous,"" the AP reports. The statement ""significantly escalates tension in the region and is absolutely unacceptable,"" he said Thursday. (The world may have underestimated Pyongyang's latest nuclear test.)"

(Associated Press) \n \n The two men dressed in white embraced warmly on the helipad in the gardens of Castel Gandolfo, where Benedict has been living since he stepped down Feb. 28 and became the first pope to resign in 600 years. \n \n In a series of gestures that ensued, Benedict made clear that he considered Francis to be pope while Francis made clear he considered his predecessor to be very much a revered brother and equal. They clasped hands repeatedly, showing one another the deference owed a pope in ways that surely turned Vatican protocol upside down. \n \n Traveling from the helipad to the palazzo, Francis sat on the right-hand side of the car, the traditional place of the pope, while Benedict sat on the left. When they entered the chapel inside the palazzo to pray, Benedict tried to direct Francis to the papal kneeler at the front of the chapel, but Francis refused. \n \n ""No, we are brothers,"" Francis told Benedict, according to the Vatican spokesman the Rev. Federico Lombardi. He said Francis wanted to pray together with Benedict, so the two used a different kneeler in the pews and prayed side-by-side. \n \n Francis also brought a gift to Benedict, an icon of the Madonna, and told him that it\'s known as the ""Madonna of Humility."" \n \n ""I thought of you,"" Francis told Benedict. ""You gave us so many signs of humility and gentleness in your pontificate."" Benedict replied: ""Grazie, grazie."" \n \n Benedict wore the simple white cassock of the papacy, with a quilted white jacket over it to guard against the chill, but minus the sash and cape worn by Francis. Walking with a cane, he looked frail compared to the robust 76-year-old Argentine. \n \n Outside the villa, the main piazza of Castel Gandolfo was packed with well-wishers bearing photos of both popes and chanting ""Francesco! Francesco!"" But the Vatican made clear they probably wouldn\'t see anything. \n \n The Vatican downplayed the remarkable reunion in keeping with Benedict\'s desire to remain ""hidden from the world"" and not interfere with his successor\'s papacy. There was no live coverage by Vatican television, and only a short video and still photos were released after the fact. \n \n The Vatican spokesman said the two spoke privately for 40-45 minutes, followed by lunch with the two papal secretaries, but no details were released. \n \n All of which led to enormous speculation about what these two popes might have said to one another after making history together: Benedict\'s surprise resignation paved the way for the first pope from Latin America, the first Jesuit, and the first to call himself Francis after the 13th century friar who devoted himself to the poor, nature and working for peace. \n \n That the former Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio was second only to Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger in the 2005 conclave that elected Ratzinger pope has only added to the popular imagination about how these two popes of such different style, background and priorities might get along. \n \n Perhaps over their primo, or pasta course during Saturday\'s lunch, they discussed the big issues facing the church: the rise of secularism in the world, the drop in priestly vocations in Europe, the competition that the Catholic Church faces in Latin America and Africa from evangelical Pentecostal movements. \n \n During their secondo, or second course of meat or fish, they might have gone over more pressing issues about Francis\' new job: Benedict left a host of unfinished business on Francis\' plate, including the outcome of a top-secret investigation into the leaks of papal documents last year that exposed corruption and mismanagement in the Vatican administration. Francis might have wanted to sound Benedict out on his ideas for management changes in the Holy See administration, a priority given the complete dysfunctional government he has inherited. \n \n Over coffee, they might have discussed future of Monsignor Georg Gaenswein, Benedict\'s trusted aide who has had the difficult task of escorting his old pope into retirement and then returning to the Vatican to serve his successor in the initial rites of the office. \n \n Gaenswein, who wept as he and Benedict made their final goodbyes to staff in the papal apartment on Feb. 28, has appeared visibly upset and withdrawn at times as he has been by Francis\' side. The Vatican has said Francis\' primary secretary will be Monsignor Alfred Xuereb, who had been the No. 2 secretary under Benedict. \n \n Both Xuereb and Gaenswein were present for lunch. Start to finish, the meeting lasted about 2 1/2 hours, with Benedict escorting Francis back to the helipad for the ride back to the Vatican. \n \n Benedict\'s resignation _ and his choices about his future _ have raised the not-insignificant question of how the Catholic Church will deal with the novel situation of having one reigning and one retired pope living side-by-side, each of them called ""pope,"" each of them wearing papal white and even sharing the same aide in Gaenswein. \n \n Before Benedict announced his decision to be known as ""emeritus pope,"" one of the Vatican\'s leading canon lawyers, the Jesuit Rev. Gianfranco Ghirlanda, penned an article suggesting that such a title would be inappropriate for Benedict since in renouncing the papacy he had ""lost all the power of primacy"" conferred on him by his election as pope. \n \n The alternate title _ which Vatican officials had suggested would be likely be chosen _ was that of ""emeritus bishop of Rome,"" since bishops routinely retire and are known as ""emeritus bishops."" \n \n But Benedict opted instead for ""emeritus pope,"" ""Your Holiness"" and also chose to keep wearing the white cassock of the papacy, leading to questions about both his own influence on the future pontiff and whether Catholics more favorable to his traditional style might try to undermine his successor\'s authority and agenda by keeping their allegiance to the old pope. \n \n Clearly aware of that potential, Benedict in his very last meeting with his cardinals on Feb. 28 pledged his ""unconditional reverence and obedience"" to the then-unknown future pope, who was nevertheless in the room. \n \n Lombardi said he understood Benedict repeated that pledge of obedience to Francis on Saturday. Asked how the popes addressed one another, Lombardi demurred, saying he didn\'t think they addressed one another as ""Your Holiness"" or ""Pope,"" saying the exchange was too familiar and warm for such titles. \n \n After a few months in Castel Gandolfo, Benedict is to return to the Vatican to live in a converted monastery in the Vatican gardens, just a short walk from St. Peter\'s Basilica and the shrine devoted to the Madonna where Francis went to pray on one of his first walks as pope. \n \n Despite Benedict\'s expressed intent to fade away, Francis on virtually every occasion afforded him has made clear he has no intention of letting his ""venerable predecessor"" disappear from memory: Francis called Benedict right after his election, urged prayers for him in his first papal Masses, and called the former Joseph Ratzinger to congratulate him on the feast of St. Joseph on March 19. \n \n The Vatican has similarly made clear that the ex-pope hasn\'t completely lost interest in the matters of the church, following on television Francis\'s inaugural appearance on the balcony of St. Peter\'s Basilica after his election, when he charmed the crowd with a simple ""Brothers and sisters, good evening."" \n \n The two men couldn\'t be more different in style and background: The Argentine-born Francis has made headlines with his simple gestures _ no papal regalia, simple black shoes, paying his own hotel bill _ and basic message that a pope\'s job is to protect the poor. \n \n As archbishop of Buenos Aires, the former Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio worked in the slums, celebrating Masses for prostitutes and drug addicts. He plans to celebrate Holy Thursday Mass this week at a juvenile detention center, where he will wash the feet of 12 inmates in a show of humility echoing that of Jesus. \n \n The German-born Benedict is an academic, one of the world\'s leading theologians who spent more than 30 years in the frescoed halls of the Vatican where he was its chief doctrinal watchdog and then its pope. His primary concern was to remind Christians in Europe of their faith and bring back a more traditional Catholic identity, and with it many of the brocaded trappings of the papacy. His Holy Thursday Masses included the traditional foot-washing, but it involved clerics at the St. John Lateran basilica. \n \n While there is a difference in style, there is a ""radical"" convergence between the two men in terms of their spirituality, according to Civilta Cattolica, the Italian Jesuit magazine whose articles are approved by the Vatican before publication. \n \n ""They are two figures of the highest spirituality, whose relationship with life is completely anchored in God,"" the magazine wrote. ""This radicalness is shown in Pope Benedict\'s shy and kind bearing, and in Pope Francis it is revealed by his immediate sweetness and spontaneity."" \n \n ___ \n \n Nicole Winfield reported from Vatican City. \n \n ___ \n \n Follow Nicole Winfield at www.twitter.com/nwinfield', 'Media caption The BBC\'s Alan Johnson: ""We will never know the details of their talks"" \n \n Newly elected Pope Francis has met his predecessor for lunch, the first time such a meeting has been possible for more than 600 years. \n \n Pope Francis was flown by helicopter to Castel Gandolfo for the private lunch with Pope Emeritus Benedict. \n \n Benedict has lived at the lakeside castle south of Rome since last month, when he became the first pope in six centuries to resign, citing ill health. \n \n Cardinal Jorge Maria Bergoglio was elected to succeed him on 13 March. \n \n No known precedent \n \n There was no official communique on the results of the Pope\'s brief lunchtime visit to Castel Gandolfo, says the BBC\'s David Willey in Rome. \n \n Analysis There had been intense speculation about how Vatican protocol would deal with the first face to face meeting since the election of Pope Francis between the new Pope and the retired Pope. It was a carefully calculated mixture of formality and informality. Emeritus Pope Benedict embraced his luncheon guest on Pope Francis\' arrival at the helipad at the papal summer villa at Castel Gandolfo, which has become Benedict\'s temporary home. Benedict, who stepped down from the papacy at the end of February, wore a white padded jacket and looked rather frail in comparison to 76-year-old Pope Francis, nine years his junior. The two white-clad clerics then prayed together in the villa\'s private chapel where Pope Francis insisted on kneeling side by side with his predecessor, rather than using the padded papal kneeler prepared for him. ""No! we are brothers, we pray together!"" Francis told Benedict in a gesture of humility. \n \n On the agenda, some delicate handover details, including a top secret document prepared by the former pope on last year\'s scandal involving leaked documents, our correspondent adds. \n \n The new head of the Catholic Church is usually elected after the death of his predecessor, and there is no public record of any previous meeting between an incumbent pope and a former pope. \n \n In 1294, former hermit Celestine V resigned after five months as pope. Boniface VIII was elected days later, and had his predecessor imprisoned. Celestine was dead within a year. \n \n In contrast, Pope Francis has spoken warmly of his predecessor. \n \n One of his first acts as Pope was to call Benedict at Castel Gandolfo, where the former pontiff had been following proceedings on television. \n \n The pope emeritus is expected to stay on at the papal summer residence until new accommodation being prepared for him inside the walls of Vatican City is ready at the end of April. \n \n For his part, Pope Francis will begin the Church\'s most important liturgical season on Sunday with a Palm Sunday Mass in St Peter\'s Square. \n \n He will then lead six more liturgies during the week, culminating with the Easter Sunday Mass and Urbi et Orbi blessing. \n \n New style \n \n The new Pope chose the name Francis in honour of St Francis of Assisi - the 13th Century Italian saint who spurned a life of luxury to work with the poor. \n \n He has called for the Roman Catholic Church to be closer to ordinary people, especially the poor and disadvantaged. \n \n Castel Gandolfo retreat Picturesque lakeside ""castle town"" in the Alban hills, 15 miles (24km) south-east of Rome \n \n Dates back to the 17th Century; its gardens occupy the site of a residence of the Roman Emperor Domitian \n \n Benedict is staying at the palace while a permanent residence is readied inside the Vatican City walls \n \n He has a staff of two secretaries and four women helpers, and is guarded by Vatican police officers \n \n And, only 10 days into his pontificate, he has made some subtle but significant changes in the lifestyle of the leader of the Roman Catholic Church, says our correspondent. \n \n He dresses very simply, preferring to wear plain black shoes under a simple white habit rather than the red leather loafers and ermine-trimmed cape worn by his predecessor. \n \n The first Latin American Pope spurned a special car to take a bus with his cardinals after he was elected, and insisted on returning to his Rome hotel the next day to pay his own bill. \n \n And Pope Francis places himself on the same level as his guests, rather than greeting them from a throne on an elevated platform, which is seen as a powerful gesture after centuries of Vatican pomp. \n \n The former archbishop of Buenos Aires has also started inviting guests to his early morning Mass - including Vatican gardeners, street sweepers, kitchen staff and maids working at the hotel where he is currently staying.', 'Centenarians, people 100 years or older, are more likely to die of pneumonia or as a result of frail health than from cancer or heart disease, compared with ""younger"" elderly adults, according to the results of a new study. \n \n The study also revealed that people who reach their 100th birthday and beyond were most likely to die in a residential care home (61 percent) or hospital (27 percent), and less likely to die at home (10 percent) or in hospice (0.2 percent), said Catherine Evans, clinical lecturer on palliative care at King\'s College London, one of the study\'s authors. \n \n Centenarians are a rapidly growing demographic group worldwide, projected to reach more than 3.2 million by 2050, Evans said. In the United Kingdom, the number of centenarians has doubled every 10 years since 1956, and is estimated to reach more than half a million by 2066. \n \n ""Despite the worldwide increase in the number of centenarians, few studies have considered the health and social care needs of older adults,"" she told Live Science. ""The rising number of centenarians, coupled with continued use of hospital care at the end of life, indicates an urgent need to ensure adequate long-term care and responsive community care services to support people living to advanced age."" \n \n The researchers used data on deaths from the Office for National Statistics for England from 2001 to 2010, which included information on socioeconomic status of the region, place of residence and care- home bed capacity. The number of centenarian deaths in England per year increased by 56 percent over that 10-year period, from 2,823 to 4,393, Evans said. [Extending Life: 7 Ways to Live Past 100] \n \n The median age of the nearly 36,000 people in the study — of whom 87 percent were women — was 101 at the time of death. The proportion of people who died in the hospital changed little over time, despite the increased number of centenarians. \n \n The data also indicated that most elderly people would prefer to die not in a hospital, but rather in an environment where they are surrounded by familiarity, autonomy and loved ones, Evans said. \n \n Evans added that in order to reduce centenarians\' reliance on hospital care at the end of life, the response must be proactive rather than reactive. ""There needs to be a greater emphasis on anticipatory care with contingency planning that details treatments and interventions when an unanticipated, or sentinel, event occurs,"" she said. ""A chest infection, for example, can be managed at home with oral antibiotics and comfort care, rather than in the hospital with intravenous antibiotic treatment."" \n \n Increasing the number of beds in residential care homes may also reduce reliance on in-patient hospital stays for people with extreme longevity, Evans noted. ""Better health care provisions could enable people to remain in their usual residence and reduce hospital admission — a major cost driver in end of life care."" \n \n The study is published online today (June 3) in the journal PLOS Medicine. \n \n Follow Live Science @livescience, Facebook & Google+.

We do not know how the powers of the Catalan government could be affected."" \n \n Where does this leave the Catalan leader? \n \n Mr Puigdemont said in a letter to Mr Rajoy on Thursday morning that the independence declaration remained suspended but this could change. \n \n ""If the government continues to impede dialogue and continues with the repression, the Catalan parliament could proceed, if it is considered opportune, to vote on a formal declaration of independence."" \n \n But he faces an uphill struggle - it is likely that senior figures in charge of internal security in Catalonia could be dismissed, and control of the region\'s police force could pass to Madrid. \n \n The regional parliament could also be dissolved. \n \n Image copyright Reuters Image caption Tough choices: How will Carles Puigdemont (L) answer Mariano Rajoy\'s ultimatum? \n \n One Spanish newspaper has reported that Mr Puigdemont might nominally remain in his job but Madrid would aim to take control of many of his duties and powers. \n \n Ultimately the process could end in regional elections but the Spanish constitution does not impose any time limit.']",4,"– It's a Catholic first: A sitting pope met with his predecessor today.

238,"[""Gov. Scott Walker will become the final top-tier candidate to join the GOP battle for the White House when he announces his bid from Wisconsin on Monday. \n \n Walker enters the race as the favorite to win Iowa’s caucuses and with high polling numbers and plenty of grassroots enthusiasm. \n \n He is a natural fit for the Iowa contest as a social and fiscal conservative from an adjacent state. And his appeal came into sharp focus when he captivated an Iowa audience in January with the tale of his battle against Wisconsin’s labor unions. \n \n But there are plenty of doubts, too, when it comes to whether Walker can be the GOP nominee. \n \n He faces a charisma question and is seen by some critics as a vanilla candidate from the Midwest who lacks the “wow” factor — the same liability that capsized the GOP candidacy of former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty in 2012. \n \n While competing with more exuberant rivals such as Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Donald Trump, Walker must show he can appeal to wide swathes of voters. \n \n He also must show he is ready for prime-time after stumbling earlier this year in national interviews over foreign policy, at one point comparing his battles with Wisconsin’s unions to how he’d take on Islamic terrorists. \n \n “This is the major leagues and the intensity is only going to get ramped up everyday,” says GOP strategist Matt Mackowiak. “He has to prove he can perform at a high level over the long haul.” \n \n A win in Iowa is the first crucial test, but it won’t guarantee his nomination. The last two winners of the Iowa GOP caucuses — former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee in 2008 and former Sen. Rick Santorum (Pa.) in 2012 — have faded in the primary contests that followed. \n \n “He’s clearly the frontrunner and there’s a lot of interest in him here,” said Craig Robinson, the former political director for the Iowa Republican Party. “But he still has a lot of work to do.” \n \n Following his presidential announcement at the Waukesha County Expo Center, Walker will spend one day each in Nevada, South Carolina and New Hampshire, before beginning an all-out blitz in Iowa that includes 11 stops over three days. \n \n He’ll be traveling the state in a Winnebago – the motor-homes manufacturer is based in Iowa – and he’s charted a course that will eventually take him to all 99 of the state’s counties. \n \n The Washington Post reports that following Walker’s initial Iowa blitz, he’ll begin campaigning in states with primaries and caucuses in early March, including Georgia, Tennessee, Illinois, Missouri and North Carolina. \n \n Walker trails Florida Gov. Jeb Bush in polls in New Hampshire, and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) — who Walker has said would be a good vice presidential candidate on his ticket — is believed to be setting up a firewall in South Carolina. \n \n That raises the importance for Walker in winning Iowa and then bottling that momentum. \n \n “He has to win or show well in Iowa,” said GOP strategist Ford O’Connell. “If he doesn’t, he’s in real trouble.” \n \n \n \n Republicans laud Walker as a candidate with cross-party appeal, saying he has the potential to draw on Tea Party conservatives, social conservatives and establishment-minded Republicans. \n \n His fight against public sector unions has been front and center in his campaign. \n \n “It’s got to be the cornerstone of his pitch,” said O’Connell. “It’s got to be his bloody rallying cry that the liberals came after him three times with everything they had and he never wavered. “ \n \n Still, Republicans warn Walker against leaning too heavily on that one achievement. \n \n \n \n “It’s not enough,” said Robinson. “You can’t run solely on your biography, and so far, he’s been almost solely focused on that.” \n \n \n \n Republicans say he will need to find traction in other aspects of his record, particularly if he’s to go head-to-head with Bush. \n \n On the stump, where observers say Walker is getting better and better, he’s begun to broaden his argument. \n \n At the Republican Party’s Lincoln Day Dinner in suburban Detroit in May, Walker sought to highlight reforms he’s championed as governor. \n \n Walker said he cut taxes in Wisconsin by $2 billion, cut back on regulations, turned a $3.6 billion budget deficit into a half-billion dollar surplus, fully funded the state’s pension system and reduced unemployment from 9.2 percent to 4.6 percent, while achieving one of the highest labor participation rates in the country at 68 percent. \n \n \n \n “We transformed everything,” Walker declared. \n \n He has boasted about defunding Planned Parenthood in the state, signed concealed carry laws and enacted stricter voter ID laws. \n \n He also has re-upped his fight with labor unions, signing right-to-work legislation that bans the requirement that private-sector workers pay labor dues. \n \n Still, Walker’s record will come under fresh scrutiny. \n \n \n \n Republicans say he’ll need to be prepared to respond to criticism that he has flip-flopped on immigration reform and ethanol subsidies, while tacking to the right on abortion and same-sex marriage in an effort to appeal to social conservatives. \n \n Walker will also need to put forth concrete policy proposals, Republicans say, to match Rubio and other senators who are viewed as stronger on foreign policy. \n \n “He’s going to get pushed on this in the debates, and he’ll have to be confident and clear on his positions,” said Mackowiak. \n \n Bush and Rubio will loom over the primaries as Walker’s top competition, and his campaign appears to be readying for a protracted fight. \n \n After Iowa, Republicans say he’ll either be a frontrunner with a huge victory under his belt or a diminished former high-flyer struggling to hold on. \n \n \n \n “He’s starting off with a lot of chips on the table in Iowa,” said Mackowiak. \n \n Read more from The Hill: \n \n Walker announces: 'I'm running for president'"", 'Wisconsin Gov.

Instead, things here in Madison have been in turmoil for months — a complication for a governor building his presidential candidacy around his ability to get things done. Walker has spent much of the year feuding not only with Democrats — a fight he relishes — but also with fellow Republicans over proposals such as the Bucks’ arena. \n \n GOP lawmakers who usually work with him in lock step are questioning his budget priorities. Walker’s popularity also has fallen statewide, even as he pulls to the front of the crowded GOP presidential field nationally. Democrats, meanwhile, accuse Walker of using the budget and other issues to bolster his national résumé ahead of his 2016 run. \n \n “It was put together by the governor to help his presidential prospects with the most far-right-wing group of his party, and it reflects those values perfectly,” state Rep. Andy Jorgensen, a Democrat, said at a news conference last week. “I suspect that’s why he’s leading in Iowa. He’s at the top of the polls there . . . but in Wisconsin, meanwhile, he’s at 41 percent approval.” \n \n Walker introduced his two-year budget — dubbed “Our Freedom and Prosperity proposal” — in a speech in early February that sounded more like an audition for president than a fiscal road map. He promised to “help restore that American Dream right here in Wisconsin” by continuing to lower property taxes, freeze college tuition, consolidate economic development operations and reduce the size of the state government. \n \n For months, Walker confidently said he would not launch his presidential campaign until completing the budget, which he expected to do in June. Instead, lawmakers spent most of the month deadlocked. \n \n There wasn’t enough cash to pay for everything they wanted to do, partly the result of increasing costs, $2 billion in tax breaks since Walker took office and a stalled economy. And with Walker exerting less influence, other Republicans have been jockeying for power and leverage. For a month, Republican leaders canceled all public budget meetings and instead met behind closed doors. Meanwhile, Walker loosened the timing of his presidential announcement, saying it is not unusual for the budget process to drag on for so long. \n \n In an ad titled, ""Scott Walker for America,"" the Republican governor from Wisconsin said he\'s hoping to ""make our country great again."" (Scott Walker) \n \n The budget finally passed last week — saving Walker from embarrassment but giving him only a few days to review it and veto individual provisions before he signed it Sunday. \n \n Lawmakers presented Walker with red-meat legislation that he can brag about on the GOP campaign trail: right-to-work legislation, expansion of school-voucher use, repeal of a 48-hour waiting period for those looking to purchase guns, mandatory drug testing for food-stamp recipients and a ban on all abortions after 20 weeks. \n \n At the same time, Walker also had to retreat on a series of key issues, including abandoning plans to consolidate economic development operations and restructuring the University of Wisconsin system. \n \n The Bucks’ arena in particular put Walker at odds with fellow Republicans and local conservative radio hosts. Last year, longtime owner and former Democratic senator Herb Kohl sold the Bucks to New York hedge fund managers Marc Lasry, a major Democratic fundraiser, and Wesley Edens. The new owners agreed to keep the team in Wisconsin — but only if they got a new arena by 2017. \n \n Walker proposed in January that taxpayers split the cost of a new $500 million arena with the former and new owners. In the past, taxpayers helped pay for building complexes for the Milwaukee Brewers baseball team and the Green Bay Packers football team. But those teams are much more popular than the Bucks — Walker admitted that he had not been to a game in years — and Republicans questioned the major expense during a tough budget period. \n \n As time passed, the project became less and less popular. In early June, Walker tried an alternative argument: It would be cheaper in the long run to build the arena and keep the basketball team, along with the income taxes that the state collects from players, than to lose the Bucks to another state. \n \n “The price of doing nothing is not zero,” Walker said at a news conference, standing behind a sign reading: “Cheaper to keep them.” \n \n The sales pitch did not work. Several Republicans, especially those from rural areas far from Milwaukee, said they couldn’t support the project. Walker then tried to gather support from urban Democrats whom he largely had ignored for the past few years. Most Democrats have declined to take a stance, instead asking why the state has money for a new arena as it is slashing funding for schools. \n \n Finally, to get the budget through before Walker’s 2016 announcement, Republican legislative leaders decided to take the Bucks’ arena out of the budget and deal with it later. \n \n Another major stumbling block in the budget was transportation funding. Walker had proposed using $1.3 billion in loans to pay for highway projects, which several Republicans called financially irresponsible. Some suggested increasing car registration fees to generate some cash, but Walker refused to do that. \n \n “At some point, your credit card is maxed out, and you can’t do any more,” state Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R) said in a TV interview in early June. “When Governor Walker proposed $1.3 billion in borrowing — I just think that is irresponsible. . . . I would prefer to pay as we go. That’s a conservative position.” \n \n Lawmakers eventually agreed to a lower level of borrowing and to delay a number of projects. \n \n Late on the night of July 2, on the eve of the Independence Day weekend and two days into the new fiscal year, lawmakers were able to advance the budget out of committee. But then came a new controversy — an amendment gutting the state’s open-records law that had been slipped into the budget. \n \n The proposed change would have made Wisconsin’s law one of the most restrictive in the country, no longer allowing journalists, activists and others to request to see lawmakers’ e-mails and legislative drafting notes. Such a change, retroactive to July 1, also would have further protected Walker as he enters the presidential race and finds his record under greater scrutiny. \n \n For days, no one would take credit for the proposal. Then on Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald (R) outed the governor’s office for having helped draft it. \n \n Walker said in a radio interview Friday that although his office offered suggestions on the topic, the proposal “didn’t come from us.” \n \n The final complication came Wednesday evening, when the state Assembly was taking up the budget, as a bomb threat cleared the state capitol for several hours. \n \n Once the threat was cleared, lawmakers returned to their chamber to debate for several more hours, to pass the budget and then to send it to the governor. On Friday morning, Walker was asked on Sykes’s radio show to assess the budget that lawmakers rushed to get to him before his announcement. \n \n “All in all,” he said, “it’s pretty good.”', '11 months ago \n \n (CNN) – Former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, who along with President George W. Bush helped send the United States military action in Iraq and Afghanistan, said in an interview Wednesday the White House has yet to justify potential strikes in Syria. \n \n And he sharply criticized President Barack Obama’s administration for allowing details about that potential military action to become public before any decisions have been made. \n \n \n \n “I can’t imagine what they’re thinking, why they would want the Assad regime to have crystal clarity with respect to what they intend,” Rumsfeld said in an interview on the Fox Business Network. \n \n Obama told the ""PBS Newshour"" on Wednesday that he hadn’t yet made a final decision about U.S. military action in Syria, though U.S. officials have been cited widely in news reports pointing to cruise missile attacks on military facilities as a likely American response to alleged chemical weapons use by the Syrian regime. \n \n Acknowledging it was difficult to fully ascertain the administration’s thinking as an outsider, Rumsfeld maintained it was puzzling the amount of information that’s made its way to the public. \n \n ""The idea of demystifying for the enemy what you\'re going to do is mindless,” he said. \n \n Rumsfeld served a secretary of defense from 2001-2006, a period that saw the U.S. begin wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. He said in the interview, however, that current statements from Obama and his aides haven’t met the threshold for intervention in Syria. \n \n “There really hasn’t been any indication from the administration as to what our national interest is with respect to this particular situation,” he said. “When you think about what’s really important in that region – it’s Iran’s nuclear program and the relationship between Iran and Syria, the Assad regime, with respect to terrorists that go around killing innocent men, women and children, including Americans.” \n \n He added that Secretary of State John Kerry, who left the U.S. Senate earlier this year for the top diplomatic post, had been “dealt a bad hand” by his predecessor Hillary Clinton and Obama, who he claimed had created a global leadership void. \n \n “This administration has been in a withdrawal mode, an apology mode,” he said, adding: “That vacuum we’ve created is being filled by people that don’t have our values or interests.”']",3,"– Make room, GOPers: Scott Walker is running for president. ""I'm in. I'm running for president because Americans deserve a leader who will fight and win for them,"" he tweeted (this time for real) today. But for the Wisconsin governor—who dropped a ""barn-burner of a speech"" on February's CPAC and boasted he can take on ISIS—there are, as the Hill puts it, both ""high expectations and doubts."" What could boost his run: his record in Wisconsin on cutting taxes and unemployment, his strong stance against organized labor, and the potential to win Iowa's caucuses based on ""high polling numbers and plenty of grassroots enthusiasm,"" per the Hill. He's not a shoe-in, though. ""He's clearly the frontrunner and there’s a lot of interest in him here,” a former Iowa Republican Party official tells the paper. ""But he still has a lot of work to do."" Part of that work will involve breaking away from what the Hill calls his image ""as a vanilla candidate from the Midwest who lacks the 'wow' factor"" to compete with more engaging candidates. Other issues: The Hill notes that critics will go after his foreign policy weaknesses, as well as lob accusations that he's ""flip-flopped"" on immigration. He'll also have to defend fiscal problems back in Wisconsin, adds Washington Post, including an embarrassingly late budget and financing for a new stadium for the NBA's Milwaukee Bucks—a deal that's been called a ""hot mess."" Finally, Walker may need to break from what some see as a one-platform campaign focused on unions. ""You can't run solely on your biography, and so far, he’s been almost solely focused on that,"" the ex-IRP official tells the Hill. (Then there's Walker's lack of a college degree.)"

241,"['Buy Photo Genesee County health official Jim Henry was among those calling for the Flint system to be tested as a Legionella source. He said the county lacked the expertise to do so. (Photo: Karen Bouffard / The Detroit News)Buy Photo \n \n Flint — Sixteen months after it was identified as a likely source of a deadly Legionnaires’ outbreak, Flint’s water supply still hasn’t been tested for the Legionella bacteria. \n \n None of five government agencies aware of the outbreak in Genesee County investigated the water system for Legionella despite concerns raised by the county’s Health Department over the water as early as October 2014. That was six months after the city left Detroit’s system and began drawing its water from the Flint River. \n \n Experts say the lack of a water evaluation made it impossible to know if the city’s new water source contributed to the respiratory disease outbreak that sickened 87 people between May 2014 and November 2015, killing nine. And to date, no source for the bacteria has been determined. \n \n In March 2015, the state Department of Environmental Quality considered taking samples from Flint’s water system to be tested for Legionella at the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services’ laboratory. But neither agency followed through. \n \n That same month, the Environmental Protection Agency also suggested city water should be tested for Legionella during an EPA meeting about the outbreak and expressed that opinion to the DEQ in an email reviewed by The Detroit News. Again, no testing was done. \n \n Experts, including Marc Edwards, the Virginia Tech professor whose research uncovered the problem of lead contamination in Flint water, argue the municipal water should have been tested for Legionella because the outbreak could be tied to changes in the water system. Genesee County Environmental Health Supervisor Jim Henry also called for such testing. Experts say had the source of the Legionella been confirmed as the water system, targeted chlorine treatments could have been applied to kill the bacteria. \n \n “MDEQ should have done such testing, especially after they were alerted to Legionella problems by the Genesee County Health Department,” Edwards said. “Better yet, they should have allowed CDC to come in and do that testing for them.” \n \n Besides the state’s DEQ and health department, the federal EPA and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also confirm to The News they’ve done no water testing for Legionella in Flint. The Genesee County Health Department says it does not have the expertise to do so. \n \n The reasons why Flint’s water supply wasn’t tested aren’t entirely clear, although the local, state and federal agencies now largely blame each other or claim that typical procedures don’t involve testing municipal water supplies. \n \n State epidemiologist Shannon Johnson, in an October 2014 email to colleagues, wrote “the current hypothesis” was that “the source of the outbreak may be the Flint municipal water.” Johnson noted that county epidemiological mapping revealed most Legionnaires’ cases had occurred downstream of Flint’s municipal water plant, where chlorine and other bacteria-killing chemicals would be more diluted. \n \n “I let (the county health department) know that we could assist with and facilitate environmental testing, whether it be through our lab or DEQ,” Johnson wrote. \n \n Darren Lytle, acting chief of the Treatment Technology Evaluation Branch at the EPA in Cincinnati, also expressed concern that changes in Flint’s water system could be behind the outbreak during a meeting with federal colleagues on March 26, 2015, according to the meeting summary sent to the DEQ. \n \n “Maybe this isn’t happening in people’s homes, but it is happening in the distribution system pipes,” Lytle suggested to fellow EPA staffers. “First we must find the source — is Legionella there? If Legionella is present, in the tanks/pipes then disturbance of changing the water quality and flushing could cause it to proliferate.” \n \n At the same meeting, the EPA’s Miguel Del Toral added that extensive flushing then being done to address bacterial growth in stagnant water in parts of the system could also foster Legionella growth, according to meeting notes. \n \n Lytle offered to take municipal water samples and test them for Legionella. He noted the EPA had tested for Legionella at two Ohio hospitals as part of a research study, so a lab was already set up for Legionella testing. \n \n But the EPA never “received a request for assistance from the state, city or county” to get further involved, EPA spokeswoman Monica Lee told The News. \n \n Asked why the DEQ didn’t test then for Legionella in Flint, spokeswoman Mel Brown said the state health department was “the lead agency to look into the matter.” \n \n State had tests from patients \n \n In materials sent in conjunction with Gov. Rick Snyder’s Jan. 13 press conference announcing the outbreak, Michigan health officials said it was impossible to know if the cases were connected to Flint city water because of a “lack of clinical isolates” — samples of Legionella collected from patients. \n \n “There’s investigations still going on to try and make that determination,” Snyder said at that time when asked if the outbreak was linked to changes in Flint’s water system. “But from a scientific or medical point of view, I don’t believe that determination can be made today.” \n \n The state laboratory, in fact, had 12 clinical isolates from Legionnaires’ patients in Flint, the state health department confirmed. Of those isolates, molecular typing was completed on the eight that tested positive for Legionella. \n \n Investigators could then search for a DNA match in the environment. But since water samples were never were tested, there was nothing to compare the clinical isolates with. \n \n State health officials point to CDC guidelines as their reason for not sampling or testing Flint’s water system, or any other environmental source, for that matter. Health department spokeswoman Jennifer Eisner noted the CDC advises against testing the municipal water system, focusing instead on testing buildings that epidemiological studies indicate are associated with the outbreak. \n \n CDC spokesman Kristen Nordlund confirmed it “does not recommend routine testing of municipal water” for Legionella. \n \n “Because Legionella can grow to high levels and are spread to people by water systems inside buildings, we need building owners and managers in Michigan and elsewhere to ensure that they have programs in place that will prevent growth and spread,” Nordlund added. \n \n Michigan’s investigation was limited to results of epidemiological surveys of patients infected in each of two waves of the outbreak, the first from June 2014 through March 2015, and the second from May 2015 through November 2015. \n \n Based on results of the first study, state health officials concluded that Flint’s McLaren Medical Center was most strongly “associated” with the outbreak. Health officials wouldn’t name hospitals studied in the second survey. McLaren hired University of Pittsburgh microbiologist Janet Stout, one of the nation’s top experts in Legionnaires’ disease, to assess the situation at the hospital. She recommended remediation. \n \n Among the 12 Legionnaires isolates at the state laboratory, two were from McLaren, including one that tested positive for Legionella. Among a total of eight isolates that tested positive for the pathogen, one genetic match was found, between the McLaren isolate and one from Flint’s Hurley Medical Center. The other six did not match, indicating these were all different strains of Legionella bacteria. \n \n Results from the isolates suggested a need for testing throughout the water system, according to Amy Pruden, part of a team of Virginia Tech researchers studying water problems in Flint. \n \n “If they demonstrated that there were multiple strains infecting patients, then the bacteria likely originated from trace background levels at many locations in the distribution system or in building plumbing, where the water chemistry shift may have stimulated them to start growing,” Pruden said. \n \n “Given that Legionnaires’ is now the leading cause of illness spread by tap water, there is a need to be more responsive to outbreaks and better track the sources and causes of infection.” \n \n No fed help sought until ’16 \n \n According to Nordlund, the CDC was approached by Genesee County’s health department in February 2015 and the CDC “felt that a comprehensive investigation was warranted and offered to further assist Michigan by providing epidemiologic and laboratory support from Atlanta or in Michigan.” \n \n But the state health department “felt that they had the skills and resources needed to perform the investigation themselves,” Nordlund said. \n \n The state health department instead declared that the outbreak ended in March 2015, a finding released in June 2015, when more Legionnaires’ patients were being seen in area hospitals. \n \n It wasn’t until last month that the state health department asked the CDC for on-the-ground assistance in Flint, when the outbreak was made public by Snyder — 20 months after it started. The CDC is focusing its investigation at the building level, rather than investigating the municipal water system. \n \n “We felt we had enough capacity between our department and the Genesee County Health Department to conduct an investigation,” health department spokeswoman Angela Minicuci said. “We have never said that this is not related to the water. We have never discounted that theory.” \n \n According to Eisner, the state health department also believed it was up to the Genesee County Health Department to test the water for Legionella, if the county wanted it tested. \n \n The Genesee County Health Department feared the Legionella outbreak could be linked to changes in the municipal water system and alerted the state by October 2014. According to Henry, the county’s environmental health supervisor, county personnel didn’t have the expertise to test a municipal water system for Legionella, so they asked the state DEQ to investigate. \n \n Then-DEQ spokesman Brad Wurfel scorned Henry’s suspicion of city water in a March 13, 2015, email to Harvey Hollins, director the state Office of Urban and Metropolitan Initiatives, and a top Snyder aide. Hollins has since been tapped to lead the state’s response in Flint. The memo was copied to then DEQ Director Dan Wyant. \n \n “This is beyond irresponsible, given that this is his department that has failed to do the necessary traceback work to provide any conclusive evidence of where the outbreak is sourced,” Wurfel fumed. \n \n “ ... Legionnaires is NOT among the 90 water contaminants screened in the Safe Drinking Water Act, but in the absence of action by county health, our staff are now considering taking samples from various points in the system and working with (the health department’s) lab to test for it, if for no other reason than to rule it out.” \n \n According to Henry, the Genesee County Health Department was learning about the municipal water system on the fly. \n \n Henry said the state has primacy over municipal water systems. Counties oversee Type 2 wells, serving more than 25 people, and private wells. Operators of Type 2 wells handle their own water testing. \n \n “We typically don’t get involved with municipal water,” Henry said. “The water plant processes is something that we don’t know, I’ve only been learning about it because of this.” \n \n County health officials didn’t have a map of the water system, and couldn’t get one from Flint’s Department of Public Works. Department of Public Works did not return numerous emails and calls from The News. \n \n Initially, according to Henry, the city water department talked about testing for Legionella. To his knowledge, they didn’t follow through. \n \n “It was the distribution system, the water main breaks, the brown water events, these are all red flags,” Henry said. “These were all indications that something is seriously going wrong — the boil water advisories, we have an uptick in Legionnaires’ disease — that was enough to look into (the water system) so we can prevent another case.” \n \n kbouffard@detroitnews.com \n \n Read or Share this story: http://detne.ws/1XLGHam', 'Many of the victims of attack in Hilla, which has been claimed by Islamic State, were Iranian nationals, security official says \n \n Dozens of people, many of them Iranian Shia pilgrims, have been killed by a suicide bombing claimed by Islamic State near the Iraqi city of Hilla, 60 miles south of Baghdad, in the deadliest single attack on Iranian nationals by the Sunni jihadi group. \n \n A suicide truck bomb packed with 500 litres of ammonium nitrate exploded on Thursday at a petrol station where several buses carrying Iranian pilgrims on their way back from the city of Kerbala had parked. Hilla is situated between Kerbala and Najaf, two cities home to important religious sites for Shias. \n \n Reports of the death toll varied, with officials quoted by Reuters saying as many as 100 people had died and others quoted by Associated Press putting the toll at at least 56 people, including 20 Iranians. \n \n Iran’s semi-official Isna news agency said up to 50 Iranians had been killed in the bombing, which also shattered a nearby restaurant. “The Iranian pilgrims martyred were inside a bus,” a source told Isna. \n \n Isis, which considers all Shias apostates issued a statement claiming responsibility for the attack. According to the SITE Intelligence Group, the statement said the suicide bomber “blew up his vehicle amidst their assembly, inflicting among them more than 200 killed and wounded, including Iranians”. \n \n Falah al-Radhi, a security official for the province affected by the attack, said most of the people killed were Iranian nationals. “A large truck exploded among them. It was a suicide attack,” he told AFP. “There are completely charred corpses at the scene.” Scores of wounded people were transferred to hospitals. \n \n The bombing was seen as a retaliation – albeit on a foreign territory – to Tehran’s anti-Isis campaign. Although Iran is extensively involved in the fight against Isis in both Iraq and Syria, it has remained largely untouched by suicide bombings. Isis attacks such as those in Paris last November or in major cities in the Middle East are unheard of in the Iranian capital. \n \n In Iraq, however, they are a regular occurrence. In July, a bomb claimed by Isis killed about 300 people, one of the worst atrocities to have hit the country since 2003. \n \n About 3 million Iranians are believed to have travelled to Iraq this week for the annual Shia commemoration of arbaeen, an important day in the Shia Muslim calendar.. \n \n \n \n Iran’s foreign ministry condemned the attack, saying that it would not alter Iran’s backing of the Iraqi government against Isis. \n \n “This heinous and barbarous crime will not change the determination of Iraqi government and people and will not alter the support of the Islamic Republic of Iran for and its solidarity with the oppressed people of Iraq and their fight against terrorism,” said Bahram Ghassemi, Tehran’s foreign ministry spokesman, according to the semi-official Fars news agency. \n \n Morad Veisi, an Iranian expert on the role of its armed forces, said Thursday’s bombing could be seen as the retaliation for Iran providing the security for arbaeen. \n \n “The security in Kerbala during arbaeen this year was a show of force by Iran – there was no attack in the city despite millions attending,” Veisi said. “But the attack is also a response to Iran’s role in fighting Isis in other parts of Iraq. Isis fighters particularly hate Iranian Shias.” \n \n Veisi said Iran’s support had been instrumental in recent years in pushing back Isis on a number of occasions, including stopping fighters from getting closer to Baghdad after Mosul’s fall and more recently in preventing fighters from taking Erbil and helping the army retake Ramadi. \n \n News of the bombing came as fighting continued in the northern city and Isis stronghold of Mosul, where a US-backed ground offensive by the Iraqi army is inching closer to more besieged parts of the city. As they lose ground in Mosul, the jihadis have intensified their attacks in other parts of Iraq. \n \n \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest Iraqi security forces at the site of the truck bomb attack in Hilla. Photograph: Alaa Al-Marjani/Reuters \n \n Isis has suffered major blows at the hands of the Iraqi army, supported by Iran-backed Shia militias and Kurdish peshmerga, in the five weeks since the Mosul offensive was launched. \n \n \n \n “The Iraqi advance on the south and south-east of the city has started to pick up some steam, which we think is a really great development,” John Dorrian, a coalition spokesman was quoted as saying by the AFP, which reported that Iraqi forces were battling against Isis in the neighbourhood ofKhadraa on Thursday. \n \n Iran’s involvement in the campaign against Isis in Iraq and Syria is carried by the Quds force, an external arm of the elite Iranian Revolutionary Guards led by its commander, Qasem Soleimani, who wields huge influence among Shia militias in both countries. \n \n \n \n Compared with Iraq, where Iran’s involvement is regarded as helpful by the US secretary of state, John Kerry, its role in Syria is more controversial. Iran has been a staunch ally of Bashar al-Assad’s regime and has been accused of helping him quell opposition. \n \n Battle for Mosul: Iraq asks for UK help to get thermobaric weapons Read more \n \n Iran is hoping that US president-elect, Donald Trump, might change his country’s approach on Syria, shifting away from a focus on removing Assad and instead helping the Syrian army in pushing back Isis from Raqqa, the capital of the Isis “caliphate”. Trump has said he is open to warming relations with Russia, which is allied with Tehran, over Syria. \n \n \n \n Iranian leaders insist their forces in both countries act only as military advisers, invited by their central governments, but the rising death toll in Iran points to a greater involvement. \n \n \n \n This week, Mohammad-Ali Shahidi Mahallati, head of Iran’s foundation of martyrs, said: “The number of Iran’s martyrs as defenders of shrine has exceeded 1,000”. He was using Iranian terminology for guard forces sent by Iran to Syria. \n \n Iran has also controversially recruited hundreds of Afghan refugees living in Iran to be sent to Syria.']",2,"– The water in Flint, Michigan, still hasn't been tested for the bacteria that causes Legionnaires' disease despite being the likely source of an outbreak that killed nine people and sickened another 78 between May 2014 and November 2015, the Detroit News reports.

Genesee County raised concerns about the water being a likely source of Legionnaires' in 2014, and five government agencies—including the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, and the EPA—were aware of it. Not one of them followed through by actually testing the water. One Flint resident who contracted Legionnaires' tells the Times he believes the state doesn't want to know if the water caused the outbreak because it doesn't want to be tied to the deaths."

It is a redefinition, they say, that reflects an evolving society where puberty hits earlier, bodies develop into the 20s, and where young people leave home, get married, have children and gain economic independence later than ever. \n \n “Adolescence encompasses elements of biological growth and major social role transitions, both of which have changed in the past century,” they write in the article, published Wednesday. \n \n “Arguably, the transition period from childhood to adulthood now occupies a greater portion of the life course than ever before at a time when unprecedented social forces, including marketing and digital media, are affecting health and wellbeing across these years.” \n \n The call for redefinition is an attempt to ensure health policy safeguards the future health of the 1.8 billion people aged 10-24 who make up more than a quarter of the world’s population, according to the United Nations Population Fund. \n \n “An expanded and more inclusive definition of adolescence is essential for developmentally appropriate framing of laws, social policies, and service systems,” the new article reads. It’s not the first time lead author professor Susan Sawyer, director of the Centre for Adolescent Health at the Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne has discussed redefining adolescence. In a 2012 study on the subject, she wrote that inconsistent age definitions only serve to compound the problem of addressing adolescent health concerns. Some information systems define people ages 15-19 as “adults,” which will “effective render adolescence invisible.” \n \n .@LancetChildAdol Viewpoint: The age of #adolescence—an extended and more inclusive definition to framing better laws, social policies, and service systems for this life phase @LancetYouth https://t.co/KKpJeGjv4W pic.twitter.com/RfVRIDYovk — The Lancet (@TheLancet) January 18, 2018 \n \n “Good information systems are an important step towards making adolescents and their health more visible to policy makers, researchers, donors and development partners,” she wrote in 2012. Sawyer and her co-authors suggest a definition of adolescence across three age categories, 10-14 years, 15-19 years, and 20-24 years. That is how Statistics Canada defines young years, often further describing the 15-19 years as “adolescents” and the 20-24 years as “young adults.” \n \n Some academics contest the Lancet piece, including sociologist Jan Macvarish from the University of Kent, who tweeted that “science really can't tell us how to live our lives and raise our children and what adulthood means.” \n \n But Sawyer is intent on a redefinition. She found that much research on the adolescent years tends to focus on children under the age of five instead of the later years when minds and bodies continue to develop which she tweeted in November ahead of the new article’s release. \n \n “Let’s make adolescents visible,” she wrote.""]",3,"– An Oregon bakery that refused to make a cake for a lesbian couple and then refused to pay the $135,000 damages award that ensued has decided to finally pay up. A spokesman for the state Bureau of Labor and Industries tells KOIN that Aaron Klein, co-owner of Sweet Cakes by Melissa, paid $136,927.07 on Monday to settle the damages and interest. The spokesman says that with the help of a private collections agency, the bureau had already recovered around $7,000 from a garnished bank account belonging to Aaron and Melissa Klein, who closed their bakery in 2013 and now run the business from home. The couple was ordered to pay damages after authorities decided they had violated the civil rights of the two women who ordered a wedding cake. The Kleins' lawyer tells the Oregonian that they still plan to appeal the ruling, but they decided it didn't make sense to rack up interest charges while the case was pending. ""The prudent thing to do, given the generosity of people who have contributed funds, was to take care of it and continue the fight,"" he says. And supporters have definitely been generous: The Kleins have received more than $515,000 from supporters since their case became national news, including at least $400,000 from a Continue to Give campaign that's still receiving a steady stream of donations.

243,"['Below most volcanoes, Earth packs some serious deep heat. Mount St. Helens is a standout exception, suggests a new study. Cold rock lurks under this active Washington volcano. \n \n Using data from a seismic survey (that included setting off 23 explosions around the volcano), Steven Hansen, a geophysicist at the University of New Mexico, peeked 40 kilometers under Mount St. Helens. That’s where the Juan de Fuca tectonic plate releases fluids due to intense heat and pressure as it descends beneath the North American plate. Those fluids rise and trigger melting in the rock above, fueling an arc of volcanoes that line up like lights on a runway. All except for Mount St. Helens, which stands apart about 50 kilometers to the west. Still, Hansen and colleagues expected to see a heat source under Mount St. Helens, as seen at other volcanoes. \n \n Instead, thermal modeling revealed a wedge of a rock called serpentinite that’s', 'Picture a volcanic eruption: fiery lava and smoke billowing skyward as a towering mountain empties its over-pressurized belly of a hot meal. At least, that’s how most of us think it works. So you can imagine volcanologists’ surprise when they discovered that Mount St. Helens, which was responsible for the deadliest eruption in US history, is actually cold inside. \n \n Apparently, it’s stealing its fire from somewhere else. \n \n \n \n Mount St. Helens is one of the most active volcanoes of the Cascade Arc, a string of eruptive mountains that runs parallel to the Cascadia subduction zone from northern California to British Columbia. It’s also one of the strangest. Most major volcanoes of the Cascade Arc sit neatly along a north-south line, where the wedging of the Juan de Fuca tectonic plate beneath the North American plate forces hot mantle material to rise. Mount St. Helens, however, lies to the west, in a geologically quiescent region called the forearc wedge. \n \n Advertisement \n \n “We don’t have a good explanation for why that’s the case,” said Steve Hansen, a geoscientist at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque. \n \n Seeking answers, Hansen recently led a seismic mapping survey of Mount St. Helens. In the summer of 2014, his team deployed thousands of sensors to measure motion in the ground around the volcano. Then, they drilled nearly two dozen holes, packed the holes full of explosives, triggered a handful of minor quakes, and watched as seismic waves bounced around beneath the mountain. “We’re looking at what seismic energy propagates off in the subsurface,” Hansen explained. “It’s a bit like a CAT scan.” \n \n \n \n Advertisement \n \n Their analysis, which is published today in Nature Communications, appears to have created more questions than it answered. From seismic reflections, Hansen and his colleagues learned that the types of minerals present at the boundary between Earth’s crust and mantle are markedly different to the east and west of Mount St. Helens, confirming that this area is geologically special. But instead of finding a hot mantle directly beneath the volcano, seismic data indicates a relatively cool wedge of serpentine rock. \n \n Not only is Mount St. Helens out of place, but it also lacks the magma reserves we’d expect given its violent history. So, where on Earth is Mount St. Helens getting its fuel? \n \n Hansen suspects the volcano’s magma source lies to the east, closer to the rest of the Cascade Arc, where material in the upper mantle is hotter. But that still leaves the question of why gooey rock being forced westward, through the crust or upper mantle, to erupt in this one off-kilter location. Earthquakes in the deep crust may be partially responsible, but more data is needed to confirm such a link. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Fortunately, more data is exactly what Hansen, and other scientists associated with the Imaging Magma Under St Helens (iMUSH) project, are now collecting. What geologists learn about this weird volcano—how its magmas form, how they move around, when and why they erupt—could improve our understanding of volcanic arc systems around the world. \n \n “Mount St. Helens is pretty unusual,” Hansen said. “It’s telling us something about how the arc system is behaving, and we don’t yet know what that something is.” \n \n \n \n [Nature Communications]', 'Several previous active and passive-source seismic studies have observed weak or absent Moho arrivals at other locations within the Cascadia forearc region14,16,18 (Fig. 1), including a reversal of the Moho velocity contrast in central Oregon13. The inferred reduction of mantle velocities has been attributed to the formation of low-velocity serpentine in the mantle wedge11,12,13,14. Serpentinite also has a relatively low-density and high-magnetic susceptibility, which is consistent with regional magnetic and gravity anomalies15. The presence of ∼50–75% serpentine is enough to reduce upper mantle P-wave velocities to 7.1–7.5 km s−1 (ref. 12), similar to the observed lower crustal velocities beneath Mount St Helens9,17. However, we note that this is only a rough estimate of the amount of serpentine required to extinguish the Moho discontinuity and is on high end of reported estimates for Cascadia which range 15–60% (refs 13, 19). \n \n The high pressure serpentine phase (antigorite) is stable in the mantle wedge at relatively low temperatures (<∼700 °C (ref. 20)) and can form by hydrous alteration of peridotite11,12. From a global perspective, Cascadia is a relatively warm arc due to the young age of the subducting Juan de Fuca plate21. However, modelling suggests that the down-going slab dewaters primarily beneath the forearc region in warm subduction zones22 and these fluids may therefore contribute to the serpentinization of the forearc mantle wedge12. Thermal modelling of the Cascadia subduction system21 (Fig. 6) suggests that the eastern limit of the antigorite stability field could extend to near Mount St Helens, therefore, we interpret the lack of PmP arrivals west of Mount St Helens as evidence for a serpentinized upper mantle. The observed transition in Moho reflectivity is abrupt, occurring over a distance of about 5–10 km and is consistent with imaging the antigorite dehydration front whose rapid reaction kinetics23 should produce a thermally well-defined boundary. \n \n Figure 6: Two dimensional thermal model of the Cascadia subduction system in Central Oregon and geologic interpretation. The surface locations of Mount St Helens and Mount Adams relative to the thermal model21 are determined by using their distance from the subduction trench. The top of the subducting plate and the crust-mantle boundary of the overriding plate are plotted as white lines. The hachured area denotes the region of the mantle wedge where serpentine is stable (<∼700 °C (ref. 20)). Locations of deep long period (DLP) earthquakes are plotted as white dots whose size scales with magnitude. The low velocity anomaly observed in the lower crust from iMUSH tomography9 is shown. Arrows show two possible pathways for the lateral migration of melt towards Mount St Helens; These include a path through the mantle wedge (B) and one through the mid-crust (A). Full size image \n \n Areas where serpentinite has been inferred in the Cascadia forearc mantle are typically offset from the main axis of arc volcanism by ∼50 km trenchward and are not usually associated with significant volcanism (Fig. 1). This observation is consistent with the view that the location of the volcanic arc relative to the trench is predominately controlled by the thermal structure of the mantle wedge6,8. Mount St Helens therefore presents a thermal paradox because it lies directly adjacent to the cold mantle wedge and yet still produces arc derived magmatism which requires elevated temperatures. For example, Mount St Helens primarily erupts dacites that are produced in the lower crust by either partial melting of a mafic source24 and/or partial crystallization of mantle derived basalts25. Analysis of melt inclusions from the 1980 and 2008 eruption cycles indicate that magma temperatures were 860–900 °C (ref. 26), consistent with thermal models of arc lower crust (800–1,000 °C)5. Additionally, analysis of young (post-Miocene) mantle derived basalts from southern Washington suggest melt segregation temperatures that range ∼1,200–1,450 °C (ref. 27). A hot mantle wedge directly beneath Mount St Helens is incongruent with the presence of a cold (<∼700 °C (ref. 20)) serpentinized uppermost mantle just west of the volcano (Fig. 6). \n \n One way this dilemma can be resolved is if the lower crustal source region resides east of the volcano, towards the hotter axial region of the volcanic arc, and the ascending melts migrate laterally in the crust towards the forearc region. Magnetotelluric results indicate that Mount St Helens is electrically connected to a region of high conductivity in the mid-crust28, which is located near the southern terminus of the Southern Washington Cascades Conductor29 (Fig. 1). This feature extends east to Mount Adams and has been interpreted as a layer of partial melt28, which could thus provide a pathway for the westward migration of melts derived from the lower crust towards the cold forearc (see path A in Fig. 6). However, dacites erupted at Mount St Helens have notably different geochemistry than those found at Mount Adams which suggests that the melt source regions for these two volcanos are not the same30. \n \n Alternatively, recent iMUSH active-source tomography resolves a vertical column of low seismic velocities southeast of the volcano that extends from Moho to mid-crust depths and is interpreted as partial melt9. This feature could therefore represent a localized lower crustal source region for the volcanism at Mount St Helens. The mantle derived basalts that ultimately drive the magmatic system25,31 require a hot source region (>∼1,200 °C (ref. 27)) suggesting that these melts are formed further to the east and migrate west into the cold forearc mantle wedge (path B in Fig. 6). The true thermal state of the mantle wedge beneath Mount St Helens is undoubtedly complicated by effects not accounted for in the two-dimensional (2D) model (Fig. 6), such as three-dimensional (3D) topography of the slab surface32 (Fig. 1) and heat transfer caused by the migration of melts33. Future geophysical constraints from the iMUSH project and increasingly realistic 3D modelling efforts are required to better constrain the deep melt pathways beneath Mount St Helens. \n \n A cluster of deep long period (DLP) earthquakes has been identified just southeast of Mount St Helens in the lower crust (23–44 km depth, Fig. 6). DLP events are commonly observed in volcanically active regions, including beneath many of the volcanoes in the Cascade Range34, and these events are thought to be caused by the movement or cooling of magmatic fluids35,36. The DLP at Mount St Helens are located near the edge of the low velocity column observed in the iMUSH tomography (Fig. 6) and have been interpreted as the result of magma injection9. Our PmP results suggest the DLP earthquake cluster is located above the antigorite stability boundary in the mantle wedge (Fig. 5) and therefore these features may be related. Buoyant ascent of water produced by serpentine dehydration has been suggested to explain non-volcanic DLP events observed in the forearc region of Central Oregon37. A local heat source is required to drive dehydration37 and this could be caused by the advection of heat associated with the arrival of mantle melts near the Moho beneath Mount St Helens (path B, Fig. 6).', 'A diseased ringed seal in Alaska is shown in this handout photo released to Reuters October 13, 2011. \n \n ANCHORAGE, Alaska A mysterious disease, possibly a virus, has afflicted ring seals along Alaska\'s coast, killing scores of them since July, local and federal agencies said on Thursday. \n \n The diseased seals have been beaching themselves on the Arctic coastline since July, with numbers picking up in subsequent months, biologists with the North Slope Borough Department of Wildlife Management and other agencies said. \n \n About 100 of the diseased animals have been found near Barrow, the nation\'s northernmost community, and half of those have died, the borough biologists reported. \n \n Elsewhere in the sprawling borough, villagers have reported 146 ringed seals hauling themselves onto beaches, and many of those were diseased, the biologists said. \n \n Ringed seals rarely come ashore in normal circumstances, spending most of the year in the water or on floating ice, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\'s Fisheries Service. \n \n Biologists said they believe the illness was caused by a virus. Symptoms include sometimes-bleeding lesions on the hind flippers, irritated skin around the nose and eyes and patchy hair loss on the animals\' fur coats. \n \n They said the mystery outbreak may not be limited to ringed seals. Some dead walruses at Point Hope, a village on Alaska\'s northwest coast, were found with similar lesions, borough biologists said. \n \n Local hunters also reported finding skin lesions on two bearded seals, the biologists said. \n \n Yet identification of the disease remains elusive, and it was not clear that the lesions found on the walruses were from the same disease that has afflicted the ringed seals, said Bruce Woods, spokesman for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. \n \n ""We\'re kind of in the dark at this point,"" he said. \n \n The remote locations and other logistical challenges make it impossible to provide veterinary care to beached animals that are sick, said Jason Herreman, a borough biologist. \n \n ""Seals that are found dead are collected for sampling. Seals that are sick but alive are being left to recover on their own,"" he said in an e-mail. Samples were being sent to various laboratories in Anchorage and elsewhere, he said. \n \n Ringed seals, bearded seals and Pacific walruses are all dependent on floating summer sea ice and suffering the impacts of rapid warming in the Arctic, according to federal agencies. \n \n NOAA has proposed listing Alaska\'s ringed seals and bearded seals as threatened, and the Fish and Wildlife Service has also designated the Pacific walrus as a candidate for Endangered Species Act protections. \n \n (Editing by Dan Whitcomb and Cynthia Johnston)', 'Even after Yahoo goes through with the sale of its core business, it will still pay its top executives handsomely—and in some cases, even better than it did before. \n \n In announcing a plan for the company’s future Monday, Yahoo (yhoo) said it had picked a new CEO to replace Marissa Mayer once its deal with Verizon (vz) officially closes. Yahoo is selling its technology and advertising business to Verizon, and the remaining company will consist only of the hoard of Alibaba (baba) stock that Yahoo owns, its stake in Yahoo Japan, and a miscellaneous array of smaller investments. \n \n Running the leftover stump of Yahoo is likely to be a much simpler and easier job than the one Mayer had, from which she is walking away with a $23 million severance package. Add to that the $69 million worth of unexercised stock options awarded to Mayer, plus the $97 million of Yahoo stock she already owns (which she’ll be free to sell when she leaves the company), and Mayer’s net worth is set to increase by about $189 million. (That’s even after she voluntarily gave up about $20 million of her annual stock bonus this year after taking fire for the cyber attacks Yahoo recently suffered. It’s also significantly more than Fortune’s estimate two months ago of $141 million for Mayer’s total payday, thanks to new equity grants and stock price appreciation in the meantime.) \n \n But Mayer’s replacement, Thomas McInerney, seems in many ways to be getting an even sweeter deal. McInerney, the former chief executive of IAC (iac) (the Internet media company once known as InterActiveCorp, which owns dating sites including Match.com (mtch)), will get a starting base salary of $2 million to become Yahoo’s new CEO, according to the offer letter made public Monday. That’s double the $1 million base salary that Mayer currently takes home. \n \n What’s more, Yahoo actually expects to pay McInerney $4 million in his first year working at the company, assuming he earns his target bonus, which is equal to his base salary, according to the new disclosures. That’s 25% more than the $3 million the company is paying Mayer for a salary and cash bonus this year. On top of that, McInerney will also be eligible for grants of long-term incentive rewards of up to $24 million, depending on achievement of performance goals. If he were to receive the maximum amount, it would also be twice as much as Mayer’s long-term incentive grant in 2015, the last full year before the Verizon deal was announced. \n \n Setting aside any discussion of the gender wage gap, McInerney’s compensation is all the more remarkable when you take into account his job responsibilities following the Verizon deal. While Mayer was hired to tackle the herculean challenge of turning around Yahoo’s struggling media business—a seemingly impossible task, in hindsight, at which she ultimately failed—McInerney will collect a paycheck for what may practically be a no-show job. \n \n After all, the company that McInerney will run will not be an operating business like the one Yahoo is today, but rather an investment company not all that different from a mutual fund. In fact, Yahoo has already begun referring to the future version of itself, which will be renamed Altaba, as simply “the Fund.” Yet unlike most funds, the Yahoo/Altaba incarnation (which will still trade like a stock under the ticker symbol “AABA”), will not buy any new stocks, and it “does not intend to sell” the Alibaba stock or Yahoo Japan shares it already owns, according to the disclosure. \n \n In short, McInerney is getting paid a huge amount to sit atop a fund that basically runs itself. The way Yahoo describes McInerney’s responsibilities in a filing Monday makes it sound like he will be little more than a glorified trustee, the way a retiree might occasionally check in on the status of the family nest egg. The Altaba fund will “depend” upon the executive team “for the monitoring of the Fund’s investments,” according to Yahoo’s disclosure, but it’s unclear how much of a time commitment that “monitoring” will require. One portion of the fund—the part consisting of marketable debt securities, which may require more active management—won’t even be managed in-house, but outsourced to a third-party investment advisor, Yahoo said. \n \n A spokesperson for Yahoo declined to comment, but a source close to the company says that besides usual fund management responsibilities, McInerney will be charged with untangling Altaba “out of a long and significant tail of Yahoo operating company liabilities,” from class action lawsuits over the data breaches to “ongoing dialogues with regulators.” \n \n The Altaba fund will oversee assets currently valued at more than $60 billion, including more than $40 billion worth of Alibaba stock. By comparison, BlackRock (blk), which oversees more than $5 trillion in assets—most of which are also in passive funds, not actively managed—paid its CEO Larry Fink a base salary of $900,000 in 2015, less than half of McInerney’s starting salary, and total compensation of $26 million for the year. Bill McNabb, CEO of passive fund giant Vanguard, which has some $3.8 trillion in assets (but is not a publicly traded company), received $10 million to $15 million in 2015 compensation, according to Bloomberg. \n \n Besides managing—or even just monitoring—far more assets than Altaba will, BlackRock and Vanguard also have another distinguishing factor: They are complex businesses with their own products and operations spread across the world. Ultimately, BlackRock and Vanguard’s executives are accountable for their own companies’ performance. McInerney, on the other hand, may very well be paid as though he were responsible for Altaba’s performance. But ultimately he won’t be: That will depend almost entirely on Yahoo Japan and Alibaba, on whose coattails McInerney will be riding. \n \n Clarification: A previous version of this article referred to McInerney’s long-term incentive rewards as stock grants. While such compensation is typically awarded in some form of stock that vests over time, Altaba has yet to establish what form these rewards will take. This article has been updated accordingly.']",5,"– Mount St. Helens already stands out as one of the most active volcanoes in the Cascade Arc and the deadliest in the US, since its 1980 eruption claimed nearly 60 lives.

244,"['U.S. military personnel prepare to transfer an injured on board USS Fitzgerald, off Izu Peninsula, Japan, after the Navy destroyer collided with a merchant ship, Saturday, June 17, 2017. The Japan... (Associated Press) \n \n YOKOSUKA, Japan (AP) — U.S. and Japanese vessels and aircraft were searching Saturday for seven American sailors who were missing after their Navy destroyer collided before dawn with a container ship four times its size off the coast of Japan. \n \n The USS Fitzgerald was back at its home port in Yokosuka Naval Base south of Tokyo by sunset Saturday, its crew lined up on deck. The Philippine-flagged container ship was berthed at Tokyo\'s Oi wharf, where officials began questioning crew members about the cause of the nighttime crash. \n \n After helping stabilize the USS Fitzgerald, the destroyer USS Dewey joined other American and Japanese vessels and aircraft in the search for the missing sailors. \n \n At least three other Navy sailors were injured in the collision. \n \n Family members were frantically seeking news, appealing via social media for calls from sailors aboard from the ship. \n \n The U.S. 7th Fleet said in a statement that the crash damaged two berthing spaces, a machinery room and the radio room. Most of the more than 200 sailors aboard would have been asleep in their berths at the time of the pre-dawn crash. \n \n Water was being pumped out of flooded areas and it was unclear how long it would take to get into the crushed mid-right side of the ship once it was at the pier in Yokosuka, the statement said. \n \n The USS Fitzgerald\'s captain, Cmdr. Bryce Benson, was airlifted early Saturday to the U.S. Naval Hospital in Yokosuka and was in stable condition with a head injury, the Navy said. Two other crew members suffered cuts and bruises and were evacuated. It was unclear how many others may have been hurt. \n \n The Navy said that the collision occurred 56 nautical miles (103 kilometers) southwest of Yokosuka, home to the 7th Fleet. \n \n ""Right now we are focused on two things: the safety of the ship and the well-being of the sailors,"" said Adm. Scott Swift, commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet. \n \n The Japanese coast guard said it received an emergency call from the container ship, the ACX Crystal, reporting the collision at around 2:20 a.m. (1720 GMT Friday). It was questioning crew members of the ACX Crystal, which is operated by the Japanese shipping company Nippon Yusen K.K., and was treating the incident as a case of possible professional negligence, said Masayuki Obara, a regional coast guard official. \n \n The ACX Crystal weighs 29,060 tons and is 222 meters (730 feet) long, the coast guard said, much larger than the 8,315-ton Navy destroyer. The container ship\'s left bow was dented and scraped, but it did not appear to have sustained any major structural damage. \n \n Nippon Yusen said all of the ACX Crystal\'s 20-member Filipino crew members were safe. \n \n Conditions were clear at the time of the collision, though Yutaka Saito of the coast guard said the area is particularly busy with sea traffic. \n \n The names of the missing sailors were being withheld pending notification of their families. U.S. Navy personnel set up support and counseling services to help families as they sought updates on crew members. \n \n ""Just heard the sweetest voice and saw a wonderful face. He\'s okay. Thank you all for the prayers,"" Rita Schrimsher of Athens, Alabama, tweeted after speaking with her 23-year-old grandson, Jackson Schrimsher, via Facetime. \n \n ""It could have been worse, so we\'re grateful,"" she said by phone. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writers Mari Yamaguchi and Elaine Kurtenbach in Tokyo and Cathy Bussewitz and Jennifer Kelleher in Honolulu contributed to this report.', 'Tokyo (CNN) Seven US sailors are missing and the commanding officer of a US destroyer is among the injured after the warship and a merchant ship collided off the coast of Japan, the US Navy said. \n \n The smaller guided-missile destroyer USS Fitzgerald suffered severe damage to its starboard side. \n \n ""The collision affected Fitzgerald\'s forward starboard side above and below the water line, causing significant damage and associated flooding to two berthing spaces, a machinery space, and the radio room,"" according to a statement from US 7th Fleet. \n \n The statement hinted that the missing sailors could be trapped in the damaged area of the destroyer. \n \n ""It remains uncertain how long it will take to gain access to the spaces once the ship is pier side ... to methodically continue the search for the missing,"" the statement said. \n \n The two ships collided around 1:30 a.m. local time Saturday in the Pacific Ocean, about 56 nautical miles southwest from the port of Yokosuka and 12 miles off the Izu Peninsula, the Japanese coast guard said. \n \n The USS Fitzgerald heads to Yokosuka, home base of the 7th Fleet, beside a US tugboat, off Shimoda, Japan on Saturday. \n \n The Fitzgerald had left the US naval base in Yokosuka, where it is based, earlier Friday for routine operations in the area, a US Naval Forces Japan spokesman said. \n \n The warship was towed back to Yokosuka, escorted by a Japanese coast guard ship, naval officials said. It arrived at port late Saturday, when divers began inspecting the damage. \n \n Earlier, the ship\'s commander, Cmdr.

All three are in stable condition at the US Naval Hospital in Yokosuka, said Cmdr. Ron Flanders, public affairs officer for US Naval Forces Japan. \n \n Five Japanese Maritime Self Defense force ships were leading the search for the missing US sailors at the site of the collision, joined by another US warship, the guided-missile destroyer USS Dewey, the 7th Fleet said. US and Japanese aircraft also were involved. \n \n No one hurt on merchant ship \n \n The merchant vessel involved is the ACX Crystal, a container ship flagged in the Philippines, officials said. It is chartered by Japanese shipping company Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha (NYK) and owned by Dainichi-Invest Corporation, NYK said. \n \n A photo from shipping company NYK shows damage from the collision. \n \n No one aboard the Crystal was hurt, and no oil spilled from the vessel, NYK said. \n \n NYK and the ship\'s owner are cooperating a Japan Coast Guard investigation into the collision, the shipping firm said. \n \n ""Our thoughts and deep concerns go out to all those directly affected,"" NYK said. \n \n The ship-tracking website marinetraffic.com shows the ship had left the Japanese port of Nagoya on Friday evening. It was expected to dock at a Tokyo Bay port around 4:30 p.m. local time, officials said after the wreck, adding that the container ship was operating under charter to a Japanese shipping company. \n \n Photos of the Crystal showed damage to its bow. \n \n Damage to the Philippine container ship ACX Crystal is seen after it collided with the USS Fitzgerald in the waters off Izu Peninsula, this photo released by Japan\'s coast guard shows. \n \n Shipping zone can be precarious \n \n The area where the wreck happened is known for heavy maritime traffic, the Japanese coast guard said. About 400 to 500 ships pass through the zone each day, the service said. \n \n The last known fatal incident there was in September 2015, when a South Korean vessel and a Japanese container ship collided, Japan\'s coast guard reported. Six Japanese crew were declared dead. \n \n The area has seen two other major collisions in the past five years. \n \n In such a busy shipping lane, the ships may have been in a ""restricted navigation"" situation, meaning they would have had o observe strict rules for movement and positioning in relation to other vessels in their vicinity, said Carl Schuster, former director of operations at the US Pacific Command\'s Joint Intelligence Center and a Hawaii Pacific University professor. \n \n Those rules leave vessels little room to maneuver, as turning away from one ship could place a vessel at risk of an even more serious incident with another, Schuster said. \n \n It completed $21 million in upgrades and repairs in February and is forward-deployed to Yokosuka, supporting security and stability in the Indo-Asia-Pacific region, the service said. \n \n The 29,000-ton container ship, which handles general cargo, includes a captain and a crew of 20, NYK said. It was built in 2008 and is about 730 feet long. \n \n The larger size of the container ship could have left the smaller US destroyer vulnerable in the collision, Schuster said. \n \n An injured USS Fitzgerald crew member is carried by US military personnel, left, and Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force members upon arriving Saturday to the US Naval Base in Yokosuka Japan. \n \n The force of the impact could have thrown overboard sailors who were standing on the opposite side of the destroyer from where it was struck, he said. That could account for the missing sailors, who may have been on deck on watch or even just relaxing in the night air, he said. \n \n Sailors also could have been trapped in compartments below deck, Schuster said, pointing out that container ships have a bulbous bow below the water line, which may have plowed into the US warship. \n \n Experienced commander in charge \n \n Benson, the Fitzgerald\'s commander, was new to the position, having taken command of the vessel May 13 after serving as the ship\'s executive officer, or second in command, since November 2015, the Navy said last month. \n \n Cmdr. Bryce Benson \n \n The Fitzgerald is the second command for Benson, a 1999 Naval ROTC graduate of Marquette University. He commanded the minesweeper USS Guardian, operating out of Sasebo, Japan, from 2008 to 2010, before taking shore assignments in Washington and with US Pacific Command. \n \n The collision was the second in the region for US Navy warship in just more than a month. On May 9, the guided-missile cruiser USS Lake Champlain was struck by a South Korean fishing boat off the Korean Peninsula. \n \n No injuries were reported in that incident, which a Navy official said occurred when the fishing boat\'s crew did not have a radio to hear warnings from the US warship. \n \n The guided-missile cruiser USS Antietam ran aground in late January while anchoring near Yokosuka, damaging its propellers and discharging 1,100 gallons of hydraulic oil into the bay. \n \n Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly described the status of the commanding officer. He was transported by medevac for treatment.', 'U.S. Navy SEALs had walked nearly seven miles from their landing zone in southern Yemen and were within about 300 feet of the al-Qaeda compound where American journalist Luke Somers was being held when they suddenly came under fire, U.S. officials said Saturday. \n \n As the commandos battled in the darkness, night-vision cameras in aircraft hovering overhead watched one militant hurry to the building housing Somers. By the time the Americans fought their way there, the militant was gone and Somers and another hostage, South African teacher Pierre Korkie, lay mortally wounded. \n \n Korkie died aboard a rescue aircraft, according to officials who provided details of the operation. Somers survived to reach a nearby Navy ship, the USS Makin Island, where he died while undergoing surgery. \n \n No casualties were reported among the 40-person U.S. rescue team. \n \n In the wake of the rescue attempt, which took place at 1 a.m. Saturday, Yemen time (5 p.m. Friday in Washington), officials said that the decision to undertake it was made after U.S. intelligence determined his al-Qaeda captors were about to execute Somers. \n \n Luke Somers and Pierre Korkie (European Pressphoto Agency) \n \n But the failure to bring the hostages out alive, following two earlier attempts to rescue U.S. captives in recent months, was likely to raise questions about the operations and the intelligence that preceded them. \n \n Last summer’s raid to rescue Americans being held in Syria by the \xadIslamic State, and an attempt to rescue Somers two weeks ago, did not succeed because in both cases the hostages had been moved before the commandos arrived. Two of the Islamic State hostages, journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, were later executed. \n \n In a video released Wednesday following the initial attempt to rescue Somers, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) warned “Obama and the American government of the consequences of proceeding ahead in any other foolish action.�? \n \n The threat to execute Somers within 72 hours, if unspecified demands were not met, led to operational planning for a second rescue attempt, which President Obama approved early Friday. Officials said U.S. intelligence gleaned from the first attempt contributed to their certainty of where Somers was being held, in a group of compounds that make up a small village in Shabwah governate, a remote region along the Gulf of Aden. Defense, intelligence and administration officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to provide details of the secret operation. \n \n The commandos did not know of Korkie’s presence in the compound. They had unconfirmed reports that another hostage might be with Somers but thought it would be someone else, a British citizen also being held by AQAP. \n \n The tragedy of the South African’s death appeared to worsen when the South African relief organization that employed him, Gift of the Givers Foundation, said that his negotiated release had been expected Sunday. \n \n Korkie, who had been working as a teacher in Yemen, and his wife, Yolande, were abducted in May 2013. Yolande Korkie was released from captivity in January, according to a post on the foundation’s Web site. \n \n Al-Qaeda’s affiliate in the Arabian Peninsula threatened to kill Luke Somers, an American photojournalist, after U.S. commandos attempted to free him. (Reuters) \n \n Somers, 33, a British-born U.S. citizen, was abducted in September 2013 from the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, on a busy street near a supermarket. He had been working in the country as a freelance photojournalist. \n \n Hostage executions, video\xad-recorded by militants and disseminated online and via social media, have placed increasing pressure on the Obama administration to launch rescue attempts. While a number of militant-held European hostages have been released in exchange for million-dollar ransoms, the administration has said that payment will only increase the number of hostages taken. It has refused to pay and has pressured other governments not to participate in ransom negotiations. \n \n Although the administration last spring traded five Taliban detainees from the prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for a U.S. serviceman captured in Afghanistan and being held in Pakistan, it described that negotiation as an exchange of war prisoners rather than a hostage ransom. \n \n The three failed attempts to rescue hostages alive through military means come as U.S. Special Forces have conducted a series of successful raids to capture wanted militants. In June, Ahmed Abu Khattala, indicted for alleged participation in the 2012 attack in Benghazi, Libya, that left four American officials dead, was snatched in a raid in Libya. He is awaiting trial in this country. \n \n But taking a suspect off the street at a time of U.S. choosing and rescuing hostages held by well-armed militants anticipating a raid are different matters. \n \n As described by U.S. officials, about 40 Navy SEALs were transported from the USS Makin Island, said to be located “in close proximity to Yemen,�? aboard V-22 Osprey aircraft that fly like airplanes but can land like helicopters. Using night-vision equipment, they began walking over terrain described as “hilly, scrubby�? and “rough.�? \n \n As the team members approached the compound and were about 300 feet away, “they lost the element of surprise,�? an official said, and a firefight with the militants began. Officials said they were not certain how the team had been spotted. \n \n Because of the direction of fire, a defense official said, they were nearly 100 percent certain that Somers and the other hostage were killed by the AQAP militants and not in crossfire. \n \n Via overhead surveillance that was maintained throughout the rescue attempt, one militant was seen going into the building where Somers was known to be held, a senior administration official said. The militant stayed “for about a five to seven count . . . long enough, of course, to shoot people or take any other action. We didn’t have visibility inside.�? \n \n By the time the commandos reached the building, the administration official said, “the terrorist had already fled.�? \n \n The defense official said five AQAP militants were killed in the firefight. None were captured. \n \n The wounded hostages, found inside the building, were immediately evacuated aboard an Osprey, but “one perished on the way�? to the USS Makin Island and “the other on the operating table�? aboard the ship, an amphibious assault vessel. \n \n The U.S. forces were not on the ground more than 30 minutes, said the defense official, who described it as “a quick fight.�? \n \n A flurry of Twitter postings from jihadists in Yemen claimed that three U.S. “Marines�? and eight Yemeni special forces were killed during the operation. \n \n Reached Saturday by the Associated Press, Somers’s sister, Lucy Somers, said the family had been notified of his death by the FBI but asked that the family be “allowed to mourn in peace.�? \n \n Since Somers’s kidnapping last year, his family had appealed for news of the abduction not to be made public. But after the AQAP video was released Wednesday, the family released their own video. \n \n “He is a good person, and he has only been trying to do good things for the Yemeni population. He goes out of his way to care for and respect the common person, and he has made many lasting friends in Yemen,�? Somers’s brother said in the video. “Luke is only a photojournalist, and he is not responsible for any action the U.S. government has taken. Please understand that we had no prior knowledge of the rescue attempt for Luke and we mean no harm to anyone.�? \n \n His mother also spoke, pleading for mercy. \n \n “Give us an opportunity to see our Luke again. He is all that we have.�? \n \n Missy Ryan in Kabul contributed to this report.']",3,"– US and Japanese vessels and aircraft are searching for seven American sailors who are missing after their Navy destroyer collided before dawn with a container ship four times its size off the coast of Japan. The USS Fitzgerald was back at its home port in Yokosuka Naval Base south of Tokyo by sunset Saturday, following the crash at 2:20am local time. The USS Fitzgerald's captain, Cmdr. Bryce Benson, was airlifted early Saturday to the US Naval Hospital in Yokosuka and was in stable condition with a head injury; two other crew members suffered cuts and bruises and were evacuated, reports the AP. The US 7th Fleet said in a statement that the crash damaged two berthing spaces, a machinery room, and the radio room, and CNN says its statement suggests the missing could be in the ship's crushed mid-right side. ""It remains uncertain how long it will take to gain access to the spaces once the ship is pier side ... to methodically continue the search for the missing,"" the statement said. Most of the more than 200 sailors aboard would have been asleep in their berths at the time of the pre-dawn crash. The Navy said that the collision occurred 56 nautical miles southwest of Yokosuka, home to the 7th Fleet. The ACX Crystal weighs 29,060 tons, making it much larger than the 8,315-ton Navy destroyer. The container ship's left bow was dented and scraped, but it did not appear to have sustained any major structural damage. The Philippine-flagged container ship was berthed at Tokyo's Oi wharf, where officials began questioning crew members about the cause of the crash and are treating the incident as a case of possible professional negligence."

Over time, however, he gained confidence and learned to follow directions as he accrued experience performing mountain searches. When he made his first official find on Aug. 20 in the Yagi section of Hiroshima, Yumenosuke didn't raise a ruckus by barking: He simply fixed his gaze on a pile of lumber and didn't take it off until his handler checked out the pile. Sadly, a man's body was found under the wood, but Yumenosuke had done his job.

247,"['“OMG New Moon Has $140 Million Opening!” said a UK magazine. “OMG times one million, you guys,” writes a reporter in The Detroit News. Even the New York Times’ Manohla Dargis described “New Moon” as “the juiceless, near bloodless sequel about a teenage girl and the sparkly vampire she, like, totally loves.” \n \n Anyone noticing a pattern here? \n \n In writing about the box office juggernaut — a film that is smashing records left and right, beating Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings in online advance sales, among other “firsts” — headline writers are using the language of teen girls. \n \n Cute? I don’t think so. There’s something that stinks to me here. Using this kind of language to cover such stunning box office success feels like an attempt to both mock girl culture and detract from the very butch success of this women and girl-driven phenomenon. \n \n I wonder if it makes people uncomfortable that, as the blogger Melissa Silverstein wrote, “A franchise fueled by girls and women has the potential of beating the machines for the box office record. This movie could potentially be ‘guy proof’ meaning they won’t need guys to see it for it to kick some box office butt. Whereas the other franchises NEED women to make their numbers.” \n \n After all, the headlines we’re used to are that women can’t get real parts in Hollywood, and that women don’t support female-centered movies. And as we saw in a recent New York Times profile of Kristen Stewart, the Twilight Saga allows her to pursue a dark, authentic role for a young woman – albeit a disturbing one — opportnities that are clearly in short supply for young women even a few years older, like Megan Fox (profiled by the New York times on the same day in part about her struggle to be taken seriously). \n \n “The question is,” writes Kate Harding at Salon Broadsheet, “will the powers that be recognize young women as a robust market that’s been largely ignored and condescended to, or will they write it off as a limited phenomenon?” If you know me, you know that I love the language of teen girls…so much so that I haven’t quite grown out of it myself. And I write this less as an expression of outrage than an observation. All I’m saying is that I’m pretty sure the words to describe what’s happening this week at box offices around the world aren’t “OMG” and “like, totally.” They’re “millions,” “record-breaking” and “87 percent of advance ticket holders are female.”', 'President Obama called for new proposals for reducing gun violence during an address Wednesday. \n \n He appointed Vice President Joseph Biden to head an inter-agency panel to come up with ""a set of concrete proposals by January that I intend to push without delay,"" Obama said. \n \n In the wake of the shooting deaths of 20 children and 6 adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown on Friday, the issue of gun control, especially assault weapons and high capacity magazines, has been brought to the fore of the national discussion. \n \n ""This is a team that has a very specific task, to pull together real reforms right now,"" Obama said. \n \n The panel will include members of the cabinet, Congress and other stakeholders, Obama said. \n \n ""Any single gun law can\'t solve all these problems,"" he said. ""We\'ll take a look at mental health, schools. We know issues of gun safety will be an element of it."" \n \n In the past any effort at gun law reform has been viewed as an encroachment of the Second Amendment, Obama said, so he\'s looking for a thoughtful approach. \n \n ""There\'s a big chunk of space between what the Second Amendment means and having no rules at all,"" he said. ""That space is what we\'re going to be working on to see if we can find some common ground."" \n \n Not all gun violence can be prevented, Obama said, ""but that can\'t be an excuse not to try."" \n \n Reform will require Americans from across the political and cultural spectrum to work together. \n \n ""If we\'re going to change things, it\'s going to take a wave of Americans … standing up and saying, \'Enough,\' on behalf of our kids."" \n \n In addition to reforming laws concerning military-style semi-automatic rifles and high-capacity magazines, Congress should close a loophole that allows gun sales at gun shows without a background check, Obama said. \n \n He also emphasized the need to improve access to mental health care. \n \n ""We need to make access to mental health care at least as easy as access to a gun,"" he said. \n \n ""This time, the words need to lead to action."" \n \n Biden was the author of the 1994 crime bill that led to a ban on assault weapons, a ban that Obama noted was supported by all living former presidents at the time, including Ronald Reagan. \n \n ""There\'s already a growing consensus for us to build upon,"" Obama said. The majority of Americans already support banning the sale of assault weapons and high-capacity clips, as well as [requiring] background checks before any gun purchases, he said. \n \n Meanwhile, as detectives continue to comb through evidence and talk to people who witnessed Friday\'s mass murder at Sandy Hook Elementary School, the state\'s chief medical examiner Dr. H. Wayne Carver has asked a geneticist at the University of Connecticut to join in his investigation of the killings. \n \n Carver is awaiting toxicology testing results for gunman Adam Lanza, 20, and information that may help answer the question of why Lanza gunned down 20 first-graders and six women at Sandy Hook. \n \n ""I\'m exploring with the department of genetics what might be possible, if anything is possible,"" Carver said Tuesday. ""Is there any identifiable disease associated with this behavior?"" \n \n Carver said he does not know whether Lanza had Asperger\'s syndrome — a possibility that has been raised — but he said Asperger\'s ""is simply not on the menu, in terms of what is wrong with this kid. Asperger\'s is not associated with behavior patterns that are violent."" \n \n Determining why Lanza went on a rampage that apparently ended only when fast-arriving police prompted him to kill himself may be difficult. Lanza destroyed a hard drive from his computer, which authorities had hoped would reveal clues about what he did, and he killed his mother as she slept. \n \n Carver said that Nancy Lanza died of four gunshots to the head from a .22-caliber rifle. She was in bed when her son killed her, and likely still asleep, Carver said. The rifle was left at the house. \n \n Mary Ellen O\'Toole, a retired FBI profiler and behavioral scientist, said seeking an answer in Adam Lanza\'s biology is worthwhile. \n \n ""I think it\'s great to consider if there\'s something here that would help people understand this behavior,"" O\'Toole said. \n \n There will be other important clues contained in the reports that detectives prepare about the crime scene and their interviews with witnesses, O\'Toole said. Some of that information may help behavioral scientists answer the key question: why? \n \n One thing is apparent from the evidence made public so far, she said. The assault on Sandy Hook Elementary ""was not an impulsive act,"" she said. ""This was well thought out."" \n \n The planning could have gone on for days, weeks or months, she said. \n \n State police Lt. J. Paul Vance has repeatedly described the investigation as a process during which Newtown and state police detectives will peel back the layers of the case. Just how much of the story detectives will finally be able to tell remains unknown, but it will not be a fast process. \n \n ""It\'s going to take months,"" Vance said. \n \n Gov. Dannel P. Malloy has declared Friday a day of mourning and has asked that people observe a moment of silence at 9:30 a.m. He has also asked houses of worship and government buildings with bells to ring them 26 times in honor of the victims. \n \n ""Let us all come together collectively to mourn the loss of far too many promising lives at Sandy Hook Elementary School,"" Malloy said.

Vampire love interest Edward is “overbearing,” and heroine Bella “quite literally lies down and takes it,” write Carmen D. Siering and Katherine Spillar in Ms. “This is a film full of gender stereotypes—testosterone-driven male aggression, females who pine away over lost loves, boys who fix motorcycles, and the girls who watch them.” And the media attention paid to the film isn’t much better, writes Rachel Simmons on her website. Headlines like “OMG New Moon Has $140 Million Opening!” use teen-girl-speak to talk about the film’s success, but Simmons doesn’t find it cute. It “feels like an attempt to both mock girl culture and detract from the very butch success of this women and girl-driven phenomenon,” signaling that Hollywood may be intimidated by a “guy-proof” film franchise."

Kyrsten Sinema took a narrow 9,610-vote lead over GOP Rep. Martha McSally Thursday evening as Arizona’s election authorities counted more ballots in the state’s uncalled Senate race. \n \n The lead amounts to less than half a percentage point with more than 1.8 million votes counted. McSally was up by 17,703 votes earlier in the day, before the counties processed another 160,000 votes — but about a half-million more votes remain to be counted across Arizona, according to both campaigns. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n Most of the outstanding ballots are coming from Arizona\'s largest county, Maricopa County, which is home to Phoenix and includes Sinema\'s congressional district. Sinema held a slight edge of about 1 point over McSally in the county as of Thursday afternoon, but the new votes counted Thursday expanded the Democrat’s Maricopa edge to 2.5 points. That’s the outcome Democrats had hoped for, while Republicans were expecting McSally’s tally there to improve. \n \n The state will continue to count early votes cast before the election daily until the race is resolved. \n \n “Arizonans must have faith that their votes are counted, and we are working diligently to ensure that count proceeds in a fair, transparent, and timely manner that voters can trust,” Andrew Piatt, Sinema’s campaign manager, said in a statement Thursday afternoon.

In Florida, Republican Gov. Rick Scott is ahead of Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson by two-tenths of a percentage point, but the race is headed for a recount. And in Mississippi, Republican Sen.

But depending on the results in Arizona and Florida, the Republican majority in the next Senate could be as small as 52 seats or as big as 54. That spread could be significant on legislation and judicial confirmations over the next two years — as well as in the 2020 elections, when Republicans must defend 22 Senate seats compared to just 12 for Democrats. \n \n In Arizona, Sinema led comfortably in polling throughout the summer and fall, but McSally closed the gap by late October. The race was one of the most expensive in the country, with nearly $30 million spent by both parties. \n \n Sinema and McSally are vying to replace Republican Sen. Jeff Flake, who retired after clashing with President Donald Trump. \n \n Both campaigns are digging in for a protracted coda to the election. McSally’s campaign sent out a fundraising request Thursday evening for donations to help fund an “army of attorneys and observers” to fend off any legal challenges once the votes are tallied. \n \n McSally’s campaign also tweeted that she was “dreading a long and painful process.” The tweet included a photo of her in a dentist’s chair.', 'WASHINGTON—Iran’s paramount political figure, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has responded to overtures from President Barack Obama seeking better relations by sending secret communications of his own to the White House. \n \n The Iranian cleric wrote to Mr. Obama in recent weeks in response to an October presidential letter that raised the possibility of U.S.-Iranian cooperation in fighting Islamic State if a nuclear deal is...']",2,"– Democratic candidate Krysten Sinema has edged ahead of Republican rival Martha McSally in Arizona, one of three states where Senate races are still undecided.

(Associated Press) \n \n The statement, by Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, appeared to be the most serious threat of reprisal by Moscow for Western sanctions against Russia over its annexation of Ukraine\'s Crimea region. \n \n Russia is key to attempts to coax Iran into significant long-term curbs of its nuclear program in exchange for relief from U.N. and other sanctions. Iran insists it does not want nuclear arms but is seeking a deal that will result in full sanctions relief. \n \n The Russian threat, hours after the latest negotiating round ended, appeared to catch Washington off guard. \n \n Days ahead of the meeting, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki had said she expects Russia to ""remain an active partner"" in the talks. During the two-day talks, Western officials involved described Russia\'s participation as constructive and unchanged by the Ukraine tensions. \n \n Ryabkov was cited by the Interfax news agency as saying Russia may feel compelled to respond to U.S. and European Union actions. He said Russia considers ""reunification"" with Crimea more important than the developments surrounding Iran\'s nuclear program. \n \n ""We wouldn\'t like to use these talks as an element of the game of raising the stakes taking into account the sentiments in some European capitals, Brussels and Washington,"" Ryabkov was quoted as saying. ""But if they force us into that, we will take retaliatory measures here as well."" \n \n Russia and the U.S. often hold different positions about what Iran needs to do to banish fears about its nuclear activities. That includes uranium enrichment, which Iran says it needs to make reactor fuel — but which can also manufacture fissile warhead material. \n \n Ahead of the most recent talks, diplomats told The Associated Press that Moscow was ready to accept a more robust Iranian enrichment program than Washington. \n \n But American officials have always said that Russia and the United States are united in their goal of banishing the threat of a nuclear-armed Iran, even if they differ on how to get there. \n \n Iran has often tried to exploit U.S.-Russian differences and Ryabkov\'s comments could embolden it to resist significant nuclear cutbacks. \n \n China usually supports Russia at the negotiations but the United States, Britain, France and Germany are unlikely to accept a lenient deal. \n \n At worst, the talks could fall apart. That could embolden Israel to make good on threats to attack Iran\'s nuclear facilities and draw the United States into any military confrontation. \n \n The Russian comments overshadowed signs that Iran may be ready to compromise. \n \n Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif had suggested earlier Wednesday his country was ready eliminate fears that a reactor it is building at Arak could be used to make atomic arms. \n \n Zarif implied that Iran was open to re-engineering the facility to one that would produce less plutonium, according to the semi-official Fars news agency. Like enriched uranium, plutonium can be used to arm nuclear warheads. \n \n While Iran insists on completing and running its nuclear reactor, ""any proliferation concerns"" linked to it ""have to be removed,"" he was quoted as saying. \n \n ___ \n \n Ischachenkov reported from Moscow. Margaret Childs in Vienna and Associated Press writer Ali Akbar Dareini in Tehran contributed to this report.', 'Story highlights Russian defense minister says his troops have no intention of entering Ukraine \n \n U.S. sanctions target 20 Russian officials, Bank Rossiya, Treasury Department says \n \n Russia announces sanctions against nine U.S. officials and lawmakers \n \n Moscow\'s lower house approves treaty to annex Crimea \n \n Russia\'s lower house of parliament overwhelmingly approved a treaty Thursday to annex the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea from Ukraine, prompting tougher sanctions from the United States. \n \n Russia responded with its own sanctions against a list of U.S. officials and lawmakers. \n \n After Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov had presented the treaty and urged lawmakers to accept the region as a part of the Russian Federation, the document was approved on a vote of 443 to 1. \n \n Speaking ""on behalf"" of Putin, Lavrov had told the State Duma that folding Crimea into Russia was needed to protect ethnic Russians there. \n \n ""I am certain that passing the document will become a turning point in the destiny of multi-ethnic nations of Crimea and Russia, who are related with close ties of the historical unity,"" Lavrov said. \n \n The political crisis has been the biggest blow to Russia\'s relations with the West since the Cold War. \n \n Approval of the treaty in the State Duma was in no doubt as Russia has stood defiant despite Western leaders denouncing Moscow\'s actions as a violation of Ukraine\'s sovereignty and a breach of international law. \n \n European Union leaders said Thursday they will sign a political association agreement with Ukraine and add 12 more people to the list of individuals targeted for sanctions, including Russia\'s Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin. \n \n EU member states also are threatening possible tougher targeted measures, European Council President Herman Van Rompuy told reporters. \n \n ""We make clear that failure to settle the crisis peacefully, and any steps by Russia to destabilize Ukraine, will have far reaching consequences,"" he said. ""And by that we mean consequences on relations in a broad range of economic areas."" \n \n U.S. and EU officials had already imposed sanctions on more than two dozen Russian and Crimean officials, and urged Russia to avoid escalating the crisis -- a call Moscow has ignored. \n \n But U.S. President Barack Obama on Thursday announced more sanctions on individuals and one bank in response to Russia\'s annexation moves. \n \n He also signed a new executive order that authorizes possible further sanctions on what he called ""key sectors"" of the Russian economy if Moscow does not act to deescalate the situation. \n \n ""This is not our preferred outcome. These sanctions would not only have a significant impact on the Russian economy, but could also be disruptive to the global economy,"" he said. ""However Russia must know that further escalation will only isolate it further from the international community."" \n \n Russia must respect ""basic principles"" of sovereignty and territorial integrity, he said, adding that the United States should also provide financial support for Ukraine\'s government and people. \n \n ""We want the Ukrainian people to determine their own destiny and have good relations with the United States, Russia, Europe -- anyone they choose,"" he said, calling for continued diplomatic efforts. \n \n Sanctions lists \n \n The new U.S. sanctions target 20 officials, including senior Russians and ""cronies"" who hold significant influence in the Russian system, as well as one bank that holds ""significant"" resources, a senior U.S. administration official told reporters. \n \n That bank was listed by the U.S. Treasury Department as Bank Rossiya. \n \n The individuals named by the Treasury include major Putin allies, both in the Kremlin and in business. Among the 16 government officials listed are Putin\'s chief of staff, Sergei Ivanov; the speaker of the State Duma, Sergey Naryshkin; and Viktor Ozerov, chairman of the Security and Defense Committee of the Russia parliament\'s upper house. \n \n Four others were named as members of the government\'s inner circle. They are financier Yuri Kovalchuk, labeled Putin\'s personal banker by a senior U.S. administration official; magnate Gennady Timchenko, whose activities in the energy sector have been directly linked to Putin, according to the Treasury; and businessmen Arkady and Boris Rotenberg. \n \n Besides Russia\'s Deputy Prime Minister Rogozin, The expanded EU sanctions target list includes two advisors to President Putin, Sergey Glazyev and Vladislav Surkov, as well as the chairwoman of the Russian Senate Valentina Matvienko. \n \n Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt told CNN\'s Christiane Amanpour that the new round of U.S. sanctions would be ""significantly more powerful than the first one."" \n \n The latest round ""hits significant economic interests that are fairly close to the ruling circles in Moscow. It will be noticed,"" he said. \n \n Russia responded with sanctions against nine U.S. officials and lawmakers, including speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives John Boehner, Senate Majority leader Harry Reid and Sens. John McCain, Robert Menendez, Daniel Coats and Mary Landrieu, according to a list published by the Russian Foreign Ministry. \n \n Boehner\'s spokesman, Michael Steel, said the lawmaker was ""proud to be included on a list of those willing to stand against Putin\'s aggression."" \n \n McCain responded, ""I guess this means my spring break in Siberia is off, my Gazprom stock is lost, and my secret bank account in Moscow is frozen. Nonetheless, I will never cease my efforts on behalf of the freedom, independence, and territorial integrity of Ukraine, including Crimea."" \n \n The U.S. Treasury said Bank Rossiya is controlled by Yuri Kovalchuk and is the 17th-largest bank in Russia. \n \n It has $10 billion in assets and handles the accounts of some top government officials, the Treasury said, adding that the bank has relationships with banks in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere. The bank also provides services to the oil, gas and energy sectors, it said. \n \n ""As a result of Treasury\'s action, any assets of the persons designated today that are within U.S. jurisdiction must be frozen,"" the Treasury said. \n \n British Prime Minister David Cameron told reporters at the EU Heads of State or Government summit there would likely be more asset freezes and travel bans. \n \n Finland\'s Minister for European Affairs and Foreign Trade Alexander Stubb told CNN more names would be added Thursday. \n \n ""There will probably be over 10 new names on the list and then of course people are going to argue, are these people good to be on the list, bad to be on the list are they to be taken seriously and so on, but there will be more names,"" Stubb said. \n \n Lavrov told lawmakers that sanctions ""have never brought any positive results"" and that there were no legal grounds for them. \n \n Kiev defiant \n \n Russia\'s defense minister assured U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel in phone call Thursday that Russian troops on the Ukraine border do not intend to cross the border or take aggressive action, Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said. \n \n Hagel made it clear in the lengthy and sometimes ""direct"" talk with Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu that the Russians bear responsibility for what happens in Crimea, including the recent violence, since they are in control there, Kirby said. \n \n While Russia insists its actions are legitimate, Ukraine\'s parliament said Thursday that Kiev will never stop fighting for Crimea, even if the country\'s new leaders have discussed evacuating military personnel from the region. \n \n Photos: Photos: Crisis in Ukraine Photos: Photos: Crisis in Ukraine Crisis in Ukraine – Ukrainian tanks are transported from their base in Perevalne, Crimea, on Wednesday, March 26.

Ukraine has facilities ready to accommodate 25,000 evacuees. \n \n A statement on the Ukrainian presidential website said former Presidents Leonid Kravchuk and Leonid Kuchma had asked Turchynov to redeploy soldiers who are still in Crimea to the mainland. \n \n The call was ""to protect and save lives of Ukrainian servicemen who bear service in difficult and dangerous conditions in Crimea,"" the statement said. \n \n Porubiy had also said the measures included a full-scale visa system for Russians. \n \n Speaking in Brussels on Thursday, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk said Kiev was in no hurry to impose a visa regime on Russia, since it could negatively affect Ukrainians living in the predominantly Russian-speaking east of the country. \n \n Yatsenyuk is in Brussels to sign the political part of an association agreement with the European Union. \n \n Lavrov said the intention to introduce visa regulations was ""surprising and regrettable."" \n \n As diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis continue, U.N.

The Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency for Energy (ARPA-E) is funding high-risk, high-reward technology, such as the magnesium ion battery being developed at Pellion Technologies, an MIT spin-off. Pellion says its batteries will have twice the energy density as existing lithium-ion batteries for both consumer products and electric vehicles. At the same time, Toyota researchers in Michigan say they are developing their own magnesium battery for an EV that can run twice the distance as current batteries on a single charge, but don’t expect it until 2020. The race is on. \n \n Lithium Air One materials scientist told me that lithium air is the ""grand slam home run"" of energy density. Lithium-air batteries differ from lithium-ion batteries in that they use carbon for their positive electrode instead of metal oxides. Carbon is lighter and reacts with oxygen in the surrounding air to produce electrical current. Although it promises a 1,000-mile range instead of just 125 miles for electric vehicles, lithium air batteries have also proven to be unstable. The big problem is that lithium ignites when it contacts moist air. But IBM researchers in California and Switzerland reported this month that they have solved a key problem in the battery’s electrochemistry by finding a different kind of electrolyte solution. IBM hopes to have a prototype lithium-air battery by 2013. Startups like Berkeley-based PolyPlus are also hunting for this ""holy grail"" of battery tech. Critics say that lithium-air research has been underway for two decades without complete success. \n \n Solid State Lithium Ion For electric vehicles, weight, range and safety are the big concerns. One idea is using solid state technology that doesn’t have a liquid electrolyte solution for a lithium-ion fuel cell. ""That gives our cells greater energy density and also potentially reduces system complexity dramatically,” said Ann Marie Sastry, CEO of Ann Arbor-based Sakti3. The firm\'s batteries pack more power into less space, said Sastry, a University of Michigan professor of materials science and engineering. There\'s no flammable material either, something that’s recently plagued the Chevy Volt’s battery. GM and Khosla Ventures are backing Sakti3’s research and development efforts. Meanwhile in Japan, Toyota announced recently that its own solid state battery with a 600-mile range will be ready for roll-out sometime around 2015. \n \n Sodium Ion Pittsburgh-based Aquion Energy is betting on simple, non-toxic materials for their grid storage battery system. ""It’s made out saltwater, cotton, charcoal and dirt, actually lithium manganese oxide,"" said Ted Wiley, Aquion’s vice president of business development. ""Everything we\'re made out of is cheap and staying cheap."" Aquion is building shipping-container-size storage cells for solar, wind and other renewable energy producers who need to store the electricity they make before selling it to the grid. It’s a hybrid battery using the food preservative, sodium sulfate, and is based on research coming out of Carnegie Mellon University’s school of engineering. This simple and inexpensive concept should also work to augment diesel generators in remote areas, Wiley said, or back up the power supply of homes and businesses. \n \n Lithium Imide When Leyden Energy’s Noam Kedem was at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas earlier this month, he was struck by the fact that almost nobody could talk on the phone after 3 p.m. ""Everyone was running from charger to charger,"" Kedem said. To meet the demand for more power and longer life, Fremont, Calif.,-based Leyden is using a unique electrolyte salt solution with existing lithium ion technology. Kedem says that doubles the number of laptop or cellphone battery charges from 350 cycles to more than 800. Kedem says their batteries can also operate up to 140 degrees Fahrenheit without producing hydrofluoric acid or the swelling that can occur when batteries heat up as they run multiple applications. Canada’s Dr. Battery retailer began selling Leyden’s first rechargeable battery pack, and the firm is beginning mass production of tablet and cellphone batteries this year. Kedem says the firm is testing a prototype electric vehicle battery using the same electrolyte platform. \n \n What do smart phones, electric vehicles and solar panels have in common? They all demand more and more battery power to keep our homes, jobs and vehicles running. Lithium ion is still the ""gold standard,"" but researchers are looking at the entire periodic table for new combinations of elements that can conduct and store electrons in smarter ways. And the sooner they find it, the sooner society can get off fossil fuels and use more sustainable energy sources. “With the combination of new materials, new design concepts, and new production and manufacturing methodologies, I believe we will get there,” said Esther Takeuchim, professor of advanced power systems at SUNY Buffalo, Here’s a look at five new battery techs – some ready for market in the next year, others just over the horizon: \n \n Mushrooms never cease to amaze. They’re one of the weirdest organisms on the planet, and we keep coming up with unexpected uses for them. Actually, some people think mushrooms aren’t from this planet at all. Really. \n \n Now comes word that researchers at Researchers at the University of California, Riverside Bourns College of Engineering have found yet another use for mushrooms — in batteries. \n \n Magic Mushrooms In My Yard: Photos \n \n The UC research team has developed a new kind of lithium-ion battery anode using portobello mushrooms, which could eventually replace the industry standard of synthetic graphite. Besides being less expensive and eco-friendlier, the mushrooms are potentially more efficient as well, thanks to their highly porous composition. \n \n The development could have a fairly big impact in multiple industries, actually. We’re likely to be using a lot more batteries in coming years, particularly in consumer electronics and electric vehicles. By using biological materials, we can bring down costs and expend less energy in the manufacturing process. \n \n Synthetic graphite, on the other hand, has a relatively high manufacturing cost due to specific preparation and purification processes that can also be harmful to the environment, according to the research team. \n \n Some Mushrooms Glow, And Here’s Why \n \n The mushroom anodes’ porosity creates more space for the transfer of energy, which can improve battery performance. But even better, according to the UC team, mushroom anodes could actually result in batteries that increase in efficiency over time, due to the organic material’s high potassium salt content. \n \n “With battery materials like this, future cell phones may see an increase in run time after many uses, rather than a decrease, due to apparent activation of blind pores within the carbon architectures as the cell charges and discharges over time,” says researcher Brennan Campbell in press materials accompanying the announcement. \n \n Mushrooms are also, as a rule, more tasty than graphite. Everybody wins. The research findings were published today in the journal Nature Scientific Reports.']",5,"– The US won't be sending troops to Crimea anytime soon. President Obama effectively ruled out a military response to Russia's land grab yesterday, USA Today reports. ""We do not need to trigger an actual war with Russia,"" he told KSDK-TV, in an interview ostensibly about raising the minimum wage. ""The Ukrainians don't want that, nobody would want that."" But Obama said to expect ""even more disruptive economic actions that could have a significant impact on the Russian economy."" In other Ukraine news: Russian forces freed Ukraine's captured navy commander today, after Ukraine demanded the release of all hostages in Crimea, CNN reports. If they weren't freed by 9pm, acting President Oleksandr Turchynov threatened to take ""technical and technological"" action—meaning, likely, turning off Crimea's utilities. Russia's defense minister asked Crimea to free the hostages. Even though Ukraine is reportedly pulling troops from the region, its parliament issued a declaration today saying that it still considered Crimea part of the Ukraine, and that ""the Ukrainian people will never, under no circumstances, stop fighting for the liberation of Crimea from the occupants."" European leaders met today in Sevastopol to discuss further punitive action against Russia, with Angela Merkel saying the EU would issue more travel bans and asset freezes against Russians, the Washington Post reports. But analysts say the measures aren't strong enough to change Russian behavior. Ukraine, too, is taking only restrained steps. Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk yesterday backed off Kiev's threat to impose a visa regime, saying it would likely be ineffective, and would inconvenience many Ukrainians. Russia, meanwhile, pulled out a threat of its own. Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Russia might revise its stance on Iran's nuclear program in response to US and EU sanctions. ""We wouldn't like to use these talks as an element of the game of raising the stakes,"" he said, according to the AP. ""But if they force us into that, we will take retaliatory measures."""
