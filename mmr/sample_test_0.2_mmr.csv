"– Denis Finley has taken to Twitter to call Politico a ""whore,"" sniff about David Letterman's upcoming Netflix show featuring Barack Obama, and call for the destruction of all office buildings, but it was his tweets about a potential change to Vermont's driver's licenses that cost him his job as editor of the Burlington Free Press. The paper reports Finley was fired by honchos at parent company Gannett on Monday evening after he was found to have repeatedly flouted its social media rules. ""We encourage our journalists to engage in a meaningful dialogue on social media, but ... the conversation [should] adhere to our overarching values of fairness, balance, and objectivity,"" says an exec from the USA Today Network, Gannett's main brand. Poynter explains Finley's demise came after he reacted to Vermont's proposal to add the gender option ""X"" to ""F"" and ""M"" on driver's licenses. The Washington Post documents the Twitter exchange between commenters who were lauding Vermont's decision and Finley. After one user noted the news was ""awesome,"" Finley replied: ""Awesome! That makes us one step closer to the apocalypse."" When someone else tweeted the recognition of different genders was awesome, Finley wrote: ""All recognition? … What if someone said it's awesome they are going to recognize pedophiliacs on licenses? I'm not being snarky, I'm just asking."" Poynter notes some readers threatened to cancel their Free Press subscriptions over the tweets. ""'Reader engagement' is not making provocative statements and then picking fights with people who disagree,"" an editor for a string of other local Vermont papers says. Emilie Stigliani, the Free Press' planning editor, will temporarily step in as Finley's replacement.","['As with changing the attitudes of Americans toward sex harassment, changing attitudes toward even the best of media — especially when it comes to people paying for content — will involve a military-like campaign, with no one-size-fits-all-messages and the unavoidable (and very expensive) need to make the case with unprecedented regularity and persistence', ', in offering drivers a third option in listing gender on licenses', 'Not all recognition is awesome', 'Sunday, mighty Arsenal was such a victim', 'He called Trump a ""political genius', 'Then, Tapper had enough', 'Learn more One tweet too many', 'New England hoopla', 'So M, F or X', 'Stephen Miller', 'com columnist Chad Finn, underscores', 'A revealing photo history', 'Fine', '', 'T', 'C', '""', 'Hmmm', '”', 'Corrections?

"– CNN's Piers Morgan thinks gun-rights proponent Alex Jones's memorable appearance on his show last night made a fine case—for his opponents. ""He was the best advertisement for gun control you could wish for,"" Morgan tells Politico, referring to the conservative radio host. ""That kind of vitriol, hatred, and zealotry is really quite scary."" Jones is the guy who started the White House petition to get Morgan deported because of the CNN host's push for stricter gun laws. The White House last night promised to respond to the petition because it easily surpassed the threshold of 25,000 signatures, notes the Daily Caller. But ""it is worth remembering that the freedom of expression is a bedrock principle in our democracy,"" said spokesman Jay Carney, suggesting Jones better not hold his breath. Jones himself, meanwhile, posted a video after his CNN appearance, telling supporters that ""if something happens to us, or we’re killed by crackheads, it was the NYPD or mafia they hired,"" reports Mediaite.

"– New White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci was not happy about what he believed was a leak of information from his financial disclosure Wednesday—though it later emerged that the form was available to the public. ""In light of the leak of my financial disclosure info which is a felony. I will be contacting @FBI and @TheJusticeDept #swamp @Reince45,"" Scaramucci said in a now-deleted tweet, per the Daily Beast. Scaramucci later denied suggestions that his tagging of Reince Priebus was a declaration of war on the White House chief of staff. ""Wrong! Tweet was public notice to leakers that all Sr Adm officials are helping to end illegal leaks,"" Scaramucci said in a second tweet. The disclosure information believed to have enraged Scaramucci appeared in a Politico report late Wednesday. According to the report, Scaramucci earned $4.9 million from his ownership stake in the SkyBridge Capital plus more than $5 million in salary from Jan. 1, 2016, to the end of June this year, when he began a short-lived stint at the federal Export-Import Bank. The New York Times notes that Scaramucci filed the disclosure form June 23 and under federal law, it would have been available to the public 30 days later. ""They aren't in process yet,"" Scaramucci wrote to the Times after being asked why he thought the report had been leaked. He didn't respond after being told it would have been available July 23.","['The disclosure highlights the extensive wealth Scaramucci has accumulated in his career — much like many of Trump’s other top advisers and Cabinet secretaries — and also the challenge he faces in extracting himself from the potential conflicts his investments could pose', '5 million to $7 million', 'Tweet with a location', 'Mr', '', 'Story Continued Below', '”', 'S', 'Scaramucci responded angrily', 'Josh Dawsey contributed to this report', 'Bank for a total liability of $2', 'He has three mortgages with U', 'Scaramucci’s appointment last week', 'Treasury spokeswoman Marisol Garibay did not respond to requests for comment', 'The financial disclosure form that Mr', 'He has several real estate investments, including single-family rental homes on Long Island', '9 million from his ownership stake in SkyBridge', 'Ex-Im was seen as a ""very temporary move,"" a way to get the Trump loyalist to Washington until a higher-level position could be found, according to one White House adviser']"
"– Scientists say they have the first physical evidence of a grisly truth from Jamestown: Colonists in the brutal winter of 1609 resorted to cannibalism, reports USA Today. Anthropologists studying the partial remains of a teenage girl—including her skull, jaw, and leg bone—say they bear the unmistakable marks of a cleaver and knife, reports the Washington Post. She had been, for lack of a better word, butchered. “Historians have to decide whether this type of thing happened,” says one of the Smithsonian scientists who worked on the project. “I think that it did. We didn’t see anybody eat this flesh, but it’s very strong evidence.” It's not clear whether the girl was a servant or perhaps the daughter of a colonist, or whether she was killed to be eaten or eaten after she died.

"– Scientists are calling it a breakthrough and a turning point: In a new study, a compound successfully halted brain cell death in mice, meaning we're one step closer to a pill that can treat Alzheimer's, the Independent reports. Neurodegenerative diseases halt the production of key proteins, which in turn results in the unprotected brain cells dying off, and symptoms appearing. The compound blocks the faulty brain signal that causes the initial ""shutdown,"" thus basically flipping the switch from ""off"" back to ""on."" Proteins are produced, brain cells are protected, and symptoms are reversed. The mice in the study had prion disease, which is similar to a human neurodegenerative disorder. After receiving the compound, memory loss and other symptoms including impaired reflexes and limb dragging were reversed; the treated mice also lived longer than those who didn't receive the compound, Sky News reports. Though it's still a long way off, scientists think a treatment based on these findings could also help people with Parkinson's disease. Now the bad news: The mice did suffer side effects, including weight loss and diabetes.

"– Electronic waste is growing at a staggering rate—Americans alone chucked an average of 65 pounds of old electronic goods each last year—and it is set to surge another 33% within five years unless consumers and producers change their ways, LiveScience reports. Most of the waste ends up in developing nations, and those countries plus the former Soviet bloc now produce more electronic waste of their own than Western nations, according to a new map that tracks the problem worldwide for the first time. The world produced around 54 million tons of electronic waste in total last year, researchers found, and though it can be valuable—a million old cell phones can yield 53 pounds of gold and 550 pounds of silver, Reuters notes—recycling rates remain low and where e-waste is recycled, it is often done so in a way harmful to both the environment and workers' health. The rate of waste is so high because engineers are constantly creating innovative designs to lure people to buy more, an earth sciences professor tells the Toronto Star. ""Why won’t these same smart people also find a way that electronics can be used longer or reused in the best way, too?”","['""Although there is ample information about the negative environmental and health impacts of primitive e-waste recycling methods, the lack of comprehensive data has made it hard to grasp the full magnitude of the problem,"" Kuehr said in the report', 'Waste can be valuable if recycled', ""4 million metric tons), versus China's 8 million tons (7"", 'For StEP maps, click here: here', '“These minerals that we mine are scarce', '(Editing by Alison Williams)', '(30 kg) per capita', 'Original article on LiveScience', '8 kg each', 'Mapping worldwide e-waste', 'Follow us @livescience, Facebook& Google+', 'S', '', ')', '(2', 'John’s, N', 'L', '”', 'N', 'Separately, U', '3 to 2', 'agencies, governments, NGOs and scientists', 'Luxembourg is another example', 'states have started similar programs, Linnell said', 'produced about 10', '58 kilogram per person', '[ See full-size infographic Credit: Ross Toro, Infographic Artist', 'Follow Tanya Lewis on Twitterand Google+', 'Some waste from rich countries ends up in developing nations, where many people work in hazardous conditions for low wages dismantling it', '[Green Guide to Holiday Electronic Gifts (Op-Ed)]', 'Having this data could help governments and companies manage their e-waste', 'StEP is run by U', 'generated about 258', 'MOUNTAINS OF TRASH', 'Consumers could help with better recycling, especially at Christmas, he said', '4 million tonnes from 2012 to 2017 from 48', 'The U', 'are likely to be retired', '""This is why we have developed this e-waste map', '3 million metric tons)', '-backed alliance said on Sunday', '(The U', 'In 2012, China produced about 12', ', and a member of StEP', 'European countries have had established e-waste recycling programs for more than 10 years, whereas only 25 U', 'It has a much smaller population than the U']"
"– Jay Leno has long said he lives off his standup money and takes the millions he gets paid for hosting the Tonight Show and sticks it right in the bank. So the news that Nikki Finke at Deadline Hollywood broke last night might not sting quite as much for him: One source tells her that Leno took a ""tremendous"" pay cut, and the LA Times confirms it was indeed ""significant."" The numbers require some guesswork, but the LAT thinks he went from somewhere between $25 million and $30 million down to about $20 million. Finke's numbers are higher. According to both accounts, Leno volunteered to take the cuts to save jobs, though at least 20 people got layoffs. Why the downsizing? Finke says it's not because of concerns about ratings or ad revenue, but because parent company Comcast is demanding cuts all around. She says the show is still a ""cash cow."" The LAT, meanwhile, says Leno's prime-time budget never got shaved when he moved back to later hours.","['One reason for that is that the production budget of the show was not reduced when Leno moved back to late night after his ill-fated stint in prime time during the 2009-10 television season', 'He does a great job', '[Updated at 10:49 a', 'ALSO:', '', 'm', ', Aug', '""]', ""Movie review: 'Cosmopolis'"", '”', 'O’Brien refused', 'Jimmy Kimmel Bests Leno & Letterman', 'Related: Gabby Douglas & Michelle Obama Give ‘Tonight Show’ A Bump', 'Whether NBC will look to other areas to make additional cuts is yet to be determined']"
"– A 17-year-old high school student in Idaho signed out of his senior prom at exactly 9:32pm Friday, but he never returned home—a lone shoe, his tux jacket, and a busted cellphone were found near the car he came in, KREM reports. Kristian Perez's family says no one's heard from him since he left the event Friday night, and local police say in a statement in the Idaho County Free Press that they've obtained a search warrant for his phone and are now scouring his call and text logs for possible clues. Cops say Kristian's mom reported him missing when he didn't come home after the prom, which was held at the National Guard Armory in Orofino. Per KLEW, a police dog-sniffing team tried to follow Kristian's scent, which apparently led west from the armory, but the scent vanished right at the entrance to a parking lot along the same highway the armory is located on. Investigators speculate Kristian may have gotten into a vehicle at that location. Cops say in the statement that a possible sighting of Kristian in Lewiston, about an hour away, came up empty after they reviewed a surveillance tape and concluded the person seen in the video wasn't the missing teen.

It even includes a shot of Dunn re-creating the iconic waterfall scene from Flashdance using a chair and a water bottle, UPI notes. Dunn explains, per Gawker, that his tools were his iPhone, a wheelchair with a tall pole on the back, a roll of luggage tape, his own computer bag, and the airport's escalators and moving walkways. He taped the iPhone to the pole or the extended handle of his computer bag, sometimes tucking ""different stuff under the bag to get the right angle,"" he says, and then placed it wherever he needed it to be, including the aforementioned escalators and walkways. ""For the escalator shot I had to sprint up the steps after I got my shot so the computer bag didn't hit the top and fall back down,"" he says.

"– The Catholic Church has hired two private investigators to track down a former Dallas priest who disappeared months before sexual abuse allegations against him surfaced. Pastor at St. Cecilia Catholic Church in Oak Cliff for 27 years, Rev. Edmundo Paredes stands accused of molesting three boys in their midteens between 10 and 20 years ago, though the exact period is being withheld to protect the victims’ identities, reports the Dallas Morning News. Paredes, 69, was removed from St. Cecilia in June 2017 after allegedly stealing $60,000 to $80,000 in cash. This February, church officials also learned of sexual abuse allegations, which were reported to police and found to be credible, Bishop Edward Burns told parishioners on Sunday. ""I recognize this diocese cannot cover its ears, its eyes, its mouth. We need to look at this head on,"" Burns said. Still, the Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests questions the delay in releasing the information. Officials initially said the allegations weren’t disclosed earlier because of a police investigation. Late Monday, however, the Diocese of Dallas said a Pennsylvania grand jury report describing more than 1,000 victims of abuse by clergy since the 1940s had motivated the disclosure after victims objected to an announcement in March, per Fox 4. Officials suspect Paredes is in his native Philippines, which he visited annually, per WFAA.

"– Christopher Kennedy Lawford, an actor, author, and nephew of John F. Kennedy, died of a heart attack Tuesday.

Patrick J. Kennedy, tells the AP, adding Lawford's hot yoga habit ""must have been too much for him at that point."" TMZ reports Lawford was at a yoga studio at the time of the heart attack. In addition to appearing on General Hospital, All My Children, and Frasier, per People, the oldest child of Patricia Kennedy also wrote several books, including 2005's Symptoms of Withdrawal. The AP reports that in that memoir, he wrote of what preceded his getting sober at age 30: mugging women for money, begging for change in Grand Central Station, and two arrests for possession. ""There are many days when I wish I could take back and use my youth more appropriately,"" he said in 2005. ""But all of that got me here.

"– The fallout from Anthony Kennedy's bombshell decision to retire from the Supreme Court continues to resonate, with President Trump saying he's ""honored"" that Kennedy has given him an opportunity to pick a successor. Of course, getting him confirmed is another issue, and the Hill digs into the political logistics in the Senate. Republicans have the numbers, but two wild cards are Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, both of whom support abortion rights and will likely have a big say in who comes next. A remedy: At Vox, Ezra Klein writes that both parties are guilty of turning the nomination process into an ""insane"" one, given the stakes. At this point, if one party held the White House and the other the Senate, it's unlikely any nominee would be confirmed. His solution? Reduce the stakes by limiting justices to 10-year terms. A big percentage: The Washington Post picks out five times Kennedy cast the deciding vote on big issues, on everything from backing abortion rights to supporting gay rights to curtailing the death penalty. The story notes that of the 276 majority opinions written by Kennedy, 92 came in 5-4 decisions.","['What are the chances, given the precedent of the past few years, that Senate Democrats will permit Trump to replace Ginsburg and give conservatives a 6-3 majority on the Supreme Court?

"– In what the UK's Civil Aviation Authority says would be ""a totally unacceptable"" first, a British Airways plane landing at Heathrow appears to have been hit by a drone on Sunday, the BBC reports. The Airbus A320 coming into London from Geneva had 132 passengers and five crew members aboard, a BA spokesman tells CNN; the incident was reported after the BA pilot touched down. ""Our aircraft landed safely, was fully examined by our engineers and it was cleared to operate its next flight,"" the rep says. No arrests have been made (it's unclear whose drone it may have been), and the aviation security arm of the Metropolitan Police is looking into the matter. Police note that flying a drone too close to a plane is illegal, NBC News reports, with punishment including up to five years in prison. Specifically, drones over 15 pounds can't fly higher than 400 feet and aren't permitted to fly ""beyond the direct unaided line of sight"" of its operator or near crowds or buildings. Not that the incident came as a total surprise: The head of the International Air Transport Association had previously noted the ""real and growing threat"" of a drone-plane hit, while a British Airline Pilots Association rep says it was ""only a matter of time."" A recent study by Bard College's Center for the Study of the Drone underscores the danger in US airspace, with 327 ""close encounters"" of drones flying within 500 feet of manned aircraft between December 2013 and September 2015, and at least 28 pilots ""[maneuvering] to avoid a collision with a drone.""

"– More than 500 migrants have been detained for illegally entering Hungary or breaching a border fence, with nearly 50 criminal cases on the books since new laws took effect yesterday, the New York Times reports, while the BBC notes that Hungarian riot police today fired tear gas at migrants trying to break through the border with Serbia. And as restrictions tighten, migrants are seeking other ways into Western Europe through Slovenia and Croatia, as well as through Hungary's border with Romania. Issues remain: Hungary’s poorer neighbors may be ill-equipped to handle the flow, and there are areas peppered with land mines, remnants of the Balkan Wars. While solutions are sought, thousands spent last night in a Vienna train station, per the Times, while at least 22 migrants drowned yesterday in the Aegean Sea, the Post notes—a sad repeat of a similar incident a couple of days earlier. Leaders of neighboring nations are scrambling to come up with their own plans for dealing with the influx, which is no small task: The EU border agency notes a head count of 500,000 migrants at EU nations' entry points so far in 2015; last year that number was around 280,000, the BBC reports. Many are refugees fleeing high-conflict areas such as Syria and Iraq, per the Washington Post, which adds there's a noted ""absence of a coordinated policy for the unprecedented influx."" ""Barbed wire in Europe in the 21st century is not an answer, it's a threat,"" Croatia's PM says, per the Post, adding that Croatia would ""accept and direct"" migrants through his country. An Egyptian billionaire who says he wants ""to clear my conscience as a human being"" has come up with an even more creative stopgap for the Syrian refugees involved: hosting them on two available Greek islands, using a joint-stock company to accept donations, Bloomberg reports. (The US is trying to help out.)","['The contrasting scenes along the Serbian border highlighted both the make-or-break resolve of the asylum seekers and the growing friction facing Europe, which has failed to create a coordinated policy for the unprecedented influx of economic migrants and war refugees from the Middle East, Africa, Afghanistan and Pakistan', 'Crisis explained in graphics', 'They crossed into Croatia where police began registering them', 'Serbia worried', 'Follow James Reynolds on Twitter', ""'We will help'"", 'But he gets no response', '""We don\'t know what we should do now', '“There’ll be thousands tomorrow', '""I can\'t go back', ""Analysis: BBC's Guy Delauney, Belgrade"", 'Read more:', 'uk', '', '""', 'co', '”', 'U', 'partners', 'These maps explain why', 'Please include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist', 'In a Sept', ""Five 'happy refugees' pictures that went viral"", 'Nearby, children screamed for their missing parents', 'What happens after Zagreb was uncertain', 'Serbian alarm over stranded migrants', '“See?

He turned to face the agent, who shot Moore just as he was shooting himself, CBS notes. A suitcase next to him held a loaded AR15 assault rifle; his car contained more ammunition.

"– She met four teen girls through social media and acquaintances and quickly tried to befriend them. But it wasn't their friendship Jelinajane Bedrijo Almario was after, say police in Hanford, Calif. Over the next few weeks in 2016, Almario, then just 16, pimped the girls, aged 14 and 15, by posting their photos on prostitution websites and driving them to meet clients at motels in Tulare County, Detective Richard Pontecorvo tells the Fresno Bee. Thankfully, ""we caught her case very early,"" he adds. Almario was arrested in May 2016 and charged as an adult with human trafficking and making terrorist threats. On Monday, two days after her 18th birthday, she was sentenced to 13 years in prison. ""It was a huge eye-opener for us,"" Pontecorvo says of the case, heard in Kings County Superior Court. ""We were able to get these girls back home and get them the help they needed … but these pimps are ruining these kids' lives at an early age."" Pimps like Almario, he adds, per UPI, ""are great at locating kids with low self-esteem and trying to be their friend, and then it obviously changes."" For example, Almario once sent threatening emails to the mother of one of her victims who was simply looking for her daughter, reports the AP. Pontecorvo explains the girls Almario targeted ""would run away for weekends or work a couple of nights.""

"– The Curiosity rover landed safely on Mars early this morning, prompting whoops of joy and relief in NASA's mission control center, reports the New York Times. The rover quickly beamed back a picture of its own shadow cast on the surface of the Red Planet. ""Touchdown confirmed. We are safe on the surface of Mars!"" the team read out after receiving signals from the rover. After a journey of 354 million miles, the rover, which is much bigger and more complex than previous models, had to land in a new way that could never be fully tested on Earth, leading to what control room staff described as ""seven minutes of terror"" before confirmation was received, notes the Washington Post. As earlier reported, the spacecraft ferrying it had to rely on a supersonic parachute to slow it from 13,200mph to about 1.7mph; with seconds to go, the rover was then lowered to the surface using three nylon tethers and retro rockets.","['That tracking would come from the Odyssey orbiter circling Mars, if the spacecraft is able to get to the right location at the right time', 'It could just be an interplanetary communications glitch', ', give or take a minute or so', 'Worldwide spectacle', 'm', '', '”', 'Reaching, orbiting and landing on Mars is notoriously hard', 'But if a full day passes without hearing from Curiosity, then pessimism will set in that something had gone terribly wrong', 'A spare wheel was put into operation, but if it turns out that Odyssey cannot turn itself toward Curiosity, it will not hear anything', 'Speaking for the team as a whole, Steltzner said they were “Rationally confident, emotionally terrified and ready for EDL', 'Formal “landing” parties have been scheduled from South Australia to Rome, from Israel to Crete; and in the United States from Atlanta to Seattle, Milwaukee to Honolulu', 'Once they establish contact, the mission proceeds']"

"– It turns out there were even more reasons the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services shouldn't have picked the free-wheeling and allegedly shady CGI Federal to build HealthCare.gov. When CGI was vetted back in 2007, it didn't have any obvious black marks on its record, the Washington Post explains. But CGI is a ""roll-up"" company formed by acquiring other companies—one of which, American Management Systems, was one giant black mark. AMS projects have hit trouble in at least 12 states as well as at the federal level, including a much-publicized 2001 failure to automate federal retirement benefits. The company went $60 million over budget on that one, yet produced nothing useful. More than 100 AMS alumni are now CGI executives or consultants. ""Should CMS have recognized that ‘OK, here’s CGI Federal. It’s a new company, but, oh, my God, it looks a lot like the AMS from yesterday’?"" asked one ex-CMS official. ""Yes. I would consider that dropping the ball."" But it didn't come up in 2007, and CMS never re-vetted the company, the Post's review of internal documents reveals. On the bright side, the review also reveals that the decision was politics-free, made purely because officials considered CMS' bid ""technically superior."" Vanity Fair, meanwhile, has an in-depth piece today on what many suspect is an accounting scandal brewing at CGI. It looks a lot like the company is using its acquisitions to mask financial problems, a quasi-legal practice known as creating a ""cookie jar.""","['In light of the bungled launch of the health-care Web site, critics have repeatedly asked how CGI Federal got the contract, and there has been widespread speculation on online news sites and blogs that the firm was selected because of political ties to the Obama administration', 'dollar is worth about 1', 'Its U', 'Umbrella contract', 'gov', 'Even before healthcare', 'Four firms applied: IBM, Computer Sciences Corp', ', another Arlington, Virginia–based company', 'Bush', '”', '', 'E', 'O', 'S', 'B', 'I', '“Yes', '’’', 'Deadline pressure', 'In December 2006, CMS put out a request for proposals', 'Thirty-one bidders responded, including CGI Federal', 'gov seemed to be having no discernible impact', '“If that had changed, I would have heard rumblings', '(All figures in this story are in Canadian dollars; one U', ', Pennsylvania’s Medicaid Medical Assistance program, and at least 40 state governments', 'As CGI worked on healthcare', 'Federal law requires that past performance be considered for all federal contracts worth more than $150,000, with limited exceptions', 'With a market value of roughly $11', 'CGI has been a big stock-market success', '07 Canadian dollars at the present time', 'gov turned out to be anything but “real simple', 'The companies’ past performance was not a priority', 'Slate said that that’s because healthcare', '1 billion 2010 purchase of Stanley Inc', '1 billion in its fiscal year ended in September 2013, up more than 100 percent from a year ago', ', Quality Software Services and CGI Federal', 'Stanley’s biggest customer was the U', 'gov is such a small part of its business', '“It’s a Website where you can compare and purchase affordable health-insurance plans, side by side, the same way you shop for a plane ticket on Kayak … same way you shop for a TV on Amazon', 'CGI is what’s known as a “roll-up,” meaning that it was built by acquiring other businesses, or rolling them up', 'These so-called indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity, or ID/IQ, contracts exist throughout the federal government', '“Now, this is real simple,” President Obama told a crowd at Prince George’s Community College, in Maryland, in late September', '“The government continues to struggle with how best to acquire the expertise to integrate technology,” says Stan Soloway, the C', '“Should CMS have recognized that ‘Okay, here’s CGI Federal', 'On Wall Street, there’s an entirely different sort of controversy brewing about CGI', 'gov worked together, kept that role for itself']"
"– The latest drama surrounding the death of Julia Roberts' half-sister, Nancy Motes: A source tells the New York Post that Roberts may end up in a battle with Motes' fiance, John Dilbeck, who plans to argue that he should be a beneficiary of Motes' estate due to the length of their relationship. Of particular concern: gifts Roberts gave her sister and ""intimate family pictures,"" the source explains. ""There is a fear that John could be holding Nancy’s personal items hostage and possibly sell them to the highest bidder. If Nancy had photos and wrote a diary, describing her feelings towards her sister, he could use them,"" the source adds. And things get more bizarre: In an interview with the Daily Mail, Dilbeck's brother Conner—who has been ranting about Roberts on Facebook—claims Motes killed herself at this time specifically to hurt Roberts' chances of winning an Oscar for her role in August: Osage County. ""We are talking about people who are powerful,"" he says. ""People who have very delicate power, people who are in the limelight. Their power can be destroyed very easily if unfortunate things make them look more wicked. They have to be careful, it can destroy their career or their Academy Award."" He also claims Motes' suicide note contains secrets about Roberts that Motes wanted to make public, and that Roberts is ""terrified"" the note could come out.

"– A 33-year-old British man who allegedly hacked into the FBI, NASA, and Federal Reserve and did millions of dollars worth of damage as a form of protest in 2012 and 2013 won't be stepping foot on US soil anytime soon. The High Court of London decided against extradition on Monday, with the Guardian reporting that it agreed with the two arguments his lawyers put forth as part of Love's appeal against extradition: That he could be prosecuted in the UK, and that Love, who has Asperger's and depression, could end up killing himself while in US custody. The AP reports the judges felt his suicide risk would be lessened if he was jailed in England, where family and friends would be accessible to him. The BBC and Wired quote Love as saying ""the reason I have gone through this ordeal is not to just to save myself from being kidnapped and locked up for 99 years in a country I have never visited,"" but that he hoped his case set a ""precedent so this will not happen to people in the future. ...

"– Scout Willis spent Tuesday walking around Manhattan, sans top, while a professional photographer followed her around taking pictures, which Willis then tweeted with the hashtag #freethenipple. Why? She's mad at Instagram. Willis, Bruce and Demi's 22-year-old kid, had one of her photos removed by the picture-sharing site last week because it included two topless models, which Instagram said violated its community guidelines. So Willis started sharing all sorts of pictures of breasts and changed her middle name on the site to ""Areola"" (sic), though you can't see that right now because her account is disabled, the Daily Dot reports. She then took to Twitter, posting pictures of her topless stroll with the captions ""Legal in NYC but not on @instagram"" and ""What @Instagram won’t let you see."" It is legal for women to be topless in public in New York City, though the Daily Dot notes that they are still sometimes arrested for it, and Free the Nipple is a documentary about the fight against the city's censorship laws. People notes that Willis' crusade comes after Rihanna's Instagram account was taken down after she posted topless photos from a magazine shoot, and Gawker adds that Willis' current Twitter avatar is one of those photos.

"– A government pamphlet's advice for pregnant women in India isn't going over well. The booklet titled ""Mother and Child Care"" tells the women to ""detach themselves from desire, anger, attachment, hatred and lust,"" spurn ""impure thoughts,"" look at ""beautiful pictures"" to benefit their fetus, and avoid meat and eggs, per the AP and Hindustan Times. According to one gynecologist in India, the advice isn't just ""unscientific and irrational,"" but it's ""a national shame"" in a country where 174 of every 100,000 pregnancies resulted in the mother's death in 2015, due in part to malnutrition and anemia. That's compared to 14 deaths per 100,000 pregnancies in the US, according to UNICEF. Since women are typically the last to eat and receive medical care in Indian households, the government should be ""ensuring that poor pregnant women get to eat a nutritious, high-protein diet,"" says gynecologist Arun Gadre. This would also help prevent stunted births; some 48% of Indian children under 5 have not grown to the proper height and weight. But ""if the calories of expectant mothers are further reduced by asking them to shun meat and eggs, this situation will only worsen,"" Gadre says. With its advice against lust, the pamphlet also suggests that engaging in sex is dangerous for pregnant women, contrary to medical evidence. A government minister charged with promoting traditional and alternative medicine says the booklet contains ""wisdom accumulated over many centuries"" from ""the fields of yoga and naturopathy.""","['The recommendations are part of a booklet called Mother and Child Care, compiled by the government-funded Central Council for Research in Yoga and Naturopathy (CCRYN) under the Ayush ministry, formed in 2014 to promote Indian traditional healing practices', 'India’s government is advising', '""Undernourished girls grow into undernourished women', '(With agency inputs)', 'Self study, have spiritual thoughts', 'Avoid bad company', '', '”', '(Associated Press)', '""', ""About a third of India's 1"", '""This is a national shame', '3 billion people struggle to live on less than $2 a day', 'Pregnant women must Stay away from desire, anger, attachment, hatred and lust', 'FILE- In this Oct', 'Read the life stories of great personalities', '“The advice is unscientific', 'Many are lucky to eat more than one full meal a day, and women often give their portions up to their hungry children or husbands', 'First Published: Jun 13, 2017 12:29 IST FILE- In this Oct', 'Keep calm (Source: Mother & Child Care Through Yoga and Naturopathy, ministry of Ayush )', '“The booklet does not contain any advice on abstaining from sex,” the Ayush minister said']"

"– Exonerating women who are wrongfully convicted of violent crimes is no easy task—just ask Kristine Bunch. She got 60 years for supposedly setting the fire that killed her 3-year-old son in 1995, and struggled to find anyone who could help, Mother Jones reports. Finally, lawyers at the Center on Wrongful Convictions at Northwestern University's law school exposed a glaring hole (and possibly corruption) in the arson investigators' case. That evidence got Bunch released in 2012 after 16 years in prison, USA Today reported at the time. Then two lawyers from the Center, Karen Daniel and Judy Royal, began helping wrongfully convicted women based on a shocking statistic: Women constitute roughly 11% of violent-crime convictions but only 6% of overturned cases. But why are women's cases harder to overturn? Daniel and Royal give their reasons: Women are usually convicted of violent crimes against people close to them (like a husband or son) so DNA evidence won't help; the suspect's DNA is already spread around the crime scene. By contrast, men usually assault or kill strangers. An incredible 63% of women's exoneration cases turn out to be accidents or suicides rather than crimes. So instead of finding a ""real culprit,"" Daniel and Royal may have to laboriously dismantle the prosecutors' case, perhaps with new science on arson or shaken-baby syndrome that not everyone accepts. Sexist stereotypes are used against women in court. In the case of a woman wrongfully convicted of murdering her son, the prosecutor implied she did it to pursue a modeling career. ""That was based on one tiny conversation expressing slight interest in maybe having a nice photo taken,"" says Daniel. ""Almost every case has something like this.""

"– Yuli Gurriel of the Houston Astros hit a home run in the second inning off Dodgers pitcher Yu Darvish Friday night, giving him reason to celebrate in the dugout afterward. But Gurriel is now apologizing after cameras caught him taking things too far. The Cuban native can be seen making a slant-eyed gesture in regard to Darvish, who is from Japan. He also acknowledged using the word ""chinto,"" meaning ""little Chinese guy,"" reports USA Today. ""At no point did I mean that in an offensive way,"" he said through an interpreter afterward. “Yesterday I was commenting that I’d never had any success against Darvish, and the gesture was saying that I wish he would look at me like one of them and maybe he’d throw me an easy pitch so I can do something."" Darvish, for his part, called the gesture ""disrespectful,"" but wasn't making a big deal about it. ""I have a lot of respect for him,"" he said of Gurriel, who played for a while in Japan, ""so I try not to think about it too much against him."" Later, the pitcher tweeted: ""Since we are living in such a wonderful world, let's stay positive and move forward instead of focusing on anger. I'm counting on everyone's big love."" Gurriel could face league discipline, though it was unclear whether that might mean missing a World Series game.

"– Many of us may avoid downing hard alcohol, wine, and beer on the same night for fear of a raging hangover the next day. But at the BBC, a review of existing research on the topic suggests the drinks' variety itself isn't the problem. Instead, Claudia Hammond points to other possible factors. For instance, she notes, having several different types of drinks may simply mean drinking more total alcohol. (As for ""beer before liquor, never been sicker""? It appears no research has been done to prove or disprove the idea that drink order makes a difference.) ""The existing evidence suggests that hangovers can't be blamed on mixing drinks,"" Hammond writes. But the amount of alcohol may not be the only culprit: Congeners, the non-ethanol products of the fermentation process, also contribute to a hangover. Tannins, for instance, are responsible for the color in darker types of alcohol. There are 37 times more congeners in bourbon than in vodka, and one study found that bourbon drinkers reported worse hangovers than those who drank vodka. So, Hammond writes, people having various types of drinks in a single night may end up indulging in drinks with more tannins. So go ahead and mix types of alcohol if you so desire, but you may want to avoid mixing alcohol with cigarettes: A study last month found that people who smoke and drink are at a higher risk of developing esophageal cancer, Science Daily reported. (If you do find yourself with a hangover, you may want to reach for a Sprite.)","['Although multiple studies have identified risk factors for the development of ESCC, notably, exposure to alcohol and tobacco, this research is the first meta-analysis to look at the interaction between alcohol and tobacco in the risk of ESCC, a class of esophageal cancer that begins in the flat cells lining the esophagus', 'Dr', '', 'Kenneth O', 'Prabhu', 'There’s certainly evidence that people are not good at judging their own drunkenness', 'For this they were paid a rather generous $450', 'Obi and Joel H', 'But if a person starts on wine or spirits, then their judgement may be impaired enough to drink more heavily later', 'This is however just an average', '11g of alcohol per 100ml of breath', 'Beer before wine and you’ll feel fine', 'Do you agree?

"– The mysteries of Old Faithful may soon be solved, thanks, in part, to something that looks like a giant hula hoop. American and Danish scientists have this week begun an aerial survey of Yellowstone that actually looks well into the earth, ""visualizing"" the geology and water as much as 1,500 feet below the surface, says Carol Finn. She's waited a decade to explore what she calls ""a last frontier ... in Yellowstone,"" and the intention is to better map the flow of water that's feeding Old Faithful and rare but sometimes violent hydrothermal explosions. Over a four-week period, a helicopter will fly above, armed with electromagnetic technology that looks like a giant hula hoop. The AP explains it in layman's terms: ""The device acts like an X-ray to determine where and how hot water flows beneath the surface."" Scientists will use the data to determine whether solid earth, ""rotten"" sulfuric rock, or water lurks below, which could assist in identifying unstable areas, per Wyoming Public Media. But a press release frames the main quest like so: We know that the water that explodes from Yellowstone's geysers ""originates as old precipitation, snow and rain that percolates down into the crust, is heated, and ultimately returns to the surface."" We know that it can take as long as thousands of years for that process to run its course. What scientists are hoping to determine are the routes these waters take. ""Does it travel down and back up? Does it travel laterally?"" asks Finn. Right now, ""nobody knows."" (Archaeologists made a surprise find underneath a Mayan temple.)","['The researchers will fly the helicopter along the Mammoth-Norris corridor and take at least four weeks to complete', 'One such explosion, or possibly multiple explosions, that occurred roughly 13,800 years ago left a crater that measures 1-1/2 miles (2', 'Geological Survey', 'has helped reveal hazards from volcanoes', 'BILLINGS, Mont', 'S', '', 'G', '”', '""Does it travel down and back up?

"– Swatting a fruit fly is as tricky as trying to catch a tiny fighter jet with an expert pilot at the controls, researchers say. High-speed cameras captured the insects avoiding threats by executing supercharged, banked turns much like fighter planes, reports the Los Angeles Times. The flies beat their wings 200 times per second and were capable of altering course in a single wingbeat, performing complex calculations incredibly quickly for a creature with only a tiny speck of a brain. The University of Washington team plans further research to determine how the flies are able to perform such amazing feats in the air, reports the Seattle Post-Intelligencer.

"– New research into the amount of time that infants in various countries spend crying found that the littlest ones in usually placid Canada were the most colicky. British babies came in second, followed by Italy. The most tranquil tots, meanwhile, live in Denmark and Germany. Writing in the Journal of Pediatrics, psychologists at the University of Warwick analyzed 28 previous studies of some 8,700 infants to measure colic—a harmless, if nerve-jangling, condition—by gauging crying times during the first 12 weeks. The longest crying jags were clocked in Canada, reports the Guardian, where 34.1% of babies wailed more than three hours a day, at least three days a week. In the UK, the tally was 28% and in Italy 20.9%. Relatively blissful Danish babes scored 5.5%, with Germany at 6.7%. The first-of-its kind analysis found that babies the world over cry around two hours a day for the first weeks, peaking at two hours and 15 minutes at six weeks. Happily for stressed-out new parents everywhere, crying time is halved by week 12, per a press release. Lead researcher Dieter Wolke says parents in countries with low colic scores are less likely to intervene when baby starts crying, allowing the infant to self-soothe. ""They don’t get all worried about it,"" Wolke tells the Telegraph. Then again, he notes, Danish babies may enjoy a bit of ""genetic bias"" since their country consistently ranks at the top of wellness surveys. In any case, new parents should learn to chill. ""If you are not relaxed you are not going to be any use to your baby,"" Wolke says.

"– An absolutely amazing story out of Oklahoma, where a Texas 16-year-old survived a 3,500-foot fall in a skydiving mishap—and didn't even require any surgery for her injuries. Mackenzie Wethington, who went skydiving Saturday as a birthday present from her parents, slammed into the ground, yet somehow only suffered a lacerated liver and kidney, broken bones, and a broken tooth; she's already communicating with her parents in writing and doctors say she's in good condition and should suffer few long-term effects. ""I have no idea how she survived,"" one tells Today. Experts are calling it a miracle; one suspects the teen somehow decreased her air speed and thus landed somewhat more softly—in other words, she was incredibly lucky. The teen was supposed to do a tandem jump with an experienced skydiver, but was told when she arrived that Pegasus Air Sports Center wasn't doing tandem jumps, so her first jump after six hours of training was on her own—and went horribly awry. It's not clear exactly what happened: According to MyFox DFW, the family says Mackenzie's primary parachute didn't open properly (it was supposed to open automatically) and may have gotten tangled, and Mackenzie couldn't open the emergency chute. Mackenzie's dad (who says the main chute only half-opened, according to CNN) blames Pegasus Air Sports Center, claiming it offered inadequate training and didn't properly maintain its equipment. The owner of Pegasus, however, blames Mackenzie and denies any problem with her equipment: ""She didn't do what she was supposed to do,"" he says, though it's not clear what she did wrong; the owner says she didn't take a ""corrective counter action"" to make her parachute ""stop turning."" He claims the chute did open fully but somehow, ""maybe ... initiated by her,"" started a rotation that caused the problem.

"– Alan Thicke's kids are fighting with his third wife over the late actor's estate. Robin Thicke and brother Brennan, the oldest of Thicke's three sons, say that Tanya Callau—who wed Thicke in 2005—is threatening them with bad publicity unless they give her more of Thicke's estate. Thicke left much of his estate to his three children, but Callau still inherited a significant amount (the Hollywood Reporter has the exact breakdown) and was allowed to continue living on his Carpinteria, Calif., ranch. Thicke's sons say their father acquired most of his wealth before meeting Callau, and that she signed a prenup prior to marrying Thicke. They also say she had no issues with the prenup or the estate plan the last time Thicke updated his trust, in February 2016. (He died in December.) But now, Thicke's sons claim, Callau is claiming the prenup is invalid and there are problems with the trust. Per a petition the brothers filed in a Los Angeles court this week, the brothers say Callau also claims she has community rights to more of Thicke's assets, she should be reimbursed for any improvements she makes to the ranch while living there, and that she took a step back from her own career to support Thicke and help raise his youngest son. The brothers' attorney says in the filing that Callau has ""threatened to make her claims fodder for 'tabloid publicity' unless the Co-Trustees agreed to participate in a mediation and succumb to her demands,"" leading the brothers to ask a court to enforce the prenup and Thicke's will, TMZ reports.

"– Scientists who study tree rings for a living have discovered that central Mongolia had an usually warm and wet spell from 1211 to 1225. This would probably remain of note only in tree-ring-studying circles if not for one other thing: Those dates happen to coincide with the rise of none other than Genghis Khan, reports the BBC. And the researchers say it's no coincidence. They argue in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that the change in weather from severe drought conditions prior to 1211 to fertile ones afterward directly helped Khan build his empire. Think rain—specifically the lush grasslands it created to fuel to Khan's horse-driven army, along with the livestock his soldiers needed to survive. ""It wasn't the only thing, but it must have created the ideal conditions for a charismatic leader to emerge out of the chaos, develop an army, and concentrate power,"" West Virginia University researcher Amy Hessl tells National Geographic. ""Where it's arid, unusual moisture creates unusual plant productivity, and that translates into horsepower—literally. Genghis was able to ride that wave.""

"– George Washington’s name is synonymous with America—and of the people who bear his surname today, 90% of them are African-American, according to the 2000 census. How did “Washington” become, as Jesse Washington, writing for the AP calls it, the “blackest name"" in America? It could be that blacks chose the name to honor George himself, an odd prospect when you consider that the first US president, while opposed to slavery on paper, owned 124 slaves and worked them hard. But perhaps not so odd when you realize that Washington also freed all 124 of those slaves upon his and his wife’s deaths; of the eight American presidents who owned slaves while in office, he was the only one to do so. Some of his former slaves may have chosen to take his surname as a mark of their community; others may have wanted to maintain a link to a powerful family after being freed. Or the choice could have been random: Booker T. Washington, for example, has never said why he chose his last name 60 years or so after George Washington’s death. Some may even have picked the name to signal their devotion to their new country: ""There was a lot more consciousness and pride in American history among African-Americans and enslaved African-Americans than a lot of people give them credit for,” says one professor and author. But one black genealogy expert, who says 82% to 94% of Washingtons listed in the 1880 to 1930 censuses were black, disagrees. ""As far as I'm concerned it's a coincidence.""

People reports on an SNL promo that dropped this week featuring her former fiance, as well as actor Jonah Hill and singer Maggie Rogers, in which Davidson introduces himself to Rogers, then immediately asks, ""You wanna get married?"" After Rogers rejects his ""proposal,"" Davidson deadpans for the camera: ""0 for 3"" (ostensibly referencing his failed relationships). Shortly thereafter came the already-deleted and somewhat confusing Grande tweets, which many are taking to be jabs at Davidson. ""For somebody who claims to hate relevancy u sure love clinging to it huh,"" was her first one, followed by, ""thank u, next."" USA Today notes Davidson had previously poked fun of his whirlwind-romance-gone-south during a comedy show last month, in which he quipped: ""Well, as you could tell, I don't want to be here. There's a lot going on."" Grande didn't seem to get (publicly) peeved at that joke.

"– Politicians are getting behind Ted Cruz ... sort of: In a conference call to Minnesota supporters Wednesday that was mostly focused on explaining why he dropped out of the presidential race, Marco Rubio said that he hopes one of the GOP candidates still in the race will keep Donald Trump from becoming the nominee, the St. Paul Pioneer Press reports. He also said that Ted Cruz is ""the only conservative left in the race"" ... but he didn't actually endorse Cruz. (John Kasich is the only other non-Trump contender left.) Another senator and former 2016 presidential contender offered a similar non-endorsement of Cruz: Lindsey Graham tells CNN that he'll headline a fundraiser for Cruz on Monday, a meet-and-greet event during the AIPAC conference in DC. Why? ""I think he's the best alternative to beat Donald Trump. I'm going to help Ted in any way I can,"" Graham explained. Buuuuut, ""He's certainly not my preference,"" Graham added of Cruz. ""But he's a reliable Republican, conservative, which I've had many differences with. John Kasich is the most viable general election candidate. I just don't see how John gets through the primary. This is an outsider year, and he is an insider.""

"– A newly found creature's name is the hog-nosed rat, and things don't get any more picturesque from there. Reporting on their find in the Journal of Mammalogy, scientists describe the animal, found in 2013 on Mount Dako, on Indonesia's Sulawesi Island: It's a long-faced carnivorous creature with ""extremely large ears (~21% of head and body length) [and] very long urogenital hairs""—the latter being pubic hairs. Co-author Kevin Rowe tells Mashable Australia that it's unclear what purpose the hair serves, though ""it probably helps it in some kind of reproductive way. Both males and females have those long ... hairs, like whiskers. They're not like human pubic hairs."" Among its other features: Rowe explains that the 18-inch-long rat's mouth opening is so narrow that it can't open it much. ""It probably eats worms and insect larvae, just kind of slurping them up."" (In line with that slurping, it also lacks the coronoid process on the dentary bone, which other mammals rely on to chew.) KNOE reports it's the third genus newly identified by the international team since 2012 (here's another of the team's finds), and recalls the moment the rat was found—twice. Rowe, of Museum Victoria, and LSU Museum of Natural Science Curator of Mammals Jake Esselstyn went to check their respective traps, saw what was clear to them was a new species, ""came back to camp and were both surprised that the other one had it as well."" The rodent was given the name Hyorhinomys stuempkei, which the Age translates from the Greek as ""'hyo' meaning hog, 'rhino' meaning nose and 'mys' meaning rat.""

"– University of Illinois graduate student Yingying Zhang disappeared in June. The Chinese woman's body has not been found, but federal prosecutors believe that Brendt Christensen is responsible for her murder—and they announced Friday that, with Attorney General Jeff Sessions' blessing, they will pursue the death penalty in their case against him. The Chicago Tribune looks at just how rare a thing such a conviction and sentence would be. Illinois did away with the death penalty in 2011, and its use in federal court is far from commonplace. More on the case, the move, and the growing allegations against Christensen: The Tribune reports the last instance of the federal sentence being imposed in Illinois court was in 2005, when Dr. Ronald Mikos was found guilty of murdering a one-time patient who was cooperating in a Medicare fraud trial against him.

"– It’s a thankless job adapting a literary darling like The Road, and, sure enough, director John Hillcoat hasn’t gotten much thanks. Critics have mixed feelings about the bleak post-apocalyptic film. Here’s what they’re saying: Despite good acting, the film is merely adequate, “an honorable attempt at filming an unfilmable book,” writes Kenneth Turan of the LA Times. “To do more than horrify and depress us, The Road is in need of a finer sensibility.” A devoted Cormac McCarthy fan, Roger Ebert wrestles with his review. “It is powerful, but for me lacks the same core of emotional feeling,” he writes. “I'm not sure this is any fault of the filmmakers.” The movie can only “dully visualize horrors the best writers hint at,” says Ty Burr of the Boston Globe. Still, it’s a “welcome rebuke to the happy-face apocalypse of 2012.” “The Road isn't a masterpiece,” writes Steven Rea in the Philadelphia Inquirer. But it stuck with him, “its images of dread and fear kicking around like such a terrible dream.”","['(Even at that, it has taken a year for the Weinsteins, the producers and distributors of “The Road,’’ to get the nerve to release the film', 'Perhaps McCarthy, like Faulkner, is all but unfilmable', '27 in Chicago', ""Fewer still will have read McCarthy's other works"", 'Old Man Robert Duvall', 'Running time: 119 minutes', 'Wife Charlize Theron', '© Copyright 2009 Globe Newspaper Company', 'com/movienation', 'Rated R', '', 'Printer-friendly »', '""', '"")', 'com', 'boston', ""McCarthy's greatest novels are Suttree and Blood Meridian"", ""It's as dense as poetry"", 'He is a wary traveler, suspecting everyone he sees', 'Ty Burr can be reached at tburr@globe', 'Dimension Films presents a film directed by John Hillcoat', ""Its effect comes above all through McCarthy's prose"", '“A long shear of light and then a series of low concussions', 'November 24, 2009', ""Yet I am grateful for having read McCarthy's"", 'E-mail this to a friend »', 'I realize my own fault is in being so very familiar with Cormac McCarthy', 'It could just mean they’re still alive', 'The Veteran Guy Pearce', 'Written by Joe Penhall, based on the novel by Cormac McCarthy', 'A trap door in a kitchen that leads to something you’d better not think about', 'I yanked it offline as quickly as I could']"
"– Israel launched an airstrike in the Gaza Strip today, in retaliation for the shooting of an Israeli working on the border fence, the Israeli military said, according to the AP. The military gave no hint as to its target or how many casualties it may have inflicted, but Hamas security sources tell CNN that one 4-year-old girl was killed in the strike, and three others were wounded. All four belonged to a family that lived near an al Qassam Brigades camp that the attack appeared to be targeting. A Palestinian sniper shot Salah Shukri Abu Latyef, a 22-year-old civilian engineer, earlier today, the Jerusalem Post reports. He was airlifted to the hospital, where he died of his wounds. Benjamin Netanyahu called it a ""very grave incident,"" and promised to ""react with force"" in accordance with longstanding policy.

"– ""I'm a born burglar,"" says Octave Durham, per the New York Times, which looks at a new documentary about Durham's notorious theft of two Vincent Van Gogh paintings. Set to be broadcast Tuesday on Dutch TV, the 45-minute special by filmmaker Vincent Verweij gets the inside scoop on the 2002 heist Durham says took less than four minutes and nabbed him two works the Times deems ""of inestimable value"": Congregation Leaving the Reformed Church in Nuenen and View of the Sea at Scheveningen. Durham, who was convicted for the burglary in 2004 and spent just over two years in prison, says he passed cops in his getaway car and brags that he'd pulled off ""more spectacular jobs than this""—after years of denying he had any involvement in the theft, per Versopolis.com. In one reveal that may insult art lovers everywhere, Durham notes he didn't run off with the Van Goghs because of any particular love for the great master, or for art in general: He did it because it was an opportunity for a big get. ""That's the eye of a burglar,"" he says. Per NLTimes.com, Durham told a Dutch paper over the weekend he'd wanted to steal two other Van Gogh paintings—Sunflowers and The Potato Eaters—but one was too big to slip out and the other was under heavy security, so he and partner Henk Bieslijn settled on the other two. The Times notes the Van Gogh Museum is still ""furious"" with Durham, who didn't get paid for the film, and refused to help Verweij. The filmmaker defends his choice of cinematic subject, noting, ""You never see documentaries or articles about art theft from the perspective of the thief.""

She said the man was arrested in the Argenteuil suburb Thursday, and told police of a plan to attack Macron on Bastille Day on July 14. Macron will oversee a military parade in Paris that day alongside Trump, per the AP. It wasn't clear whether Trump's presence was a factor in the alleged plot.

Police say he also expressed nationalist views, voicing a desire to attack ""Muslims, Jews, blacks, homosexuals,"" per AFP.

"– The race between Ted Cruz and Beto O'Rourke in Texas is emerging as one of the must-watch races of the midterms. Cruz, of course, is the Republican incumbent hoping to keep his Senate seat, while O'Rourke is a 45-year-old three-term congressman mounting a surprisingly strong challenge. A new poll by Emerson College out this week has the race in a statistical dead heat, reports the Hill, which notes that Texas has not elected a Democrat to the Senate in three decades. Here's a look at the latest, including O'Rourke's growing national profile: Rock star: The Texas GOP tweeted an old photo of O'Rourke this week showing him back in the '90s with his old punk band, Foss. The photo was meant to mock O'Rourke, and some Republicans think it did just that. ""Wearing a dress?"" tweeted one strategist. But an analysis at the Washington Post thinks the photo actually endeared O'Rourke to far more people than it alienated. His ""rock-star status is cemented by Texas GOP, handing Dems an icon they desperately need,"" reads the headline. Oh, he skateboards, too.","[""While Texas has not elected a Democrat to the Senate in three decades, polls continue to show that the race between O'Rourke and Cruz will be tight"", '4 percentage points', 'Tweet with a location', 'Sen', '', 'ADVERTISEMENT']"

"– This winter's flooding in Northern California has done more than bring relief after years of drought; it's created the prospect of the best gold prospecting in 20 years. Gold hunters in the area tell the Chico Enterprise-Record the floods have ""rearranged the rivers"" and ""move things around."" That means gold veins that have been hidden for 200 years are suddenly exposed. According to CBS San Francisco, the floods also swept gold out of abandoned mines and washed it downriver. While KCRA reports that gold can simply be picked off the ground following major flooding, the best prospecting will come in the summer months when the water has receded. Right now, rivers are still high and government workers are trying to keep would-be prospectors away while they get things under control. But in the summer—which experts say could be the busiest since the one that followed major flooding in 1997—stream beds will be exposed for better gold hunting. ""I'm going to have a ball,"" one prospector tells the Chico newspaper. The epicenter for the new gold rush could be the Oroville Dam, which nearly catastrophically flooded this winter and required the use of an emergency spillway for the first time.

"– A California mother is outraged over what she claims is a racist toy her 5-year-old son received for his birthday, the Washington Post reports. Ida Lockett says she was helping her son put together a Playmobil pirate ship set when she came to instructions to put a shackle around the neck of one of the dark-skinned pirates. “It’s definitely racist,” she tells CBS Sacramento. “It told my son to put a slave cuff around the black character’s neck and then to play with the toy.” The boy's aunt, who purchased the pirate ship set, posted on the Playmobil Facebook page that she was mortified. ""Would it be too much to ask for you to just create a regular old black pirate?"" she asks. Playmobil issued a statement defending the toy as a portrayal of life on a 17th-century pirate ship. “If you look at the box, you can see that the pirate figure is clearly a crew member on the pirate ship and not a captive,” the statement reads. “The figure was meant to represent a pirate who was a former slave in a historical context."" But not everyone was mollified by the statement: The Post reports the president of the Sacramento NAACP is calling for the toy to be removed from shelves. In her Facebook post, the boy's aunt claims the pirate ship was the only Playmobil set she could find with a black figure.

"– The Mormon church's big revelations didn't stop with its sacred undergarments: In an online essay titled ""Plural Marriage in Kirtland and Nauvoo,"" the church for the first time declares that founder Joseph Smith was a polygamist, with a footnote stating that ""careful estimates"" put his tally of wives at between 30 and 40. The essay explains that Smith was ordered to take multiple wives by an angel who visited him three times between 1834 and 1842; in the last instance, the angel was armed with a sword and threatened a reluctant Smith. The leader, then married to first wife Emma, took his first plural wife, Fanny Alger, in Kirtland, Ohio. Smith and Alger ultimately separated, and the church relocated to Nauvoo, Ill., where he married many more women. The oldest was 56, and the youngest was 14-year-old Helen Mar Kimball; some were already married, a revelation the New York Times describes as the ""biggest bombshell for some."" The essay explains that a number of marriages, including that with Kimball, were sealed ""for eternity alone,"" suggesting sexual relations weren't involved (the ones that did involve sex were ""for time and eternity""). What did Emma think of all this? Per the essay, she was none too pleased, though at one time she did accept four of Smith's wives into their home. And what was the reasoning behind what the essay describes as the ""wrenching trial"" of polygamy? Kimball said Smith told her that ""the practice of this principle would be the hardest trial the Saints would ever have to test their faith."" Two more essays discuss plural marriage in the church's later years; they're part of an effort the church is making to share ""reliable, faith-promoting"" info about its past, the church's historian tells the Times.

"– Most of the national attention in Tuesday's election is focused on GOP gains in the Senate, but Roll Call points out that Republicans also are poised to hand President Obama a milestone he'd rather avoid in the House. Consider that Democrats lost 63 seats in the 2010 midterms are expected to lose five to 12 (or maybe more) seats on Tuesday. No president has lost as many in back-to-back midterms since Harry Truman lost 83 in 1946 and 1950, writes Stuart Rothenberg. Dwight Eisenhower managed to lose a total of 66, but Obama seems on track to top him. More typical is the pattern of Bill Clinton, who lost 54 in 1994 but bounced back with a gain of five in 1998. Still, if Tuesday is shaping up to be a night of celebration for the GOP, Politico offers a reality check, at least in the Senate: Several first-term Republicans in vulnerable states will be up for re-election in 2016.

A new six-year study of the mammalian family tree, looking at DNA and anatomical evidence in greater detail than ever before, has identified Protungulatum donnae as the most likely common ancestor for all 5,400 placental mammal species, reports the New York Times. The critter, however, is only hypothetical, notes the LA Times, explaining that scientists used data to ""reverse-engineer"" it.

Because Protungulatum donnae would have emerged 200,000 to 400,000 years after the great extinction that ended the dinosaurs—about 36 million years later than previous estimates—scientists say this is a clear sign the rise of the mammals was tied to that mass extinction.

In the last few weeks, more than 150 people across 13 counties have been hospitalized after using synthetic pot laced with what health officials believe to be a type of a rat poison known as brodifacoum, a powerful anti-coagulant. A widely used pesticide, when ingested by humans brodifacoum can cause bleeding from the nose or gums, as well as internal bleeding. Symptoms include coughing up blood and bloody urine, health officials say, and brodifacoum poisoning can be treated with vitamin K administered via IV to stabilize the blood’s clotting ability.

"– When Prime Minister Theresa May entered a room in the House of Commons to speak to Conservative lawmakers ahead of a no-confidence vote Wednesday, she was greeted by table banging—a customary sign of approval, reports the AP. It ended up being a prescient gesture: The BBC reports she needed the votes of 159 MPs to remain the Conservative leader, and she crossed that threshold, winning the confidence vote 200 votes to 117, reports the Guardian. It adds that after the words ""does have confidence in..."" were announced, it could not hear the rest due to the eruption of cheers. But Reuters reports May won't be in it for the long haul. In her pre-vote comments, she pledged to step down in advance of the 2022 parliamentary election.

"– Noticed something a bit off about PBS' A Capitol Fourth broadcast Monday? So did hundreds of people who took to Facebook and Twitter, per NBC News. Though host Tom Bergeron initially laughed off concerns that the live concert and fireworks display over Washington would be rained out, per the Washington Post, the sky above the Capitol Building was foggy and overcast as the fireworks began. That made seeing the show a bit difficult—so PBS intervened. Mingled with misty footage of fireworks over the Capitol building, with scaffolding clearly visible, was stock footage of fireworks from previous celebrations. Viewers were quick to call out the ""fraudulent"" scheme—there was no disclaimer during the ""live"" broadcast—noting the stock footage showed a clear sky over the Capitol Building, and no scaffolding, per the Post. Afterward, the show admitted to showing ""a combination of the best fireworks from this year and previous years"" because of the poor conditions. ""It was the patriotic thing to do,"" reads a tweet from the Capitol Fourth account. ""We apologize for any confusion this may have caused."" The apology didn't appease some, though. ""How is using stock video patriotic?"" one user wrote. ""If I wanted that, I'd watch YouTube.""

"– The AP reports that President Trump hit the links on his Florida golf course the day after Thanksgiving, but before he did, he rehashed a topic that's long been on his mind, with seeming impatience. ""Republicans and Democrats MUST come together, finally, with a major Border Security package, which will include funding for the Wall,"" he tweeted, referring to the border barrier he wants erected between the US and Mexico. ""After 40 years of talk, it is finally time for action. Fix the Border, for once and for all, NOW!"" The Hill notes there's a Dec. 7 deadline Congress must meet to fund the remaining parts of government that are still not funded, and Trump has said he'd be OK with shutting down the government if the wall isn't included in any upcoming funding packages. ""Could there be a shutdown? There certainly could, and it will be about border security, of which the wall is a part,"" the president told reporters Thursday, per Reuters, which notes Democrats, who just gained control of the House in the midterms, may now be less amenable to giving in to Trump on this matter.

"– The Ice Bucket Challenge is now claiming former heads of state as victims. But former President George W. Bush didn't really want to have a bucket of ice water dumped on his head. ""I do not think it's presidential,"" he says in a video posted today on Facebook. He opts instead to write a check, but Laura Bush had other plans. She sneakily arrives on camera with a bucket in hand, and … well, you can guess what happens next. ""That check is from me. I don't want to ruin my hairstyle,"" she quips. Bush was challenged to join the cause by several people, including daughter Jenna Bush Hager, CNN reports. Dubya passes on the challenge to Bill Clinton, saying ""yesterday was Bill's birthday and my gift to Bill is a bucket of cold water."" President Obama has apparently agreed that getting splashed with water isn't presidential—he's written a check to an ALS charity. The Ice Bucket Challenge has raised $22.9 million, reports NBC.

"– If you thought being an international superstar was about as crazy as your life could get, think again. Cracked and The Stir round up 15 celebrities with even crazier (and some of them very painful) backgrounds: Woody Harrelson's dad, who walked out on the family in 1968, was a contract killer who probably got away with killing at least two people before going to prison. Then, when he got out early, he was hired to murder a judge, and he went back to prison. Woody tried to get him a retrial, but he died in 2007. Kelsey Grammer first lost his mom and grandpa, whom he lived with. Two years later, his dad was shot to death on his front lawn by a crazed taxi driver. Then his younger sister was murdered by a gang of robbers in a Red Lobster parking lot. Then his two half-brothers died in scuba diving accidents. As if that's not all bad enough, a good friend was killed on 9/11, another good friend was murdered by his own wife, and one of his former wives tried to kill herself and ended up killing their unborn child. Olivia Newton-John's parents fled Germany when the Nazis took over, and her dad ended up getting a job interrogating captured Nazi pilots—not over torture, but over dinner and drinks. One of his interrogations led to the capture of Deputy Fuhrer Rudolf Hess. He later joined MI5's code-breakers and decoded German messages, including secret battle plans that helped the Allies win World War II. Charlize Theron's father was verbally abusive, and while the actress was growing up in South Africa, he once came home drunk and started shooting at Charlize and her mother. Theron's mom managed to get the gun, and ended up killing her husband. Jack Nicholson was born out of wedlock to a 19-year-old aspiring actress, so her parents raised him as their own and he grew up believing his mom was his sister. Leighton Meester's parents and her aunt went to prison when the actress was just a baby, after getting busted smuggling 1,200 pounds of marijuana from Jamaica. Her aunt ended up escaping prison and got on the US Marshals' 15 Most Wanted List. Tobey Maguire's dad robbed a bank across the street from his house—in broad daylight, without a mask. He was caught, not surprisingly, and went to prison for two years.

"– President Trump may not have had the biggest inauguration crowd in history, but he may have made a bigger fuss about media coverage of it than any of his predecessors. Sources tell the Washington Post and CNN that on Saturday morning—the first morning of his presidency—Trump contacted Michael T. Reynolds, the National Park Service's acting director, to demand more photos of the crowd on the National Mall. Reynolds, who has worked for the service for 30 years, was ""taken aback"" by the request, but he sent some aerial photos to Trump, according to the Post's sources. The photos did not, however, provide proof of Trump's claim that more than a million people had gathered to watch his inauguration. Reynolds and the NPS have declined to comment, but insiders say Trump also expressed anger over an NPS tweet comparing his crowd to Obama's, which apparently led to an order for all Interior Department accounts to stop tweeting. White House deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed that Trump contacted the NPS. She said the call demonstrated the president is ""so accessible, and constantly in touch."" ""He's not somebody who sits around and waits. He takes action and gets things done,"" she said. ""That's one of the reasons that he is president today, and Hillary Clinton isn't."" (Trump was still talking about the size of his inaugural crowd on Wednesday, when he gave his first interview as president.)","['The trouble began late Friday, when the agency’s official Twitter account retweeted two messages that could be perceived as critical of the new administration: the one comparing the relative crowd size for Trump’s inauguration to that of Obama’s 2009 swearing-in, and another that noted policy pages that had been removed from the White House’s website', '“It’s a lie,” Trump said', 'We caught them in a beauty', 'Look how far back it goes', 'Those tweets were then deleted', 'Sarah L', 'Jan', '', '""', 'S', '20', '”', 'C', '“He’s not somebody who sits around and waits', '[Federal agencies ordered to restrict their communications]', 'This crowd was massive', '[Interior Department reactivates Twitter accounts after shutdown following inauguration]', 'He takes action and gets things done,” Sanders said', '20, 2017 Keilaun Wilson of Columbia, S', 'Trump called Michael T', 'Crosson then apologized on Twitter for “mistaken RTs from our account', '8 billion budget and more than 22,000 employees']"
"– Jerry Sandusky and his wife, Dottie, blamed his victims for his sex abuse conviction in letters written to the judge before his sentencing earlier this week. Instead of expressing regret, the Sanduskys labeled the young men ingrates and liars in the letters, which have now been made public, CNN reports. Sandusky pointed out that the boys came from unstable homes. ""Nobody mentioned the impact of abandonment, neglect, abuse, insecurity, and conflicting messages that the biological parents might have had in this,"" he wrote. The couple, echoing a recording Sandusky made before sentencing, blamed his downfall on a vast conspiracy involving police and the media. In one letter, Dottie describes the couple's adopted son, Matt, who accuses Sandusky of molesting him, as a liar and a thief, the Philadelphia Inquirer reports. A spokesman for the state attorney general's office describes Sandusky's behavior as ""banal, self-delusional, completely untethered from reality. It was entirely-self-focused, as if he himself were the victim.""

"– North and South Korea will compete together under one unified flag at next month's Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, in what will be the first such arrangement since 2006. South Korea previously announced North Korea would send officials, athletes, and a cheer squad to the Olympics following talks between the two countries. It has now revealed North Korea's intention to send a 550-member delegation. Among those arriving in South Korea beginning on Jan. 25 will be female ice hockey players joining a team of South Korean athletes (they'll compete under a flag showing the Korean Peninsula in blue on a white background), as well as 230 cheerleaders, 140 orchestra members, and 30 people who will take part in a taekwondo demonstration, report Sky News and CNN. Ahead of the Olympics, skiers from both countries will also train together in North Korea, per CNN. The thawing of relations between the North and South has drawn praise from some. But others, like Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono, fear Kim Jong Un only hopes to ease international pressure while continuing to develop a nuclear weapons arsenal. ""It is not the time to ease pressure, or to reward North Korea,"" Kono said Tuesday in Vancouver, Canada, where 20 countries met and agreed to consider tougher sanctions on the North, per Reuters.

"– Written motions finally evolved into verbal arguments this morning in Baltimore, where defense attorneys for two of the six officers charged in the arrest and death of Freddie Gray tried to have said charges dismissed and the office of State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby recused from the case—attempts that were both rejected by Judge Barry Williams, the Baltimore Sun reports. The defense attorneys argued, among other things, that Mosby had influenced the jury pool by ""[adopting] and [encouraging] the public's cry of 'no justice, no peace'"" when she publicly announced the charges against the officers in May. Another complaint by the defense: Mosby's judgment was influenced by her husband serving as councilman for a local district that saw a ""disproportionate amount of violence"" in the days after Gray's death, the AP reports. Williams called that assertion ""condescending"" and said while he was ""troubled"" by some of Mosby's comments during her May 1 news conference, the defendants' right to a fair trial wasn't compromised by her statements, per the AP. The hearing is expected to continue this afternoon to determine whether the trial for the six officers should be split up.

"– ""I believe you!!!"" Mira Sorvino writes in an open letter to Dylan Farrow published by the HuffPost. The actor reached out to Woody Allen's daughter Wednesday to apologize for starring in her father's Mighty Aphrodite—for which she won an Oscar—while ignoring Farrow's claims of sexual abuse against Allen. Farrow was 7 when she said Allen sexually touched her, and a judge later found her claims credible, though Allen has continually denied the allegations, Vulture reports. Sorvino says she was aware of Farrow's claims when she made Mighty Aphrodite but dismissed them ""as an outgrowth of a twisted custody battle"" because of her lifelong love of Allen's work. ""It is difficult to sever ties and denounce your heroes, your benefactors, whom you fondly admired and felt a debt of gratitude toward for your entire career’s existence,"" she writes. Sorvino says her experience opening up to Farrow's brother, reporter Ronan Farrow, about Harvey Weinstein made her want to learn more about Dylan Farrow's allegations, which led to her taking those allegations seriously. Sorvino says her love of Allen's work ""does not excuse my turning a blind eye to your story simply because I wanted desperately for it not to be so."" She says she won't work with Allen again, writing: ""We are in a day and age when everything must be re-examined. This kind of abuse cannot be allowed to continue. If this means tearing down all the old gods, so be it."" Sorvino isn't the first actor to denounce Allen. Greta Gerwig and David Krumholtz recently said they regret working with him.

"– Tsai Ing-wen promised a ""new era"" for Taiwan on Saturday after being elected as the island's first female president. The 59-year-old, from the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party, defeated the Nationalist Party's Eric Chu with around 60% of the vote, reports the Los Angeles Times. Tsai will take office in May. Nationalist President Ma Ying-jeou has already served two terms and Taiwan's constitution didn't allow him to seek a third, the AP notes. ""We failed. The Nationalist Party lost the elections. We didn't work hard enough,"" Chu told supporters at party headquarters, announcing his resignation as party chief.

"– Michael Cohen's legal woes appeared to deepen Tuesday night with a bombshell release from Stormy Daniels' attorney. According to financial records reviewed by the New York Times and NBC News, a company linked to a Russian oligarch targeted by US sanctions deposited around $500,000 into an account controlled by Essential Consultants, the shell company Cohen used to pay hush money to Daniels before the 2016 election. Michael Avenatti alleges that funds from oligarch Viktor Vekselberg may have ""replenished the account"" in a series of payments in 2017 after the Daniels settlement, though Columbus Nova, a US affiliate of a Vekselberg company, denies that he was involved in its payments to Trump's personal lawyer, the Washington Post reports. The purpose of the company's payments is unclear. Sources tell CNN that Robert Mueller's investigators have already quizzed Vekselberg about the payments to Cohen's company. Records reviewed by the Times show that around $4.4 million flowed through the Essential Consultants account between its creation weeks before the 2016 election and January this year, including hundreds of thousands of dollars from pharmaceutical firm Novartis, AT&T, and Korea Aerospace. AT&T confirmed the payments late Tuesday, saying Cohen's firm was among those it ""engaged in early 2017 to provide insights into understanding the new administration,"" the AP reports. Cohen isn't a registered lobbyist, and while the unusual payments may not have broken any laws, Trump and his attorney ""have a lot of explaining to do,"" Avenatti said in a tweet Tuesday.","['The purpose of the payments, which predate the sanctions, and the nature of the business relationship between Vekselberg and Cohen is unclear', 'Korea Aerospace Industries made a $150,000 payment to Essential in November 2017', ""At that time, he was still Trump's personal lawyer"", 'After publication, Columbus Nova provided a statement from its attorney, Richard Owens', 'By law, only U', 'Manafort has pleaded not guilty', 'Mueller III', 'First Republic also declined comment', 'Who knew Mr', 'Campaign donations under scrutiny', '(Associated Press)', 'Lamesa now holds a 9', 'Clifford', 'inaugural committee', 'Alexei Nikolsky / TASS via Getty Images file', 'Air Force', 'https://www', 'dropbox', '', '""', 'S', '”', '___', '(Seth Wenig/AP)', 'government', 'Alice Crites, Carol D', 'What FBI agents wanted to know', 'Avenatti said his investigation uncovered that $4', ""Attorney's office in Manhattan"", '[Analysis: How money flowed through Michael Cohen’s multipurpose shell company]', 'Vekselberg was targeted for U', 'government business interests', 'com/s/pskgpwr15r48tx5/Executive%20Summary', 'Mr', 'Trump denies having an affair with Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford', 'AT&T confirmed its connection Tuesday evening', 'representative of a key Russian figure', '/ Updated By Sarah Fitzpatrick, Tracy Connor, Tom Winter and Ben Collins', 'Avenatti’s document might provide a road map to those clients', ""That's unusual"", 'Columbus Nova hired Cohen as U', 'In a statement, Novartis said it had a one-year agreement with Essential Consultants, ""focused on U', 'He could not be reached for immediate comment', '""This thing\'s ugly and it\'s gonna get worse', 'affiliate is Vekselberg’s cousin, Andrew Intrater, a U', 'Cohen — ‘accounting advice,’ ‘real estate consulting,’ ‘insight,’ etc', ""Intrater was also questioned by Mueller's investigators, two sources told CNN"", 'Nicholas Biase, a spokesperson for the U', '-based affiliate of a Russian billionaire with close ties to Russian President Vladi\xadmir Putin', 'pdf?dl=0 … Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports', 'healthcare policy matters,"" that expired in February', 'CNN has not independently authenticated the documents', ""Cohen disputed Avenatti's accounting but provided no details"", 'He built his fortune, currently estimated by Forbes at $14', 'government, the company said Tuesday', ""Update: This story has been updated to include Columbus Nova's latest statement"", 'Trump and Mr', 'Vekselberg questioned by Mueller probe investigators', 'Avenatti also said he had uncovered:', 'The Executive Summary from our first Preliminary Report on Findings may be accessed via the link below', 'Cohen was such a brilliant renaissance man?”', 'While it is illegal for foreigners to donate to US politics, Intrater is American', 'In particular, Avenatti identified eight transactions between January and August 2017, totaling half a million dollars, from U', '4 million flowed through a First Republic account linked to Essential Consultants between October 2016 and January 2018', 'The chief executive of the U', 'An attorney for Vekselberg did not respond to a request for comment, nor did representatives for his company in Russia', 'Avenatti says he has information showing that', ""Cohen is currently under investigation by federal prosecutors in New York, but hasn't been charged"", ""Ross resigned from his position as vice chairman of the bank after he was confirmed as Trump's commerce secretary"", 'citizens and legal permanent residents can donate to a U', 'Each has important business considerations with the U', ""Vekselberg's cousin Intrater gave generously to support Trump"", 'KAI did not respond to requests for comment', ""He noted reports that said Trump met with Novartis' CEO in January 2018"", 'Columbus Nova has also registered many alt-right internet domains, though the domains return an error message']"

Michael David Elliot, 40, allegedly stole a woman's red jeep and abandoned it in the small town of Shipshewana, Indiana, this afternoon. A woman spotted the car and called police, who said the vehicle had been seen in the area as early as 5:30am. Knowing Elliot ""can go a lot of places in seven hours,"" police went door-to-door and had schools locked down before releasing students under a heavy police presence. Then a call about a stolen vehicle came in to the LaPorte County Sheriff's Office, and a deputy saw the vehicle and attempted a traffic stop, WOOD-TV reports. But the driver kept going and led authorities on a 5-minute chase. Stop sticks disabled his tires in Kankakee Township; Elliot jumped out and tried to run but was arrested and booked.

"– The US has misspent “tens of billions of dollars” on contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan—at minimum—according to a new report from a bipartisan commission set up to scrutinize the issue. The report bemoaned problems like “ill-conceived projects,” “poor planning and oversight by the US government, as well as poor performance on the part of contractors,” and even “criminal behavior and blatant corruption,” according to the Atlantic. “War by its nature entails waste,” committee member Jim Webb tells CNN. “But the scale of the problems in Iraq and Afghanistan also reflects the toxic interplay of huge sums of money pumped into relatively small economies and an unprecedented reliance on contractors.” The report criticizes the government for too routinely using contractors for too many tasks—including monitoring other contractors. It also complained that “untrustworthy” companies continue to win contracts, because there are barriers to suspending or banning them, the Huffington Post notes.

"– More than 100 cars and dozens of tractor trailers have been caught up in a chain of accidents stretching over several miles of the Pennsylvania Turnpike in Bensalem this morning, backing up traffic for several more miles behind that. The first accident came at about 7:45am on the westbound side, causing a rubbernecking delay on the eastbound side—where the subsequent crashes occurred beginning at 8am, Fox 29 Philadelphia reports. Icy conditions are believed to be responsible—though residents say that stretch of road is so notoriously treacherous that accidents sometimes occur there in good weather. One crash site involves roughly 75 cars and several tractor trailers, CBS 3 Philadelphia reports. Another 30 cars were involved in another big wreck, in which a tractor trailer jackknifed, reportedly landing on top of at least four cars. Emergency crews are now using the westbound side to transport out the wounded. At least five people have been hospitalized so far.

"– It started with a candy wrapper and ended (for now) in a courtroom. Nestle's attempts to trademark the shape of its ""four-fingered"" KitKat have been rejected by the European Court of Justice, which ruled that shape alone isn't enough to recognize it as a KitKat, the BBC reports. The decision was a setback for Nestle—which manages the brand overseas; Hershey is licensed to sell the brand here in the US—and a victory for Cadbury, which was trying to block the trademark. The ruling means that, for now, other candy companies can make similar-looking chocolate bars. Nestle, which reaped more than $60 million a year from 2008 to 2010 in the UK from KitKat, argued that the four-fingered design has become inextricably associated with the KitKat brand over the past eight decades, Bloomberg notes. But Cadbury said the shape wasn't enough to make a consumer automatically think ""KitKat,"" and the court agreed. The BBC even notes that in Norway, a lesser-known chocolate bar called Kvikk Lunsj (""quick lunch"") has been around for nearly as long as KitKat. The fight between the two confectionary giants is the second major brouhaha they've had in recent years: In 2013, Nestle managed to block Cadbury's attempts to trademark its signature purple-colored chocolate wrappers, per Bloomberg. KitKat case now heads back to the UK High Court, which will render a final decision.

Jamie Merrett was starved of oxygen for 21 minutes before paramedics arrived. Merrett, 37, was paralyzed from the neck down after a car accident 8 years ago but had been able to talk, operate a wheelchair, and use a computer before the nurse's blunder.

In her first public comments about ""El Chapo,"" beauty queen Emma Coronel says she fears he may not survive the ""slow torture"" of solitary confinement at El Altiplano, the prison he left through a mile-long tunnel last year.

"– The ongoing eruption of Hawaii's Kilauea volcano is creating new worries for residents—including the risk of ""vog,"" or volcanic smog. Big Island residents have been warned that a change in the wind is expected to increase the risk of vog, which contains potentially deadly sulfur dioxide gas, Reuters reports. Gov. David Ige has warned that more mass evacuations will be needed as new cracks in the ground send lava and toxic gas into new neighborhoods near the volcano. Ige has asked President Trump to declare a disaster in the state so that federal money can be used in the event of large-scale evacuations by air and sea, the AP reports. Forecasters say Big Island residents are likely to face higher levels of sulfur dioxide Friday, which is especially dangerous for children, the elderly, and those with respiratory conditions, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Trade winds are expected to ease conditions by Saturday morning. Amid fears that the volcano, one of the world's most active, could erupt explosively, flammable pentane has been removed from a geothermal plant near two neighborhoods that had to be evacuated because of lava and gas. Kilauea is surrounded by Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, which closed Thursday night until further notice. Scientists had warned that if the volcano erupts, park visitors within a mile or so of the crater were at risk of being hit by refrigerator-sized boulders.","['Surfers bobbing in the ocean off Kona on the west side of the Big Island complained of the smog that could be seen in a haze over the coast', 'Honolulu Star-Advertiser writers Dan Nakaso and Kristen Consillio contributed to this report', 'Hawaii Gov', 'Workers have removed flammable pentane from a nearby geothermal plant', ""Ige says there's potential for a larger-scale evacuation as more fissures open"", 'Geological Survey’s Hawaiian Volcano Observatory at Kilauea told a news briefing', '“If you’re wearing clothing, there’s no risk,” he said', '“It’s just horrible', '""We\'ve', '2 kilometers) away', '12:30 p', '10:15 a', '12 a', 'WXCHASING via REUTERS', '', '(GRAPHIC: Scorched earth - tmsnrt', 'rs/2IldVyS)', '‘BALLISTIC BLOCKS’', '2 km)', 'S', '”', 'SHARE', 'ADVERTISING', 'Environmental Protection Agency', 'Sgt', '(Associated Press)', '2 p', 'm', '___', '11 a', '8:20 a', '8 to 3', '“They’re having difficulty breathing and respiratory issues', 'State officials estimate it will cost more than $2', 'Some two dozen homes have burned', 'Gov', 'Lava advances towards a metal barrier in Puna, May 6, 2018', 'Apau Hawaii Tours/via REUTERS', 'However, earthquakes continue and additional fissure outbreaks are expected', 'We’re making sure we’re stocked so we’re ready to go', 'Active eruption of lava from fissures some 25 miles (40', 'Pentane is a flammable liquid similar to lighter fluid, or butane', 'Hilo Medical Center, however, has not seen an increase in respiratory patients, she said', 'Hawaii Volcano Observatory scientist Tina Neal says communities a mile or two away may be showered by pea-sized fragments or dusted with nontoxic ash', 'The Puna Geothermal Venture is owned by Nevada company Ormat Technologies', 'County officials say as of Thursday 15 fissures have emerged']"

"– Ticks are out in force this year, and there's one species in particular you should watch out for if you'd ever like to eat meat again. Experts say the lone star tick appears to be spreading from its home base in the southeastern US. Whereas other ticks can spread ailments such as Lyme disease, the lone star tick is bothersome because it is believed to trigger a potentially life-threatening and apparently lifelong meat allergy with its bite. The tick doesn't technically make people allergic to meat, but rather to a sugar molecule found in red meat known as alpha-gal. This alpha-gal allergy has typically been limited to the southeastern US, where the lone star tick is prevalent, but no more, reports Wired. Cases—in which the consumption of meat can result in hives, difficulty breathing, or death—have been reported in Minnesota, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and New York, per Inverse. Long Island has seen at least 100 cases in the last year. Researchers suspect the spread of the allergy coincides with the spread of lone star ticks, though it's also possible that other ticks are responsible. Either way, ""the nuisance level [for lone star ticks] is much higher than the black-legged tick,"" an expert tells the Weston Forum. ""It is aggressive and very abundant."" Researchers are currently studying the effect of a lone star tick bite on mice to determine why it triggers the allergy.

"– Pooping in space ""isn't glamorous, but it is necessary for survival,"" an astronaut explains—yet it's presenting quite a challenge for NASA. See, while the International Space Station has a pretty fancy toilet, an astronaut must wear a diaper during launch and landing activities or while spacewalking. But as NASA looks toward future missions in deep space, it's also looking for a way for astronauts to relieve themselves while remaining in their space suits for up to six days, reports Time. That's where you come in. The agency is offering a $30,000 prize in a ""space poop challenge"" if someone can create ""a system inside a space suit that collects human waste for up to 144 hours and routes it away from the body, without the use of hands."" There are plenty of stipulations. For example, the system ""needs to take no more than five minutes [to set up]"" as an astronaut might be forced to jump into their suit quickly in an emergency, per Space.com. While such a challenge might seem humorous, a solution ""could be the difference between life and death,"" notes the contest website. ""You don't want any of these solids and fluids stuck to your body for six days,"" NASA adds in a release.

"– Amtrak is taking its lumps after a Twitter misfire. In response to a woman's tweet about being stuck in an Amtrak elevator at Baltimore-Washington International Airport, Amtrak tweeted on Wednesday, ""We are sorry to hear that. Are you still in the elevator?"" Well, no. Amanda Carpenter's plea for help had actually gone out seven months earlier, and Amtrak failed to notice the elapsed time. Carpenter, who is Ted Cruz's former communications director, responded, ""Oh, my thank you for this but I was trapped months ago. Like last February. Thanks for checking...? Ha."" The gaffe has brought all kinds of ridicule and memes down upon Amtrak, as rounded up by Mashable. ""Not our finest hour,"" acknowledged the company in a followup tweet. It seems that Carpenter's original tweet resurfaced all these months later because somebody retweeted it for some reason, and whoever responded on behalf of Amtrak simply didn't see the date. In fairness to the company, it responded to the original tweet just 16 minutes after Carpenter sent the request for help, telling her that ""BWI agents are aware of you, and are working to get you out."" Amtrak has now offered Carpenter a free train ride over the mess, but that didn't stop Twitter users from poking fun at what one guy calls ""the worst customer service response time ever."" Another used a gif of a skeleton holding a telephone.","['Are you still in the elevator? — Amtrak (@Amtrak) September 7, 2016', 'Add a location to your Tweets', 'It was an honest mistake that anyone could have made', 'twitter', '', 'Guys', '@amandacarpenter Not our finest hour yesterday', '[h/t:Vocativ]', 'Wanted to make sure']"
"– North Korea's ""Day of the Sun"" became the ""Day of the Flop"" after an attempt to mark its founder's birthday with a missile launch fizzled, according to South Korean officials. An official from South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff says the missile launch from the country's east coast early Friday deviated from a normal trajectory, the Washington Post reports. An American military official says the US also detected and tracked the failed launch, which took place on the most important day in Pyongyang's calendar, the birthday of Kim Il Sung. Officials suspect the missile was a Musudan intermediate-range missile, also known as a BM-25, which Pyongyang has displayed in military parades but never tested before. The country fired a different kind of medium-range missile into the sea last month. Even North Korea's closest ally denounced the latest launch attempt, reports Reuters. The launch, ""though failed, marks the latest in a string of saber-rattling that, if unchecked, will lead the country to nowhere,"" China's Xinhua news agency said. ""Nuclear weapons will not make Pyongyang safer. On the contrary, its costly military endeavors will keep on suffocating its economy.""

"– After four years of mapping our planet's gravity, the European Space Agency's GOCE satellite has plunged back to Earth. The GOCE—Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer—was last heard from 75 miles over Antarctica, Reuters reports. It is believed to have burned up on re-entry, with hundreds of pounds of surviving debris scattering somewhere in the Western Pacific. Its gradiometer, the instrument used to make gravity measurements, is made of materials tough enough to survive the fall to Earth, the BBC notes. GOCE—the planet's lowest-flying scientific satellite—mapped Earth's gravitational field in never-before-seen detail, revealing how gravity's pull is uneven across the world. The satellite's fall to Earth, which was inevitable after it ran out of fuel a few weeks ago, was the ESA's first uncontrolled re-entry in decades. But since GOCE was relatively light at 1.2 tons, it didn't attract the same attention as other recent re-entries, including the crash of a failed Russian probe last year.","[""Engineers monitoring the last hours of the satellite from Europe's Space Operations Centre in Darmstadt, Germany, observed Goce to keep a straight-on approach as it dipped deeper and deeper into the atmosphere"", 'Its maps have very broad applications', 'Tracking project', '', 'm', ""In January 2012, Russia's failed 14-ton (12,700-kg) Phobos-Grunt Mars probe returned"", ""5-ton (5,900-kg) Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite and Germany's 2"", ""In 2011, NASA's 6"", 'The 1', '""Goce survived for a few minutes longer than we expected - but since re-entries are difficult to predict, this is not very surprising,"" Holger Krag from Esa\'s Space Debris Office told BBC News', '4-ton (2,177-kg) X-ray ROSAT telescope re-entered the atmosphere', 'A signal from Goce was last acquired at 22:42 GMT on Sunday as it passed 121km (75 miles) above Antarctica', 'EST Sunday (0016 GMT Monday) near the Falkland Islands', 'Goce (Gravity Field and Steady-State Ocean Circulation Explorer) was launched in 2009 as part of a series of innovative environmental research satellites', 'Its sophisticated gradiometer - the instrument used to make gravity measurements - incorporated composite materials which were expected to ride out the destructive forces that would ordinarily incinerate traditional components', 'Statistics show that there is typically at least one piece of tracked space ""junk"" re-entering the Earth\'s atmosphere every day; with, on average, one intact defunct spacecraft or old rocket body coming back every week']"
"– A man who went on a murder rampage against white people in San Francisco 40 years ago has died at San Quentin. NBC News reports that JCX Simon, 69, one of four notorious ""Zebra killers,"" was found unresponsive in his cell. An autopsy is pending. Simon and three others were convicted of killing 14 random white victims and wounding seven others from October 1973 to April 1974. Most were shot in the back or execution-style while walking down a street, reports the San Francisco Chronicle. They were dubbed the ""Zebra"" killings because investigators used the Z channel radio band to communicate, explains the newspaper. At one point, the manhunt was so intense that police stopped and questioned any black men who remotely resembled the suspects—until a federal judge ruled that the stops were unconstitutional. The LA Times reports that the men hoped to ""run all the whites out of San Francisco"" and make the city headquarters for a group known as the Death Angels, an offshoot of the Fruit of Islam, which provided security for the Nation of Islam. The other three killers are still serving life sentences without parole at separate prisons.","['The 69-year-old Simon was convicted in San Francisco of two counts of first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit murder and assault with a deadly weapon in 1976 after the killing spree, which prompted what authorities said was the biggest manhunt in the city’s history', 'Police, acting on a tip by an informant, eventually raided an apartment complex at 844 Grove St', 'SOCIAL', '', 'C', 'X', 'm', '”', 'J', 'pic', 'twitter', 'com/5NZMeOeM3t — John Zuchelli (@tvzuke) March 13, 2015', 'Seven men were arrested, but only Cooks, Green, Moore and Simons were charged', 'Jim Jones, who forced his followers to drink cyanide-laced punch', 'Dan White also murdered Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk that decade', 'He was pronounced dead at 11:59 p']"
"– If you want to convey something affectionate or romantic and you can't do it in person, it may be better to send an email than leave a voicemail. So report researchers at Indiana University Bloomington in the journal Computers in Human Behavior after analyzing both the messages being sent and the physical state of those doing the sending. Contrary to previous research and conventional wisdom suggesting that a voicemail message is more intimate than email, this study finds that, at least among the 72 college-age millennials analyzed, the act of writing produced in the sender far more emotional arousal and greater use of emotional language. The effect endures, too, since people tend to respond to messages using the same medium, thus the recipient may in turn experience similarly heightened emotions when replying, reports Pacific Standard. ""When writing romantic emails, senders consciously or subconsciously added more positive content to their messages, perhaps to compensate for the medium's inability to convey vocal tone,"" Dennis and Wells wrote in the paper. ""Senders engage with email messages longer and may think about the task more deeply than when leaving voicemails. This extra processing may increase arousal."" What's more, the students they studied have, they feel, adapted to the medium. ""If you look at the new generation of millennials, and that's who we studied, they've grown up with email and text messaging,"" one researcher says. ""So it may not be as unnatural a medium as we at first thought."" Or, perhaps, voicemail is just more awkward.

"– Toronto police have a suspect in a gruesome case in which body parts were mailed to at least two places, reports the local Star. The suspect is 29-year-old Luka Rocco Magnotta, described by CP24 of Toronto as a low-budget porn actor who has reportedly posted a wide range of disturbing videos, including the torture of cats. So far, three body parts believed to be from the same male victim have been discovered: a torso in a suitcase behind a Montreal building where Magnotta lived; a foot mailed to Conservative Party headquarters in Ottawa; and a hand at a postal warehouse, also in Ottawa. The hand was reportedly addressed to Canada's Liberal Party, according to the CBC. Police aren't saying much about the case, other than that Magnotta and the victim knew each other.

"– Donald Trump woke everyone from their pre-Christmas slumber Thursday with a tweet calling for a strengthened and expanded US nuclear arsenal. His tweet followed remarks made earlier by Vladimir Putin in which he called for his country's ""need to strengthen the military potential of strategic nuclear forces,"" per Yahoo. On Friday, Trump doubled down on his previous remarks during what Politico calls an ""off-air conversation"" on MSNBC's Morning Joe. ""Let it be an arms race … we will outmatch them at every pass and outlast them all,"" he said. (Politico notes some flip-flopping on nuclear issues, citing a March New York Times interview in which he said, ""It's a very scary nuclear world. Biggest problem, to me, in the world, is nuclear, and proliferation."") Not in on his latest stance, apparently: his own team. Per a transcript posted by NBC's Katy Tur on Twitter, Trump's new White House counselor Kellyanne Conway told Rachel Maddow Thursday night ""we're getting ahead of ourselves"" when Maddow mentioned a ""new nuclear arms race."" And, per a tweet by CNN's David Wright, incoming White House press secretary Sean Spicer insisted on Today Friday that ""there is not going to be"" an arms race and that ""we will all be just fine."" A short time later on CNN's New Day, Spicer said the remarks Trump made to Morning Joes' Mika Brzezinski ""was a private conversation. I was not privy to that,"" per Mediaite.

"– The disappearance of another jet in Southeast Asia while the fate of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 remains a mystery comes as a shock to the aviation world, but experts stress that the two cases are very different. The New York Times runs through some of the differences with AirAsia Flight 8501: Unlike with Flight 370, there has been no sign that anybody on Flight 8501 intentionally disabled any onboard systems, meaning that investigators should have the normal automatic transmissions from the flight to help the search. Flight 370 disappeared on a clear night, while Flight 8501 was believed to have encountered stormy weather, with weather agencies having reported lightning strikes along its route. The AirAsia pilot's last communication with air traffic control was a request ""to avoid clouds by turning left and going higher to 38,000 feet."" Flight 370's pilot was very experienced, with more than 18,000 hours of flying time, while the combined experience of Flight 8501's pilot and co-pilot is believed to be less than half that. Neither Flight 370 nor Flight 8501 issued an emergency distress call, but, as the AP notes, ""pilots are trained to focus first on the emergency at hand and then communicate only when free,"" and there's no sign that the AirAsia flight diverted sharply from its intended course the way the Malaysia Airlines flight did. Another major difference is the search area for Flight 8501, which is much smaller and shallower than the vast area that has been searched for Flight 370. ""We are not talking about the deep Indian Ocean here,"" says CNN aviation correspondent Richard Quest. ""We are talking about congested airspace around Southeast Asia.

"– Police are no longer seeking the whereabouts of a blue Porsche after a quadruple murder in an upscale Washington, DC, neighborhood—but they've released video of a ""person of interest"" who may have been driving it before it was found burning behind a church. In surveillance video, a hooded figure in dark clothing can be seen moving outside the house where Savvas and Amy Savopoulos were found dead after a fire on Thursday, NBC Washington reports. Two other bodies found in the home are believed to be the couple's 10-year-old son, Philip, and Veralicia Figueroa, one of their housekeepers. Their other housekeeper, Nelitza Gutierrez, tells the Washington Post that she thought something odd was going on Wednesday when she received messages asking her not to come in the next day. Gutierrez says Savvas Savopoulos gave conflicting information in different messages and sounded unlike himself. ""It was something very suspicious because I felt his voice was really tense,"" she tells the Post. ""And it was different than what he had said to me before."" She says she also found it strange that Savopoulos said Figueroa was spending the night at the home, something she had never known to happen before. Deepening the mystery, police documents seen by the Post detail some strange events in the surrounding area that week, including reports of a possible prowler, a man banging at the door of a home, and an ""aggressive vacuum cleaner salesman"" at another home.","['Firefighters arrived at the large home in the 3200 block of Woodland Drive NW midday Thursday to find smoke and fire coming out of the roof', 'They said Friday that three victims had wounds', ""'s Metropolitan Police Department"", 'Albans school, where Phillip was a student', ', Gutierrez got a text message from Amy Savopoulos: “I am making sure you do not come today', 'Video Camera Captures Girl Dragged by School Bus', '“Never, never did she stay over', '(Tony Powell/Washington Life Magazine)', 'Victoria St', '(Published Monday, May 18, 2015)', 'Minutes before 10 a', 'D', 'C', '', 'm', '”', 'Sophia Greek Orthodox \xadCathedral', 'J', 'Martin contributed to this report', ""Christopher's Episcopal Church in Lanham, Maryland, about 5:15 p"", 'Police Chief Cathy L', 'There apparently was no answer', 'Thursday', '(Published Friday, May 15, 2015)', 'Savvas Savopoulos was president and chief executive of American Iron Works, a leading custom steel and iron manufacturing company that helped build Verizon Center and CityCenterDC', 'Police have said all four deaths are being investigated as homicide', 'He asked the housekeeper to call Figueroa’s relatives to relay the message', 'Their youngest child, Philip, was a student at St', '(YouTube/DC Metropolitan Police Department)', 'The person, dressed in dark clothing, can be seen on video released by D', 'home Thursday, as was her normal routine']"
"– In 2012, hackers posted 6.5 million stolen LinkedIn passwords to a Russian forum, TechCrunch reports. It turns out, that security breach was much bigger and much worse than possibly anyone realized. According to Motherboard, 117 million LinkedIn emails and passwords taken as part of the same breach were just put up for sale by a hacker named ""Peace,"" who is seeking $2,200 for them on the dark web. LinkedIn has confirmed the emails and passwords are legit and is working on contacting affected users. Back in 2012, LinkedIn never specified how many accounts had been compromised by hackers. Ars Technica reports it's possible even the company didn't know how many passwords had been stolen initially. Hackers have apparently had no trouble with the lightly encrypted passwords. One source claims hackers cracked 90% of the stolen passwords within 72 hours. Ars Technica argues many of the passwords should never have been allowed by LinkedIn in the first place. More than 750,000 users had the password ""123456."" More than 170,000 used ""linkedin."" Other popular passwords were ""password"" and ""111111.""

"– After just six months on the job, the head of the US Forest Service is stepping down after a PBS probe revealed not only claims of sexual harassment and assault throughout the agency in general, but also accusations of misconduct against Tony Tooke himself, PBS reports. Tooke's retirement, which is effective immediately, comes just a few days after a PBS NewsHour investigation into both the Forest Service and Tooke, who informed his staff he'd be leaving in a Wednesday email obtained by Politico and BuzzFeed. While Tooke didn't confirm or deny the allegations against him—allegations that the New York Times says haven't yet been spelled out—he says, ""I cannot combat every inaccuracy that is reported in the news media,"" and therefore feels it's best to ""make way for a new leader that can ensure future success for all employees and the agency."" PBS talked to 34 current and former Forest Service female workers, who described a hostile work environment that included everything from bullying and sexual harassment to groping and rape. Many women also allege retaliation after they reported these incidents. The Forest Service says its parent agency, the Department of Agriculture, has ""engaged an independent investigator"" to look into specific allegations against Tooke, who has been with the Forest Service since he was 18. Tooke wrote in his email that ""I admire the courage"" of the women who've come forward about the Forest Service and that ""each employee deserves a leader who can maintain the proper moral authority to steer the Forest Service along this important and challenging course."" Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue thanked Tooke in a statement for ""his decades of service to this nation and to the conservation of its natural resources.""","['The suit led the Forest Service to later agree to a “consent decree” that required it to increase the number of women among its California staff to 43 percent, roughly the same percentage of women in the civilian workforce at the time', 'Afterward, she said, she faced retaliation, including death threats against her and her son', 'Thank you for subscribing', 'Myers was furious', 'Tooke were not clear on Wednesday night', 'Editor’s Note: This story has been updated', '“Or they don’t care', 'Socializing after hours can involve heavy drinking', 'View all New York Times newsletters', 'We hold people accountable', 'Speaking up', 'Video by Joshua Barajas', 'MORE:', 'Reporting harassment', 'Invalid email address', 'Oregon', 'Mr', 'Please try again later', 'Rep', 'S', '', '”', 'U', 'Hallie M', '” Archaeologist', 'C', 'org', 'Photo', 'office “demonstrably shocked” and in disbelief', 'Forest Service', 'I must also think about what is best for my family', 'An error has occurred', '“Let it go', 'Darla Bush “Once you say something', 'Tooke wrote', 'Perdue appointed Mr', 'Please re-enter', 'I still believe all that stuff', 'Your browser does not support HTML5 video', 'Department of Agriculture', 'He didn’t care if he hurt me,” she said', 'Deschutes National Forest', 'Myers was shocked and upset, but didn’t stop him', 'At first, Erinn Whitmer loved her job as a seasonal firefighter', 'That decree expired in 2006', 'Many women alleged retaliation after reporting these incidents', 'you get a target on your back” Fire operations specialist', 'Lack of follow-up', 'Sequoia National Forest', 'A year later, that friend died while fighting a fire', 'But it’s frustrating because there’s so many more out there who are not talking', '‘We all live in this fear’', 'Things started to get fuzzy from there', 'The camaraderie', 'She was optimistic action would be taken', 'Video by Lorna Baldwin, Emily Carpeaux and William Brangham', 'That same year, California Rep', 'The ones who leave', 'Crawls of supported ""No More 404"" sites', 'Today, she has three girls', 'Fremont-Winema National Forest', '“Absolutely they were intimidated by her being able to do what they could do', 'And it’s been nonstop ever since', 'The U', 'Not in this agency', '“I keep looking back on it and wishing I could have just punched him or something', 'You must select a newsletter to subscribe to', 'She fears speaking up will jeopardize her retirement, which is seven years away', 'At first, Myers found the Human Resource department’s response encouraging', '“I was cleared of all wrongdoing,” he said', '“Few women would care for such a job, fewer still would seek it,” the magazine wrote', '“I had previously tried to report some bad behavior that’s not near as bad as sexual assault', 'In interviews with 34 current and former U', 'The decree bred resentment among male Forest Service employees', 'That investigation also revealed claims of sexual misconduct against Tooke, including relationships with his subordinates before he became chief', 'So I can’t even imagine if I had reported the rape,” she said', 'Lorna Baldwin, Emily Carpeaux and William Brangham contributed to this reporting', 'Her case has been winding its way through that process ever since', '“It’s less a culture of harassment than just blatant misogyny', 'But Duran said an even bigger issue is the retaliation people face after reporting bad behavior', 'Speak up, and you get hammered', 'Patti Adkinson, a workers’ compensation representative who handled the woman’s case, found this disturbing', 'In January 2015, she filed a formal EEO complaint', 'Melissa Moore “To be a chick in fire, you have to be excellent” Engine captain', 'Women quit or retire or leave … I still love the Forest Service', 'Investigations can take years and stretch into hundreds of pages, especially if there is more than one allegation', '“I just want these guys to stop getting these women drunk and using them for sex…”', 'Janine McFarland “I still love the Forest Service', '’ That really tears them apart … People want to know why', 'She remembers her supervisor, a Forest Service veteran, offering her beers at a crew member’s house after dinner', 'The adrenaline of fighting fires', '“I don’t know about if he dropped it intentionally, but he definitely knew I was there and didn’t care', 'Tooke had relationships with subordinates before his appointment to the top role', '“This agency, they just detest women, do not want women in their ranks', 'I’ll say, ‘you have to go through this or move on', '“The instant I filed” a complaint, she said, “everything changed']"
"– The discovery of 12 Thai boys and their coach still alive after 10 days trapped in a flooded cave has brought massive relief to their families and an anxious nation—but the military warns that their ordeal could be only just beginning. The group, discovered by two British divers late Monday, are on a dry rock ledge around 2.5 miles from the mouth of the cave, and the Thai military says it could be months before it can get them out, unless the boys learn to dive, the BBC reports. The cave in northern Thailand often remains flooded until the end of the rainy season in September or October, meaning the youth soccer team and their coach may need to have food and other supplies sent in for the next four months. Experts warn that it could be very difficult to get the boys, ages 11 to 16, to safety through miles of dark, narrow, flooded tunnels. ""Trying to take non-divers through a cave is one of the most dangerous situations possible, even if the dives are relatively easy,"" US National Cave Rescue Commission coordinator Anmar Mirza tells the AP. Thai officials say they're committed to ""100% safety"" and will continue to explore their options, including draining water from the cave system and searching for shafts that could provide an alternative escape route. Officials say the boys are hungry and weak but in stable medical condition with only minor injuries. They have been provided with high-protein liquid food and will be given more supplies and visited by doctors in the days to come.","['The governor said that requests had been made to build ""infrastructure"" in the cave leading to the pocket where the teenagers and their coach are located', 'They were found on a rock shelf about 4km (2', 'Chiang Rai Gov', 'One boy replies: ""Oh', '11:50 p', '11:40 p', '11 p', 'See you tomorrow', '', '""', '(Associated Press)', '9:25 a', 'm', '___', '8:30 a', 'S', ""Why can't they swim out?"", 'But no one is in red condition', 'Rescuers found all 12 boys and their', '""Thank you all Thais, thank you all foreigners,"" he said', 'Who are they?', 'He says ""supplying them on site may face challenges depending on how difficult the dives are', 'Divers had to navigate a series of sharp, narrow bends in near-darkness', '""I\'m so happy I can\'t put it into words,"" another relative of one of the group told reporters as tears of joy streamed down his cheeks', 'How can they get out?', '""I want him to be physically and mentally fit,"" she said', 'Anmar Mirza, the U', 'He said, ""We found them safe', 'How did they get there?', ""But the operation isn't over"", 'Narongsak Osatanakorn said Tuesday morning that they used a field assessment in which red is critical condition, yellow is serious condition and green is stable condition', 'Families of the missing group were ecstatic at news of their discovery', 'Rescuers found all 12 boys and their soccer coach alive deep inside a partially flooded cave in northern Thailand late Monday, more than', 'Narongsak Osatanakorn said late Monday that the 13 were being rescued', 'Rescuers are now considering how best to bring the group to safety']"
"– Crimea first, eastern Ukraine next? Pro-Russia protesters last night seized government buildings in the cities of Kharkiv, Luhansk, and Donetsk in Ukraine's largely Russian-speaking east, waving Russian flags and demanding a referendum on joining Russia, reports Reuters. In Donetsk, separatists have dubbed the region an independent republic, and have called for the sovereignty referendum to be held by May 11, the AP reports, noting that Crimea did much the same before Russia annexed it. These self-proclaimed lawmakers have also asked Vladimir Putin to send peacekeeping troops, according to Russia's state-run ITAR-Tass news agency. Acting Ukrainian President Oleksandr Turchynov has canceled a trip abroad to deal with the unrest, and the country's interior minister, who blames the protests on Vladimir Putin and ousted Ukrainian leader Viktor Yanukovich, says the turmoil will be dealt with non-violently. He added that ""separatists"" had been removed from one building in Kharkiv as of today. More: Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk today emphasized those Russian fears, saying that country's troops were roughly 20 miles from the border and asserting that ""an anti-Ukrainian plan is being put into operation ... under which foreign troops will cross the border and seize the territory of the country."" Reuters reports that in Luhansk, protesters occupying the state security building have reportedly taken hold of weapons. Meanwhile, the New York Times reports that a Ukrainian military officer in Crimea was last night killed by a Russian soldier who fired an automatic weapon at the unarmed man. The death apparently resulted from a confrontation between a number of Ukrainian and Russian troops, and occurred in a military dorm. Some Ukrainian military personnel remain in Crimea to facilitate the transition, notes the Times.","['Earlier, Vladimir Putin submitted to the Federation Council an address on using the armed forces of Russia on the territory of Ukraine until the normalization of the socio-political situation in that country', 'Let’s keep it,” he said', 'Soviet-era music was being played over loudspeakers outside', 'It will be held no later than May 11', 'KIEV, April 7', 'REFERENDUM DEMAND', 'They used automobile tires among other ‘construction materials’', 'YANUKOVICH CALL', 'REUTERS/Stringer', 'Slideshow (9 Images)', '(Associated Press)', '', '""', '/ITAR-TASS/', '00:00 / 00:40 SD HD Share', 'Protesters outside cheered and chanted ""Russia!

"– Investigators suspect an overdose of prescription drugs caused Prince's death last week and they want to find out exactly where he got them, according to a source close to the investigation. The probe is looking at whether a doctor was on Prince's plane when he made an emergency landing in Illinois the week before his death, and whether he overdosed on the plane, a law enforcement official tells the AP, which notes that the development is worryingly reminiscent of Michael Jackson's death. The source confirmed reports that the opiate painkiller Percocet is believed to have been involved. Documents released on Thursday signal that the investigation is now a criminal probe and charges are a possibility, the Star Tribune reports. The documents released by the Carver County, Minn., sheriff's office Thursday include a request to seal the results of a search conducted at Prince's Paisley Park the day he died, Reuters reports. A judge granted the request, which was made on the grounds that ""intense media scrutiny"" could hamper the investigation or risk injury to innocent people. Carver County Chief Deputy Jason Kamerud declined to comment on reports of drugs found at Prince's home. He tells the AP that contrary to media reports, investigators have not asked the DEA to get involved. ""We might contact them to help us, but that hasn't happened,"" he says.

"– A dispute over the freshness of Wendy’s fries leaves a 25-year-old Minnesota woman facing criminal charges. According to CBS Minnesota, Wendy's employees claim that Eiram Chanel Amir Dixson became argumentative during a drive-thru transaction just after noon Thursday after the woman asked specifically for fresh French fries. Reports don't specify the condition of the fries, or whether she even received them, but do make clear that an argument followed. Employees allege Dixson reached through the drive-thru window and, after an employee threw a soft drink at her, proceeded to spray them with Mace. The restaurant manager was hit directly in the face while two more employees were also in the line of the spray, per the police report. All three employees provided similar accounts of the incident, according to ABC News 5. Dixson is being charged with felony use of tear gas to immobilize. If found guilty, she’ll face a maximum sentence of up to five years in prison and/or a $3,000 to $10,000 fine. Wendy’s drive-thrus see their share of action: last year, a worker was allegedly bit over a wrong order in Virginia, while a Florida man reportedly threw an alligator through a drive-thru window as a prank.","['Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive', 'Paul this week', ""Not a huge place, so don't bring your whole extended family with you"", 'St']"
"– It has to rank among the saddest of studies: a new look at suicides among young children. Researchers reviewed two decades of CDC data, from 1993 to 2012. Though they write in JAMA Pediatrics that ""suicide is a leading cause of death among school-aged children younger than 12 years,"" they found that suicides among those ages 5 to 11 are very rare, reports the AP: There were 657 during the period studied, or one roughly every week-and-a-half (per the CDC, the daily average for all ages is 105 suicides). But while the suicide rate remained stable during that time, ""that stability obscured racial differences,"" observes Psych Central. The suicide rate decreased in white children, but increased significantly in black children, from from 1.36 to 2.54 per 1 million between the study's first five years and its last five. (In white children, the shift was from 1.14 to 0.77.) That shot suicide up from No. 14 on the list of causes of death among black kids of this age to No. 9; it's No. 11 for white kids. The researchers noted that 84% of those who committed suicide were boys and just 16% girls, and the rate worsens when viewed through a gender lens as well. For black boys, the rate climbed to 3.47 per million. The findings represent a big shift, per lead author Jeffrey Bridge. ""Historically, the suicide rate among US black individuals has been lower than that of white individuals across age groups,"" reads the study. ""To our knowledge, this is the first national study to observe higher suicide rates among US black individuals compared with white individuals."" Hanging and suffocation were the main methods for young children. Bridge advises parents to look for warning signs like prolonged unhappiness and withdrawing from favorite activities.

Police say Joseph Van Wert, 65, and Randy Lambach, 45, will face a hearing later this month, the New York Daily News reports. Lambach would allegedly seek out women with drug addictions and post their pictures online, then arrange meetings with clients. Some of these meetings took place in Van Wert's apartment in a senior facility. Van Wert offered his apartment in return for cash or drugs. The Berkshire Eagle reports that the police investigation began last spring in response to citizen complaints about increased prostitution across the city. Lambach would allegedly keep up to 90% of the money the women made, sometimes refusing them cash altogether and paying them in heroin or crack cocaine instead. At least one woman said Lambach drove her to an ""appointment"" across state lines. Police estimated one of the victims was 15 years old. They were also told that some of the women were Lambach's former foster children. Both men have pleaded not guilty, Lambach to four counts of human trafficking and Van Wert to conspiracy to commit human trafficking, deriving support from prostitution, maintaining a house of prostitution, and sexual conduct for a fee.","['Police were provided the plate number of the blue station wagon used to shuttle the women and identified Lambach as its owner', 'Sign up for BREAKING NEWS Emails privacy policy Thanks for subscribing!', 'He would sometimes wait outside or watch from a closet or doorway', 'Violent pimp gets 12 years in prison after beating prostitute', 'Van Wert was arrested at his apartment shortly thereafter', 'Pussycat Dolls deny band member’s ‘prostitution ring’ claims', 'com', 'Posted Tuesday, November 21, 2017 5:27 pm', 'Michael Maddalena', 'Joseph E', 'Nov', '', '""', 'm', '14', 'How to help', 'One told police she didn\'t ""street-walk,"" but instead got her ""dates"" through ads on backpage', 'Men would contact Lambach via cellphone and a date, time, location and fee would be agreed upon', 'Reach Bob Dunn at bdunn@berkshireeagle', 'Lambach, 45, of Pittsfield, are being held on charges including human trafficking pending dangerousness hearing Nov', 'Van Wert, 65, of Becket, and Randy W', 'Lambach was picked up without incident about 4 p']"
"– US District Court Judge Ann Donnelly issued an injunction barring the government from deporting anyone during an emergency hearing Saturday night in Brooklyn, and her court was not the only one to do so. Reuters reports that judges in three additional states—Massachusetts, Virginia, and Washington state—have since followed suit. Reuters points out that these legal moves are curbs that do not eradicate President Trump's executive order that severely limits immigration, but observes ""the growing number ... could complicate the administration's effort to enforce it."" The former is exactly what an unnamed senior White House official pointed out, reportedly telling NBC's Kelly O'Donnell such rulings do ""not undercut the President's executive order."" The official continues, ""All stopped visas will remain stopped. All halted admissions will remain halted. All restricted travel will remain prohibited. ... The order remains in place."" But the pressure shows no sign of easing: The AP reports that the attorneys general of 15 states and the District of Columbia will issue a joint statement branding Trump's ban as unconstitutional and at odds with ""a bedrock principle"" of the US: religious liberty.

"– A Gallup poll released Wednesday finds that Americans' approval of Congress has hit yet another record low: 10%. There aren't many institutions Americans have liked less over the last 50-or-so years, according to Gallup: Only Fidel Castro, Saddam Hussein, Osama bin Laden, and OJ Simpson detective Mark Fuhrman have ever scored lower. ABC News takes a look at some very unpopular things that still manage to rank above Congress: According to an August poll, Paris Hilton is America's least-favorite celeb. But her 60% disapproval rating is still better than Congress's 86% disapproval rating. Socialism is about three times as popular as Congress: About 33% of Americans view the system positively, according to a January poll. About half of Americans polled in November said waterboarding should be permitted as an interrogation technique—meaning more support the technique than support Congress. During the financial crisis, banks were more popular than Congress is now: Some 18% of Americans still had faith in the institutions in 2009.

The network says the reboot will feature Roseanne's original cast, including Roseanne Barr, Sara Gilbert, and John Goodman, despite the fact that Goodman's character, dad Dan Conner, died during the show's final season.

"– When law professor Anita Hill faced the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1991 to testify about the sexual harassment she said she endured from then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas, she also faced down attacks on her character and credibility—and many (including Hill herself) still blame Joe Biden, the senator who led the panel, for allowing that to happen. Now he tells Teen Vogue he's sorry for his role. ""I believed Anita Hill. I voted against Clarence Thomas,"" he says. ""And my one regret is that I wasn't able to tone down the attacks on her by some of my Republican friends. I mean, they really went after her."" He says he felt his hands were tied as he tried to simply play ""judge"" in the proceedings, but he wonders if he could've done more, including subpoenaing witnesses who may have backed Hill up. ""I wish I had been able to do more for Anita Hill,"" he says. ""I owe her an apology.""

After an emotional McCain confessed to Biden she couldn't get through his book on Beau's life and his battle with glioblastoma, Biden took her hand and said to her: ""One of the things that gave Beau courage, my word, was John."" He then discussed recent breakthroughs in dealing with the cancer and told her that ""if anybody can make it,"" it was the senator. ""You gotta maintain hope.""

"– Microwave weapons? That's the latest theory being floated to explain the mysterious ailments suffered by staffers at the American embassy in Cuba. But now a pioneering scientist in that field thinks the idea—based on a principle called the microwave auditory effect—is bogus. Kenneth Foster is a professor of bioengineering at Penn who explained the auditory effect in a 1974 study. At Scientific American, he assesses what's known about the Cuban ailments and lays out why it's ""wildly implausible"" that microwaves are to blame. For one thing, any such weapon powerful enough to cause brain damage would almost certainly burn the victims, too, and that didn't happen. Instead, Foster suggests that a much simpler explanation is likely. ""It is reasonable to guess the sounds were inadvertently produced by ultrasound devices, possibly even spytech, but without malicious intent against the embassy personnel,"" he writes. Foster cites this earlier investigation from the AP revealing the sounds that the victims are believed to have heard, and he says the sounds are consistent with ultrasound devices interacting with each other. It makes sense to him that the Cubans might have been trying to listen in on Americans with these relatively common gizmos. ""The incidents occurred about the time of the 2016 US election, and the Cubans undoubtedly were desperate for intelligence about US intentions."" A Cuban scientist, meanwhile, agrees that the microwave theory is far-fetched. ""First, it was sonic weapons, now microwave,"" he told CNN. ""What's next, kryptonite?""","[""Though a March report based on the examinations of 21 diplomats who served in Cuba didn't link the attacks to microwaves, the study's lead author, Douglas Smith, director of the University of Pennsylvania's Center for Brain Injury and Repair, told The New York Times that US diplomats in Cuba and China likely suffered brain injuries and that microwaves are considered the culprit"", 'Other scientists have argued psychological factors were involved instead', '""It\'s science fiction, not science,"" he said', 'Employees reported symptoms such as headaches, confusion, hearing loss', '""First, it was sonic weapons, now microwave', 'intentions', 'S', '', '”', '""', 'Intermodulation distortion is increasingly being employed to jam microphones used to record concert music illegally or for eavesdropping', 'We do not capture any email address', '""Second, you have to have a perpetrator', 'It reads like a bad spy thriller', 'embassy in Havana, Cuba', 'This is a kind of weapon that doesn\'t exist,"" said Dr', 'embassy employees, causing sonic delusions and “very real brain damage”', ""MUST WATCH Trump: Cuba 'responsible' for diplomat attacks 00:18"", 'His theory: the Cubans were employing a microwave weapon against U', 'To elicit auditory sensations, individuals must be exposed to intense but brief (microsecond) pulses of microwave energy', 'Neuroskeptic, a neuroscientist who blogs anonymously in Discover magazine, brutally reviewed the Penn study', 'Yan and colleagues report ultrasound can be used for eavesdropping purposes as well, by picking up vibrations in objects produced by human speech', ""JUST WATCHED Trump: Cuba 'responsible' for diplomat attacks Replay More Videos"", 'On September 1 science reporter William Broad jumped into this morass with a long article in The New York Times', 'JUST WATCHED State Department pulls employees out of Cuba Replay More Videos', '""For an attack to have occurred you have to have a real victim']"

The NBA star says the club, WiP, should have known that allowing Brown and Drake—who've both been involved with Rihanna—in at the same time was a terrible idea. Thus, the lawsuit claims, the club owners are responsible for the injuries he suffered in the fight. Those injuries include a ""corneal laceration of the left eye,"" the lawsuit claims, and Parker's lawyer notes that eye injuries ""certainly don't improve your outside shot.""

"– Barack Obama may not be Mitt-Romney-rich (or even Al-Gore-rich), but he's doing all right for himself. The president's latest financial disclosure forms, released yesterday, reveal that he and Michelle had total assets worth somewhere between $1.8 million and $7 million in 2013, the AP reports. (That's just like 2012.) Most of that is in US Treasury notes, which are worth between $1 million and $5 million. Other assets include Vanguard retirement funds and college saving funds. Current financial disclosure rules only require politicians to list their assets within a broad range, so it's hard to pin down exactly how much Obama has, the New York Times explains. Besides his presidential salary, Obama makes most of his money off royalties from his books, though the market seems to believe he peaked as a writer in the '90s. His latest, 2010's Of Thee I Sing, A Letter to My Daughters, earned between $5,001 and $15,000, compared to $50,001-$100,000 for 1995's Dreams From My Father.

"– Queen Elizabeth II is now the longest-tenured monarch in British history, surpassing her great-great-grandmother Victoria's 23,226 days, 16 hours, and 23 minutes as queen sometime around 5:30pm local time, reports the BBC.

There are no gaps between British monarchs, so Elizabeth became queen as soon as her father King George VI died. However, he died in his sleep, and no one is quite sure exactly when he passed, explains Time.

"– The Pentagon inspector general’s office didn't take the Gen. John Allen-Jill Kelley email exchange lightly, assigning 15 investigators toiling seven days a week to review the thousands of pages of documents. They've now sussed out between 60 and 70 emails that ""bear a fair amount of scrutiny,"" according to a defense official, who didn't elaborate on what those emails might contain. The New York Times reports the purpose of the investigation, which likely won't conclude until 2013, is to determine if one of three violations occurred: misconduct (ie, adultery or inappropriate language), substantial use of government property for personal matters, or a security breach. Those investigators aren't the only ones getting busy. A previously silent Kelley is now defending herself, through her attorney. Abbe Lowell, a big-time Washington lawyer who has represented Bill Clinton and John Edwards, yesterday released emails, phone recordings, and more evidence that, he says, prove Kelley did not try to exploit her relationship with David Petraeus. He also sent out three letters connected to the scandal, the AP reports: He asked the US Attorney's Office in Tampa why Kelley's name was released in the first place, adding that federal privacy laws could apply. He wrote another letter to a businessman Kelley was trying to help make a deal with South Korea, before she lost her honorary consul status. The businessman, Adam Victor, has said in interviews that Kelley was not a skilled negotiator, and Lowell says he defamed her in an attempt to bask in his ""15 minutes of fame.""

"– The grieving parents of 15-year-old Reid Comita say he died after going on a hike the Boy Scouts should never have sent him on. The Texas teenager died from heat stroke in June while on an ""Intro to Backpacking"" course that would have been his final task to become an Eagle Scout. ""The Boy Scouts of America are responsible for my son's death. It's that simple,"" father John Comita tells WFAA. Reid's parents are suing Boy Scouts of America, accusing them of being negligent by sending the boy on an ""extremely aggressive hike"" through rugged terrain in southwest Texas on a day when temperatures were around 100 degrees. ""He wasn't an athlete. He wasn't prepared to go on an advanced hike,"" the father says. John Comita says the family signed Reid up for the course—which was supposed to include two days of training followed by a three-day hike—because they thought it was the safest option, but he was immediately sent on the hike, reports the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. The lawsuit also faults the Boy Scouts for sending Reid on a hike with two other teenagers, a 14-year-old and an 18-year-old, instead of the two adults that regulations require. Boy Scouts of America, which awarded Reid the rank of Eagle Scout after his death, declined to comment on the lawsuit but said the ""health and safety of our youth members is of paramount importance,"" the Washington Post reports. (This woman got sick on a hike and was dead 9 hours later.)","[""The petition further contends that Reid didn't receive proper training at the camp before being sent out on the more advanced hike and that he was accompanied by only two other teenagers, not the required two adults"", 'We strive to create a safe environment for youth to experience outdoor adventure', 'They are responsible,"" John Comita told WFAA in a sit-down interview', ""It doesn't make it any better"", 'Sept', '', '""', '""He wasn\'t an athlete', '""His friends, his troop, have been great,"" says John', '(Photo: WFAA)', 'Reid Comita,15, died from heat stroke while hiking at Buffalo Trail Scout Ranch in June', '""He was very special,"" she said']"
"– A CIA operative in charge of hunting down Osama bin Laden is a war profiteer who helped bilk the Pentagon out of some $200 million, reports Gawker. Marty Martin was put in charge of tracking down the terror mastermind from 2002-2004, and boasted to the AP that those early efforts ""led to this great day"" the day bin Laden was killed by Navy SEALs. After he left the CIA, Martin joined International Oil Trading Company, a Florida operation that delivered fuel to US forces in the Middle East, a company accused by both Congress and the Pentagon of grossly overcharging the government, to the tune of $204 million. Martin was also accused in a Florida lawsuit of paying a $9 million bribe to Jordanian officials to win exclusive fuel shipping rights, and has been linked to dirty campaign contributions given to (and returned by) John McCain during his bid for the presidency. Contacted by Gawker to comment on the various charges, Martin responded: ""No no, man.

Another ranger was injured in the attack inside what the AP calls the nation's oldest public park.

"– Some media outlets might want to evict Donald Trump from their politics sections, but he appears to be doing pretty well among Americans surveying the political arena. As CNN reports in a new CNN/ORC national poll, Trump is polling at the top of the considerable heap of Republican presidential contenders, at 18%. Jeb Bush comes in second at 15%, Scott Walker at 10%, and no other GOP candidate cracked double digits. Of note: The poll was conducted after Trump started swinging at John McCain's war record, indicating he's emerged unscathed; the new poll puts Trump up 6 points over a similar poll at the end of June. ""There's a movement going on,"" Trump told CNN this morning in response, per the Hill. ""People are tired of these incompetent politicians in Washington ... I'm just not that surprised."" Trump is racking up similar numbers in Iowa, per an NBC/Marist poll out today: He's at 17%, though he's trailing Walker's 19% in that state, reports Politico. Bush has 12% there. The story is a little more marked in New Hampshire, where Trump is pulling down 21% to Bush's 14% and Walker's 12%. And Trump's divisiveness shows in his unfavorability ratings: 53% of New Hampshire Republicans view him unfavorably, notes Politico, while that number is 44% in Iowa, and what CNN calls a ""sky high"" 59% of all registered voters in its poll.","['Fifty two percent of registered Republicans and Republican-leaning independents want the outspoken real estate magnate to stay in the race, according to the CNN/ORC poll', ""Trump's unfavorability rating is sky high"", '5 percentage points', 'John McCain’s war record', '', 'ADVERTISEMENT', '”', 'm', ""Trump's backing has climbed 6 points since a late-June poll, while support for Bush and Walker has not changed significantly"", 'Among all respondents, 40 percent expect former Florida Gov', 'Jeb Bush follows in second place with 15 percent', 'Results for all registered voters have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3', '--Sarah Ferris contributed to this report, which was updated at 11:41 a', ""The Republican electorate is more enthusiastic about next year's vote than the Democrats are"", 'Meanwhile, an NBC News/Marist poll on Sunday showed Trump leading among New Hampshire GOP primary voters and narrowly trailing Walker in Iowa', '5 percentage point margin of error', 'Bush and Walker run just behind Clinton and about even with Sanders']"
"– Spain's Prince Felipe became King Felipe VI at midnight as the abdication of his father, King Juan Carlos, became official. The occasion was fairly low-key, with no foreign heads of state present and no huge state banquet, which the palace says was ""in keeping with the criteria of austerity that the times recommend,"" the AP reports. The 46-year-old king was later proclaimed head of state in a parliamentary ceremony where he promised to be a monarch ""who is ready listen and understand, warn and advise as well as to defend the public interest at all times,"" the BBC reports. The new king spoke of the need to ""look ahead to the Spain we are building together as I begin this reign,"" reports CNN, which notes that while the monarchy remains popular in Spain, the royal family has been accused of corruption and excess during the country's economic crisis—and Juan Carlos' image suffered after he went on a luxurious elephant-hunting trip in the middle of the recession. Felipe and his wife, who is now Queen Letizia, will be driven through the streets of Madrid before appearing at the palace but they may find that many Spaniards aren't in the mood for cheering: The country's soccer team, which won the World Cup in 2010, crashed out of the tournament last night with a 2-0 loss to Chile.","['Juan Carlos has said Felipe, a former Olympic yachtsman, has ""the maturity, the preparation and the sense of responsibility necessary"" to serve as king and ""to lead to a new stage of hope using his experience and the drive of a new generation', 'Spain’s', ""Felipe VI must now address Spain's 21st-century difficulties"", ""There was no champagne, just sparkling cava wine from Spain's Catalonia region"", '""More than anything this is a message', '', '""', '(Associated Press)', '____', 'Hatton contributed from Lisbon, Portugal', 'Spain’s Juan Carlos formally ratified', '""In a time when every expense is examined with a magnifying glass, particularly public money, any ostentation would have been criticized,"" he said', 'Others did not answer or expressed no opinion', 'READ: The sailor who will take the helm in Spain', 'Retirements of monarchs', ""CNN's Al Goodman reported from Madrid, while Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London and Steve Almasy in Atlanta"", 'His wife is a former television journalist and a divorced commoner', 'Stroke of pen', ""Felipe reflected on the country's recent economic woes, which have fueled high unemployment rates"", 'By royal standards, it was humble: reception guests were being served hot and cold tapas-style nibbles, to be eaten while standing', 'The abdication announcement initially triggered widespread demonstrations calling for a referendum on reinstating a republic', ""The landmark occasion was perhaps most notable for what it didn't include: no state banquet, no foreign royals or heads of state, no ostentatious ceremonies or parades"", ""More recently, however, the royal family's image was tarnished by Juan Carlos' 2012 Botswana hunting trip"", ""She and her husband, Inaki Urdangarin, have denied allegations that they diverted public funds from Urdangarin's foundation for private use"", 'At his side will be the new Queen Letizia, who before she married into the royal family worked as a TV presenter', 'What they want to say is: \'We\'re in a moment when sobriety in spending shows a certain sense of solidarity in a time of economic difficulty,\'"" Navarra University history professor Pablo Perez Lopez said', ""The reasoning behind that choice is easy to understand, says Emilio de Diego Garcia, history professor at Madrid's Complutense University"", ""Felipe holds a law degree from Madrid's Autonomous University and obtained a master's in international relations from Georgetown University in Washington"", ""Juan Carlos won broad support for his handling of Spain's 20th-century challenges"", 'It will be a no-frills event, though the 18th-century Spanish crown and 17th-century scepter will be on display', ""MADRID (AP) — Crown Prince Felipe ascended to the Spanish throne at midnight Wednesday, but there weren't any ritzy official celebrations"", 'But a recent poll found that while 62 percent of respondents said they wanted a referendum on the monarchy ""at some point,"" 49 percent said they favored a monarchy with Felipe as king, while only 36 percent wanted a republic', 'Francisco Franco, and then endeared himself to many by making army rebels stand down during an attempted military coup in 1981', 'Such an unraveling could place the monarchy itself in danger']"
"– In the Deep South, a predilection for proper manners often means the temptation to tell someone off is replaced with a ""Bless your heart."" But an obituary that appeared last month in a North Carolina newspaper flouted politeness, and at least one family member isn't happy, KDVR reports. The death notice for Cornelia June Rogers Miller, who died in February, ran in Murphy's Cherokee Scout newspaper, and it wasn't a flattering depiction of the great-grandmother, who ""died alone after a long battle with drug addiction and depression."" ""Drugs were a major love in her life as June had no hobbies, made no contribution to society, and rarely shared a kind word or deed in her life,"" the obituary says. ""We speak for the majority of her family when we say her presence will not be missed by many, very few tears will be shed, and there will be no lamenting over her passing."" All of which has her son, Robert Miller, fuming—and he thinks he knows who placed the obituary. ""It's unbelievable that my sisters would write this,"" he tells WTVC, noting his mom was a ""loving, generous woman."" WTVC managed to track down one of his two sisters, and she tells the station she didn't write the obituary, calling it ""tragic."" To make matters worse, it appears parts of the obituary may have been plagiarized from one written for someone in California in 2008. ""[She] doesn't even have the integrity to write something for herself,"" Miller says, apparently referring to the sister he thinks trashed their mom. The Cherokee Scout publisher says the paper scans all submitted obituaries but notes they won't change anything unless there's a solid reason. ""The family's will overrode the editor,"" he says. Miller says he sent in a new obituary to replace the printed one. (It's not the first scathing obituary.)","['According to the obituary in the Cherokee Scout, June died in February', ""We tracked down one of his sisters, but she says she didn't write it either"", '(Image: Robert Miller)', 'MURPHY, N', 'FOLLOW-UP:', 'C', '”', '', 'twitter', 'com/v2JGzWOCaE — Stephanie Santostasi (@Stephanie_NC9) July 3, 2017', '“Unbelievable', 'PREVIOUSLY:', '""', 'June and her husband visited often', '""Once my father retired, they would go up to Murphy pretty much whenever they liked to', 'What do you think about it? pic', 'Watch the update here', 'Miller lived in Florida and had a summer home in Murphy', '""Yeah, it\'s disturbing,"" said one man', ""But, June's son Robert has an idea""]"
"– To most people, it just looks like a smooth, egg-sized rock, but it was part of the founding of the Mormon church and photos of it have now been published for the first time. The images of the ""seer stone"" that Mormons believe founder Joseph Smith used to translate buried gold plates he said he found in upstate New York 185 years ago were released as part of what the church says is an effort to be more transparent about its past, the AP reports. The photos have been published in a book that also includes pictures of the ""printer's manuscript"" of the Book of Mormon—a handwritten copy of the original manuscript that was produced by one of Smith's scribes. The book, which Smith said he translated from ""reformed Egyptian"" with the stone, recounts a visit from Jesus Christ to North America, reports the Salt Lake Tribune. As for the translation, the church has this to say: ""Joseph placed ... the seer stone in a hat, pressed his face into the hat to block out extraneous light, and read aloud the English words that appeared on the instrument."" It says the translation occurred over three months in 1829 as part of a ""a series of miraculous events."" Indeed: In March, the Deseret News reported that the church says it takes roughly five years to translate and then produce the Book of Mormon in another language. The church says it is trying to make its history more ""tangible"" with the release, but Terryl Givens, professor of literature and religion at the University of Richmond, tells the AP that the church is also trying to show skeptics it has nothing to hide. ""Other churches' origins are concealed by the mist of history. Mormonism is the first world religion in which the origins were exposed to public view, to documentation, to journalists, and newspaper reporting."" (Last year, the church admitted that Smith had up to 40 wives.)","['In the preface to the 1830 edition of the Book of Mormon, Joseph Smith wrote: “I would inform you that I translated [the book], by the gift and power of God', 'Mormon 9:32', ', with Erick B', '27, 1841, Church History Library, Salt Lake City', 'Translation Instruments', 'Jensen said Mary Whitmer’s grandson John C', '” (Selections from Elders’ Journal, July 1838, 43, available at josephsmithpapers', 'See Richard E', 'Royal Skousen [New Haven: Yale University Press, 2009], xv–xix', 'org topic page states', '5 million physical copies are distributed each year', 'Acts 11:4–17; 16:9–10; Exodus 28:30; Leviticus 8:8; Numbers 21:9', '” (“Golden Bible,” Palmyra Freeman, Aug', 'Originally published December 2013', 'Burges, 1832], 138–39', ') 1 Kings 19:11–12', '11, 1829, [2]', '19, 1831): 120', '(Associated Press)', 'Wilford Woodruff journal, Nov', 'Moroni 10:3–5', '3 [May 1992]: 18–24', '1997, 36–41; Russell M', '15', 'lds', 'Davidson et al', 'Michael Hubbard MacKay, Gerrit J', 'Turley Jr', '(Dean C', ') Alma 37:23–24', 'Phelps, Sept', '4 [Fall 1984]: 489–560', '2 [Spring 2011]: 143', '', '""', '”3', '”5', '6', '”7', '10', '12', '”17', '20', '23', '”25', '”27', '”29', '”30', '”32', 'Conclusion', '”34', 'Resources', 'Jenson, eds', 'Jessee, Ronald K', '1, 1879), 290', 'Reynolds, ed', 'Dennis L', 'Thorne, eds', 'encquran', 'brill', 'Dirkmaat, Grand Underwood, Robert J', 'Hartley, eds', 'Welch, ed', '1 (Spring 1986): 6–33', '1, 1879), 289–90', '13, 1881, 4', 'A', 'W', 'B', 'Lyndon W', 'Spelling modernized', '”', 'Email: wbutters@deseretnews', 'com, Twitter: WhitneyButters', 'Sorenson and Melvin J', '1834): 14; italics in original', '""These efforts have served to unite us', '” His scribes shared that testimony', '“Was not Jo Smith a money digger,” one question read', 'Minutes, Church conference, Orange, OH, Oct', '""I\'m incredibly excited,"" Mackay said Tuesday', 'See also 1 Nephi 1:2', ', Histories, Volume 1, 116; John W', '(Richard L', 'org', ', Documents, Volume 1: July 1828–June 1831, vol', '” (Wilford Woodruff journal, Dec', 'Parry and others, eds', '“Yes,” Joseph answered, “but it was never a very profitable job to him, as he only got fourteen dollars a month for it', 'Cook (Orem, UT: Grandin Book, 1991)', '4, 2015, in Salt Lake City', '“Word of mouth only has a limited radius', 'Church historian Steven E', 'The Independence, Mo', ') John A', '(See Neal A', 'org; Welch, “Miraculous Translation,”,121–9', 'Goodwillie, “Shaker Richard McNemar,” 143', 'Acts 9:1–8; 12:7–9', 'Ricks and others, eds', 'Joseph Smith History, 1838–ca', '‘Days never to be forgotten’', '1841, 8–11 (draft 2), in Karen Lynn Davidson, David J', '“Last Testimony of Sister Emma,” Saints’ Herald 26 (Oct', ') “Last Testimony of Sister Emma,” 289–90', 'You are about to access: http://www', 'Grandin’s printing office in Palmyra, New York']"
"– Roland Bosee Jr., 68, and Nino Esposito, 78, have been inseparable since they first met in 1970. ""You meet someone and it just clicks,"" Esposito told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette last month. So with the SCOTUS decision over the summer to legalize gay marriage, the men looked forward to finally tying the knot. But one issue is holding them back: Esposito is technically Bosee's father, because he adopted him in 2012. ""We thought never in our lifetime—or in 20 lifetimes—...same-sex marriage [would] happen,"" Bosee said, adding to CNN that the adoption ""gave us the most legitimate thing available to us"" at the time. Even though they petitioned to have the adoption annulled, Allegheny County Judge Lawrence O'Toole —known for being progressive on LGBT issues—rejected that plea, noting that adoptions are typically only dissolved when fraud is involved and that nixing theirs ""would place in jeopardy and imperil adoption decrees generally."" Adoptions of this sort are often sought to cement legal status for financial and other reasons, as well as to strengthen emotional ties. The men said it was both: Esposito told the Post-Gazette ""we felt we lacked a family of our own,"" but they also discovered that any money they inherited from each other would be subject to a much greater inheritance tax if they weren't considered relatives. One person on the couple's side: Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey, who tells the Post-Gazette, ""I wasn't aware that LGBT couples were turning to this method. I can't even imagine having to get an adoption petition approved … to visit a loved one in the hospital."" Casey has written a letter of support to AG Loretta Lynch, asking her office to ""consider issuing guidance"" in cases like this; her office is reviewing it, a rep tells CNN.

"– Saudi Arabia's 30-year-old deputy crown prince is looking toward the future with his new ""Vision 2030"" plan—a plan that includes pulling the kingdom out of its overreliance on oil and leaning more on non-oil investment to transform it into a global power, Reuters reports. ""We will not allow our country ever to be at the mercy of commodity price volatility or external markets,"" Prince Mohammed bin Salman told reporters gathered at a Riyadh palace Monday. Per Gulf News, he had earlier appeared in a televised al-Arabiya interview, noting, ""We have developed a case of oil addiction in Saudi Arabia. … I think by 2020, if oil stops we can survive."" Also part of his new blueprint: including women more in the economy and appealing to young people who face the prospect of not finding jobs. The BBC notes that more than 70% of the kingdom's revenue came from oil in 2015, but oil prices continue to plummet and Saudi Arabia's economy is suffering, per Al Jazeera. In broad terms, the prince would like to bring up its Public Investment Fund (PIF) capital to $2 trillion from $160 billion. Prince Mohammed says 5% of shares in the Aramco oil company would be sold to fund this $2 trillion nest (which he thinks could even rise to $3 trillion). Also part of the prince's game plan: setting up a ""green card"" system in five years' time to expedite Muslim and Arab expatriates' long-term residency, as well as boosting affordable housing and getting more women into the workforce. The founder of the DC-based Saudi American Public Relations Affairs Committee tells Al Jazeera this a ""visionary move,"" but another Saudi expert says he's seen similar changes proposed before. ""To implement some of these, you need the collaboration of society,"" he notes. ""For example, if you want to increase the empowerment of women, you need to liberalize your society.""

"– Tesla is facing more scrutiny following three car fires in six weeks. First, investors launched a lawsuit; now, the government is getting involved, USA Today reports. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is now investigating two of the fires, both of which occurred after Model S undercarriages hit debris on the road (the other happened during a crash). In a blog post, CEO Elon Musk says his company asked for the investigation and writes that ""if something is discovered that would result in a material improvement in occupant fire safety, we will immediately apply that change to new cars and offer it as a free retrofit to all existing cars."" But the NHTSA tells the LAT a different story: ""The agency notified the automaker of its plans to open a formal investigation and requested their cooperation, which is standard agency practice for all investigations."" Musk also says the company will increase the cars' ground clearance to help prevent them from hitting debris, and warranties will start covering fire damage, even in the event of driver error, ""to reinforce how strongly we feel about the low risk of fire in our cars."" To that end: ""We believe the evidence is clear that there is no safer car on the road than the Model S,"" Musk notes. ""Since the Model S went into production mid last year, there have been more than a quarter million gasoline car fires in the United States alone, resulting in over 400 deaths and 1,200 serious injuries ... compared to zero deaths and zero injuries due to Tesla fires. The media coverage of Model S fires vs. gasoline car fires is disproportionate by several orders of magnitude, despite the latter actually being far more deadly.""","['Reading the headlines, it is therefore easy to assume that the Tesla Model S and perhaps electric cars in general have a greater propensity to catch fire than gasoline cars when nothing could be further from the truth', 'What About Safety Overall?', 'This was unfortunately almost entirely ignored', '37 on Sept', ', factory (Photo: Jessica Brandi Lifland for USA TODAY)', '7%, or $4', 'They closed 3', 'VPC', 'PST, Nov', '', '09 a share', '""', 'A Auto Show', 'S', '30', '[Updated 8:55 a', 'm', '”', ']', 'TESLA STOCK: Shares rise despite federal probe into fires', 'Further Actions', 'Read or Share this story: http://usat', 'In order to get to that end goal, big leaps in technology are required, which naturally invites a high level of scrutiny', 'LATEST: From the L', 'PHOTOS: Tesla Model S', 'electric cars following crashes', ""Musk says it's proof of the car's safety"", 'There is a real, physical reason for this: a gasoline tank has 10 times more combustion energy than our battery pack', 'That cannot be allowed to happen', 'Moreover, the Model S battery pack also has internal firewalls between the 16 modules and a firewall between the battery pack and passenger compartment', 'In this Wednesday, Nov', 'It is also why arsonists tend to favor gasoline', 'ly/I0PQdJ Federal safety regulators opened a probe into a series of fires in Tesla Motors Inc', '"" Musk gave no hint that NHTSA was about to open an investigation', 'The media coverage of Model S fires vs', 'Another software update in January is aimed at letting drivers set their preferred road height for themselves and passengers']"
"– The term ""sex addiction"" might get tossed around a lot these days as a way to explain some not-so-classy behavior of the Anthony Weiner-Tiger Woods variety, but is it really an addiction on par with drugs or alcohol? The first study to explore brain responses in people who describe themselves as hypersexual suggests otherwise, reports UCLA. Researchers there showed the subjects—39 men and 13 women—sexual images, and discovered that their brains didn't respond in the same way that, say, a cocaine addict would respond to images of cocaine. “Most people describe high-frequency sexual problems as an ‘addiction’—that’s how the public and even many clinicians talk about it,"" one of the researchers tells Slate. ""But this data challenges the addiction model and forces us to reconsider how we think and talk about these problems.” The subjects have higher libidos, or sexual desire, but not necessarily a clinical medical problem.

"– Another day, another political sex scandal—but this one involves a minor. Ohio's Eric W. Deaton, Senate candidate for the conservative Constitution Party, was indicted Tuesday for having alleged sexual contact with a young girl, the Dayton Daily News reports. Deaton, 42, is accused of having unlawful sexual conduct with the girl, who he reportedly met at his church, while she was between the ages of 13 and 15 ... and he's calling the whole mess ""politically motivated."" He adds that “the powers that be don’t like” his decision to run for office, and says he'll stay in the race despite his Sept. 14 arraignment and the fact that he faces the possibility of five years in prison. According to WDTN Dayton, police say they have hotel surveillance video and receipts that prove their case ... and Deaton's lawyer says those very items (somehow) help prove that his client is innocent.

"– You'd expect some jail time for a child rapist, right? Not so for du Pont heir Robert H. Richards IV, who admitted to raping his 3-year-old daughter almost a decade ago, the Daily Mail reports. In a 2009 case that's only now coming to light, the News Journal reports that Delaware Judge Jan Jurden sentenced Richards to an eight-year prison term but suspended it for probation, plus a sex offenders rehabilitation program, because Richards ""will not fare well"" in prison and ""treatment needs exceed need for punishment."" The News Journal calls it ""a rare and puzzling rationale"" from a judge who is known for her tough sentencing, especially given that treatment is usually reserved for first-time drug offenders, drunk drivers, and the mentally ill. While some attorneys say such a sentence isn't unheard of, a public defender notes that the case raises questions about ""how a person with great wealth may be treated by the system."" A defense lawyer adds, ""I've never heard of the judge saying in general that he is not going to do well ... Who thrives in jail?"" A suit recently filed against Richards by his ex-wife is seeking damages for assaults on the couple's two children. Initially indicted on two counts of second-degree child rape, Richards took a plea deal of one count of fourth-degree rape, which carries no mandatory minimum prison sentence, the Daily Mail notes.","['The well-being of the child is paramount in such cases and parents and prosecutors are often reluctant to put children through the trauma of testifying and being cross-examined, he said', 'Richards IV suggested that she considered unique circumstances when deciding his punishment for fourth-degree rape', 'doj-Superior Court Judge Jan Jurden answers a question from a public defender after holding Mental Health court on Wednesday, April 4, 2012', 'Hrivnak would not comment', 'Earlier story: Police investigated du Pont sex abuse claim', ""O'Neill, whose office represents defendants who cannot afford a lawyer"", 'Treatment sentence', 'Commentary: Take into account entire sentencing process', 'Probation offered', 'State Prosecutor Kathleen M', 'Read or Share this story: http://delonline', 'CLOSE Robert H', 'Contact senior reporter Cris Barrish at (302) 324-2785, cbarrish@delawareonline', 'Defense lawyer Michael W', 'Buy Photo 04/04/12-Wilmington, De', 'Vaughn Jr', 'Joseph S', '', '""', '-xxxf', 'dpc', '(3/18/14)', ""'"", 'said', '8 million in 2005', '""It was more than reasonable, an enlightened plea offer,"" Richards attorney Eugene J', ""'Will not fare well'"", ""'Right on'"", 'Robert H', 'Maurer Jr', '8 million for, pictured', 'Her order stipulated that he undergo inpatient treatment followed by outpatient treatment', ""In Delaware's correctional system, Level 5 is prison"", 'Video: Du Pont heir sued over abusing his own children', 'O’Neill (Photo: The News Journal/FRED COMEGYS)', 'Defense lawyer Joseph A', 'Nor do court records cite any physical illnesses', 'She would not say when she represented Richards', '""Who thrives in jail?""', 'Richards spent eight months on Level 3 probation, which requires weekly contacts with a probation officer, before Jurden moved him down to Level 2, which requires only monthly visits with a probation officer', 'The plea offer', '8 million for', 'His father, Robert H', 'Buy Photo Delaware Public Defender Brendan J', '""I can\'t think of a case like that,"" he said', 'com or on Facebook', 'Earlier story: Du Pont heir faces child sex lawsuit', ""At Tuesday's press conference he stood alongside Tracy and her mother Donna Burg"", 'The News Journal/JENNIFER CORBETT (Photo: The News Journal/JENNIFER CORBETT)', '""That procedure was followed in this case as well']"
"– The war of words between Chicago and the federal government over ""sanctuary cities"" policy is heating up. Attorney General Jeff Sessions slammed the city's leaders Monday over their lawsuit against the Trump administration, saying they ""have demonstrated an open hostility to enforcing laws designed to protect law enforcement"" and ""instead have adopted an official policy of protecting criminal aliens who prey on their own residents,"" despite a surge in violent crime, Politico reports. Sessions said Mayor Rahm Emanuel has complained that the federal government is demanding a ""reordering of law enforcement practice""—but that is what is needed to combat ""the culture of lawlessness that has beset the city.""

Chicago is suing over plans to withhold police grant funding from cities that fail to meet federal conditions, including granting immigration officials unlimited access to police stations, the Chicago Tribune reports. Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said Monday that the federal government's plans will damage public safety and community policing.

"– Just how bad are Pakistan's power grid problems? This bad: The government has ordered civil servants to stop wearing socks, reports Reuters. The weird order goes hand in hand with another edict that forbids government offices from turning on their air-conditioners. That makes things so unbearably hot that the workers are barred from wearing shoes and socks lest they be tempted to reach for the AC. Instead, bare feet in sandals or moccasins are required. If it sounds like desperation, that's because it is. Even in major cities, electricity goes down for 10 hours a day, reports the New York Times, and it's not hard to imagine all the disastrous ways that ripples through society—at hospitals, morgues, factories that can't run their equipment, etc. All kinds of factors are at play, but the Times zeroes in on a surprisingly simple one: ""Most Pakistanis will not pay their bills.""

"– North Korea has apparently kicked off a new propaganda war ahead of planned war games between the US and South Korea next month. South Korea says its military found hundreds of propaganda leaflets floating down a river near the border last week, boasting that the North won the Korean War and threatening missile attacks, reports the AP. Some 200 flag-shaped lapel pins featuring a photo of Kim Jong Il were also discovered in a hotel flowerbed near Incheon International Airport on Thursday, reports Stars and Stripes. These are no ordinary pins: As Atlas Obscura explains, they're a patriotic symbol distributed by North Korea's Workers' Party to be worn by all adults on the left side of the chest. Some say Kim Jong Un's wife disappeared after failing to wear one in public. Other versions feature Kim Il Sung, and a rare few show both former leaders. These are only given to high-ranking government officials and military leaders, though ordinary citizens can get a knock-off version from China on the black market. North Koreans were even using the pins in place of cash before the Workers' Party made it illegal. Police are investigating how the pins got into the flowerbed as possession of such items is illegal in South Korea, but say they may have arrived via a propaganda balloon. Meanwhile, Pyongyang accuses the South of releasing snakes across the border ""as part of a 'cunning scheme' to challenge our unity,"" reports the Guardian. A diplomat also promises action if the war games go ahead as planned, noting the US ""crossed the red line"" when putting Kim on a sanctions list.","['actions — likely including a decision to station a Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense system, known as THAAD, in the southeastern region of Seongju — have put the peninsula on the verge of war, and that a vicious showdown could erupt if the U', 'A Kim Il Sung pin is more used by citizens than a Kim Jong Il pin, they said', '(Associated Press)', '', 'S', '”', 'Gen', 'chang', 'kyong@stripes', 'com', 'and South Korea go ahead with annual war games planned for next month', 'Ryol said recent U', 'Vincent Brooks, commander of U', 'On Thursday, North Korea’s top diplomat for U', 'bases in the Pacific while pursuing the capability to hit the American mainland with a nuclear-tipped missile']"

"– Authorities in Canada think Sunday night's mosque shooting that left six people dead is a ""lone wolf situation,"" reports Reuters, and they think they've got their shooter: Alexandre Bissonnette, 27, appeared in court Monday and was charged with six counts of first-degree murder and five counts of attempted murder, reports CBC News. So far, he does not face any terrorism-related charges. Bissonnette attended Laval University, near the Quebec City mosque, and studied political science and anthropology. The AP reports that he was known to espouse ""far-right nationalist views"" online, and the Toronto Globe and Mail reports that this didn't begin until March when nationalist leader Marine Le Pen visited Quebec City. ""I wrote him off as a xenophobe,"" says a fellow Laval student. ""He was enthralled by a borderline racist nationalist movement."" A member of a refugee advocacy group says Bissonnette had become a familiar name to those who monitor extremist groups. He was ""unfortunately known to many activists in Quebec for taking nationalist, pro-Le Pen and anti-feminist positions at Laval University and on social media,"" François Deschamps wrote on the Facebook page of the group Welcome to Refugees, per the Montreal Gazette.

"– A 7-year-old bowler in Canada just learned a tough lesson about rules, or pants, or ... something. After Grayson Powell bowled a terrific game and prepared to collect a gold medal with two teammates, he was told he was disqualified for wearing pants that weren't black enough. So reports the CBC, which photographed Grayson's outfit and, sure enough, his black jeans are faded to a gray. ""If this is what sport is about when it comes to kids ... shame on them,"" said his angry father, Todd Powell. This odd controversy, however, was just getting started. In a long rebuttal, Gord Davis, provincial head of Youth Bowling Canada, insisted the organization ""did nothing wrong"" and is ""not to blame for how this went down."" The black jeans dress code has been in place ""for decades,"" he said, and rules are rules. The boy's dad smelled a rat. He accused Davis of disqualifying his son's team so the second- and third-place teams, which bowl at lanes owned by Davis, could take higher honors. Davis fired back that Powell was ""full aware of the dress code"" and sent his kid anyway. He pressed: ""What parent would do this?"" As the Guardian reports, one of Powell's complaints is that his son was disqualified only after bowling a 171-point game that propelled his Riverdale team to the title in the Newfoundland city of St. John's."" After the story made headlines in Canada, an odd-sounding compromise was reached. The disqualification stands, but the kids get their gold medals. In the future, however, all rules must be followed ""no matter what,"" wrote Davis on Facebook.

"– The new Star Wars trailer debuted at halftime during ESPN's Monday Night Football, and immediately became a force to be reckoned with both on social media and ticket sites that crashed during presales for its Dec. 18 opening. Fandango and Movie Tickets both had issues after offering tickets even before the trailer aired for the JJ Abrams-directed The Force Awakens, the Hollywood Reporter notes. Fandango users got hit with a ""site maintenance"" message, while Movie Tickets customers received an error warning. Imax, meanwhile, waited patiently until after the halftime show to start its selling spree, but also had problems and had to funnel people to the other two sites. Meanwhile, buzz about the movie was one for the cosmos, making it hard to find a non-Star Wars-related tweet for a couple of hours after the trailer aired. The clip—which Business Insider called ""glorious"" and the San Jose Mercury News deemed ""spectacular with surprises""—blasted plenty of computer-generated special effects off the screen, as well as close-ups of newbies John Boyega as Finn, the franchise's new hero, and Daisy Ridley as female scavenger Rey (Ridley got emotional herself watching the trailer). And, to everyone's great pleasure, there was a Han Solo-Chewie appearance, as well as a rumor-busting interaction between Solo and Princess Leia, the Mercury News notes. See the full trailer below.

"– The FBI hopes new surveillance footage released today will aid in the recovery of 13 priceless artworks stolen 25 years ago and help put to rest one of Boston's greatest mysteries. In the early hours of March 18, 1990, two men dressed as cops were let into the Gardner Museum, where they tied up two security guards and absconded with the artwork and the museum's security footage, the Boston Globe reports. But the thieves, who have never been identified, may have missed one key thing. According to the FBI, surveillance footage from the day before the robbery shows a security guard letting a man into the museum—against protocol—through the same door later used in the robbery. The Globe reports it's unclear why this footage wasn't viewed by law enforcement earlier, but it could show a ""dry run"" of the heist. The newspaper identifies Richard Abath as the security guard in the footage, and the FBI is hoping the public can help identify the mystery man he lets in. Abath, a rock musician at the time who now lives in Vermont, has claimed he had no part in the robbery, but this new footage appears to contradict a number of his statements. No one has ever been charged with stealing the art—for which there is a $5 million reward—and no one ever will, as the statute of limitations has expired. Someone in possession of the paintings, however, could face charges. Their total value exceeds $500 million, reports AP.","['1) Vermeer’s ""The Concert""', 'That person entered the museum through the same door as the thieves in the middle of the night, 24 hours before the theft', 'will shed new light on exactly what happened March 18 [1990], who else may be involved, and hopefully lead us to our paintings', '5) Govaert Flinck’s ""Landscape with an Obelisk""', '6) A Shang Dynasty Chinese Bronze Beaker from 1200-1100 BC', ""Attorney's Office,Thursday, Aug"", '13) Napoleonic Eagle Finial', '9) Degas\' ""Three Mounted Jockeys""', '12) Manet’s ""Chez Tortoni""', '', '”', 'm', '4) Rembrandt’s ""Self Portrait""', '7) Degas\' ""La Sortie du Pelage""', '8) Degas\' ""Cortege Aux Environs de Florence""', '(Associated Press)', 'S', '""', '___', 'Online: https://www', 'youtube', 'Advertisement', 'That event occurred at 12:49 p', 'US Attorney Carmen M', '2) Rembrandt’s ""A Lady and Gentleman in Black""', '11) Degas\' ""Program for an Artistic Soiree"" (less finished charcoal on buff paper)', '“We have this big question mark as to who this individual is,” Ortiz said', 'Globe reporters discuss new video in Gardner museum heist', 'It was not immediately clear if Abath has recently discussed his actions that night with authorities', '- More information on Gardner Museum theft Uploaded on Aug 6, 2015', 'No panic button was activated and no Boston Police notification was made during the robbery', '10) Degas\' ""Program for an Artistic Soiree"" (charcoal on white paper)', 'Officials then decided to release it to the public in hopes it could lead to new information', '” He said the video “raises more questions than answers', 'He has said he opened the door only for security checks', 'Attorney Carmen Ortiz, which released the video', 'A Globe reporter who went to Abath’s house Thursday morning in Brattleboro was turned away by a woman who said he did not live there', 'on March 17, 1990, nearly exactly 24 hours before the heist', 'No weapons were seen during the robbery and no panic button was activated', 'The suspects did not brandish weapons, nor were any weapons seen during the heist', 'In this March 18, 1990 still image from surveillance video released by the U', 'We believe that no stone should be left unturned,” said Anthony Amore, Director of Security at the Gardner Museum', '“Over many months we have engaged in an exhaustive re-examination of the original evidence in this case']"
"– Walmart is under criminal investigation by the Department of Justice over allegations that it doled out millions in bribes to Mexican officials in order to grow its business there more quickly, sources tell Bloomberg and the Washington Post. The US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act prohibits companies from paying foreign officials in an effort to increase business, and if Walmart is found to be in violation of FCPA, the company could face executive departures, slowed expansion in Mexico and other markets, and penalties that could be ""incredibly high,"" says one lawyer. In a note to employees yesterday, Walmart CEO Mike Duke said the company is conducting its own ""aggressive investigation"" into the allegations; in an earlier statement, a VP had noted that ""many of the alleged activities ... are more than six years old. If these allegations are true, it is not a reflection of who we are or what we stand for.""

"– The Trump attorney who says he penned the ""sloppy"" tweet that some say indicates a possible obstruction of justice isn't done making headlines. John Dowd spoke to Axios' Mike Allen, scoffing at criticism of the tweet regarding Mike Flynn, which suggested Trump knew the former national security adviser had lied to the FBI before Trump canned James Comey. ""The tweet did not admit obstruction,"" Dowd says. ""That is an ignorant and arrogant assertion."" Plus, the Constitution has Trump's back, per Dowd. ""[The] president cannot obstruct justice because he is the chief law enforcement officer under [the Constitution's Article II] and has every right to express his view of any case,"" he claims. Newsweek notes it's not clear which section of Article II Dowd refers to, though it speculates on one part involving the president seeking the opinion ""of the principal Officer in each of the executive Departments, upon any Subject relating to the Duties of their respective Offices."" Allen notes that with this pronouncement, Trump's legal team is ""setting the stage"" to keep Trump insulated from obstruction of justice or collusion charges in the Russia probe—meaning, Allen speculates, that his lawyers may be nervous charges are coming down the pike. But one of Barack Obama's former counsels notes ""it is certainly possible"" for Trump to have obstructed justice, and Allen points out Richard Nixon's Articles of Impeachment were jump-started with the assertion that Nixon ""has prevented, obstructed, and impeded the administration of justice."" But whether Trump can or can't be held responsible for such a transgression may be moot, Allen adds.

But Moscow, in the meantime, sought to cast doubt on the generally accepted theory that pro-Russian separatists were to blame, reports the Wall Street Journal. At an official briefing last night, the defense ministry said that its radar spotted a second aircraft in the vicinity and that it was probably a Ukraine fighter jet, which could have shot down the plane. The air force chief also suggested that a Ukraine missile system could have hit the plane from the ground, and he said satellite imagery suggested that Ukraine had been moving such systems into the area. He offered no proof, but as Katie Stallard at Sky News writes, ""Russia doesn't need to prove its case—all it needs is to create one, to insist that there are different versions of events, that there is credible claim and counter-claim."" Meanwhile, the refrigerated train carrying passengers arrived in the Ukraine town of Kharkiv, reports the AP. Forensic experts from the Netherlands, which is taking the lead in the investigation, were to prepare the bodies today for transport to Amsterdam, probably tomorrow.

"– The mystery of what happened to a Swedish journalist who vanished after a ride on a Danish inventor's submarine is slowly becoming clearer. Though details are still scarce, Copenhagen police say Peter Madsen, after changing his story, has confessed that Kim Wall died in ""an accident"" on board his Nautilus sub and that he then ""buried her at sea,"" the BBC reports. Officials have been searching for Wall since her disappearance on Aug. 10, when she boarded Madsen's sub, which then sank off of Denmark's Refshaleoen island. Madsen initially claimed he had dropped Wall off after they'd cruised around for about three hours, but in a police statement cited by the Local, that story has since been modified. ""The accused has told police and the court that an accident occurred on board the submarine which caused Kim Wall’s death, and that he subsequently buried her at sea at an unspecified location somewhere in Koge Bay,"" reads the statement in the closed-door case. Madsen's explanation was released after a defense and prosecution request. Although the statement also notes that ""current charges remain in place,"" it's unclear what those charges are: Deutsche Welle notes that Madsen was originally charged with negligent manslaughter, but it's now reporting a new charge of aggressive manslaughter, which it says can lead to a prison sentence of up to eight years.

""They found Deputy Darren Goforth face down in a pool of his own blood,"" continued Anderson, per the Houston Chronicle. She says 15 shell casings were found at the scene, and a .40 caliber handgun recovered from Miles' home proved a match for the bullets that killed Goforth.

"– It is one of the most unusual, and rarest, jobs in the country: Larry Villarin is a certified male sex surrogate, one of only 10 in the US sanctioned by the International Professional Surrogates Association. But as a profile at Broadly makes clear, the 62-year-old Villarin is not to be confused with a male gigolo. His role is to help clients ""cope with their fears and anxieties about physical intimacy,"" writes Natalie O'Neill, and sex is just one component of that. The story uses the example of a 35-year-old woman who had shied away from intimacy her entire adult life because a car accident as a teenager left her blind in one eye. She'd never even been kissed until her sessions with Villarin. ""She needed to believe I wouldn't laugh at her or run away,"" he says. ""It was beautiful to see her open up."" On its website, IPSA says ""it is committed to promoting healthy attitudes toward sexuality and intimacy in our clients and in the community,"" and the story explains that it gets around prostitution laws ""because it doesn't acknowledge intercourse is part of the practice."" Villarin says his clients range in age from 22 to 75, with milestone birthdays seemingly one of the big triggers. Most are referred to him from a psychologist, with survivors of abuse and women with disabilities among those reaching out. One of the tricky parts is setting boundaries so the clients don't confuse the physical intimacy with romantic feelings for Villarin. ""It's just growth—what humans are capable of,"" he says.

"– Monday was Bitcoin Pizza Day, the anniversary of the day in 2010 when developer Laszlo Hanyecz paid 10,000 bitcoins for two pizzas in the online currency's first recognized transaction. The same amount of bitcoins would be worth around $22.5 million now. The currency, which sank to $443 a year ago, is up more than 65% so far this month and has been soaring to record highs, passing $2,000 for the first time over the weekend and breaking through the $2,100 and $2,200 marks on Monday, reports CNBC, which notes that a $100 investment in bitcoins exactly seven years ago would be worth more than $75 million at the $2,251 price it reached Monday. Analysts say several factors are behind the steep rise in the price of the currency, including political uncertainty worldwide and the ironing out of technical issues. Japan has also given bitcoins a big boost with new legislation allowing retailers to accept the currency. ""The Japanese have caught the bitcoin bug and inefficiencies across markets are being exposed,"" CryptoCompare founder Charles Hayter tells Business Insider.

"– James Tumblin's 300,000-piece collection of Gone With the Wind memorabilia started with a single gray dress with black appliques that lay crumpled on the floor of the Western Costume Company in Los Angeles in the 1960s. ""A docent told me not to bother to pick it up, because they were throwing it away,"" Tumblin, who once ran the hair and makeup department at Universal Studios, told the Telegraph last month. But ""I had noticed there was a printed label saying Selznick International Pictures, and 'Scarlett production dress' was written in ink,"" he said. ""I asked if he would sell it to me."" He ended up paying just $20 for the costume, worn by Vivien Leigh as Scarlett O'Hara in four scenes of the 1939 film—an incredible bargain considering the dress sold at auction on Saturday for $137,000. The outfit—really a jacket and skirt ensemble—was actually pale blue during filming. But some of the 150 Gone With the Wind pieces sold by Heritage Auctions this weekend remain in pristine condition, including a gray wool suit Clark Gable wore when he kicked down Scarlett O'Hara's boudoir door as Rhett Butler, CNN reports; it sold for $55,000. A straw hat worn by Leigh fetched $52,500, while a black bonnet donned by Leigh and Olivia de Havilland's character Melanie Wilkes sold for $30,000, Reuters reports. Tumblin seems happy to have been able to offer up his pieces, many of which have toured the country.

"– The duck boat sinking that killed 17 on a Missouri lake is now the subject of a federal criminal investigation after the Coast Guard found probable cause for negligence. The US Attorney's Office for the Western District of Missouri is seeking to delay civil lawsuits over the July 19 incident until the end of its ""wide-ranging"" investigation to prevent revealing evidence too early, though two boat captains already know themselves to be targets. Per the Springfield News-Leader, the Coast Guard found probable cause for ""misconduct, negligence, or inattention to the duties of the captain"" by Kenneth McKee of Ride the Ducks Branson's sunken Stretch Duck 07, and also probable cause that Barry King acted in a ""grossly negligent manner"" while operating Stretch Duck 54, which made it to safety. The Branson area had been under a severe thunderstorm warning for 20 minutes before Stretch Duck 07 entered Table Rock Lake, where 73mph winds whipped up waves more than three feet high. Per the Wichita Eagle, the boat wasn't to be operated in winds exceeding 35mph or waves exceeding two feet. Civil cases also accuse Ride the Ducks Branson, owned by Ripley Entertainment, of putting passengers at risk through use of boat canopies, citing a National Transportation Safety Board recommendation to remove them following a 1999 tragedy.

"– The West Coast sardine population was down 72% since 2006 per a fall assessment—the worst crash since the mid-20th century, and one with far-reaching implications, particularly since the steep decline is expected to continue. One of those implications: Ocean predators that depend on sardines may be starving, the Los Angeles Times reports: Researchers think 1,600 malnourished sea lion pups that washed up onshore in Southern California last year were born to nursing mothers whose milk quality was compromised after they had to turn from fatty sardines to other fish; brown pelicans—which also depend on sardines for food—are also suffering. Neither species can turn to anchovies as an alternative food source, as they normally would, because their numbers are also down. Fishermen, too, are affected; they're not allowed to catch as many sardines (harvest maximums have been dramatically cut)—and they often can't find any to catch (the LA Times follows one boat that caught zero fish in a 12-hour outing). So what's going on? Sardine populations often experience wild swings, booming when conditions are good and then dropping sharply when conditions shift. After the last bad collapse, which happened after a massive boom in the 1940s, sardine fishing was halted for 18 years beginning in the 1960s, and though the population bounced back in the 1980s, it was never the same. Scientists now, as then, aren't sure how to divide the blame between ocean conditions (the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a climate cycle, has brought cold, sardine-unfriendly water to the area) and overfishing. Last month, Pew Charitable Trusts warned that dozens of species, including whales, sharks, dolphins, salmon, and tuna, could feel an impact.","['The population rebounded in the 1980s and fishing resumed, but never at the level of its heyday', 'When conditions are poor, sardine populations plunge', 'For further information, please visit: pewenvironment', 'Spawning has taken a dive too', '""Not very well', '', 'org/pacificfish', 'comments@noaa', '""', 'And then it collapsed', '""Tonight\'s pretty reflective of how things have been going,"" Hanson said', 'Cause for concern', 'Now, they say, there is evidence some ocean predators are starving without sardines', '5 million tons estimated in 2000 and a major decline by historical standards', ""The Pacific sardine is the ocean's quintessential boom-bust fish"", 'While those conditions have brought a boom in some species, such as market squid, they have repelled sardines', 'Fulfill its September 2013 commitment to prohibit unregulated fishing on forage fish species such as sand lance, saury, and lanternfish that are not currently managed or monitored', 'Keeping an eye on the big picture']"

""I realize this is a bit of uncharted territory for Ohio, but if another life can be saved by his willingness to donate his organs and tissues then we should allow for that to happen,” said Kasich.

"– As four black Florida A&M University students waited outside for a friend to let them into his apartment building for a party, a white man confronted them—and ultimately pulled a gun on them in an incident Tallahassee police and the university are now investigating. Video of a portion of the Saturday night incident went viral after one of the students, Isaiah Butterfield, posted it on Twitter; Butterfield tells BuzzFeed News that before he started filming, the white man in the video walked past him and his friends and through the building's entrance. ""Then he turned and he said, ‘You aren’t getting in here if you don't have a key,'"" Butterfield says. ""We were shook because we hadn’t said anything to him."" He says the man then came back outside and started harassing the group, at which point another white person walked up and started defending the black students. Butterfield then started filming. The white bystander, who had a key to the building, let the group inside; the first white man then insisted they not get on the elevator with him and asked repeatedly whether they had a key to the building. As the group attempted to enter the elevator, the man pulled out a gun. ""He made sure we saw that he had a gun so we didn't get in the elevator,"" says Butterfield, who notes that the group had earlier questioned whether the man actually lived in the building, since it is student housing and he looked older than most residents. (At one point in the video, the man can be heard saying, ""Where am I going? I am going upstairs to get laid."") The students, who were ultimately let into the building by their friend, reported the incident to police the following day.

"– Jim Vidmar has rather unusual job: He oversees 10,000 fake Twitter accounts. And the Las Vegas man has been at it for six years, using a dozen computers and a slew of accounts to help beef up the followings of his 50-or-so clients, who pay him to help them seem more popular and important, reports the Wall Street Journal. And the accounts have gotten more sophisticated: In April, a tough new filter was applied, and the majority of Vidmar's accounts were wiped from the site. And so the vendors that sell the fakes to Vidmar put a little more work into them: The fakes now feature photos, profile details, and tweet a number of times before he buys them; he got 1,000 for $58 from a Pakistan supplier this month. From there, he has the accounts tweet, retweet, follow, and message—all in the name of clients like ""Rapper/Singer/Producer/Guitarist/Fitness Model"" Dave Murrell aka @Fyrare (number of Twitter followers: 238,360). Murrell has tried Twitter ads, but says he gets more bang for his buck with Vidmar. Murrell doesn't exactly express any qualms: ""If you're not padding your numbers, you're not doing it right.

"– The Bourbon virus—so named because it first emerged recently in Bourbon County, Kansas—has puzzled researchers. A man with the first known case of the disease died last year, and since then, experts have been working to learn more about it. A new study outlines findings, NBC News reports. ""It took months to find out this a novel virus that belonged to a genus of viruses called Thogotovirus,"" which have been seen ""throughout the world,"" CDC researcher Erin Staples tells NBC. Just one example of the Thogotovirus has appeared in the US, the researchers write in a CDC publication: Aransas Bay virus, found in ticks in a seabird nest off Texas. Though the Kansas death is the first scientists have linked to the illness, Staples believes it has probably affected others; they just didn't know it. That doesn't mean we should panic, she notes; we should just continue to protect ourselves against ticks, which may be carriers. Mosquitoes and other animals may also be involved, and researchers are preparing to investigate.","['But by the fourth day, the patient was drifting in and out of consciousness and was taken by ambulance to the hospital', 'Virus Genes', ""It wasn't anything that had been seen before"", 'Serological studies on Dhori virus', 'His condition did not improve', 'net/) as described (16)', 'DOI PubMed Kuno G , Chang GJ , Tsuchiya KR , Miller BR', 'were negative', 'Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever infects about 2,500 people a year', 'Initial laboratory findings showed leukopenia (2,200 cells/μL), lymphopenia (absolute lymphocyte count 550 cells/μL), thrombocytopenia (72,000 cells/μL), mild hyponatremia (sodium 133 mmol/L), hypokalemia (potassium 3', 'Cite This Article', '“We are surprised', 'galactomannan, antibodies against Histoplasma spp', 'New York: Elsevier Inc', '6 mg/dL–1', 'Discussion Using traditional techniques (i', 'Lambert, Dana J', 'Lambert, D', '2014 ; 88 : 5298 – 309', 'McCauley JW , Hongo S , Kaverin NV , Kochs G , Lamb RA , Matrosovich MN , Family Orthomyxoviridae', 'Emerg Infect Dis', 'Washington (DC): American Public Health Association; 1995', '2012 ; 93 : 293 – 8', 'Hunt)', '2006 ; 12 : 1074 – 80', 'Volume 21, Number 5—May 2015', 'Am J Trop Med Hyg', '0 mmol/L), a creatinine level (0', 'Kosoy, A', '8°C) developed', 'Kosoy, Amy J', 'Pastula, Cynthia S', 'J Gen Virol', 'Research', 'Goldsmith, D', 'Pastula, J', 'Arboviruses', '2011 ; 364 : 1523 – 32', 'Parasitol Res', '2003 ; 41 : 379 – 85', 'J Clin Microbiol', 'Olga I', 'Hawkinson, Daniel M', 'Erin Staples', 'I', 'J', 'M', 'e', 'S', 'C', '', '05 software (http://www', 'megasoftware', 'g', 'Ms', 'Acknowledgment', 'References', 'p', '749–61', '2001 ; 23 : 211 – 4', '2005 ; 73 : 1050 – 8', '1985 ; 29 : 324 – 8']"

"– You have one of six possible variations of the APOE gene, having inherited one variant—e2, e3, or e4—from each parent. Reporting in the journal Neuron, University of Hawaii researchers found that the brain development of children as young as preschool age with two copies of e4 or one of e4 and one of e2 seem most adversely affected—an intriguing find in light of previous research that has linked the e4 variant to Alzheimer's. Researchers scanned the brains of 1,187 healthy people between the ages of 3 and 20 and found, for instance, that the size of the hippocampus tends to be smaller in those with the e2/e4 combination. They also found some kids with e4 didn't perform as well on tests of memory, though they caught up with their peers by age 10, reports HealthDay News. And while brain researcher Rebecca Knickmeyer, who didn't participate in the study but wrote an accompanying editorial, says the variants aren't necessarily predictive and people shouldn't start testing their kids, the research suggests that Alzheimer's may in fact be a developmental disorder, not strictly an aging one, reports the Los Angeles Times. That raises the possibility that adjustments to ""diet or cognitive training"" early on could change someone's ""trajectory,"" per Knickmeyer. Three in four people have at least one copy of e3, which seems to offer a protective effect. About 14% of people have an e4 variant, which has been linked with an elevated risk of Alzheimer's, but Knickmeyer points out that there are many Alzheimer's patients without e4, and many with e4 who never develop Alzheimer's. (Some research suggests that memories lost to Alzheimer's are actually retrievable.)","['People who carry at least one copy of the APOE e4 allele have an increased chance of developing atherosclerosis, which is an accumulation of fatty deposits and scar-like tissue in the lining of the arteries', '', 'However, other studies have not found these associations', ""People with one — and especially two — e4 variants are significantly more likely to develop Alzheimer's than people without e4""]"

"– Ebola doesn't always show itself through fever, vomiting, and diarrhea. A new PLOS study finds that some people with the virus show mild or no symptoms at all—a potential concern for preventing its spread. Researchers who visited the village of Sukudu in Sierra Leone, a hot spot in the recent West African Ebola outbreak, found up to 25% of Ebola infections ""may have been minimally symptomatic,"" meaning ""a significant portion of Ebola transmission events may have gone undetected"" in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, NBC News reports. At least 28,000 people are known to have been infected during the epidemic, at least 11,000 of whom died. In Sukudu, there were 34 known Ebola cases, including 28 deaths among 900 residents, reports Gizmodo. A year after the worst of the outbreak was over, Stanford University researchers tested the blood of 187 people in Sukudu who'd lived with or shared a toilet with someone infected with Ebola, per a release. They found 14 had Ebola antibodies, suggesting they'd previously been infected, while 12 said they didn't recall feeling sick or having a fever. Believing them to be truthful as health workers kept an eye on villagers during the outbreak, researchers now plan to visit other villages ""so we can begin to answer the question of what was the true burden of disease,"" the study author says. ""We expect to find a lot more undocumented survivors."" It's not clear if asymptomatic patients are contagious.

"– Not long after 12-year-old Tamir Rice was killed by police in Cleveland in November, a group of students in nearby Akron decided protests weren't enough. So the Akron PeaceMakers, an anti-violence youth group, brainstormed with the local PD to come up with a double-sided crib sheet of tips for kids to follow when interacting with cops, NPR reports. The ""You and the Law"" cards, set to be doled out to all Akron middle school and high school students—and possibly to adults, and internationally, in the future—feature 15 bullet points outlining ""basic rights and responsibilities,"" as well as suggestions to ensure safety during an encounter. ""Do not 'bad-mouth' or walk away from the law-enforcement officials,"" ""control your emotions,"" and ""do not resist arrest for any reason"" are some of the tips. The top of each card mentions the ""easiest way to avoid conflict with law enforcement officials is simply to stay out of trouble."" The cards have sparked a debate over whether the police are escaping their own responsibility in confrontations, NPR notes. But the kids involved say the point is to de-escalate the situation, not let cops off the hook—and there are phone numbers on the back to report police misconduct. ""Instead of cussing [a police officer] out, I can just say, 'OK. Let me calm down,' and then at a later time, call the police station,"" one student tells NPR. Akron Mayor Don Plusquellic says the cards serve as a common-sense refresher. ""Some people don't think about 'Oh, what happens when I reach in for my license,'"" he said at a presentation of the cards, per Cleveland.com. Billy Soule, whose son was stopped by cops years ago with a toy gun, works with the youth group as a city rep.

""As such, he was lawfully acting in defense of himself or others."" The finding followed a five-month investigation and protests around California, including a ""National Day of Action for Andy Lopez"" organized by a statewide group opposing police brutality, CBS San Francisco reports. Andy was walking through rural Sonoma County last October, holding a BB gun resembling an AK-47, when deputies on patrol saw him and told him to drop the weapon. Ten seconds later, Gelhaus had put seven bullets in the boy. ""The family and my office are greatly disappointed with the decision,"" said the Lopez family's attorney. ""If there was ever a case where charges were warranted, it was this one."" But Ravitch said her office pored over more than 1,000 pages of reports and spoke to numerous experts to consider ""every interpretation of the facts.""

"– ""Thank you. Thank you."" Those were the first words Gregory Jean Jr. spoke to police on Saturday when they peeled back a wood panel in an upstairs closet and found him crammed in the space between the garage and attic, WXIA reports.

Here's what critics are saying: ""Bigelow drills down into one of American history's most egregious cases of abuse of police power, bringing it to life with visceral detail and slowed-down meticulousness"" in what ""feels like her timeliest movie yet,"" writes Ann Hornaday at the Washington Post. It's ""daring, sophisticated and unforgettably disturbing."" And ""in scale, scope and the space it offers for a long-awaited moral reckoning, it's nothing less than monumental."" ""It's hard to overstate just how visceral and harrowing an experience it is,"" writes Lindsey Bahr at the AP, calling Detroit ""a well-made and evocative film"" jam-packed with ""stomach-churning horror."" She argues there could be more nuance and perspective. But ""maybe anger is all you're supposed to feel when you step outside the theater. Maybe not feeling satisfied with Detroit is the point."" Chris Klimek says Detroit is ""maddeningly imperfect but still honorable,"" citing ""lightly fictionalized"" aspects of the otherwise true story that set it up ""for maximum outrage."" This is ""messy work, even when it’s done in good faith,"" he writes at NPR. He applauds John Boyega, previously of The Force Awakens. Radiating a ""Denzel-like calm,"" he shows ""he's a bonafide movie star,"" Klimek writes. Peter Howell's main gripe is that the film ""tries to tell us everything about the circumstances without telling us much about the people."" But Detroit still makes for ""urgent viewing,"" he writes at the Toronto Star. Why? ""The injustice and anger behind it all feels like current reality, even a half-century on,"" when ""a person's skin can still determine everything from employment opportunities to treatment by police.""","['The movie opens with a semi-animated sequence that fashions Jacob Lawrence\'s ""Migration Series"" of paintings into a primer on the mass movement of African-Americans from the rural south to the urban north and west after World War I, and the subsequent white flight to the suburbs', ""It's about Reed becoming a militant for peace"", ""It's nauseating"", ""Bigelow's quasi-journalistic style has long alienated some viewers; now it's infuriating them, too"", 'This is still America', 'Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian', '"" Running time: 143 minutes', '', 'S', '""', '———', 'twitter', ')', 'Boston', 'Neuman', 'D', 'I', 'A', "") Detroit isn't as dispassionate as that"", ""(They're still touring"", 'Her follow-up, Zero Dark Thirty, got a Best Picture nod, too', 'Enlarge this image toggle caption Francois Duhamel/Annapurna Francois Duhamel/Annapurna', ""com/ldbahr In Harrowing 'Detroit,' Kathryn Bigelow Mixes Brutal Facts With Fiction"", 'MPAA Definition of R: Restricted', 'Follow AP Film Writer Lindsey Bahr on Twitter: www', ""It's about him making a choice to survive"", 'Three young Black men were left dead and many questions were left unanswered', 'This was America, you think', 'Three stars out of four', 'Bigelow has always gone for immersion before reflection or judgment', 'From the Critics From RT Users Like You!', '(Strange Days even climaxes in a riot touched off by white police using excessive force on a black suspect, which is where Detroit begins', ""It's hard to overstate just how visceral and harrowing an experience it is"", 'Did this really happen?

"– Donald Trump says a meeting with dozens of black pastors at Trump Tower on Monday was ""amazing,"" ""inspiring,"" and ""unbelievable""—but he has no intention of changing his campaign's tone. His campaign initially said the summit would be followed by public endorsements from more than 100 clergy members, though it later canceled the public part of the meeting and pastors say there were plenty of disagreements during the talk, Politico reports. ""I asked him: 'Are you a racist?'"" Bishop George Bloomer tells the AP. ""People are saying that about you,"" Bloomer says he told Trump. ""If you are seeking the African-American community to support you, at the least, you're not helping with these kind of things that are going on."" Clergy members say the roughing up of a Black Lives Matter protester at a Trump rally was discussed, as was Trump's rhetoric on immigration. Afterward, Trump said, ""The beautiful thing about the meeting is they didn't ask me to change the tone,"" per Politico. Some attendees say he did agree to soften his tone somewhat, though the AP reports that at a Monday evening rally in Macon, Ga., where he was introduced by Herman Cain, Trump repeated the positions on immigration that the pastors had been concerned about. But he has adopted a ""newly conciliatory tone on racial matters,"" according to the New York Times: Trump and the clergy members who met with him were strongly criticized by the Rev.

"– Everyone knows smartphones can steal hours from a day, but employees are turning to their mobile devices while on the clock, too. A new survey by staffing firm OfficeTeam finds that office workers spend an average of 56 minutes a day on their cell phones while at work, and another 42 minutes a day doing other personal tasks. That's nearly five hours of personal phone time a week, and a total of more than eight hours of broader personal time, notes WTOP. Not only that, but most bosses underestimate the time waste on phones to be closer to 39 minutes a day—and workers younger than 35 are averaging a whopping 70 minutes of their day on their phones and 48 minutes on other personal matters. ""It's understandable that employees may occasionally use their mobile devices or attend to personal tasks during business hours,"" OfficeTeam's' district president says. ""But these activities can easily become big distractions."" Fortune reports that most of the personal time on phones is spent on social media and non-work email; in distant third, fourth, and fifth places come sports sites, mobile gaming, and shopping. Beyond this, the survey found that 58% of office workers visit pages their company prohibits, but there's a breakdown between the sexes: 68% of men do this, compared to just 43% of women.

"– There are roughly 73.7 million kids running around America, and about 16 million, or nearly one in five, of them are doing so fueled by food stamps, according to US Census data out yesterday. That number is particularly alarming when compared to pre-recession levels: In 2007, some 9 million, or one in eight, kids were on food stamps. There are currently about 46 million Americans total on food stamps, down from the 2013 peak of 48 million. The jump signals what Reuters says is a ""lop-sided"" economic recovery that has left low-income people behind, but it also underscores a fundamental partisan divide over social welfare programs. As the Blaze notes, Republicans want to scale back the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program—arguing that the end of the recession should indicate less need—and trimmed $8.6 billion and 850,000 people from its rolls with last year's farm bill. Democrats, meanwhile, argue that it's too soon to scale back the program. Meanwhile, some other highlights from the Census numbers: 27% of children live in single-parent homes, three times the 9% who did in 1960 10% of kids live with a grandparent, 15% have a stay-at-home mom, 0.6% have a stay-at-home dad, and 38% have at least one foreign-born parent 48% of households are made up of married couples, down from 76% in 1940 Americans are continuing to marry later, at a median age of 29 for men and 27 for women; that's up from 24 and 21 in 1947","['Today’s table package delves into the characteristics of households, including the marital status of the householders and their relationship to the children residing in the household', 'S', '', 'gov', 'Census Bureau reported Wednesday that 16 million children living in America received food stamps in 2014, or about one out of every five kids', 'Census Bureau’s annual Families and Living Arrangements table package released today', '6 billion from the program, eliminating benefits for about 850,000 people, according to estimates by anti-hunger advocates', 'Census survey of American families released on Wednesday', 'The median age for people first getting married in 2014 was 29 for men and 27 for women up from 24 and 21 respectively in 1947', '7 billion from the program over ten years', 'The historical data on America’s families and living arrangements can be found on census', 'That cut was estimated to reduce food stamp benefits by about $90 per month for the hundreds of thousands of homes that use them']"
"– Heartburn is a big problem in the US. In fact, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), which are used to treat acid reflux and heartburn, are among the most prescribed drugs in the country, with millions taking them, and they're becoming more widely available over-the-counter, reports CNN. But a preliminary report just released by the American Heart Association is concerned that the drug—already associated with a higher risk of heart attack and other vascular problems, as the AHA reported earlier this year—may also increase one's risk of ischemic stroke, the most common type caused when a clot cuts off blood flow to the brain. ""At one time, PPIs were thought to be safe, without major side effects,"" the study's lead author says. “This study further questions the cardiovascular safety of these drugs."" Researchers followed nearly a quarter-million patients in Denmark who were suffering from stomach pain and indigestion and had an endoscopy. Their average age was 57, and six years later those taking one of four PPIs (Prilosec, Protonix, Prevacid, or Nexium) had a 21% higher risk of stroke than those not taking one. Lowest-dose PPIs didn't increase the risk much if at all, while highest-dose increased it, from 30% for Prevacid to 94% for Protonix. Another type of acid-lowering meds called H2 blockers (think Pepcid and Zantac) showed no elevated risk. ""As a culture, we tend to want a pill to deal with our problems, when a lot of people could reduce their heartburn by eating smaller meals, drinking less alcohol, or not smoking,"" one doc told CNN in 2010. (PPIs are also associated with a higher risk of dementia.)","['“With the knowledge that PPIs are being used by millions of people for indications and durations that were never tested or approved, it may be time for the pharmaceutical industry and regulatory agencies to re-visit the specificity and the safety of these agents,” Cooke said', 'org/news/heartburn-drug-damages-blood-vessel-cells-in-lab-finding?preview=9c99da54e21c70a1a941c9610398ecef', 'JUST WATCHED Drug-resistant bacteria found in U', 'heart', 'Study Highlights:', 'Follow AHA/ASA news on Twitter @HeartNews', '; Roman Sukhovershin, Ph', 'org/corporatefunding', 'org', 'Most serious warning yet', 'Replay More Videos', 'Julie Del Barto (national broadcast): (214) 706-1330; julie', 'Embargoed until 3 p', '', 'm', 'CT / 4 p', 'S', '”', 'D', '; Timo Z', 'Nazari-Shafti, M', 'Additional Resources:', '###', 'Akeem Ranmal: (214) 706-1755; akeem', '""', '02:18', 'MUST WATCH Ways to treat heartburn 02:40', '""Antacids usually would help if you have less than one incident a week,"" Badger-Plange said', 'ranmal@heart', '""Patient safety is a top priority', ', Ph', 'ET Tuesday, May 10, 2016', 'Cooke, M', 'Notably, another type of antacid known as an H2 antagonist, did not have this adverse effect', 'Patients with kidney disease should avoid antacids that contain aluminum']"

No, she isn’t a mathematician who planned out her pregnancies to happen that way: Her first child was born full-term, but the next two were both born early—and both were actually induced a day prior to being born, USA Today reports. Of course, along come the statisticians to make the story a lot less magical: “The probability is not as astronomical as you might be compelled to think,” says one. Another says the chance of such a series of births is about 1 in 2,500—not all that “extraordinary,” he says, since thousands of women in the US gave birth during those years.

"– Donald Trump has announced that he will nominate attorney David Friedman as US ambassador to Israel, selecting an envoy who supports Israeli settlements and other changes to US policies in the region, reports the AP. Friedman says he looks forward to carrying out his duties from ""the US embassy in Israel's eternal capital, Jerusalem,"" even though the embassy is in Tel Aviv. Like some of his predecessors, Trump has vowed to move the American embassy to Jerusalem, a politically charged act that would anger Palestinians who want east Jerusalem as part of their sovereign territory. The move would also distance the US from most of the international community, including its closest allies in Western Europe and the Arab world. The president-elect says Friedman will ""maintain the special relationship"" between the US and Israel. But the announcement sparked anger from liberal Jewish groups, with the president of J Street calling Friedman's nomination ""reckless,"" citing his support for settlements and his questioning of a two-state solution with the Palestinians. (Friedman has previously likened liberal Jews in the US to Jews who aided the Nazis during World War II, notes the New York Times.) The statement doesn't detail how Friedman could work in Jerusalem. One option would involve Friedman, if confirmed by the Senate, working out of an existing US consulate in Jerusalem.

"– After just short of 20 years, the murder of JonBenet Ramsey is as much of a mystery as ever—especially in light of a new examination of DNA evidence. A joint investigation by the Boulder Daily Camera and 9News calls into question former District Attorney Mary Lacy's decision to exonerate the Ramsey family. At the time, Lacy concluded that DNA evidence found on JonBenet's underwear and long johns belonged to a male intruder who was not part of the Ramsey family. But now three forensic experts who examined the DNA test results and lab reports used by Lacy say they do not support her conclusion. For one thing, a sample on her underwear identified as coming from ""Unknown Male 1"" may in fact be a composite from multiple people and thus ""worthless as evidence,"" says the news report. Another revelation that further muddles the picture: DNA samples on her long johns appear to come from JonBenet and at least two other people, not one, a fact that has never been revealed before. What's more, the independent experts say all of the unknown DNA may be the result of ""inconsequential contact with other people,"" reports the Camera. With the exoneration, ""I was trying to prevent a horrible travesty of justice,"" Lacy tells ABC. (The interview was done before these latest revelations.) ""I was scared to death that despite the fact that there was no evidence, no psychopathy, and no motive, the case was a train going down the track and the Ramseys were tied to that track.""

"– John Stumpf, the Wells Fargo CEO slammed for his ""gutless leadership"" by Sen. Elizabeth Warren last week, is going to have to tighten his belt a little this year: He will forfeit his bonus, part of his salary, and $41 million in stock awards over the fake-account scandal that saw the sacking of 5,300 employees, CNN reports. In addition, Stumpf will work for free while the company conducts an investigation. The bank's board of directors also says Carrie Tolstedt, who headed the retail division where workers created the phony accounts, will forfeit at least $19 million of the $125 million she was going to leave the company with at the end of the year, and will not receive severance or a bonus for 2016. The announcement comes as Wells Fargo is set to go before the House Financial Services Committee on Thursday. The board says it is launching an independent investigation into how millions of accounts were created without the permission of customers, the BBC reports. Wells Fargo was fined $185 million over the scandal and the Washington Post describes the board's cash clawback as ""by far the most aggressive and public effort"" since the 2008 financial crisis to punish bank chiefs for misconduct—although Stumpf still has the estimated $161 million he received in bonuses over the five years the scam took place, and Tolstedt received $60 million over the same period.

"– A BuzzFeed investigation this year found at least 29 US police dogs had died of heatstroke in their handlers' cars over the past seven years. But a new analysis of 619 deaths since 2011 by the Green Bay Press-Gazette raises that number to at least 46 dogs, with 18 others succumbing to heatstroke during other activities (e.g., training exercises, being tethered outside in the sun), putting heatstroke as the No. 1 cause of police dog deaths for non-medical reasons. Failures in the cars' AC or other equipment were factors in 19 of the 46 cases, while officer negligence was blamed in 26. One especially egregious case in 2013 involved 10 US Customs and Border Protection dogs who died after the AC failed. ""Those dogs were essentially in an oven,"" a rep said at the time. ""You don't have to be an animal lover to be sick about this."" It's unclear exactly how many police dogs die this way, since agencies don't have to report it, the Press-Gazette notes; instead, stats are typically culled from memorial websites and other sources. ""It is a painful, horrible death,"" a veterinary specialist told BuzzFeed. Departments are taking measures including replacing faulty heat-alarm units, mounting fans in car windows, and inspecting AC units more regularly. But advocates say it comes down to human diligence. ""It's not a matter of changing policy,"" the director of a Wisconsin canine handler group tells the Press-Gazette. ""Check on your dog."" An Animal Legal Defense Fund director puts it in harsher terms: ""An officer who allows a dog to die of heat exhaustion on duty is as neglectful as leaving a service revolver on a school playground.""

"– A 21-year-old Baltimore County man died in the hospital three days after being repeatedly punched by officers responding to his 911 call, the Guardian reports. According to the Baltimore Sun, Tawon Boyd called 911 early last Sunday. He told officers his girlfriend, Deona Styron, had ""got him intoxicated and is secretly recording him."" Boyd's grandmother, Linda Burch, says Boyd ""was acting...like he was on something."" Police noted he seemed ""confused and paranoid,"" and it was clear he ""needed to be taken to the hospital."" But Boyd started trying to get into police cars and resisted attempts to restrain him, resulting in minor injuries to three officers. Based on the police report, it doesn't appear Boyd was trying to hurt the officers. He was holding onto one of the officer's shirts when the officer punched him twice in the face. At that point, the family's lawyer, Latoya Francis-Williams, says Boyd was ""literally attacked"" by officers. She says they got on top of him and ""really started wailing."" “I kept telling them stop before they hurt him,” Burch tells the Sun. “They told me to go across the street before they lock me up.” WBAL reports a medic gave Boyd haloperidol, an antipsychotic drug, to calm him down. An autopsy is now looking into whether the drug played a role in Boyd's death Wednesday from heart and kidney failure. Boyd's family is accusing the police of using too much force. “Mr. Boyd was in need of medical attention, and the police responded with violence,” Francis-Williams tells the Sun.","['According to the report, Boyd attempted to enter two police cars and then ran to a neighbor’s house and banged on the door, calling: “Help!

"– Almost 30 years after he went missing from a group home in Kitchener, Ontario, at the age of 21, Edgar Latulip remembered something very important last month: his name. Police say the 50-year-old, who has a developmental delay and functions at a child's level, has spent the last 30 years living in St. Catharines, around 80 miles from where he disappeared, CTV reports. From what investigators can piece together, Latulip took a bus to Niagara Falls in September 1986 and ended up in St. Catharines, where he suffered a head injury and ""effectively forgot who he was"" until this year, when he told a social worker he remembered. Before his disappearance, Latulip had attempted suicide at least once, leading to fears he may have killed himself. Police officer Duane Gingerich, who investigated the disappearance, tells the Guelph Mercury that he's thrilled that Latulip has turned up alive. ""I had hopes that he was out there somewhere,"" he says. ""For us as investigators, this is great, this is awesome. It's satisfying because most of these cases don't turn out this way. You expect the worst when a person is missing for that period of time."" A DNA test confirmed Latulip's identity and police say a reunion with his mother, who moved to Ottawa years ago, is being arranged. In a 2014 interview, she told the Mercury she was still haunted by the disappearance. ""This is always at the back of my mind. Having an answer would mean closure,"" she said. (A California hospital recently identified the man it had called ""Garage 66"" for 16 years.)","['At the time of his disappearance, police believed Latulip, who has a developmental delay, took a bus and travelled to the Niagara Falls area', ""Latulip's mother, Silvia Wilson, said she is overwhelmed by her son's return, but she hasn’t spoken with him yet"", 'Catharines, Ont', 'CTVNews', 'ca Staff', '', '""', 'Const']"
"– Michael Douglas has backtracked after hitting the headlines by saying his throat cancer was caused by oral sex instead of smoking and drinking. The actor's publicist now says that he wasn't talking about his own cancer being caused by the human papilloma virus, the BBC reports. The reversal prompted the Guardian to release audio of its interview with Douglas, in which the actor says he doesn't regret his years of smoking and drinking, because ""this particular cancer is caused by something called HPV, which actually comes about from cunnilingus."" At an American Cancer Society event in New York last night, Douglas said he had been trying to raise awareness of the link between HPV and throat cancer, the New York Daily News reports. ""I've become, I think, in the past 24 hours a sort of poster boy for oral cancer, and just so you all understand, I think we would all love to know where our cancer comes from,"" he told the audience. ""I simply, to a reporter, tried to give a little PSA announcement about HPV, a virus that can cause oral cancer, and is one of the few areas of cancer that can be controlled and there are vaccinations that kids can get.""","['Allen Burry, a spokesman for the actor, has since denied that Douglas said that oral sex was the cause of his own cancer, but was merely one of the many causes of oral cancer', '“This particular cancer is caused by HPV,"" he says in a recent interview', 'Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas', 'com)', 'com', 'No', '” (Richard Corkery/New York Daily News)', '', '""', '”', '(Ben Gabbe/Getty Images)']"
"– Real-live winter in the South? You bet: Unlikely ice storms hammered southern states yesterday, depriving thousands of power, forcing hundreds of flight cancellations, and killing at least five people, CNN reports. It's not over, either: Storms are poised to strike regions from Dallas to Memphis until tomorrow and Arkansas through Monday. The north will also get its share, with sleet or snow hitting central New England through the central Appalachians into today, and blanketing the nation's capital tomorrow. In other details: Dallas/Forth Worth had it worst, canceling nearly 700 flights and the downtown Dallas holiday parade for the first time in 26 years. The storm cut out power for more than 200,000 customers. Temperature swings were shocking: In Hot Springs, Arkansas, a temperate 75-degree day on Wednesday turned into an ice storm yesterday. Most fatalities occurred on icy roads, including the death of Granby, Missouri, Mayor Ronald Arnall, whose car veered off a state highway in southern Missouri and hit a tree, Reuters reports. Oklahoma alone has recorded about 116 storm-related injuries. A new storm struck the Pacific Coast yesterday, dropping pretty heavy snow on Portland. Even Las Vegas might see snow today—up to 2 inches.

"– The world's least shocking quote: A British man's admission that his fairly miraculous swim across the Hoover Dam reservoir was ""drink fueled,"" per the Guardian. Arron Hughes speaks to the Daily Post about his Aug. 10 experience, which came after what he says was a 37-hour bachelor-party bender with friends in Las Vegas. He describes it as a brutally hot day and says that as they stood under the 726-foot-tall structure, he decided, ""F--- it! I'm going for a swim."" What he didn't know then that he knows now: Some 275 people have died at the dam over the last decade, and no one has successfully made it across the full width of the Colorado River there. But he apparently had luck on his side: Only one of the 10 hydroelectric turbines were powered on during his swim. ""I swam from Arizona to Nevada,"" he tells the Post. ""I went across first and then swam back. ... It took about 30 minutes to do. Even though I was knackered half way across I knew I had to get to the other side."" He reportedly told the Sun that he was about 160 feet from the dam and felt a strong tug. ""I was sucked towards the wall and had to swim hard."" He says police were waiting for him and handcuffed him for what he didn't realize wasn't permitted, as he says there aren't any ""no swimming"" signs posted. ""You're just expected not to."" He says he ended up getting fined about $330, but, as the tattoo on his body reads, per the Times of London: ""No regrets.""

"– When US inspectors looked at four border police bases in Afghanistan—funded by the US at a cost of almost $19 million—they found most of the facilities on three of those bases had either been abandoned or weren't being used as intended, the Wall Street Journal reports. The report from the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, a US government watchdog agency, uncovered numerous examples of poor construction work: One base has no water supply, a second is experiencing sewage overflow, some are missing drainpipes, others have leaking fuel lines or broken doors. One even includes a well house being used as … a chicken coop. The US Army Corps of Engineers says it is working on fixing the issues. The report also finds that the US plan to fund hundreds of millions of dollars worth of infrastructure projects in the country is extremely behind schedule—and that some of the ambitious plans may actually hurt the country, the Washington Post adds. The report raises concerns about the 2014 withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan and questions whether local forces are prepared to take over security duties—and whether this new infrastructure can be successfully maintained by a country with limited resources. The Post digs into a $220 million electricity project in Kandahar that it cites as a prime example.","['The report, by the special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction, also concludes that the Afghan government will not have the money or skill to maintain many of the projects, creating an “expectations gap�? among the population that could harm overall stabilization efforts', 'taxpayers about $220 million through 2013', 'counter\xadinsurgency campaign', 'Now-retired Gen', 'Army Maj', 'Senior U', 'S', '', 'When U', 'Sen', 'Claire McCaskill (D-Mo', '”', 'djreprints', 'com A U', '�?', 'David H', 'All U', '“This is a bridge to nowhere,” he declared to his staff in 2011', 'funding for diesel ends', 'Many U', 'Gen', 'This report was approved by a new inspector, former federal prosecutor John F', 'But other civilian and military officials have questioned that logic', 'foreign assistance program has led to waste and fueled corruption', 'Army Corps of Engineers install a new hydropower turbine at a dam in the violence-plagued hills of neighboring Helmand province', 'Dow Jones Reprints: This copy is for your personal, non-commercial use only', 'government’s long term commitment to Afghanistan', 'He has vowed to scrutinize how projects are conceptualized and designed, not just how they are implemented', 'counterinsurgency mission, the inspector general wrote', 'and Afghan governments can lose the populace’s support', 'Kenneth Dahl was the deputy commander of U']"

Cantor—the first majority leader ever to lose a primary—is stepping down at the end of July following his shock defeat at the hands of little-known Tea Party challenger David Brat. ""It became obvious to me that the measures necessary to run a successful campaign would have created unnecessary and painful division within our party,"" Sessions said. The leadership election will be held by secret ballot next week but the more competitive race is now the one to succeed McCarthy as whip, the Hill finds. McCarthy's chief deputy, Rep.

Paramount is also tweaking the marketing materials for the movie, according to the Hollywood Reporter. A source says a scene in which Cruise's character, a former military cop, uses a semiautomatic weapon is being removed from promos. Even a comedy, Parental Guidance, saw its red carpet premiere and after-party canceled over the weekend ""in light of the horrific tragedy,"" AFP reports. The film stars Bette Midler and Billy Crystal. Also over the weekend, episodes of Family Guy and American Dad were yanked.","['The Film Society of Lincoln Center in New York City also postponed a special screening of Jack Reacher on Monday night that was to be accompanied by a discussion with Cruise and director Christopher McQuarrie, saying it was doing so out of respect for the families of the victims', '""[Django} is a Western', 'Tuesday, December 18, 2012 1:26 EST', '', '19', 'Give me a break', '""', '”', 'Everyone please pray for them', 'used NFL football to advertise its upcoming period pic Gangster Squad', 'On Sunday, Warner Bros', 'it’s just wrong', 'Foxx, however, said Hollywood can\'t ""ignore"" that violence in movies has an impact', 'By Agence France-Presse', ""FILM REVIEW: 'Jack Reacher'"", 'Tragedies happen,"" the filmmaker said', 'The studio will still hold a screening for cast and crew and their friends and families, industry daily “Variety” reported', 'Pop star Justin Bieber tweeted: “My prayers go out to all those suffering in this tragedy']"
"– Japan is considering burying its troubled nuclear plant in sand and concrete—the same move made in Chernobyl 25 years ago, Reuters reports. “It is not impossible to encase the reactors in concrete. But our priority right now is to try and cool them down first,” said an official, as authorities work to restore power. Smoke has been rising from the No. 2 reactor at the plant, and authorities aren’t sure of the cause—though it may be linked to the explosion there Tuesday, notes the AP. New damage has been discovered in the fuel pool at the plant’s No. 4 reactor, hampering cooling efforts to refill it with water (click for more on the alarming situation). US data-collecting flights suggest that radiation hasn’t expanded outside a 19-mile area—but Japan has raised its threat level from 4 to 5 out of 7, pointing to danger that extends beyond the local. The crisis could continue for weeks, said a US official.

""He says he can’t breathe."" The neighbor could be heard telling the young man ""stay calm"" and ""stay with me."" Meanwhile another neighbor followed the alleged shooter, who had driven off in a Dodge pickup. ""You’re gonna love this—I’m following the suspect,"" the man told 911 before stopping at the mouth of a dead-end street where the father had parked. The suspect later turned himself in and was charged with attempted murder.

"– ""We are not thugs. We are professionals,"" says the leader of a black policing group, addressing a speech in which President Trump urged officers to not be ""too nice"" when arresting suspects. Perry Tarrant of the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives met with AG Jeff Sessions on Tuesday to discuss Trump's comments, which he said could have ""potential harm … in detracting from the legitimacy [of police], and detracting from the trust that local law enforcement and communities have,"" per the Los Angeles Times. Sessions said he would ""hold any officer responsible [for] breaking the law,"" noting it took ""one bad officer to destroy the reputations of so many"" who ""serve with honor and distinction,"" reports USA Today.

In a Saturday memo, acting DEA chief Chuck Rosenberg said he had ""an obligation to speak out when something is wrong,"" then addressed how the president had ""condoned police misconduct regarding the treatment of individuals placed under arrest by law enforcement."" Rosenberg encouraged agents to ""earn and keep the public trust and continue to hold ourselves to the very highest standards."" Trump has yet to elaborate on his comments made to law enforcement officers in Brentwood, NY, on Friday.

"– A first-of-its-kind study reveals that humans make up a minuscule portion of life on the planet. As in 0.01%, reports the Guardian. The flip side of that? Despite the scant figure, humans have reshaped the animal kingdom, helping wipe out about 83% of mammals and half of all plants since civilization began, according to the comprehensive survey in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. For this study, researchers weren't counting individual members of species. This is all about weight—they surveyed the Earth's biomass, meaning the carbon content in living creatures. Start with this: All life on the planet weighs about 550 gigatons, notes Science. The new study breaks down that figure, including these highlights: Plants account for an astounding 82% of the planet's biomass Bacteria make up 13%—leaving just 5% for everything else beyond plants and bacteria Fungi (think yeast, mold, and mushrooms) make up 2% Ocean life makes up a surprisingly small 1% Chicken and other poultry make up 70% of all birds on the planet; only 30% are wild Livestock (mostly cows and pigs) make up 60% of all mammals; humans account for 36% of mammals, leaving only 4% as wild ""The fact that the biomass of fungi exceeds that of all animals sort of puts us in our place,"" says Harvard biology professor James Hanken, who wasn't part of the study, per a release at Phys.org.","['The integrated dataset enables us to draw basic conclusions concerning kingdoms that dominate the biomass of the biosphere, the distribution of biomass of each kingdom across different environments, and the opposite structures of the global marine and terrestrial biomass pyramids', 'In this Sept', '“It is definitely striking, our disproportionate place on Earth,” said Milo', 'Humans are about two-thirds water', '0 (CC BY-NC-ND)', ', intrastudy uncertainty, interstudy uncertainty)', '7 Gt C; SI Appendix, Table S15)', 'More information: Yinon M', '06 mammals 0', 'designed research; Y', 'performed research; Y', ', species, broader taxonomic groups)', '6 billion people represent just 0', 'org/cgi/doi/10', 'org/lookup/suppl/doi:10', '(AP Photo/Eric Gay, File)', 'Fig', 'Footnotes Author contributions: Y', 'www', '1073/pnas', 'wikipedia', '1711842115/-/DCSupplemental', '', 'version=""1', '1 0', '007 0', '7 0', '002 0', '2 0', '02 0', '2 8', 'O', 'pnas', '”', 'e', 'g', '3', 'R', 'M', 'B', '-O', ', R', 'P', 'In cases when we report one significant digit, we do not consider a leading “1” as a significant digit', 'Plants outweigh all other life on Earth', 'Dry mass also has these features but is used less frequently', '2 1 GT C 2 12 4 70 0', ', fish, subsurface prokaryotes, marine eukaryotes, soil fauna)', 'com/milo-lab/biomass_distribution', ""22, 2017, file photo, John Locke works to move a herd to another field at his family's ranch in Glen Flora, Texas"", 'For groups such as arthropods, global estimates are still lacking (10, 11)', ', and R', 'Taxonomic Levels Used', 'This article contains supporting information online at www', 'Bar-On el al', 'Nevertheless, there is often no way around using such conversions', 'and R', '” It did not include, for example, bacterial or fungal biomass', 'Most of our estimates are constructed by combining several different estimates (e', 'Still, humans have an outsized influence on its more massive fellow creatures', 'Uncertainty Estimation and Reporting', ', temperature, depth, distance from shore, primary productivity, biome type), as shown in Fig', 'org/wiki/Biomass_(ecology)#Global_biomass) but currently falls short of a comprehensive or integrated view', 'This open access article is distributed under Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives License 4', 'For all kingdoms except animals, all taxa making up the kingdom are considered together', 'Fungi—yeast, mold and mushrooms—make up about 2 percent', '“When I do a puzzle with my daughters, there is usually an elephant next to a giraffe next to a rhino', 'The authors declare no conflict of interest', 'General framework for estimating global biomass', 'In this April 11, 2018, file photo, two boys push their scooters through a park with green blossoming trees in Frankfurt, Germany', '“It is pretty staggering,” said Milo', 'As such, we must be aware that the data may contain such biases']"
"– In just a month, Iran could have enough weapons-grade uranium to build a nuclear bomb, a US expert says. ""Breakout times""—a reference to the period needed to get weapons-grade uranium from low-enriched uranium—""are currently too short and shortening further."" The findings, from the Institute for Science and International Security, are based on Iranian and UN data on nuclear progress, USA Today notes. The White House is currently urging Congress to hold off on potential tougher sanctions on the country. Meanwhile, however, some US officials say new nuclear talks with Iran are going well. ""I have never had such intense, detailed, straightforward, candid conversations with the Iranian delegation before,"" says a negotiator, per the Christian Science Monitor. Indeed, an Iranian lawmaker says the country isn't currently enriching uranium to 20% purity, a point at which it's easy to make weapons-grade stuff, the Monitor notes. MP Hossein Naqavi Hosseini says there's ""no need for further production"" of 20%-enriched uranium, the Telegraph reports.

"– The Anti-Defamation League says the shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh is thought to be the deadliest attack specifically targeting Jews ever in the US—by far. CNN reports the previous attack to have that label occurred in 1985, when Seattle lawyer Charles Goldmark, his wife, and two sons were killed. (The Washington Post notes it ""was actually a case of mistaken religious identity,"" as the family was not Jewish.) The toll in Saturday's shooting stands at 11. The AP reports police on Sunday said the victims were eight men and three women. In an arrest affidavit made public, police say that while treating alleged shooter Robert Gregory Bowers for injuries he sustained after being shot by police, he said Jews were ""committing genocide to his people"" and that he wanted them all to die. The AP separately reports on a ""vulnerability"" the shooter took advantage of: an unlocked door. While the Tree of Life synagogue required guests to ring a bell to gain access during the week, on the Jewish Sabbath the building was open to all guests for Shabbat services. The Post quotes the FBI special agent in charge as saying it was ""the most horrific crime scene I’ve seen in 22 years."" Federal hate crime charges were filed against Bowers on Saturday: 29 charges in all, including 11 counts of using a firearm to commit murder. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reports Pittsburgh police also filed charges on Saturday: 11 counts of criminal homicide, six counts of attempted homicide, six counts of aggravated assault, and 13 counts of ethnic intimidation.

"– They set sail aboard the Carnival Fantasy, but a Florida couple's experience aboard the cruise ship was less fantasy, more creepy nightmare. While some couples find towels adorably folded into the shapes of animals in their cabins, Chris and Dana White say they instead stumbled upon a hidden camera pointed at their bed, ensconced in TV wires in their room on Carnival's Fantasy, which was sailing out of Mobile, Ala., last October. The couple tell Inside Edition in an interview that aired Monday that they were ""flabbergasted"" to spot the camera, and that their ""privacy had been invaded."" ""I was thinking, 'I can't believe this is actually happening to us,'"" Chris White says. They're talking to the media now because they don't think the cruise line properly dealt with the issue when they reported it, saying a rep for Carnival initially told them the device wasn't a camera. In a statement to USA Today, Carnival calls the incident with the Whites a ""unique and unusual one"" and says that while a ""video transmitter"" was indeed found after a full probe, the transmitter ""was not connected to an electrical source and not capable of recording."" Chris White shakes his head at that, saying the device was ""wired up … working … [and] warm to the touch."" Newsweek notes one other ""bizarre"" cruise ship incident that took place in September, this time involving a Royal Caribbean ship out of Australia. In that case, about 1,300 employees from an Indian tobacco company booked a vacation on the Voyager of the Seas and basically ran ""amok"" with women they brought aboard dressed as Playboy Bunnies.

Police are still investigating why Simon was on the tracks; ABC reports he was asleep.

"– An amazing, if grisly, feat continues to resonate after a report in Thursday's Globe and Mail of Toronto. The newspaper, quoting military sources, says a Canadian sniper in Iraq killed an ISIS militant from the mind-boggling distance of 3,540 meters, or 2.2 miles. The Canadian military has not confirmed what would be the longest kill shot by a sniper in history, but the story has in the meantime drawn attention to something else: the remarkable prowess of Canadian snipers in general. Some coverage: The training: If confirmed, that means the sniper record has been broken four times in the last 15 years, three of those times by Canadians, notes Maclean's magazine. One reason, it says, is because Canadian snipers ""are not simply taught to hit their targets."" The training goes beyond their shooting duties, making sure they're able to ""design and run complex operations"" if necessary. ""That in itself may not make them better snipers but the gestalt of sniper-training and command-thinking combined could explain their skill."" Long history: The CBC examines the history of Canada's military marksmanship, noting that Cpl. Francis Pegahmagabow of the 1st Canadian Infantry Battalion had 378 kills, making him deadliest sniper of World War I. A military historian says the skill carried into WWII. ""The best snipers were usually country boys who knew how to hunt."" Official statement: The Canadian military has not confirmed the kill, but it did confirm the shot. ""A member of the Joint Task Force 2 successfully hit a target from 3,540 meters,"" it says in an email to NPR, adding that it won't divulge further details for troop safety. Really? The Globe and Mail says the shot was verified by video and data, but that hasn't emerged yet, and some are skeptical. The Washington Post talks to former US snipers who say that even seeing a human target would be difficult from that distance, even with advanced scopes. A theory floated by a former Marine shooter: ""A spotter with an advanced optical device was able to verbally walk the sniper onto the target and correct his aim.” Yes: Canadian Cpl. Rob Furlong, who once held the record himself at 2,430 meters, counters the skeptics: “It’s not an impossible distance,” he says. “So to the naysayers I would just say, this can be done.” It's a ""hell of a shot,"" adds former Canadian sniper Jody Mitic, who was written a book called, of course, Unflinching: The Making of a Canadian Sniper. A critic: In a post at Stuff.co.nz, John Edens thinks the shot was possible, given high-tech gizmos to account for everything from wind speed to the curvature of the earth. Plus, the gun used, a McMillan TAC-50 rifle, employs a 50-caliber bullet the size of a ""large cigar."" His beef, though, is with media coverage that he thinks glorifies war. ""It's an achievement to a point, but it's not really one humanity should be proud of.""","['Mitic said to hit a target at that distance, the sniper team, likely a shooter and spotter, would have to take every possible factor into account, from the temperature of the weapon and ammunition to the curvature of the Earth', 'They work in pairs', '“It’s not an impossible distance,” he says', 'Weeks before, Canadian Master Cpl', '""Hard data on this', 'Enlarge this image toggle caption Dan Balilty/AP Dan Balilty/AP', ""'Force multipliers'"", 'Story continues below advertisement', ""' (CBC)"", '', '""', 'U', 'S', 'soldier', '”', 'It is a world record that might never be equalled', 'Read more: Ottawa lays out $62-billion in new military spending over 20 years', 'Jonathan Vance revealed Canadian troops were operating inside Mosul', 'They are two completely different environments', 'Cpl', '""Canada has a world-class sniper system', '“I’ve been saying this forever,” he tells Maclean’s by telephone', '""We\'re called \'force multipliers,\'"" Mitic said', '2 miles away during a recent operation in Iraq', 'Corporals and master corporals: bright and articulate', ""It isn't an opinion"", 'Not long after, Cpl', 'His record would stand longer, until 2009, when a British sniper, Craig Harrison, made a shot from 2,475 metres', '(Marius Barbeau/Canadian Museum of History)', 'Maclean’s regrets the error', 'Maclean’s witnessed firsthand how soldiers out on patrol, sometimes for days in enemy territory, operated as closely knit teams', 'There is an observer,"" a military source said', 'Records are made to be broken', ""54 miles), which was set by Britain's Craig Harrison in 2009"", ""He still stands as one of Canada's most decorated First Nations soldiers"", '""This is a skill set that only a very few people have', 'Still, there are the naysayers', ""Read more: New mission against Islamic State won't include sending troops to Syria: Sajjan"", 'Canadians have held the record for longest kill shot before', 'Canadian sniper history', ""It isn't an approximation"", 'Command decisions were made with input from different ranks, offering multiple perspectives to patrol commanders', '“I have been very impressed with the young people in our special forces that I have interacted with overseas', 'It is not just a sniper', 'Canadian Sniper Hit A Target More Than 2 Miles Away, Military Confirms']"
"– A young actor and singer has been found dead in his suburban Los Angeles home at age 20, reports Variety. Jackson Odell, best known for a role as Ari Caldwell on the ABC sitcom The Goldbergs, was found unresponsive in his Tarzana residence on Friday.

"– A fun foray into finding out more about her ancestry through a popular genealogy website led to a shocking revelation for 72-year-old Denice Juneski: She wasn't related to any of her own relatives—at least not the ones she'd grown up knowing. KARE reports that as Minnesota's Juneski was puzzling over her test results from 23andMe, a woman in a nearby town in Wisconsin took her own DNA test. Linda Jourdeans' results showed that ""M. Mayer"" was her mother—but that wasn't the woman who had raised her, she tells KARE. The murkiness of this all soon cleared up: Juneski and Jourdeans had been somehow switched at birth sometime after being born on Dec. 19, 1945, at Bethesda Hospital in St. Paul, Minn. The news offered context for things both women had long noticed: Juneski was the only blonde among redheads and brunettes, while Jourdeans, a redhead, was surrounded by lighter-haired kin. Juneski said she also felt out of place in a family of athletes, while Jourdeans was the only athlete in her family. The women tracked each other down in April and have since met a few times, and they're celebrating their special new bond. ""I consider it a gift,"" Juneski says. Together, the women visit one other person at her memory care facility: 99-year-old Marianne Mayer, the woman who raised Juneski and is Jourdeans' biological mother. Rochelle Nielsen, Juneski's biological mother and the mom who raised Jourdeans, died of cancer when Jourdeans was 17.

"– President Trump praised Anthony Kennedy during a rally in North Dakota Wednesday evening and said he is ""honored"" the Supreme Court justice made his bombshell retirement decision when he did. ""I'm very honored that he chose to do it during my term in office, because he felt confident in me to make the right choice and carry on his great legacy,"" Trump said in Fargo, reports Politico. Trump didn't go into detail on potential successors, except to say the person would need ""intellect."" And he emphasized the ramifications: ""We have to pick a great one that is going to be there for 40 years or 45 years."" (The pick is expected to come from this list, notes Time.) As NPR reports, Trump also has begun casting the issue as an crucial one in the 2018 midterms, arguing that it's more important than ever that the GOP retain its grip on the Senate. ""Justice Kennedy's retirement makes the issue of Senate control one of the vital issues of our time—the most important thing we can do,"" Trump told the crowd. He was there stumping for Rep. Kevin Cramer, the GOP challenger to Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, who is seen as one of the most vulnerable incumbent Democrats given that she represents a red state.

"– Alleged Silk Road mastermind Ross Ulbricht was no ordinary drug boss—he paid $1,000 a month for a San Francisco apartment he shared with two roommates, used an alias from the Princess Bride, and was arrested in the sci-fi section of his public library. But the FBI says the 29-year-old not only raked in around $80 million from his online drug marketplace's $1.6 billion turnover over two years, he ordered at least two killings to protect his operation, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. The FBI says Ulbricht, aka ""Dread Pirate Roberts,"" was provided with a photo of the supposed victim in one killing he ordered but there's no indication the killing actually took place. The other hit man he tried to hire was an undercover agent. Ulbricht, a Texas native, appears to be a ""normal, nerdy guy"" in his social media postings, Gawker finds. He went to grad school at Pennsylvania State University, where he studied solar cells. On his LinkedIn profile, he complained about government control and said his goals had changed after graduation.

"– Guards at Rikers Island don't just neglect the mentally ill or let them bake to death, they also routinely brutally beat them, often without suffering any repercussions, a New York Times investigation has discovered. The Times uncovered a secret report compiled by a city department this year that found that 129 Rikers inmates suffered ""serious injuries"" in altercations with staff members over an 11-month span last year; 77% of those inmates had a mental health diagnosis. In most cases, the inmates were beaten while handcuffed. The Times investigated the incidents individually, and offer some disturbing details: When guards found Jose Bautista trying to hang himself, they saved him, but then allegedly threw him to the ground and punched him with such force that they perforated his bowel. It was one of five beatings noted in the report that followed a suicide attempt. Bautista needed emergency surgery, but guards took nine hours to drive him to the hospital—which is only 15 minutes away. When Andre Lane threw water or urine at guards, they allegedly handcuffed him to a gurney, wheeled him to a clinic that wasn't monitored by security cameras, and beat him so violently that the walls and cabinets were covered with his blood. After Brian Mack complained that guards were stealing inmates' food, a guard captain allegedly hit him in the eye with his radio, while another officer punched him in the jaw. He came away with a broken eye socket and jaw. Correction officials said he'd been in a fight with another inmate, but investigators noted no such fight was logged in prison records. None of the guards involved in any of the cases have faced criminal charges—or even administrative ones. Rikers has been under pressure to reform its treatment of mentally ill inmates—in January, for example, it announced it would stop putting the ""seriously mentally ill"" in solitary, though the Times notes that classification applies to a small segment of the population. Last week an oversight board said the newly-appointed city jail commissioner had in June illegally sent as many as 47 mentally ill Rikers inmates to solitary without consulting clinicians, the AP reports.","['""I would just hope that you would review these issues and in the future instruct your staff to be consistent with the board standards and not to violate these rules which are not just rules but designed for the safety of the prisoners,"" said board member Dr', 'Lane was known as a disruptive inmate', 'Mr', 'Dixon into an examination area without a security camera', 'Barnes wrote', '', '”', 'Robert Cohen', 'At least one inmate suffered a seizure, Ponte said', 'Lane, who had also splashed guards with a liquid', '“They’re going to kill me', 'He had been in and out of Rikers, and much of his most recent stint had been spent in solitary confinement', 'That is nothing like what actually happened, according to accounts from three people who were there']"
"– Saddam Hussain's name is making it difficult for him to get a job. ""People are scared to hire me,"" the 25-year-old Indian marine engineer tells the Hindustan Times. Hussain was, yes, named for that Saddam Hussein; the name was given to him by his grandfather. It turned out to be a poor choice, as the young man has been unable to find a job since graduating university two years ago, despite having done very well in school. And he's applied for dozens of positions. He says he's spoken with some of the HR departments of companies he's applied with, and they told him his name was the problem, because it could cause ""suspicion."" One recruitment expert points out that this would be a problem especially if a job requires travel abroad, during which he might get stopped by airport or border authorities: ""He might just keep getting stuck or the company has to pull him out of the sticky situation, making the hire cumbersome,"" the expert says. Hussain got his first name legally changed to Sajid, but though he got all his official documents changed to reflect his new name, his original name still poses a problem because it's listed on educational certificates, which prospective employers want to see. He's working on getting those certificates changed as well, but the process is moving slowly, the BBC reports. (Meanwhile, in America, a guy is trying to change his name to Hitler.)","[""One Saddam, a journalist working in Ramadi, a Sunni city in the desert province of Anbar, said his father was fired from his government job because he could not convince his superiors he was not a member of the dictator's Ba'ath party"", '""People are scared to hire me,"" Saddam-turned-Sajid is quoted by Hindustan Times as saying', '“Even Shah Rukh Khan gets detained at US airports', '', '""', ""Read Prashant Rao's BBC article"", 'Somehow, thanks to sheer luck, the weapon jammed, and the militia eventually released him', 'Being Saddam in Iraq', 'A top executive of Delhi-based TeamLease Services, a leading recruitment consultant, agrees', 'He says they fear complications from an encounter with immigration officials across international borders', 'So he went to court to become Sajid', 'But his woes did not end there', 'But since unscrupulous people often abuse the system by frequently changing names, the court acted with caution', '“I am an innocent victim of somebody else’s crimes,” he says', '“If the issue involves crossing the borders, then nothing can be done as border patrol and airport authorities are very process-driven and if there is a red flag, they will check out', 'His grandfather had lovingly given him his name, hoping that one day he would grow up into a ‘positive’ human being']"
"– Cristiano Ronaldo is considered one of the best soccer players ever, and he proved why on Friday.

Sixty people in Poland wore the same T-shirt for three nights, and did not use soap, smoke, drink, or ""eat odorous foods"" during the study. Those shirts were then sniffed by 200 lucky volunteers, who were asked to judge the smells based on five personality traits, such as extroversion, neuroticism, and dominance.

"– A New Jersey court on Wednesday gave the Flight Crew—aka the New York Jets cheerleaders—something to cheer about: a $325,000 settlement of the class-action lawsuit filed in 2014 by a cheerleader identified as Krystal C., CNNMoney reports. That amounts to each of the 52 cheerleaders getting $2,500 per season worked and $400 per photo shoot. The settlement covers the 2012-13 and 2013-14 seasons. New York State Sen. Diane Savino, per the New York Post, cheered the settlement, calling on the NFL to ""develop uniform rules … to ensure that all cheerleaders in every state received the employee pay and protections they deserve."" NFL teams have sought to justify low pay for cheerleaders by saying they're independent contractors, CNN notes. In the case of the Flight Crew, Krystal C.'s suit claimed that cheerleaders were compensated $150 per game and $100 for special appearances. But, when you factor in practices and rehearsals, that pans out to $3.77 per hour. Throw in hair, makeup, and transportation expenses and ""the hourly rate goes below $1.50 an hour,"" says the cheerleaders' attorney.

"– Despite reports Thursday that they wouldn't be charged with a crime, the five teens who allegedly laughed and filmed a man as he drowned in Florida earlier this month could now face misdemeanor charges. ABC News reports police have recommended charges for ""duty to report"" against the unnamed teens, who range in age from 14 to 16. News 13 explains that while Florida doesn't have a law requiring bystanders to report someone dying, it does have a law that requires people to report someone has died. Jamel Dunn, 31, drowned earlier this month. Cocoa Police Chief Mike Cantaloupe says it's the first time the law would be used in this manner, and the teens would serve as a ""test case.""

"– The quotes are so incendiary that some are questioning their veracity. But Axios reports Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House author Michael Wolff has ""dozens of hours"" of tapes to back up statements that appear in the book. And in an excerpt running in the Hollywood Reporter, Wolff (who is the co-founder of Newser) explains just how he got access to them. A June 2016 Hollywood Reporter article may have helped grease things: Hope Hicks emailed Wolff to say Trump was pleased with the cover. Post-election, Wolff says he floated the idea of him coming to the White House ""journalistically, as a fly on the wall"" to gather information for a future book. Trump seemed disinterested in the idea of a book, but ""his non-disapproval became a kind of passport for me to hang around,"" writes Wolff. And so Wolff writes he spent each week at the Hay-Adams hotel, scheduled appointments with senior staffers, and ""plunk[ed] myself down, day after day, on a West Wing couch."" The excerpt shares other tidbits—how the Secret Service protested the president's attempts to lock himself in his bedroom; how Trump's post-dinner calls to billionaire pals spurred leaks; how Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump thought Anthony Scaramucci would be the White House's saving grace—which Trump's lawyer is now trying to block from release. The Washington Post reports Wolff and his publisher, Henry Holt and Co., have been sent a letter that demands they ""immediately cease and desist from any further publication, release, or dissemination of the book"" or any excerpts; the lawyer also wants a copy and says a libel suit is being considered.","['Whatever the substance of the Russia ""collusion,"" Trump, in the estimation of his senior staff, did not have the discipline to navigate a tough investigation, nor the credibility to attract the caliber of lawyers he would need to help him', 'Bigness is unavoidable and inevitable', '1 but was withheld', '"" (An exchange repeated similarly several times, with no rancor from either Trump or Kimmel', ""You can't feel it"", 'For H', 'Gary Cohn, Dina Powell, Rick Dearborn, all on their way out', '""Oh yeah, I think they should leave', 'I say I like everybody', '""I know Jeff very well', '""I want a win', ""Everybody's happy"", 'Good run', '5 million', '""Great guy', 'officials told U', 'I try again', '', '""', 'e', ')', 'Loved me', 'm', '""Huh?""', '""Brexit', '""Hmm', 'Indeed', 'S', 'N', 'U', 'R', 'Nutso', 'In America', '"" He says he absolutely can', 'And now you', 'Life is sunny', 'Steve Bannon was openly handicapping a 33', 'His extreme self-satisfaction rubs off', 'Wolff on Media', ""Couldn't take it anymore"", ', him', '""What books are you reading?""', '""I have a much bigger base than Romney', 'No, I said', 'We think alike', 'McMaster), all neatly accessible', 'or 6 a', 'Sounded like you', '""Very interesting', '] But yeah, I might do something with Ari', ""(Even Ivanka and Jared regarded Conway's fulsome defenses as cringeworthy"", 'I want a win', ""These two '80s guys were undoubtedly once quite in sync"", 'Then I came back and did more meetings, then I did a fundraiser tonight, then I did Kimmel', 'Everything else is mere distraction', 'On Leslie Moonves: ""Great guy', '""Trump,"" said one senior Republican, ""turned selfish careerists into patriots', 'So no pivot', '""It\'ll be different math than they\'ve ever seen', '(he offers different times at different moments)', '""There had to be over a thousand policeman', '3 percent chance of impeachment, a 33', 'Bigness always wins', 'I know Roger very well', ""But as a politician, he's OK as a salesman"", 'Even his family, now closely gathered around him, seemed nonplussed', '""What do these people do?"" asked everyone pretty much of everyone else', 'secretary general António Guterres has spoken with senior U', ""I'm inching on 20 million people"", 'The spontaneity', 'There are no phonies here', 'and not a big funding cut', 'funding to UNRWA', 'They had a neighborhood roped off, four or five blocks away from this beautiful house', 'Trump at a May 25 rally in Anaheim', '""That\'s an unfair question,"" he says, making a rare grab for politesse', ""1 doesn't mean it was frozen"", ""Kimmel flat out doesn't believe him"", ""You're not a two-minute interview guy"", 'His shamelessness is just so … shameless', 'Machine guns all over the place', ""Priebus, everybody's punching bag, just tried to survive another day"", 'On Twitter, I have 8', ') He loves everybody', 'I try again: ""How much are you a salesman?""', 'Little more than two months in, she quit', ""And I think Rupert respects what I've done"", 'But I sneak it back', 'In a way, this gave him a human dimension', 'Or everybody here is honest about being a phony', 'Who would want to miss that?

"– The final surviving member of the singing von Trapp family that fled the Nazis in World War II and inspired The Sound of Music has died at the age of 99 in Stowe, Vt. Maria von Trapp was the third of seven children of Georg von Trapp and his first wife; she was the inspiration for Louisa in the famous musical and film. ""She was a lovely woman who was one of the few truly good people,"" said brother Johannes von Trapp, a son born later to Georg von Trapp and his second wife, also named Maria. ""There wasn't a mean or miserable bone in her body. I think everyone who knew her would agree with that."" After escaping Austria, the von Trapps settled in Stowe, eventually opening a ski lodge, where Maria von Trapp played accordion and taught Austrian dance with a younger sister. She recalled, well, the sounds of music surrounding her early years in an online biography, notes the AP. ""Father played the violin, accordion, and mandolin. Mother played piano and violin,"" she wrote. ""I have fond memories of our grandmother playing the piano for us after meals."" She also served as a missionary in Papua, New Guinea. The family was fairly long-lived: Maria's older sister, Agathe, died three years ago at age 97.","['Maria von Trapp was the last surviving member of the seven original Trapp Family Singers made famous in ""The Sound of Music', 'Mother played piano and violin,"" she wrote', 'I think everyone who knew her would agree with that', 'File-This Aug', 'STOWE, Vt', '', '(Associated Press)', '""', '""There wasn\'t a mean or miserable bone in her body', 'She was 99', 'Our Lodge offers stunning mountain views, old-world comforts, and impeccable service, along with activities for every season']"
"– It's not unusual for newspaper editorials to criticize a president's policies. But the editorial board at the Los Angeles Times is taking the concept to a new level with a multi-part series called ""Our Dishonest President."" Part one on Sunday issued a warning that President Trump is ""so unpredictable, so reckless, so petulant, so full of blind self-regard, so untethered to reality that it is impossible to know where his presidency will lead or how much damage he will do to our nation."" Those traits may have helped him get elected as an ""outsider,"" but hopes that they would be reined in once he entered the White House are fading. The editorial ends with a plea for voters, protesters, members of Congress, state legislators, the courts, the media, etc., to be vigilant about protecting America from its own president. On Monday, part two focuses on Trump's capacity to lie. Plenty of politicians lie, of course, but what Trump ""brings to the equation is an apparent disregard for fact so profound as to suggest that he may not see much practical distinction between lies, if he believes they serve him, and the truth."" What makes this especially dangerous is that Trump repeats the lies of others, even crackpots. ""He gives every indication that he is as much the gullible tool of liars as he is the liar in chief."" Verification seems to be a foreign concept to Trump, but it can't be for everyone else, write the editors, who close with advice: ""Investigate. Read. Write. Listen. Speak. Think. ... Be suspicious of those who confuse reality with reality TV, and those who repeat falsehoods while insisting, against all evidence, that they are true. To defend freedom, demand fact.""
