# MDES

## Progress Checklist

```
[ ] Checklist for Data Handling:

- [ ] Separating the articles (using "|||||" as a delimiter) and storing them into a list.
- [ ] Checking the dataset and determining how many sources are there in each row (use `len(list)`).
- [ ] After deciding on a suitable number, take X random sources from the dataset and append them to the list for each row. This represents the noise (extra irrelevant summaries) from the dataset.

[ ] Checklist for Hierarchical Clustering:

- [ ] Implement the Hierarchical Clustering algorithm using TF-IDF + Clustering to generate baseline results (similar to the assignment part 7).
- [ ] Search and identify better algorithms for hierarchical clustering.
- [ ] Implement the algorithms mentioned by Shubh and compare their performance to the baseline method above.
