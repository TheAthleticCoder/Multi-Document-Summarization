IND vs AUS prophecy,"The Cricket World Cup semi-final witnessed a controversy right before the match between India and New Zealand, as accusations of the pitch being swapped at the last minute were made at the Board of Control for Cricket India. The match turned out to be a high-scoring contest, with India emerging victorious. The second semi-final also saw a used pitch being deployed for the contest between Australia and South Africa. After the Aussies won the game by the barest of margins, pacer Mitchell Starc had a cheeky take on the pitch for the final.
Australia didn't look at their best chasing a mediocre target of 213 runs. They lost 7 wickets in the process of the run-chase. When Starc was asked if he was concerned about the final, considering the nature of the run-chase against South Africa, he gave a rather cheeky response
""I guess we'll find out when we get to Ahmedabad tomorrow and see if it's a fresh wicket or an old wicket,"" Starc said, in a cheeky manner.
In the press conference, Starc was also asked about the nature of the pitch at the Eden Gardens.
""Yeah, it was obviously pretty bare wicket. I'm not sure if it was slightly tougher to start with the bat due to being under covers for some amount of time, I'm not sure how long. We probably saw it was very, very inconsistent pace whilst it did probably nip a little bit, there was a little bit of swing. I think the inconsistencies made it tough to bat on with that first 10 overs that we bowled. So, I think looking at Josh's pitch map, that's what he does so well in Test match bowling. He was incredible today and the way we run off each other to have that power play that we did and carry some momentum through the middle was how we want to start matches so it was nice to do it in a big game,"" he said.
When asked if it was a surprise to have played on a pitch that really didn't 'showcase the one-day game' in a tourament that has seen so many runs being scored in the league stage, Starc said that he isn't an expert to read pitches.
""Yeah, I'm certainly not going to say I'm one to read pitches and know what they do. I mean training here the last few days, the practice wicket certainly turned a lot. From all reports I think the wicket we played on has been used a few times so no surprise that it did turn. Probably a little surprising that it did seam around a little bit whilst I said before it was pretty inconsistent pace wise, I think average first inning scores here have been sort of around 300 mark or a little bit higher. So yeah, a little bit surprising but you know sometimes it's nice to see ball dominate bat sometimes,"" he asserted.","With barely two days left for the nail-biting thriller of Rohit Sharma-led India vs Pat Cummins-led Australia ICC Men's World Cup Final, to be played on 19 November at Ahmedabad's Narendra Modi stadium, the pre-tournament predictions are gaining momentum.
Apart from numerous predictions circulating on newspapers and social media, several pundits and analysts sharing their knowledge, one pre-tournament prediction made by Australia star Mitchell Marsh is phenomenal.
One of Marsh's prophecies – made about six months back – has now become true. Apart from predicting that Australia would meet India in the final, Marsh – while speaking on a podcast show hosted by IPL franchise Delhi Capitals during the 2023 season – has also foretold the scores as well.
According to him, March had said that Australia would win by 385 runs after folding India for just 65 in the final.
His first part of his prediction proved true, as 5-time world champions Australia ((1987, 1999, 2003, 2007, and 2015), reached their eighth final after beating South Africa while India reached their fourth after 1983, 2003, and 2011.
“Australia will stay undefeated, defeating India in the final, Australia 450-2 in the final, India all out 65,"" Hindustan Times quoted Marsh as saying.","While speaking on a podcast show hosted by IPL franchise Delhi Capitals during 2023 season, Marsh had predicted that Australia would meet India in the final. We are two days away from the big final at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. At the end of 45 riveting league matches and two thrilling semifinal games, World Cup 2023 is down to two final teams - India and Australia. No two teams have faced each more number of times than these two as the pair are all set to add episode 14 to their sensational rivalry. Amid the build up to the final, it is time to revisit some of the pre-tournament predictions made on the summit clash and the one that stands out is that of Australia star Mitchell Marsh, who did get it right on his prophecy made about six months back, but the opener had foretold the scores as well.

While speaking on a podcast show hosted by IPL franchise Delhi Capitals during the 2023 season, Marsh had predicted that Australia would meet India in the final. Willingly going into the specific details of his prediction, Marsh further added that Australia will win by 385 runs after folding India for just 65 in the final.
Marsh did get the first part of his prediction correct as Australia, the most successful team in World Cup history with five titles (1987, 1999, 2003, 2007 and 2015), made it to their eighth final after beating South Africa while India reached their fourth after 1983, 2003, and 2011. However, he is yet to find out about the second part of his remark.
“Australia will stay undefeated, defeating India in the final, Australia 450-2 in the final, India all out 65,” Marsh, who has been in a stellar form in this World Cup with 426 runs at 53.25, had said.
Although the prophecy regarding India and Australia facing each other in the final came true for Marsh, it is the home team - and not the Aussies - who are undefeated so far in the tournament winning all 10 of their games - nine in the round-robin stage and one semifinal.
Australia, however, head to the final on the back of an eight-match winning streak. After losing to India in their opener and to South Africa in their second game, they bounced back to win all their remaining games, including the semifinal against the Proteas, to make the final."
PM take on Israel-Hamas Conflict,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday condemned the deaths in the ongoing war between Israel and Palestinian terrorist group Hamas. Speaking at the Voice of the Global South Summit, PM Modi spoke about ""new challenges"" in the West Asia region and added that India has ""exercised restraint"" in the conflict.
""We have given emphasis on dialogue and diplomacy. We also strongly condemn the deaths of civilians in the conflict between Israel and Hamas,"" he said.
PM Modi further noted that India has sent humanitarian aid to the Palestinians following his conversation with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. ""This is the time when the countries of the Global South should unite for the greater global good... , "" he said.
His remarks came close on the heels of India voting in favour of the United Nations resolution that condemned settlement activities in “the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and in the occupied Syrian Golan”. India was among 145 nations that voted in favour of the resolution, with seven countries - including Canada ad Israel - voting against, and 18 abstaining. In October, India abstained in the UN General Assembly from voting on a draft resolution by Jordan, which called for an immediate humanitarian truce in the Israel-Hamas conflict. In a statement explaining its decision, India said that the resolution did not make any mention of the terrorist group. The resolution titled 'Protection of civilians and upholding legal and humanitarian obligations' was overwhelmingly adopted with 120 nations voting in its favour, 14 against it and 45 abstaining.
India has maintained its call for a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine, and reiterated to protect civilians caught in the Israel-Hamas crossfire.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi today condemned the deaths of civilians in the ongoing Israel-Hamas war and highlighted the urgent need for unity and cooperation among the Global South in the face of escalating challenges rising in West Asia due to the conflict.
Speaking at the e inaugural session of the 2nd Voice of Global South Summit, PM Modi emphasised India's unwavering stance against violence and terrorism, including the October 7 attacks by Hamas on Israel. The Prime Minister underscored the importance of exercising restraint and prioritising dialogue as the cornerstones of conflict resolution.
""We all are seeing that new challenges are emerging from the events in the West Asia region. India has condemned the terrorist attack in Israel on October 7,"" PM Modi said. ""We have exercised restraint as well. We have given emphasis on dialogue and diplomacy. We also strongly condemn the deaths of civilians in the conflict between Israel and Hamas.""
""After talking to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, we have also sent humanitarian aid to the people of Palestine. This is the time when the countries of the Global South should unite for the greater global good,"" he added. 
The Global South refers to a collection of countries, primarily situated in the Southern Hemisphere in Asia, Africa and South America, with varied levels of economic development. While these countries do not share identical characteristics, they often grapple with common challenges such as poverty, inequality, and limited access to resources. Over 1,200 Israelis, mostly civilians, were killed after the Palestinian group Hamas launched a sensational land-sea-air assault on October 7. In retaliation, Israel pounded the Gaza Strip - a Hamas stronghold - with airstrikes, killing over 11,000 people in the densely populated Palestinian enclave. 
The Prime Minister advocated for a collaborative strategy guided by the 'five Cs' principles: consultation, communication, cooperation, creativity, and capacity building.

""I cannot forget that historic moment, when the African Union was inducted into G20 as a permanent member with India's efforts,"" PM Modi said.","The developments in West Asia are throwing up new challenges and the time has come for countries of the Global South to speak in one voice for the greater global good, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Friday even as he condemned civilian deaths in the Israel-Hamas conflict.

Modi made the remarks in his televised opening address at the second virtual Voice of Global South Summit, a mechanism created by India to bring together developing countries and to seek their recommendations for the country’s G20 presidency. Modi largely spoke on the achievements of the G20 presidency but referred to the crisis triggered by the October 7 terror attacks by Hamas. “For global progress, sabka saath, sabka vikas (with everyone and progress for everyone) is necessary but we are all seeing that new challenges are emerging from the incidents in West Asia,” he said, speaking in Hindi.
India had condemned the horrific terror attacks in Israel on October 7 and called for restraint along with dialogue and diplomacy, he said. “We strongly condemn the death of civilians in the conflict between Israel and Hamas,” he added.
Modi said that following his phone conversation with President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian National Authority, India sent humanitarian assistance for the people of Palestine. “This is the time when countries of the Global South must talk in one voice for the greater global good,” he said.
In keeping with the theme of “one earth, one family, one future” for India’s G20 presidency, all countries should move forward with 5Cs – consultation, cooperation, communication, creativity and capacity building, Modi said. India had initially backed Israel’s right to defend itself, but it has since adopted a more nuanced approach by calling for observance of international humanitarian law and avoiding of civilian casualties. While the Hamas attacks intense killed 1,200 people, Israel’s intense bombardment of northern Gaza has killed more than 11,400 people, including some 4,400 children.
Modi also spoke about forward movement on several initiatives unveiled at the first Voice of Global South Summit in January. He inaugurated Dakshin, a centre of excellence for the Global South that will focus on development and knowledge sharing. “During the G20 Summit, on behalf of India, I had proposed to launch a weather and climate monitoring satellite for the Global South. We are working rapidly on this,” he said.
He described Voice of Global South as a unique platform for the changing world of the 21st century that gives a voice to developing countries for the first time. When India became the chair of the G20 last December, it adopted the responsibility of taking forward the issues and concerns of the Global South, he added. He highlighted several achievements of the G20 that are important for the Global South, including the inclusion of the African Union as a full member of the grouping of 20 largest economies, agreement on major reforms of multilateral development banks and the focus on sustainable finance for developing countries.
An action plan to speed up implementation of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) will strengthen poverty reduction programmes in the Global South, and there was agreement on providing climate transition finance and technology to developing countries on easy terms. The launch of the Global Biofuel Alliance was very important for the Global South. “We hope that you will all join this,” Modi said.
India also believes that new technologies should not become a way to increase the divide between North and South, and that there is a great need for responsible use of technology in the era of artificial intelligence (AI). “To take this forward, the AI Global Partnership Summit is being organised in India next month,” he said.
The digital public infrastructure (DPI) framework adopted by the G20 will help with the last mile delivery of essential services and increase inclusivity, while India is creating a DPI repository to share its capabilities with the Global South.
Several heads of state and government joined the inaugural session of the virtual summit, including Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasona, Indonesian President Joko Widodo and Mauritius Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth."
