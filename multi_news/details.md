## Data Handling

We take a sample of the complete data and built smaller versions. \
The `sample_{train,val,test}.csv` files contain the following columns: \
- `documents`: A list of documents for each sample.
- `num_documents`: The number of documents for each sample.
- `summary`: The summary of the sample.

The `sample_{train,val,test}.csv` contains 2 documents for each sample which aren't part of the sample.
